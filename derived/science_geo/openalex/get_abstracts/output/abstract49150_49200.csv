https://openalex.org/W2064148637,"A polypeptide of Mr 38,000 has been identified as a specific component of the membrane of presynaptic vesicles, using the monoclonal antibody SY38. This protein, which is acidic (isoelectric at approximately pH 4.8) and glycosylated, appears to be an integral membrane protein, as suggested by its solubilization with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and the finding that the epitope recognized by antibody SY38 is located on the cytoplasmic surface of those vesicles. It is found in presynaptic vesicles of neurons of the brain, spinal cord, and retina as well as at neuromuscular junctions. It is also found in the adrenal medulla. Its occurrence in diverse vertebrate species indicates its stability during evolution. This protein, for which we propose the name synaptophysin*, provides a molecular marker for the presynaptic vesicle membrane and may be involved in synaptic vesicle formation and exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1977157092,Clones of complementary DNA encoding the human lymphokine known as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were isolated by means of a mammalian cell (monkey COS cell) expression screening system. One of these clones was used to produce recombinant GM-CSF in mammalian cells. The recombinant hematopoietin was similar to the natural product that was purified to apparent homogeneity from medium conditioned by a human T-cell line. The human T-cell GM-CSF was found to be 60 percent homologous with the GM-CSF recently cloned from murine lung messenger RNA.

These clones carry the B cell lineage surface antigen B-220 but not antigens normally expressed on mature B lymphocytes, myeloid cells, or T lymphocytes. Their immunoglobulin μ heavy chain and kappa light chain genes are in germ-line configuration.

Clones L/B AgA2, CB/Bm 7, and Bc/Bm 11, but not Ba/C1, could develop into antibody-secreting cells after in vivo transfer. None gave rise to cells responsive to polyclonal T cell activators, nor did any differentiate into cells that could develop into granulocyte/macrophage-colony-forming cells in vitro. All grew in interleukin 3 but not in other cytokines. We conclude that clones L/B AgA2, CB/Bm 7, and Bc/Bm 11 are early precursors of B lymphocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2031300940,"Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene transcription was studied using DNA transfection. The enhancer element identified in the mouse heavy chain locus was active in pre-B and plasmacytoma cell lines, but no activity was detected in two T cell lymphomas. However, even in the absence of the enhancer, cell type specificity of immunoglobulin gene transcription was still retained. We have used gene fusions to show that transcription cell type specificity is conferred by a VH gene promoter. Deletion analysis of this VH promoter indicates that a conserved octamer found 5′ of the TATA box in immunoglobulin V genes is a functional part of the tissue-specific promoter upstream element."
https://openalex.org/W1966242477,"Borna disease virus causes a rare meningoencephalitis in horses and sheep and has been shown to produce behavioral effects in some species. The possibility that the Borna virus is associated with mental disorders in humans was evaluated by examining serum samples from 979 psychiatric patients and 200 normal volunteers for the presence of Borna virus-specific antibodies. Antibodies were detected by the indirect immunofluorescence focus assay. Antibodies to the virus were demonstrated in 16 of the patients but none of the normal volunteers. The patients with the positive serum samples were characterized by having histories of affective disorders, particularly of a cyclic nature. Further studies are needed to define the possible involvement of Borna virus in human psychiatric disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W1590376353,"Site-directed mutagenesis can be employed to alter activity critical residues in proteins which are susceptible to chemical oxidation. Previous studies have implicated methionine 222 as a primary site for oxidative inactivation of subtilisin (Stauffer, C. E., and Etson, D. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 5333-5338). Because of uncertainties in predicting which amino acid would be the optimal substitute for methionine 222, we prepared all 19 amino acid substitutions at this site in the cloned subtilisin gene using a cassette mutagenesis method (Wells, J. A., Vasser, M., and Powers, D. P. (1985) Gene (Amst.), in press). Mutant enzymes were expressed in Bacillus subtilis and were found to vary widely in specific activity. Mutants containing nonoxidizable amino acids (i.e. Ser, Ala, and Leu) were resistant to inactivation by 1 M H2O2, whereas methionine and cysteine enzymes were rapidly inactivated. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of improving oxidative stability in proteins by site-directed mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2068467995,"Extracellular collections of abnormal filaments composed of prion proteins have been identified in the brains of scrapie-infected hamsters using immunoelectron microscopy. Some of the filaments were 1500 nm in length; generally, they exhibited a uniform diameter of 16 nm. Rarely, the filaments had a twisted appearance, raising the possibility that they are flattened cylinders or are composed of helically wound protofilaments. The prion filaments possess the same diameter and limited twisting as the shorter rod-shaped particles observed in purified preparations of prions. Both the filaments and rods are composed of PrP 27–30 molecules, as determined by immunoelectron microscopy using affinity-purified antibodies. The ultrastructural features of the prion filaments are similar to those reported for amyloid in many tissues including brain. These results provide the first evidence that prion proteins assemble into filaments within the brain and that these filaments accumulate in extracellular spaces to form amyloid plaques."
https://openalex.org/W1503509391,"A chemotactic peptide stimulated the high-affinity GTPase activity in membrane preparations from guinea pig neutrophils. The enzyme stimulation was inhibited by prior exposure of the membrane-donor cells to islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, or by direct incubation of the membrane preparations with its A-protomer (the active peptide) in the presence of NAD. The affinity for the chemotactic peptide binding to its receptors was lowered by guanyl-5'-yl beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) reflecting its coupling to the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in neutrophils. The affinity in the absence of Gpp(NH)p was lower, but the affinity in its presence was not, in the A-protomer-treated membranes than in nontreated membranes. The inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase (Ni) was purified from rat brain, and reconstituted into the membranes from IAP-treated cells. The reconstitution was very effective in increasing formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-dependent GTPase activity and increasing the chemotactic peptide binding to membranes due to affinity increase. The half-maximal concentration of IAP to inhibit GTPase activity was comparable to that of the toxin to inhibit the cellular arachidonate-releasing response which was well correlated with ADP-ribosylation of a membrane Mr = 41,000 protein (Okajima, F., and Ui, M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13863-13871). It is proposed that the IAP substrate, Ni, couples to the chemotactic peptide receptor and mediates arachidonate-releasing responses in neutrophils, as it mediates adenylate cyclase inhibition in many other cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1626924127,"Upon stimulation with serotonin of washed human platelets prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate, we found an approximately 250% increase in [32P]phosphatidic acid (PA) formation, a small decrease in [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and a concomitant increase in [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Using [3H]arachidonate for prelabeling, [3H]diacylglycerol accumulated transiently at 10 s after addition of the agonist, [3H]PA increased but to a lower extent compared to 32P-labeled lipid, and the formation of both [3H]polyphosphoinositides increased. The serotonin-induced dose-dependent changes in [32P]PA correlate with its effect on the changes in slope of aggregation of platelets. The potency of 13 drugs to antagonize the serotonin-induced PA formation closely corresponds to both their potency to inhibit platelet aggregation and their binding affinity for serotonin-S2 receptor sites. It is suggested that at least part of the signal transducing system following activation of the serotonin-S2 receptors involves phospholipase C catalyzed inositol lipid breakdown yielding diacylglycerol which is subsequently phosphorylated to PA."
https://openalex.org/W1563147417,"The discovery of a trans-stimulation property associated with lysine exodus from lysosomes of human fibroblasts has enabled us to characterize a system mediating the transport of cationic amino acids across the lysosomal membrane of human fibroblasts. The cationic amino acids arginine, lysine, ornithine, diaminobutyrate, histidine, 2-aminoethylcysteine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and cysteamine all caused trans-stimulation of the exodus of radiolabeled lysine from the lysosomal fraction of human fibroblasts at pH 6.5. In contrast, neutral and acidic amino acids did not affect the rate of lysine exodus. trans-Stimulation of lysine exodus was observed over the pH range from 5.5 to 7.6, was specific for the L-isomer of the cationic amino acid, and was intolerant to methylation of the alpha-amino group of the amino acid. The lysosomotropic amine, chloroquine, greatly retarded lysine exodus, whereas the presence of sodium ion was without effect. The specificity and lack of Na+ dependence of this lysosomal transport system is similar to that of System y+ present on the plasma membrane of human fibroblasts. In addition, we find cystine exodus from the lysosomal fraction of cystinotic human fibroblasts to be greatly retarded as compared to that of normal human fibroblasts with half-times of exodus similar to those reported for the lysosomes of cystinotic and normal human leukocytes (Gahl, W. A., Tietze, F., Bashan, N., Steinherz, R., and Schulman, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9570-9575). In contrast, normal and cystinotic human fibroblasts did not show any differences with regard to lysine efflux or its trans-stimulation by cationic amino acids. An important mechanism by which cysteamine treatment of cystinosis allows cystine escape from lysosomes may be the ability of the mixed disulfide of cysteine and cysteamine formed by sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange to migrate by this newly discovered system mediating cationic amino acid transport."

We created DNAs specifying G proteins with shortened transmembrane domains, by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Expression of these DNAs showed that G proteins containing 18, 16, or 14 amino acids of the original transmembrane domain assumed a transmembrane configuration and were transported to the cell surface. G proteins containing only 12 or 8 amino acids of this domain also spanned intracellular membranes, but their transport was blocked within a Golgi-like region in the cell. A G protein completely lacking the membrane-spanning domain accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and was secreted slowly.

https://openalex.org/W2169269127,"We have isolated the proto-oncogene c-myb from Drosophila melanogaster. This gene is represented by a single locus at position 13E-F on the X chromosome, and is expressed in early embryos by transcription into two polyadenylated RNAs with lengths of approximately 3.0 and 3.8 kb. The gene may encode a protein with a molecular weight of at least 55,000 that shares a domain with c-myb(chicken) in which 91 of 125 (or 73%) of the amino acids are identical in the Drosophila and chicken genes. These findings represent the first rigorous identification of a Drosophila proto-oncogene that can encode what may be a nuclear protein, and they set the stage for a genetic analysis of how c-myb serves the normal organism."
https://openalex.org/W1491645708,"When human neutrophils, previously labeled in their phospholipids with [14C]arachidonate, were stimulated with the Ca2+-ionophore, A23187, plus Ca2+ in the presence of [3H]acetate, these cells released [14C]arachidonate from membrane phospholipids, produced 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-[14C]eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and 14C-labeled 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6-cis,8,10-trans, 14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid ([14C]leukotriene B4), and incorporated [3H]acetate into platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). Ionophore A23187-induced formation of these radiolabeled products was greatly augmented by submicromolar concentrations of exogenous 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), 5-HETE, and leukotriene B4. In the absence of ionophore A23187, these arachidonic acid metabolites were virtually ineffective. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and several other lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitors (butylated hydroxyanisole, 3-amino-1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-pyrazoline and 1-phenyl-2-pyrazolidinone) caused parallel inhibition of [14C]arachidonate release and [3H]PAF formation in a dose-dependent manner. Specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as indomethacin and naproxen, did not inhibit but rather slightly augmented the formation of these products. Furthermore, addition of 5-HPETE, 5-HETE, or leukotriene B4 (but not 8-HETE or 15-HETE) to neutrophils caused substantial relief of NDGA inhibition of [3H]PAF formation and [14C]arachidonate release. As opposed to [3H]acetate incorporation into PAF, [3H]lyso-PAF incorporation into PAF by activated neutrophils was little affected by NDGA. In addition, NDGA had no effect on lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase as measured in neutrophil homogenate preparations. It is concluded that in activated human neutrophils 5-lipoxygenase products can modulate PAF formation by enhancing the expression of phospholipase A2."

https://openalex.org/W1553679158,"The properties of the Bacillus subtilis RNase P are characterized with regard to the types and concentrations of monovalent and divalent ions required to potentiate precursor tRNA cleavage by the protein-RNA holoenzyme and the catalytic RNA alone. The ionic dependence of the RNase P RNA-catalyzed reaction in part seems due to a requirement for ion shielding between substrate and catalytic RNAs. The RNase P protein, which binds to RNA nonspecifically and tightly, likely serves, in part, as a cation screen. However, the character of the ion dependence of the RNA catalysis, the inhibition by high SO2-4 concentration, and potentiation by solvents suggest that RNA conformational transition may be involved in the reaction. It is proposed that the reason for catalysis by RNA in the RNase P reaction may be a requirement for fluidity in the structure of the catalyst, so that it can accommodate many tRNA substrates, which vary in their structural details."
https://openalex.org/W2075810299,In many cases the multiple genes coding for one specific tRNA are dispersed throughout the genome. The members of such a gene family nevertheless maintain a common nucleotide sequence during evolution. A major mechanism contributing to this concerted evolution is intergenic conversion. Here we show that it occurs between three tRNA genes of related sequence residing on different chromosomes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Sequence analysis of converted genes indicates that blocks of a minimal length of 18-33 bp and of a maximal length of 190 bp can be transferred from one gene to the other. During meiosis the frequency of these transfers lies in the order of 10(-5) per progeny spore. Information transfer between any two members of the gene family occurs in both directions.
https://openalex.org/W1498234043,"Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP-2) participates in the microsomal conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol, in the conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol ester, and in intracellular cholesterol transfers. The stoichiometry of binding between cholesterol and SCP-2 is 1:1. However, reports have appeared attributing sterol carrier protein activity to a protein preparation identical to hepatic fatty acid-binding protein (FABP). Therefore, the present investigation was conducted to compare homogeneous preparations of FABP and SCP-2 with respect to their capacities to participate as carrier proteins in reactions involving sterols or fatty acids. The results show that SCP-2 and FABP have separate and distinct physiological functions, with SCP-2 participating in reactions involving sterols and FABP participating in reactions involving fatty acid binding and/or transport. Furthermore, there is no overlap in substrate specificities, i.e. FABP does not possess sterol carrier protein activity and SCP-2 does not specifically bind or transport fatty acid. As long as only small quantities of organic solvent (1.6 volume %) were used for substrate addition, the sterol delta 7-reductase liver microsomal assay for SCP-2 correlated well with the physiologically relevant assays employed in the reconstituted adrenal system. The sterol carrier protein activity previously attributed to rat hepatic FABP is explained by the presence of significant quantities of propylene glycol (15 volume %) or Tween 80 in the assay procedure."
https://openalex.org/W1491559815,"The production of plasminogen activator by ovarian granulosa cells has been previously reported to be temporally correlated with ovulation in the rat and to be under hormonal control of gonadotropins. We have examined the type of plasminogen activator produced by granulosa cells and also investigated other ovarian cell types for synthesis of this enzyme. Using antibodies specific for tissue-type or urokinase-type plasminogen activator, we have found that granulosa cells produce exclusively the tissue-type enzyme. However, in cultures of whole follicles isolated from the ovary, there is primarily synthesis of urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Examination of other isolated ovarian cell types has demonstrated that thecal cells secrete the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and that the production of this enzyme is also regulated by gonadotropins and temporally correlated with ovulation. These results suggest that ovulation requires both types of plasminogen activator and that the neighboring granulosa and thecal cells cooperate to ensure rupture of the follicle wall and unimpeded passage of the ovum into the oviduct."
https://openalex.org/W1575034514,"The small subunits of spinach ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase were isolated by mild acid precipitation of the hexadecameric holoenzyme. About one-third of the small subunits remained in the supernatant while the remainder, and all of the large subunits, were precipitated and irreversibly denatured. The spinach small subunits were able to reassemble with the large subunit octamer of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase from the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus ACMM 323, prepared as described previously (Andrews, T. J., and Ballment, B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7514-7518) to produce a catalytically active, hybrid enzyme. The heterologous small subunits bound an order of magnitude less tightly than homologous small subunits and the specific activity of the hybrid, when fully saturated with foreign small subunits, was about half that of the homologously reassembled or native Synechococcus enzyme. In addition, the Km(CO2) of the hybrid was about twice as high. However, the degree of partitioning between carboxylation and oxygenation was identical for the hybrid, the homologously reassembled, and the native Synechococcus enzymes and clearly less in favor of carboxylation than partitioning by the spinach enzyme. Therefore, this important facet of catalysis by ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase appears to be specified exclusively by the large subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1577594918,"The biosynthesis and post-translational modification of mannosidase II, an enzyme required in the maturation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi complex, has been investigated. Antibody raised against this enzyme purified from rat liver Golgi membranes was used to immunoprecipitate mannosidase II from rat liver, 3T3 cells, or HeLa cells. Mannosidase II immunoprecipitated from rat liver Golgi membranes, when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, migrated with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 124,000. In contrast, the enzyme purified from rat liver Golgi membranes was shown to contain both the 124,000-dalton component and a 110,000-dalton polypeptide believed to result from degradation of intact mannosidase II during purification. Mannosidase II from 3T3 and HeLa cells migrated on polyacrylamide gels with apparent molecular weights of approximately 124,000 and 134,000-136,000, respectively. When immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled cultures, mannosidase II from both cell types was similar in the following respects: (a) the initial synthesis product had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 124,000; (b) in cultures treated with tunicamycin the initial synthesis product had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 117,000; (c) endoglycosidase H digestion of the initial synthesis product gave an apparent molecular weight similar to the tunicamycin-induced polypeptide; (d) the mature enzyme was mostly (HeLa) or entirely (3T3) resistant to digestion by endoglycosidase H. Loss of [35S]methionine from intracellular mannosidase II occurred with a half-life of approximately 20 h; there was no appreciable accumulation of labeled immuno-reactive material in the medium. HeLa mannosidase II, but not the 3T3 enzyme, was additionally modified 1-3 h after synthesis, the initial synthesis product being converted to a doublet with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 134,000-136,000. Evidence is presented that this mobility shift may result from O-glycosylation. Mannosidase II from both cell types could be labeled with [32P]phosphate or [35S]sulfate. The latter is apparently attached to oligosaccharide as indicated by inhibition of labeling by tunicamycin; the former was shown with the HeLa enzyme to be present as serine phosphate moieties. In addition, [3H]palmitate could be incorporated into the enzyme in 3T3 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This feature of human and mouse IgD distinguishes it from all other immunoglobulins regardless of species or class.

https://openalex.org/W1586586278,"Previous studies have demonstrated a Factor IX and IXa binding site on the endothelial cell surface for which both the zymogen and enzyme compete with equal affinity. In this report, we demonstrate that the affinity of Factor IXa, but not Factor IX, for the cell surface is increased in the presence of both Factors VIII and X. When Factor Xa formation was studied in the presence of saturating concentrations of Factors VIII and X, the half-maximal rate was observed at a Factor IXa concentration of 151 +/- 12 pM. Active site-blocked Factor IXa, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-Factor IXa, was a more effective inhibitor of Factor X activation (Ki = 124 pM) than was Factor IX (Ki = 3.0 nM). Radioligand binding studies carried out in the presence of Factors VIII and X confirmed the presence of a selective endothelial cell Factor IXa binding site with Kd = 127 +/- 27 pM. In contrast, when Factor IXa binding was studied in the absence of other coagulation factors, or in the presence of Factor VIII (thrombin-activated or unactivated) alone, this new high affinity site was not observed. Competitive binding studies indicated that Factor IXa was 12 times more effective as an inhibitor of Factor IX-endothelial cell binding in the presence of Factors VIII and X. Consistent with the increased affinity of Factor IXa binding in the presence of factors VIII and X, cell-associated Factor IXa coagulant activity decayed 7 times more slowly in the presence of these coagulation factors. These results demonstrate selective Factor IXa-endothelial cell binding in the presence of Factors VIII and X, suggesting this interaction could be a physiologic occurrence."

In pulse-labeled MOPC-315 (where MOPC-315 represents mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma cells) plasmacytoma cells, no precursor forms of these proteins were detected and only ERp99 was sensitive to endoglycosidase H. The ERp99 oligosaccharide remained endoglycosidase H sensitive during a 3-h chase, and analysis by high performance liquid chromatography showed the predominant structure to be Man8GlcNAc2. We have used a sucrose gradient analysis of pulse-labeled MOPC-315 plasmacytoma cells in order to directly study the biosynthetic sorting of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated ERps and have found no strong evidence to suggest these proteins ever leave the endoplasmic reticulum. In spite of their common sorting pathway, these proteins differ in their membrane orientation. Both ERp60 and ERp72 are entirely protected by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane while ERp99 appears to have a large domain exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1590250543,"A growth factor, mammary-derived growth factor 1 (MDGF1), has been purified to apparent homogeneity from human milk. The factor is a pepsin-sensitive, reducing agent-insensitive protein with a molecular mass of 62 kDa and a pI of 4.8. An apparently identical factor has been isolated from human mammary tumors, suggesting that MDGF1 might be made by and act as an autocrine growth factor for mammary cells. High affinity receptors for MDGF1 have been detected on mouse mammary cells, normal rat kidney cells, and A431 epidermoid cells (KD = 2 X 10(-10) M). MDGF1 at picomolar levels stimulates the growth of mammary cells and greatly amplifies their production of collagen, apparently via elevating collagen mRNA levels, an effect that is demonstrated for normal rat kidney cells. The responsiveness of mammary cells to MDGF1 is attenuated when the cells are grown on a basement membrane collagen substratum, a component of the extracellular matrix upon which these cells normally rest in vivo. MDGF1 thus may regulate the production of new basement membrane as mammary epithelium invades the stroma during proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1514207813,"In exponentially growing 3T6 cells, the synthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) is balanced by its utilization for DNA replication, with a turnover of the dTTP pool of around 5 min. We now investigate the effects of two inhibitors of DNA synthesis (aphidicolin and hydroxyurea) on the synthesis and degradation of pyrimidine deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). Complete inhibition of DNA replication with aphidicolin did not decrease the turnover of pyrimidine dNTP pools labeled from the corresponding [3H]deoxynucleosides, only partially inhibited the in situ activity of thymidylate synthetase and resulted in excretion into the medium of thymidine derived from breakdown of dTTP synthesized de novo. These data demonstrate continued synthesis of dTTP in the absence of DNA replication. In contrast, hydroxyurea decreased the turnover of pyrimidine dNTP pools 5-50-fold. Hydroxyurea is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and stops DNA synthesis by depleting cells of purine dNTPs but not pyrimidine dNTPs. Our results suggest that degradation of dNTPs is turned off by an unknown mechanism when de novo synthesis is blocked."
https://openalex.org/W1498557333,"Rat ovarian granulosa cells, isolated from immature female rats 48 h after stimulation with 5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin, were maintained in culture. The effects of monensin, a monovalent cationic ionophore, on various aspects of proteoglycan metabolism were studied by metabolically labeling cultures with [35S]sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, or [3H]glucose. Monensin inhibited post-translational modification of both heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans and dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycans, resulting in decreased synthesis of completed proteoglycans [( 35S]sulfate incorporation decreased to 10% of control by 30 microM monensin, with an ED50 approximately 1 microM). Proteoglycans synthesized in the presence of monensin showed undersulfation of both DS and HS glycosaminoglycans and altered N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, suggesting that the processing of all sugar moieties is closely associated. Monensin caused a decrease in the endogenous sugar supply to the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pool as indicated by an increased 3H incorporation into DS chains [( 3H]glucosamine as precursor) in spite of the decrease in glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Monensin reduced and delayed transport of both secretory and membrane-associated proteoglycans from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. It took 2-4 min for newly labeled proteoglycans to reach the main transport process inhibited by monensin. Monensin at 30 microM did not prevent internalization of cell surface 35S-labeled proteoglycans but almost completely inhibited their intracellular degradation to free [35S]sulfate (ED50 approximately 1 microM), resulting in intracellular accumulation of both DS and HS proteoglycans. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that one of the intracellular degradation pathways involving proteolysis of both DS and HS proteoglycans and limited endoglycosidic cleavage of HS continued to operate in the presence of monensin. These results suggest that the intracellular degradation of proteoglycans involve both acidic and nonacidic compartments with monensin inhibiting those processes that normally occur in such acidic compartments as endosomes or lysosomes by raising their pH."

(1981) Nature 272, 128-132), thus placing expression of this gene under control of the strong lambda promoter pL. The construction, pKCE3, which includes a properly positioned E. coli ribosome binding site from the lac operon (Robbins, P.W., Trimble, R. B., Wirth, D.F., Hering, C., Maley, F. Maley, G. F., Das, R., Gibson, B.W., and Biemann, K. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7577-7583), was used to transform an E. coli strain lysogenic for a lambda prophage containing a temperature-sensitive repressor. By shifting cultures of pKCE3 lysogens to 42 degrees C, the production of Endo H commenced and was linear for about 1 h. Enzyme yields were amplified 150-fold above those obtained from comparable cultures of S. plicatus and represented 3 to 4% of total cellular protein, which enabled purification of Endo H to homogeneity by a rapid fourstep procedure. Although most of the cloned Endo H was secreted into the periplasmic space by E. coli, its 4 kDa leader sequence peptide (Robbins et al. (1984] was only partially removed during processing. As a result the purified pKCE3 Endo H was a heterogeneous population of molecules with an average molecular mass of 31 kDa compared to the 28.9 kDa fully processed product normally secreted by S. plicatus. Despite the residual approximately 2 kDa of leader sequence on the cloned pKCE3 product, there were no detectable differences in either the substrate specificity or the stability characteristics of the enzyme purified from E. coli or from S. plicatus. Of particular value for studies on glycoproteins was the finding that the genetically engineered Endo H was completely free of proteolytic contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W1489140179,"A new affinity labeling reagent for glycogen synthase a from rabbit muscle, uridine diphosphopyridoxal, has been prepared. Incubation of the enzyme with this reagent resulted in a time-dependent, almost complete loss of activity. The inactivation was pseudo-first order, and the results of the kinetic analysis suggested the formation of a noncovalent enzyme-reagent complex prior to the covalent reaction, with a Kinact of 25 microM and a maximal rate constant of 0.22 min-1. The inactivation was pronouncedly protected by UDP-Glc and UDP, but not by the allosteric activator glucose 6-phosphate. The increase in a spectral peak at 425 nm and the decrease in enzymatic activity were well correlated, suggesting that the reagent causes the inactivation of the enzyme by the formation of a Schiff base. The rate of inactivation increased as the pH was raised, giving a pK of 8.85. Almost all the original activity was recovered by the treatment of the inactivated enzyme with cysteamine or any other aminothiol compound. No recovery of the activity, however, was observed with inactivated enzyme which had been treated with NaBH4. A peptide containing the labeled amino acid was isolated for inactivated enzyme after reduction with NaBH4, carboxymethylation, and chymotryptic digestion by fractionation on a Bio-Gel P-6 column and high performance liquid chromatographies. Manual Edman degradation established the sequence as Glu-Val-Ala-Asn-labeled Lys-Val-Gly-Gly-Ile-(Tyr). The introduction of an active site-directing moiety to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate makes the resultant reagent an effective probe for the active site of glycogen synthase."

https://openalex.org/W1542868482,"Stretching arteries from resting length to 1.7 times the resting length increased myosin light chain phosphorylation from 40 to 70% in a graded fashion, reaching a plateau at 1.6 times the resting length. When the fully stretched arteries were released, active tension developed without any exogenous stimulating agent. This stretch-release-induced tension approached the same magnitude as that of the control K+-induced tension. Stretch-induced phosphorylation and the subsequent tension development upon release of stretch were prevented by incubating the arteries in physiological salt solutions containing ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or chlorpromazine. The inhibition produced by EGTA was reversible. Stretch-induced phosphorylation decreased as a function of time, regardless of whether stretch was maintained, or slackened slowly, or released quickly. While tension developed upon release of stretch, light chain phosphorylation simultaneously decreased. As tension reached and maintained its maximal value, phosphorylation continued to decrease. Thus, light chain phosphorylation is necessary for activation of arterial muscle contraction, but it need not be maintained during tension development or maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1903537363,"Two main polypeptides, Mr about 27,000 and 21,000, were protected against pepsin proteolysis when a mixture consisting of asolectin vesicles and 125I-labeled tetanus toxin was subjected to a pH drop from 7.2 to 3.0. The same result was obtained with the amino-terminal portion of the toxin (called fragment B). These polypeptides were not found to be protected in the following conditions: (i) when vesicles were omitted from the mixture; (ii) when the external pH of the vesicles was maintained at 7.2 and trypsin was used as a proteolytic agent; and (iii) when the vesicles were ruptured either before or after addition of the toxin. By specific immunoprecipitation, we identified the protected polypeptides as part of the central fragment of tetanus toxin. In addition, a 15.5-kDa polypeptide, belonging to toxin fragment C, was shown to be particularly resistant to digestion by various proteases, even in the absence of lipid vesicles. Based on these findings, we propose a model for entry of tetanus toxin into its target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1492294957,"Addition of Ca2+ to primary cultures of female pituitary cells incubated in serum-free medium lacking added Ca2+ yielded no effects on levels of prolactin or growth hormone mRNA, assayed by cytoplasmic dot hybridization. However, incubation of the cells in serum-free medium containing sufficient ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid to reduce medium Ca2+ levels below the 10-40 microM present as a trace contaminant yielded a decrease in the levels of both mRNAs. The decrease was dose-dependent at extracellular Ca2+ concentrations below 1.0 microM, had an apparent half-maximum at about 0.3 microM, and did not appear to plateau with increasing incubation times. Following 2-3-day incubations of cells in low Ca2+, a reduction of prolactin mRNA (23-70-fold) consistently greater than the reduction of growth hormone mRNA (9-15-fold) was observed. Similar effects of reduced extracellular Ca2+ were obtained with primary cultures of male pituitary cells. The specificity of these effects of lowered extracellular Ca2+ was demonstrated by the following observations. The decreases in these mRNAs were substantially reversible by readdition of Ca2+ to the incubation medium. Reduction of extracellular Ca2+ led to no detectable changes in cellular ribosomal RNA levels or over-all RNA synthesis. In male pituitary cells, the level of another metal-regulated mRNA, that for metallothionein, was not decreased by a reduction of extracellular Ca2+ that caused a 40-fold decrease in levels of prolactin and growth hormone mRNA. Hence, Ca2+ exhibits specificity in its regulation of pituitary prolactin and growth hormone gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1486107092,"The enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to lactosylceramide (LacCer) was obtained in a 32,000-fold purified and apparently homogeneous form from rat liver by a procedure involving affinity chromatography on UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose and LacCer-Sepharose. The enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits whose apparent molecular weights are 65,000 and 22,000. Methylation and hydrolysis of the product formed by incubation of the enzyme with UDP-galactose and [3H]LacCer yielded 2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-[3H]galactose, indicating that a galactose residue was introduced to position C-4 of the terminal galactose of the LacCer. The product also specifically reacted with monoclonal antibody directed to globotriaosylceramide (Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). This indicates that the purified enzyme is exclusively alpha 1-4-galactosyltransferase. Studies on substrate specificity indicate that the purified enzyme is highly specific for the synthesis of GbOse3Cer and is clearly distinct from the enzymes responsible for the formation of iGbOse3Cer (Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-Cer) and blood group-B substance, which possess alpha 1-3 galactosidic linkages at the nonreducing termini. The enzyme is also distinct from the alpha 1-4-galactosyltransferase which catalyzes the formation of galabiaosylceramide (Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-1Cer) and IV4Gal-nLacOse4 (P1 antigen). These studies represent the first report of the properties of a highly purified alpha-galactosyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of sugar residues to glycolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1525218478,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation of prolactin secretion from rat pituitary (GH3) cells is biphasic with a secretory burst (0-2 min) at a higher rate, followed by sustained secretion (beyond 2 min) at a lower rate. Based on the effects of calcium ionophores, K+ depolarization, and diacylglycerol (or phorbol esters), it was suggested that the secretory burst is dependent on elevation of cytoplasmic free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) whereas sustained secretion is mediated by lipid-activated protein phosphorylation. In this study, we pretreated GH3 cells with 0.03 mM arachidonic acid to abolish thyrotropin-releasing hormone-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i (Kolesnick, R. N., and Gershengorn, M. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 707-713). In control cells, basal secretion was 0.7 +/- 0.2 ng/10(6) cells/min which increased to 8.3 +/- 0.8 between 0 and 2 min after TRH and remained elevated at 3.3 +/- 0.2 between 2-10 min. In cells pretreated with arachidonic acid, TRH stimulated prolactin secretion to only 2.6 +/- 0.3 ng/10(6) cells/min between 0 and 2 min and to 3.2 +/- 0.2 between 2 to 10 min; these values are not different from each other nor from the response between 2 and 10 min in control cells. K+ depolarization, which elevates [Ca2+]i even in arachidonic acid-pretreated cells but does not affect lipid metabolism, caused only a secretory burst. Bovine serum albumin, which binds free arachidonic acid and reverses arachidonic acid inhibition of TRH-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i, reversed the inhibition of the secretory burst stimulated by TRH. These studies present direct evidence that the burst of prolactin secretion stimulated by TRH is dependent on an elevation of [Ca2+]i whereas the sustained phase of secretion is independent of such elevation."
https://openalex.org/W1501980962,"Abstract The present study was designed to investigate the effect of dexamethasone treatment for 2 weeks (2.5 mg/kg/week, subcutaneously) on the level of unesterified fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, in the renal medulla of rats, and to relate the observed effect to changes in the tissue concentration and the fatty acid composition of renal medulla phospholipids and triglycerides. Dexamethasone treatment caused an increase in the renal inner medulla level of unesterified fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, that was associated with a reduction of triglycerides and of arachidonic acid esterified into triglycerides, and with an increase in the rate of fatty acids esterification into triglycerides. In contrast, dexamethasone treatment did not affect the renal medulla concentration of phospholipids, the arachidonic acid content of renal medulla phospholipids, or the rate of esterification of fatty acids into renal medulla phospholipids. In the face of increased fatty acid esterification into triglycerides, the finding of reduced triglyceride levels in the renal medulla of dexamethasone-treated rats suggests excessive triglyceride breakdown. If so, fatty acids including arachidonic acid liberated from triglycerides may contribute to elevation of unesterified fatty acid levels in the renal medulla during dexamethasone treatment. The increased level of free arachidonic acid in the renal medulla of dexamethasone-treated rats may explain in part the reported effect of this steroid in increasing urinary prostaglandins."

https://openalex.org/W1561813445,"Malonyl coenzyme A synthetase (EC 6.2.1.14) was induced in Pseudomonas fluorescens grown on malonate as a sole carbon source. This enzyme was purified, for the first time, over 30-fold by the combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purified enzyme, which had a specific activity of about 0.512 mumol/min/mg, appeared to be electrophoretically homogeneous. The molecular size of the enzyme was determined to be 98,000 Da which is composed of two 49,000-Da subunits. The optimum pH for the enzyme was 7.5. Malonyl coenzyme A synthetase requires ATP, CoA, and Mg2+ for the full enzyme activity. With succinate or acetate, the synthetic rate of CoA derivative was 40% of that observed with malonate. The malonyl coenzyme A synthetase showed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the substrate, malonate, ATP, and coenzyme A, from which the Km values were calculated to be 3.8 X 10(-4) M, 2 X 10(-3) M, and 10(-4) M and Vmax values to be 0.117 mumol/min/mg, 0.111 mumol/min/mg, and 0.142 mumol/min/mg, respectively. The purified malonyl coenzyme A synthetase was immunogenic in the rabbit and Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis revealed a single precipitant line with the enzyme. The antiserum inhibited the enzyme activity and the extent of inhibition was dependent on the amount of the serum added."

https://openalex.org/W1675435207,"Two forms of a histone H1-specific S-adenosylmethionine:protein-lysine N-methyltransferase (protein methylase III) have been purified from Euglena gracilis 48- and 214-fold, respectively, with yields of 3.4 and 4.6%. The enzymes were purified on DEAE-cellulose and histone-Sepharose affinity chromatography and found to be highly specific toward histone H1 as a substrate. However, one of the enzymes also methylates other histone subfractions to a limited extent. Of the proteins other than histones, only myosin showed measurable methyl-accepting capability. Both enzymes were found to be inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (D and L forms), S-adenosyl-L-ethionine, and sinefungin. While the Ki values for S-adenosyl-L-ethionine were similar for both enzymes, the values for S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and sinefungin were 10-fold lower for the second form. The Km values for histone H1 and S-adenosyl-L-methionine were found to be 3.1 X 10(-7) and 2.7 X 10(-5) M, respectively, for the first enzyme, and 4.4 X 10(-7) and 3.45 X 10(-5) M for the second. Peptide analysis of methyl-14C-labeled H1 revealed that the two enzymes methylate different sites within the histone H1 molecule. The two enzymes were found to have molecular weights of 55,000 and 34,000, respectively. Both enzymes have an optimum pH of 9.0, which is identical to that of other protein-lysine N-methyltransferases thus far identified."
https://openalex.org/W26822258,"Our previous study (Tan, A. W. H., and Nuttall, F. Q. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9624-9630) indicated that liver synthase D contained a large number of endogenous phosphates, 12 of which were stable and 6 labile to alkali treatment. We wished to investigate the nature of the phosphates on synthase which became isotopically labeled when inorganic [32P]phosphate was given either to intact rats or to isolated liver cells. An antibody against liver synthase D was used for the isolation of synthase. The antibody recognized both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated form of the enzyme, native as well as partially cleaved species. A large enzyme form, with Mr of 90,000 as well as one with Mr of 73,000 was observed. A 61% decrease in [32P]phosphate was found in synthase when prelabeled liver cells were treated with glucose, whereas a 25% increase was seen in cells treated with glucagon. After [32P]synthase D was converted to synthase I by synthase phosphatase, 95% of the [32P]phosphate was lost. All of the bound [32P]phosphates were found to be labile to alkali. Thus, under the in vivo conditions used, the [32P]phosphates incorporated into synthase were characterized by their fast turnover rate, alkali lability and susceptibility to the action of synthase phosphatase, both in vivo and in vitro. These criteria serve to distinguish them from the slower turning-over, alkali-stable phosphates found previously in both synthases D and I."
https://openalex.org/W1583623811,"We have developed density labeling pulse-chase methods which, in contrast to a conventional radiolabeling approach, allow us to determine the effectiveness of our chase and to measure RNA stability in vivo without measuring precursor pool specific activities. We have used these methods to determine the stability of the embryonic ribosomal RNA inherited by either normally or slowly growing Drosophila melanogaster larvae. If larvae are raised in a rich growth medium, embryonic rRNA decays with a half-life of 48 h. However, if larvae are raised in a poor growth medium, which slows larval growth and prolongs development, the half-life of rRNA increases to 115 h. This is the only example, of which we are aware, directly showing that rRNA half-life increases during slow growth conditions. We propose that the increased stability of rRNA that we find may enable slowly growing larvae to maintain the ribosome levels necessary to continue growth and development under conditions of nutrient deprivation."
