https://openalex.org/W2012674191,"We have transferred the site-specific recombination system of the yeast 2 micron plasmid, the FLP recombinase and its recombination targets (FRTs), into the genome of Drosophila. Flies were transformed with an FLP gene under the control of hsp70 regulatory sequences and with a white gene flanked by FRTs. The heat-induced recombinase catalyzes recombination between FRTs, causing loss of white (seen somatically as white patches in the eye) and, less frequently, gain of white (seen as dark-red patches). Loss and gain frequencies vary with the severity of the heat shock, and patterns of mosaicism vary with the developmental stage at which the heat shock is applied. The recombinase is also active in the germline, producing white-eyed and dark-red-eyed progeny."

https://openalex.org/W2008546779,"The chicken heavy chain locus contains a single JH segment and a unique functional VH gene (VH1) 15 kb upstream, with approximately 15 D elements in between. A cluster of pseudogenes (psi VH) spans 60-80 kb, starting 7 kb upstream from VH1, with an average density of one pseudogene per 0.85 kb and an almost systematic alternation of polarity. Diversification of the unique rearranged VH1 gene takes place during bursal ontogeny by the same hyperconversion mechanism that was described for the chicken light chain, with psi VH segments acting as donors. The hyperconversion mechanism also operates within the D region, as all pseudogenes analyzed are fused VD elements; this D region possesses distinct characteristics, allowing higher combinatorial possibilities in the gene conversion process. Allelic exclusion appears to be performed by restriction of a complete VDJ rearrangement to a single allele."
https://openalex.org/W1550151833,"Our previous work has shown that, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, any of the eight stabilizing amino-terminal residues confers a long (> 20 h) half-life on a test protein β-galactosidase (β gal), whereas 12 destabilizing amino-terminal residues confer on β gal half-lives from less than 3 min to 30 min. We now show that an analogous single-residue code (the N-end rule) operates in an in vitro system derived from mammalian reticulocytes. We also show that the N-end rule has a hierarchical structure. Specifically, amino-terminal Glu and Asp (and also Cys in reticulocytes) are secondary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be conjugated to primary destabilizing residues such as Arg. Amino-terminal Gln and Asn are tertiary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be converted, via selective deamidation, into secondary destabilizing residues Glu and Asp. Furthermore, in reticulocytes, distinct types of the N-end-recognizing activity are shown to be specific for three classes of primary destabilizing residues: basic (Arg, Lys, His), bulky hydrophobic (Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr), and small uncharged (Ala, Ser, Thr). Features of the N-end rule in reticulocytes suggest that the exact form of the N-end rule may depend on the cell's physiological state, thereby providing a mechanism for selective destruction of preexisting proteins upon cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1528943412,"Abstract In order to test the physiological significance of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in pharmacomechanical coupling, we have utilized two near-physiological systems, in which relatively high molecular weight solutes can be applied intracellularly and receptor coupling is retained: beta-escin permeabilization and reversible permeabilization. We showed that in smooth muscle permeabilized with beta-escin, one of the saponin esters, alpha 1-adrenergic (phenylephrine) and muscarinic (carbachol) agonists, as well as caffeine and InsP3, cause contractions mediated by Ca2+ release. These contractions were calmodulin-dependent and blocked by depletion of Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Intracellular heparin (Mr = about 5000), a blocker of InsP3 binding to its receptor and a specific inhibitor of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in smooth muscles, inhibited the responses to the agonists and to InsP3, but not those to caffeine, nor did it block the enhanced contractile response to cytoplasmic Ca2+ induced by agonists and by GTP gamma S. Neomycin blocked Ca2+ release induced by carbachol, but not by caffeine. In reversibly permeabilized ileum smooth muscle cells, loaded with Fura-2 acid and heparin, the intracellular heparin inhibited Ca2+ release and contractions induced by carbachol in Ca2+-free, high K+ solution. Heparin did not inhibit the high K+ contractions (with 1.2 mM Ca2+) and had no significant inhibitory effects on carbachol-induced responses in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. These results, obtained under near-physiological conditions, support the conclusion that InsP3 is the major physiological messenger of the Ca2+ release component of pharmacomechanical coupling, but not of the components mediated by Ca2+ influx or by potentiation of the contractile response to Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2045286684,"Eye movements exist to improve vision, in part by preventing excessive retinal image slip. A major threat to the stability of the retinal image comes from the observer's own movement, and there are visual and vestibular reflexes that operate to meet this challenge by generating compensatory eye movements. The ocular responses to translational disturbances of the observer and of the scene were recorded from monkeys. The associated vestibular and visual responses were both linearly dependent on the inverse of the viewing distance. Such dependence on proximity is appropriate for the vestibular reflex, which must transform signals from Cartesian to polar coordinates, but not for the visual reflex, which operates entirely in polar coordinates. However, such shared proximity effects in the visual reflex could compensate for known intrinsic limitations that would otherwise compromise performance at near viewing."
https://openalex.org/W1964613403,"Prolonged afferent stimulation of the rat dentate gyrus in vivo leads to degeneration only of those cells that lack immunoreactivity for the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin. In order to test the hypothesis that calcium binding proteins protect against the effects of prolonged stimulation, intracellular recordings were made in hippocampal slices from cells that lack immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Calcium binding protein-negative cells showed electrophysiological signs of deterioration during prolonged stimulation; cells containing calcium binding protein did not. When neurons without calcium binding proteins were impaled with microelectrodes containing the calcium chelator BAPTA, and BAPTA was allowed to diffuse into the cells, these cells showed no deterioration. These results indicate that, in a complex tissue of the central nervous system, an activity-induced increase in intracellular calcium can trigger processes leading to cell deterioration, and that increasing the calcium binding capacity of a cell decreases its vulnerability to damage."

https://openalex.org/W2046850350,"Drosophila fasciclin III is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on a subset of neurons and fasciculating axons in the developing CNS, as well as in several other tissues during development. Here we report on the isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding an 80 kd form of fasciclin III. We have used this cDNA, under heat shock control, to transfect the relatively nonadhesive Drosophila S2 cell line. Examination of these transfected cells indicates that fasciclin III is capable of mediating adhesion in a homophilic, Ca2+-independent manner. Sequence analysis reveals that fasciclin III encodes a transmembrane protein with no significant homology to any known protein, including the previously characterized families of vertebrate cell adhesion molecules. The distribution of this adhesion molecule on subsets of fasciculating axons and growth cones during Drosophila development suggests that fasciclin III plays a role in growth cone guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2048323317,"In the mycelial prokaryote S. coelicolor, whiG is a gene dispensable for growth but needed for the earliest stages of spore formation in aerial hyphae. Nucleotide sequencing indicates that whiG encodes an RNA polymerase σ factor highly similar to the motility σ factor (σ28) of B. subtilis. High copy number of an intact whiG gene caused sporulation in vegetative hyphae that are usually fated to lyse without sporulating. However, the introduction of many copies of a σ28-dependent promoter from B. subtilis into S. coelicolor reduced sporulation, suggesting partial sequestration of the whiG gene product by the foreign promoter sequences. We propose that the level of whiG σ factor is crucial in determining the developmental fate of hyphae."
https://openalex.org/W1499226315,"The 90-kDa heat-shock protein, hsp90, is an abundant cytoplasmic protein that can be phosphorylated in vitro by a double-stranded (ds) DNA-activated protein kinase found in cells from several species. Here we show that the dsDNA-activated protein kinase from human HeLa cells phosphorylates 2 threonine residues in the sequence PEETQTQDQPME at the amino terminus of human hsp90 alpha. Hsp90 beta, which is 97% identical to hsp90 alpha but lacks both amino-terminal threonines, is not phosphorylated by the dsDNA-activated protein kinase. Mouse hsp86 and rabbit hsp90 alpha are homologous to human hsp90 alpha; both heterologous proteins are phosphorylated at the same amino-terminal threonines by the human dsDNA-activated protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1485888367,"Abstract Phosphorylase kinase is a Ca2+-regulated, multisubunit enzyme that contains calmodulin as an integral subunit (termed the delta-subunit). Ca2+-dependent activity of the enzyme is thought to be regulated by direct interaction of the delta-subunit with the catalytic subunit (the gamma-subunit) in the holoenzyme complex. In order to systematically search for putative calmodulin (delta-subunit)-binding domain(s) in the gamma-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, a series of 18 overlapping peptides corresponding to the C terminus of the gamma-subunit was chemically synthesized using a tea bag method. The calmodulin-binding activity of each peptide was tested for its ability to inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase. Data were obtained indicating that two distinct regions in the gamma-subunit, one spanning residues 287-331 (termed domain-N) and the other residues 332-371 (domain-C), are capable of binding calmodulin with nanomolar affinity. Peptides from both of these two domains also inhibited calmodulin-dependent reactivation of denatured gamma-subunit. The interactions of peptides from both domain-N and domain-C with calmodulin were found to be Ca2+-dependent. Dixon plots obtained using mixtures of peptides from domain-N and domain-C indicate that these two domains can bind simultaneously to a single molecule of calmodulin. Multiple contacts between the gamma-subunit and calmodulin (delta-subunit), as indicated by our data, may help to explain why strongly denaturing conditions are required to dissociate these two subunits, whereas complexes of calmodulin with most other target enzymes can be readily dissociated by merely lowering Ca2+ to submicromolar concentrations. Comparison of the sequences of the two calmodulin-binding domains in the gamma-subunit of phosphorylase kinase with corresponding regions in troponin I indicates similarities that may have functional and evolutionary significance."
https://openalex.org/W1514896392,"The vasoactive peptide endothelin 1 (ET1) is encoded by a well characterized gene located on human chromosome 6. Recently, two human genomic fragments were isolated which potentially encode related vasoconstrictor peptides, endothelin 2 (ET2) and endothelin 3 (ET3) (Inoue, A., Yanagisawa, M., Kimura, S., Kasuya, Y., Miyauchi, T., Goto, K., and Masaki, T. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 2863-2867). Inoue et al. were unable to detect transcripts of the ET2 and ET3 genes and observed ET1 gene expression exclusively in endothelial cells. In this study, we document transcription of the ET3 gene by isolating from a hypothalamic cDNA library DNA clones complementary to human ET3 mRNA. ET3 mRNA encodes a 238-amino acid precursor that includes ET3 and a 15-amino acid homologous segment, the ET3-like sequence. On the basis of DNA isolated from human-mouse somatic hybrid cell lines, we assigned the ET3 gene to human chromosome 20. The ET3 and ET1 genes are, therefore, not genetically linked. RNA blot hybridization with restriction fragments derived from cDNAs revealed that the ET3 and ET1 genes are both expressed in lung, pancreas, and spleen. Cultured endothelial cells and cardiac tissues express the ET1 but not the ET3 gene. Observations that genes encoding endothelin-related peptides are expressed in a variety of human tissues suggest that these peptides may participate in complex vasoregulatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1547521803,"Cells generally respond to long-term hyperosmotic stress by accumulating nonperturbing organic osmolytes. Unlike bacteria, in which molecular mechanisms involved in the increased accumulation of osmolytes have been identified, those in multicellular organisms are virtually unknown. In mammals, during antidiuresis, cells of the renal inner medulla are exposed to high and variable extracellular NaCl. Under these conditions, the cells contain a high level of sorbitol and other osmolytes which help balance the high extracellular osmolality. PAP-HT25 is a continuous line of cells derived from rabbit renal inner medulla. When medium osmolality is increased by raising the NaCl concentration, these cells accumulate sorbitol. The sorbitol is synthesized from glucose in a reaction catalyzed by aldose reductase. When the medium is made hyperosmotic, aldose reductase activity increases because of a larger increase in the amount of enzyme. This increase is produced by the accelerated rate of synthesis of aldose reductase protein. The purpose of the present studies was to examine the mechanism of this increase in aldose reductase protein by measuring the relative abundance of aldose reductase mRNA. A cDNA clone coding for rabbit kidney aldose reductase was isolated. Antisense RNA probes transcribed from this clone hybridized specifically with a 1.5-1.6 kilobase mRNA in Northern blots. Cells grown chronically in hyperosmotic medium had a relative abundance of this specific mRNA which was six times that of cells grown in isoosmotic medium. When cells grown in isoosmotic medium were switched to hyperosmotic medium, the level of aldose reductase mRNA peaked (18-fold) at 18-24 h. The induction of aldose reductase mRNA by osmotic stress was reversible. Our finding of increased abundance of a specific mRNA in direct response to hyperosmotic stress represents the first report of such an effect in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2057833663,"We report the characterization of a chromosomal integrin gene that encodes the Drosophila PS2 α subunit. The gene is composed of 12 exons spanning 31 kb. By employing a novel method for directed cDNA cloning, we have analyzed over 300 independent cDNA clones for the existence of alternate RNA products. Two forms of PS2 α mRNA are frequently observed: a canonical (C) form and a form lacking the 75 nucleotide exon 8 (m8). The relative ratio of these two forms varies widely during development. Although region A, derived from exon 8 and the adjacent 25 amino acids, shows weak conservation among the sequences of α subunits that bind to different ligands, it is highly conserved in the homologous PS2 α gene of the distantly related Mediterranean fruitfly. We suggest that the variable region A may be important in determining the specificity and affinity of integrin receptors for their ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1816763520,"Abstract Stimulation of serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells with 20 ng/ml recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB (rPDGF) results in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that is detectable within 10 min and which peaks after 2 h. Inhibition of translation with 36 microM cycloheximide inhibits rPDGF-stimulated PGE2 synthesis (greater than 90%), suggesting that de novo synthesis of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) is required for growth factor stimulation of PGE2 synthesis. Paradoxically, the addition of 10 microM exogenous arachidonate to the serum-starved cells resulted in 2-fold more PGE2 synthesis, and maximal synthesis occurred at 30 min compared to 2 h following rPDGF treatment. These data suggest that the serum-starved cells have ample biosynthetic capacity to support maximal rPDGF-stimulated PGE2 synthesis without de novo enzyme synthesis. Kinetic analysis of PGHS mRNA levels showed that although rPDGF did elevate the steady-state level of PGHS mRNA, the increase occurred after maximal PGE2 synthesis was achieved. Quantification of PGHS levels by immunoblot showed that there was no significant increase in enzyme levels following rPDGF stimulation even under conditions where PGHS mRNA levels were elevated. Irreversible inactivation of PGHS by treatment with aspirin and subsequent stimulation with rPDGF synchronized the maximal elevation of PGHS mRNA levels and PGE2 synthesis; both peaked at 3 h. Interestingly, aspirin pretreatment increased both the rate and amplitude of rPDGF-stimulated PGHS mRNA induction. The enhanced induction was not simply the result of a loss in PGE2 production since treatment with exogenous PGE2 also induced PGHS mRNA levels. Since rPDGF-stimulated PGE2 synthesis is blocked by both transcription and translation inhibitors but arachidonate-stimulated PGE2 synthesis is unaffected, the requirement for protein synthesis does not appear to involve de novo PGHS synthesis. The synthesis of a protein required for coupling of the rPDGF receptor to phospholipase activation and arachidonic acid mobilization is a more likely interpretation. In summary, our data suggest that rPDGF can induce PGHS mRNA levels, but that rPDGF-stimulated PGE2 synthesis is not dependent upon de novo PGHS synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1598348959,"Neutral trehalase was purified from stationary yeast ABYS1 mutant cells deficient in the vacuolar proteinases A and B and the carboxypeptidases Y and S. The purified electrophoretically homogeneous preparation of phosphorylated neutral trehalase exhibited a molecular mass of 160,000 Da on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and of 80,000 Da on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Maximal activity (114 mumol of trehalose min-1 x mg-1 at 37 degrees C) was observed at pH 6.8-7.0. The apparent Km for trehalose was 34.5 mM. Among seven oligosaccharides studied, the enzyme formed glucose only from trehalose. Neutral trehalase is located in the cytosol. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against neutral trehalase precipitates the enzyme in the presence of protein A. The antiserum does not react with acid trehalase. Dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli of the active phosphorylated enzyme is accompanied by greater than or equal to 90% inactivation. Rephosphorylation by incubation with the catalytic subunit of beef heart protein kinase is accompanied by reactivation and incorporation of 0.85 mol of phosphate/mol subunit (80,000 Da). The phosphorylated amino acid residue was identified as phosphoserine."
https://openalex.org/W2042328177,"Gene targeting via homologous recombination-mediated disruption in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells has been described for a number of different genes expressed in these cells; it has not been reported for any nonexpressed genes. Pluripotent stem cell lines were isolated with homologously recombined insertions at three different loci: c-fos, which is expressed at a low level in ES cells, and two genes, adipsin and adipocyte P2 (aP2), which are transcribed specifically in adipose cells and are not expressed at detectable levels in ES cells. The frequencies at which homologous recombination events occurred did not correlate with levels of expression of the targeted genes, but did occur at rates comparable to those previously reported for genes that are actively expressed in ES cells. Injection of successfully targeted cells into mouse blastocysts resulted in the formation of chimeric mice. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of altering genes in ES cells that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the mouse, in order to study their function at later developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W1516929882,"The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 carries out oxygenic photosynthesis analogous to higher plants. Its photosystem I contains seven different polypeptide subunits. The cartridge mutagenesis technique was used to inactivate the psaD gene which encodes subunit II of photosystem I. A mutant strain lacking subunit II was generated by transforming wild type cells with cloned DNA in which psaD gene was interrupted by a gene conferring kanamycin resistance. The photoautotrophic growth of mutant strain is much slower than that of wild type cells. The membranes prepared from mutant cells lack subunit II of photosystem I. Studies on the purified photosystem I reaction center revealed that the complex lacking subunit II is assembled and is functional in P700 photooxidation but at much reduced rate. Therefore, subunit II of photosystem I is required for efficient function of photosystem I."
https://openalex.org/W1597215081,"Abstract In fura-2-loaded bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, 0.5 microM angiotensin II (AII) stimulated a 185 +/- 19 nM increase of intracellular-free calcium [( Ca2+]i) approximately 3 s after addition. The time from the onset of the response until achieving 50% recovery (t 1/2) was 67 +/- 10 s. Concomitantly, AII stimulated both the release of 45Ca2+ from prelabeled cells, and a 4-5-fold increase of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [( 3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3) levels. In the presence of 50 microM LaCl3, or when extracellular-free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]o) was less than 100 nM, AII still rapidly increased [Ca2+]i by 95-135 nM, but the t 1/2 for recovery was then only 23-27 s. In medium with 1 mM MnCl2 present, AII also stimulated a small amount of Mn2+ influx, as judged by quenching of the fura-2 signal. When [Ca2+]o was normal (1.1 mM) or low (less than 60 nM), 1-2 microM ionomycin caused [Ca2+]i to increase 204 +/- 26 nM, while also releasing 45-55% of bound 45Ca2+. With low [Ca2+]o, ionomycin pretreatment abolished both the [Ca2+]i increase and 45Ca2+ release stimulated by AII. However, after ionomycin pretreatment in normal medium, AII produced a La3+-inhibitable increase of [Ca2+]i (103 +/- 13 nM) with a t 1/2 of 89 +/- 8 s, but no 45Ca2+ release. No pretreatment condition altered AII-induced formation of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3. We conclude that AII increased [Ca2+]i via rapid and transient Ca2+ mobilization from Ins(1,4,5)P3- and ionomycin-sensitive stores, accompanied (and/or followed) by Ca2+ entry through a La3+-inhibitable divalent cation pathway. Furthermore, the ability of AII to activate Ca2+ entry in the absence of Ca2+ mobilization (i.e. after ionomycin pretreatment) suggests a receptor-linked stimulus other than Ca2+ mobilization initiates Ca2+ entry."

The sequence of two cDNA clones shows there is alternative splicing in the 5'-coding region which, on conceptual translation, would give rise to two proteins with slightly different amino termini. A partial genomic clone indicates there are four introns in the carboxyl-terminal half of the clone. Two transcripts, 3.8 and 5.3 kilobases long, are expressed at a high level in the heads of adult flies and also in larvae, pupae, and embryos. Hybridization of the cDNA probes to sections of adult flies indicates the RNA is present predominantly in nervous tissue (in the cortex of the brain and the thoracic ganglion); it is also expressed in the ovaries. Transcripts corresponding to both cDNAs are present in the central nervous system, but only one of them is found in detectable levels in the ovaries.

https://openalex.org/W2049761007,"The tyrosine kinase pp60v-src, encoded by the v-src oncogene, seems to regulate phosphatidylinositol metabolism. The effect of pp60v-src on control points in inositol phosphate production was examined by measuring the amounts of inositol polyphosphates in Rat-1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of the protein. Expression of v-src-resulted in a five- to sevenfold elevation in the steady-state amount of an isomer of inositol tetrakisphosphate, whereas the concentrations of inositol trisphosphates or other inositol tetrakisphosphates were not affected. The activity of a key enzyme in the formation of inositol tetrakisphosphates, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate 3-kinase, was increased six- to eightfold in cytosolic extracts prepared from the v-src-transformed cells, suggesting that this enzyme may be one target for the pp60v-src kinase and that it may participate in the synthesis of novel, higher order inositol phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1582485749,"A Drosophila melanogaster gene (dgo) encoding a G protein alpha subunit has been isolated by screening genomic and adult head cDNA libraries using bovine transducin alpha subunit cDNA as probe. The gene, which maps to 47A on the second chromosome, encodes two proteins which are both 354 amino acids long but differ in seven amino acids in the amino-terminal region. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two proteins are 81% identical to that of a rat Go alpha subunit. Analysis of genomic clones revealed that there are eight coding exons and that the putative transcripts for the two proteins differ in the 5'-noncoding regions and the first coding exons but share the remaining six coding exons. The arrangement of two different 5'-noncoding regions on the gene suggests that two different promoters regulate the expression of the transcripts encoding the two proteins. RNA blot analysis detected three transcripts: a 3.9-kilobase (kb) transcript found at all stages of development; a 5.4-kb transcript present predominantly in adult heads; and a 3.4-kb transcript present only in adult bodies. In situ hybridizations of a cDNA probe to adult tissue sections showed that the gene is expressed abundantly in neuronal cell bodies in the brain, optic lobe, and thoracic ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W1500828552,"Bovine seminal plasma contains four similar acidic proteins, previously designated as BSP (bovine seminal plasma)-A1, BSP-A2, BSP-A3, and BSP-30-kDa, that when added to pituitary cell cultures result in the immediate secretion of gonadotropins (follitropin and lutropin). However, when calf or horse serum was included in the culture medium the secretion of gonadotropins was completely prevented. This effect was seen at levels up to 200 micrograms of BSP protein/ml while the presence of more than 200 micrograms of BSP protein/ml in the serum medium continued to release gonadotropins. This could be explained by the presence in the sera of a binding factor to the BSP proteins which prevents their action. This binding factor has been detected in all the sera tested, including human serum, in dot-blot experiments using 125I-labeled BSP-A1, -A2, -A3, or -30-kDa protein. Thus, it was of interest to isolate this binding factor from human serum by affinity chromatography on a column of BSP-A1/-A2-agarose. The purified binding factor was then identified as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) by the following criteria: (a) it has a molecular mass of 27,000 daltons, (b) the amino acid composition is similar to apoA-I, (c) the first 25 residues at the amino-terminal end of this binding factor are identical to apoA-I, and (d) the binding factor cross-reacts in the radioimmunoassay of apoA-I. Furthermore, BSP proteins also bind to purified plasma apoA-I and apoA-I associated with high density lipoprotein. ApoA-I is the major protein of plasma high density lipoprotein and plays an important role in lipid transport and metabolism. Thus, the binding of bovine seminal plasma proteins to apoA-I suggests some physiological significance in lipoprotein function or vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W1565629313,"Digestion of a 42-kDa gelatin-binding fragment (GBF) of fibronectin with pepsin followed by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose produces three fractions, a drop-through non-binding fraction, a retarded fraction that is dominated by a 13-kDa fragment whose NH2 terminus is identical to that of 42-kDa GBF, and a binding fraction that contains a homogeneous fragment of apparent mass 21 kDa with an NH2 terminus corresponding to Arg484. This 21-kDa GBF binds repeatedly to gelatin-Sepharose, eluting near 2.6 M in a urea gradient. It also binds in the fluid phase to a fluorescent-labeled collagen peptide with Kd = 10 microM and inhibits the binding of 42-kDa GBF to the same peptide with KI = 7.3 microM. Thus, major gelatin-binding determinants of fibronectin are located within a 21-kDa region that contains two type I homologous finger modules and is devoid of the type II kringle-like modules that were previously thought to be essential for this activity."
https://openalex.org/W1604557194,"Renal medullary cells are normally exposed to high extracellular NaCl as part of the urinary concentrating mechanism. They react to this stress by accumulating sorbitol and other organic osmolytes. PAP-HT25, a line of epithelial cells derived from rabbit renal inner medulla, expresses this response. In hypertonic medium, these cells accumulate large amounts of sorbitol. There is a large increase in the amount of aldose reductase, which catalyzes production of sorbitol from glucose. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the aldose reductase protein increases because of faster synthesis or slower degradation. We measured the rate of synthesis and degradation of aldose reductase protein by pulse-chase with [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antiserum and autoradiography. The protein synthesis rate was 6 times greater in cells grown in hypertonic (500 mosmol/kg) medium, than in those grown in normal (300 mosmol/kg) medium. When control cells were switched to hypertonic medium, the synthesis rate increased 15-fold by 24 h, then decreased to 11-fold after 48 h. In contrast, synthesis rate continued to increase past 24 h when accumulation of sorbitol was prevented by inhibiting aldose reductase activity with Tolrestat. Thus, there is a feedback mechanism by which cellular sorbitol accumulation inhibits aldose reductase protein synthesis. Degradation of aldose reductase protein was slow (only about 25% in 3 days) and was not affected by osmolality. Thus, the osmoregulatory increase in aldose reductase protein is due to an increase in its synthesis rate and not to any change in its degradation."

https://openalex.org/W1606142823,"Abstract Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) mediates its in vivo antineoplastic effect primarily through its action on the endothelial surfaces of tumor vessels. Among other changes, endothelial cells increase the expression of surface procoagulant molecules which allow for the genesis of microthrombi and the eventual anoxic killing of the tumor tissue. TNF is also a potent antimitotic factor for endothelial cells. We investigated the molecular basis for these diverse actions of TNF by differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from TNF and cycloheximide-treated human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells. One of the cDNA clones identified encodes the transcription factor and proto-oncogene AP-1/c-jun. The expression of AP-1/c-jun following TNF treatment is mediated largely at the transcriptional level. Neither c-myc nor c-fos transcripts were induced by TNF. Since AP-1/c-jun has been previously identified as one of the earliest transcripts expressed in quiescent cells that have been stimulated by growth factors, our results suggest that mitogenic and antimitogenic stimuli evoke distinct yet overlapping sets of molecular responses and that the coordinate expression of AP-1/c-jun and c-fos is not mandatory. AP-1/c-jun transcript induction is thus one of the initial events mediated by TNF treatment of HUVE cells."

Chem. 263, 18965-18971), and Krev-1 protein (Kitayama, H., Sugimoto, Y., Matsuzaki, T., Ikawa, Y., and Noda, M. (1989) Cell 56, 77-84). The partial amino acid sequence analysis of c25KG revealed that this protein was different from any low Mr GTP-binding proteins already reported. c25KG bound about 1 mol of [35S] guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)/mol of protein, with a Kd value of about 45 nM. [35S]GTP gamma S-binding to c25KG was specifically inhibited by guanine nucleotides, GTP and GDP, but not by adenine nucleotides such as ATP and adenyl-5'-yl beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate. The binding activity was not inhibited by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide. c25KG hydrolyzed GTP to librate Pi with the specific activity of 1.8 mmol of Pi/mol of protein/min, which are different from the activities of the already purified low Mr GTP-binding proteins. We conclude that c25KG is a novel GTP-binding protein and c21KG is a rap1/smg p21/Krev-1 product."
https://openalex.org/W1511946771,"Abstract 32-Oxo-24,25-dihydrolanosterol (32-oxo-DHL) was deformylated to 4,4-dimethylcholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol, the product of 14 alpha-demethylation of 24,25-dihydro-lanosterol (DHL), by the reconstituted lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase system consisting of cytochrome P-45014DM and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase of yeast. Affinity of 32-oxo-DHL to the cytochrome was considerably higher than those of lanosterol and DHL, and the rate of deformylation of 32-oxo-DHL was faster than the rate of demethylation of lanosterol and DHL. Spectral analysis of the 32-oxo-DHL complex of cytochrome P-45014DM suggested the interaction between the 32-aldehyde group and the heme iron. These observations, together with our preceding findings on the metabolism of 32-hydroxy-24,25-dihydrolanosterol (Aoyama, Y., Yoshida, Y., Sonoda, Y., and Sato, Y. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1239-1243), indicate that the 14 alpha-demethylation of lanosterol catalyzed by cytochrome P-45014DM proceeds with three step monooxygenations via the 32-hydroxy and 32-oxo intermediates, and the cytochrome mediates this sequential reaction without releasing the intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W1590051283,"Abstract Microsomes of seminal vesicles of the cynomolgus monkey were incubated with [14C]5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic (arachidonic) acid and NADPH for 40 min at 37 degrees C and the products were characterized. Prostaglandins F2 alpha and E2 were the two main metabolites (approximately 52% of radioactivity), while 18(R)-hydroxy-cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (18(R)-HETE) was identified as the main, less polar product (approximately 13%). Significant biosynthesis of the 19-hydroxy or 20-hydroxy metabolites of arachidonic acid could not be detected. The formation of 18(R)-HETE was further investigated in the presence of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, diclofenac sodium. The omega 3-hydroxylation was only partly supported by substituting NADH for NADPH. The hydroxyl oxygen of 18(R)-HETE was derived from the atmosphere and the omega 3-hydroxylation was inhibited by proadifen and partly inhibited by carbon monoxide. These findings suggest that 18(R)-HETE is formed by a cytochrome P-450 (P-450 omega 3). Linoleic acid and 8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid were also substrates of the enzyme, but stearic acid was not metabolized. 5,8,11,14,17-Eicosatetraenoic acid was oxygenated under these conditions mainly to 17,18-dihydroxy-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, presumably formed from 17(18)-epoxy-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid by hydrolysis. The seminal microsomes thus seem to possess both omega 3-hydroxylase and omega 3-epoxygenase activity. These seminal vesicles also contain prostaglandin E 19-hydroxylase (Oliw, E.H., Kinn, A.-C., and Kvist, U. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7222-7227). The presence of arachidonate omega 3-hydroxylase and prostaglandin E 19-hydroxylase was assessed in microsomes of adult and juvenile monkey livers. Arachidonic acid was metabolized extensively to diols (via epoxides), but 18-HETE could not be detected. In contrast, prostaglandin E1 was slowly hydroxylated mainly to 19-hydroxyprostaglandin E1 by both adult male and female juvenile hepatic microsomes. The results indicate that P-450 omega 3 of seminal vesicles might be a tissue-specific enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1500461544,"The Mucor rennin gene encoding a prepro-form of the fungal aspartic proteinase from Mucor pusillus was expressed under the control of the yeast GAL7 promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An inactive zymogen of the enzyme with the 44-amino-acid pro-sequence was identified in the medium during the initial stage of cultivation. Processing of the purified zymogen to the mature enzyme proceeded autocatalytically under the acidic conditions. The rate of processing was accelerated by an increase in the concentration of the zymogen or addition of the mature enzyme. The in vitro processing was inhibited by inhibitors for the aspartic proteinases. The zymogen with no proteinase activity due to a mutation at the active site residue, Asp, was still processed at a relatively slower rate in a wild-type strain of yeast, but no processing occurred in the pep4-3 mutant strain of S. cerevisiae deficient in yeast proteinase A. Thus, Mucor rennin is excreted in a form of zymogen, which is then processed in the yeast secretion pathway mainly by the autocatalytic proteolysis but, alternatively, by a proteinase of yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1606268460,"Abstract Human neutrophils were fractionated on Percoll gradients and the various subcellular fractions were analyzed for phospholipid and fatty acid composition. The results showed that plasma membranes and azurophilic granules were enriched with ethanolamine-(PE) relative to choline-(PC) containing phosphoglycerides. A remarkable degree of uniformity existed throughout the gradient with respect to the subclass composition of the subcellular PC and PE components. In each fraction 50-60% of the PC was diacyl, 40-45% was 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl (ether linked), and 2-5% was 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl (plasmalogenic). For PE, 20-25% was diacyl, 7-12% ether linked, and 64-76% plasmalogenic. When neutrophils were incubated for 15 min with [1-14C]arachidonic acid and subfractionated most of the PC-associated label was intracellularly localized. A similar result was observed in PE, however, when the cells were allowed to stand for 2 h in fatty acid-free buffer following the 15 min of labeling and then subfractionated there was a sizable migration of [14C]arachidonate into plasma membrane PE. In all cases the diacyl subclass was labeled most heavily after 15 min but after an additional 2 h of incubation in fatty acid-free buffer there was a direct transfer of label to the ether- and plasmalogenic-linked PC and PE subclasses. It was also found that arachidonoyl-coenzyme A 1-acyl-lysophosphatide acyltransferase activity was inherent in all three major membrane types but was enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum/secondary granule fraction. Arachidonate consistently accounted for roughly 5% of the PC and 17% of the PE fatty chain composition in each subcellular fraction. These findings demonstrate that, despite the uniform arachidonate and PC and PE subclass composition within the various neutrophil subcellular fractions, the bulk of the PC- and PE-associated arachidonate is localized in intracellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1486187785,"An unusual fumarate reductase was purified from cell extracts of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and partially characterized. Two coenzymes previously isolated from cell extracts, 2-mercaptoethane-sulfonic acid (HS-CoM) and N-(7-mercaptoheptanoyl)threonine-O3-phosphate (HS-HTP), were established as direct electron donors for fumarate reductase. By measuring the consumption of free thiol, we determined that fumarate reductase catalyzed the oxidation of HS-CoM and HS-HTP; by the direct measurement of succinate and the heterodisulfide of HS-CoM and HS-HTP (CoM-S-S-HTP), we established that these compounds were products of the fumarate reductase reaction. A number of thiol-containing compounds did not function as substrates for fumarate reductase, but this enzyme had high specific activity when HS-CoM and HS-HTP were used as electron donors. HS-CoM and HS-HTP were quantitatively oxidized by the fumarate reductase reaction, and results indicated that this reaction was irreversible. Additionally, by measuring formylmethanofuran, we demonstrated that the addition of fumarate to cell extracts activated CO2 fixation for the formation of formylmethanofuran. Results indicated that this activation resulted from the production of CoM-S-S-HTP (a compound known to be involved in the activation of formylmethanofuran synthesis) by the fumarate reductase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1537115614,"Abstract A series of N-terminal deletions of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the HEM1 product, delta-aminolevulinate synthase, was constructed. Targeting ability of mutant signals was assayed in vivo by fusion to beta-galactosidase or to the mature delta-aminolevulinate synthase. In the former case, the subcellular location of the fusion proteins provided a measure of import efficiency. In the later case, constructs were tested for complementation of delta hem 1 strains. We found this complementation assay to be particularly sensitive if the delta hem 1 strain is rho-. The results of these experiments, together with experiments deleting the signal from the carboxyl end, indicate that the targeting information is encoded in non-overlapping regions of the HEM1 signal."
https://openalex.org/W1591836921,"Abstract We have investigated the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase in skeletal muscle. Rat epitrochlearis muscles were incubated in vitro with 32Pi to label cellular phosphoproteins, before being treated with hormones. Phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen synthase were immunoprecipitated under conditions that prevented changes in their phosphorylation states. Based on measurements of the activity ratio (-AMP/+AMP) and the 32P content of phosphorylase, 4-8% of the phosphorylase in untreated muscles appeared to be phosphorylated. Epinephrine promoted increases of approximately 4-fold in the 32P content and activity ratio. Neither these effects nor the epinephrine-stimulated increases in phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase kinase were attenuated by insulin. However, insulin at physiological concentrations rapidly decreased the 32P content of phosphorylase in muscles incubated without epinephrine. Results from peptide mapping experiments indicate that phosphorylase was phosphorylated at a single site in both control and insulin on phosphorylase represented a decrease in 32P of approximately 50%. By comparison, the 32P content of glycogen synthase and the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase were decreased by only 20 and 16%, respectively; the 32P content of the kinase alpha subunit was not affected by insulin. The results provide direct evidence that insulin decreases the amount of phosphate in phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase. These findings have important implications with respect to both the regulation of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle and the mechanism of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1530196561,"Abstract Bovine lens aldose reductase (alditol:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.21) undergoes an oxidative modification, greatly stimulated by high ionic strength, upon incubation in the presence of oxygen radical generating systems (Del Corso, A., Camici, M., and Mura, U. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 148, 369-375). The enzyme modification is accompanied by a change in stereospecificity toward the two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde. In particular, the Km for L-glyceraldehyde of the native form increased over 150 times after the enzyme modification, with a decrease in the catalytic efficiency of over 200 times. By contrast, for the D-enantiomer the Km increased only 7 times with respect to the native form, with a concomitant decrease in the catalytic efficiency of only approximately 3 times. This dramatic change in stereospecificity may account for the reported apparent cooperative behavior exhibited also by highly purified electrophoretically homogeneous preparations of aldose reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1538435434,"Abstract The chromosomal protein MC1 of Methanothrix soehngenii is a family of three variants a, b, and c. These are small basic polypeptides of 89, 87, and 90 residues, respectively. Their primary structures have been determined from automated sequence analyses of the intact proteins and from structural data provided by peptides derived from the variants by cleavage at aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, and methionine residues. By comparison with variant b taken as reference, variants a and c present 18 and 24 differences, respectively. The extent of sequence homologies between protein MC1 from M. soehngenii and proteins MC1 from two other species of Methanosarcinaceae is only 60%. The sequences 17-35 and 45-58 of the protein MC1 appear well conserved. Deletions are observed in region 36-44. Many changes, most of them nonconservative, occur in the carboxyl-terminal third of the protein. However, proline residues at positions 68, 72, 76, and 82 remain strictly conserved. Predictive methods for secondary structures indicate a low content of alpha helix and beta sheet structures in proteins MC1."
https://openalex.org/W1520354388,"The tryptophan repressor regulates expression of the aroH, trpEDCBA, and trpR operons in Escherichia coli. The protein contains no cysteine residues, and the presence of this reactive side chain would allow introduction of spectral probes to monitor binding reactions. Three mutant trp aporepressors, each with a point mutation from serine to cysteine, were produced at positions 67, 86, and 88 by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. This single conservative substitution affected both tryptophan and operator DNA affinities in all three purified proteins. Cysteine substitution for serine at position 67 decreased tryptophan binding by approximately 6-fold and the operator DNA affinity by approximately 50-fold. The proximity of this amino acid to Gln-68 which is involved in binding to operator DNA (Otwinowski, Z., Schevitz, R. W., Zhang, R.-G., Lawson, C. L., Joachimiak, A., Marmorstein, R. Q., Luisi, B. F., and Sigler, P. B. (1988) Nature 335, 321-329) may account for this effect. Substitution at position 86 diminished tryptophan binding by approximately 4-fold and operator DNA binding by approximately 130-fold. The participation of Ser-86 in the hydrogen bond network required for operator binding (Otwinowski, Z., Schevitz, R. W., Zhang, R.-G., Lawson, C. L., Joachimiak, A., Marmorstein, R. Q., Luisi, B. F., and Sigler, P. B. (1988) Nature 335, 321-329) presumably accounts for the DNA binding effects. The diminished corepressor activity in these two mutants may derive from distortions of the binding region, as the tryptophan and DNA binding sites are intimately related. The mutation at position 88 altered tryptophan binding the most of the three mutants (approximately 18-fold) and operator binding least (approximately 12-fold). Ser-88 forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group of bound tryptophan (Schevitz, R. W., Otwinowski, Z., Joachimiak, A., Lawson, C. L., and Sigler, P. B. (1985) Nature 317, 782-786), and alteration of the geometry of the side chain would be anticipated to perturb the topology of the binding site. The diminished operator affinity may derive from improper alignment of the tryptophan ligand, crucial for high affinity operator binding (Otwinowski, Z., Schevitz, R. W., Zhang, R.-G., Lawson, C. L., Joachimiak, A., Marmorstein, R. Q., Luisi, B. F., and Sigler, P. B. (1988) Nature 335, 321-329).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W68711788,The rate of benzylamine utilization by monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B from human blood platelets was 2-4 times higher than that for octopamine. Both activities were inhibited 100% by 10(-7) M deprenyl (a specific MAO-B inhibitor) and were not affected by clorgyline (a specific MAO-A inhibitor) or by polyclonal antibodies to MAO-A. The preincubation of platelet MAO-B with purified MAO-A from mitochondrial membranes of human placenta resulted in appearance of excess octopamine activity. This additional activity was not precipitated by antibodies to MAO-A or inhibited by deprenyl but was inhibited by clorgyline. Incubation of the MAO-A preparation from placenta at 45 degrees C for 15 min before its preincubation with MAO-B caused 50% loss of both activities. Protease inhibitors had no effect on the modification of MAO. These data indicate that MAO-A or a factor tightly bound to it can modify MAO-B yielding a form of the enzyme with both MAO-A and MAO-B substrate and inhibitor affinities and MAO-B immunospecificity.
