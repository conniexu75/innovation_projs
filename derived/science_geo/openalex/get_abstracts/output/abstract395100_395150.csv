Here, we show that the apical complex protein Pals1 and Pten have opposing roles in localizing the Igf1R to the apical, ventricular domain of cerebral cortical progenitor cells. We found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which contacts this apical domain, has an age-dependent effect on proliferation, much of which is attributable to Igf2, but that CSF contains other signaling activities as well. CSF samples from patients with glioblastoma multiforme show elevated Igf2 and stimulate stem cell proliferation in an Igf2-dependent manner. Together, our findings demonstrate that the apical complex couples intrinsic and extrinsic signaling, enabling progenitors to sense and respond appropriately to diffusible CSF-borne signals distributed widely throughout the brain. The temporal control of CSF composition may have critical relevance to normal development and neuropathological conditions.

Embryonic CSF distributes many factors to the developing brain CSF Igf2 binds to progenitors and stimulates their proliferation Pals1 and Pten regulate Igf1 receptor expression Igf2 in glioblastoma CSF regulates progenitor proliferation and disease state Neural development involves a dynamic interplay between cell autonomous and diffusible extracellular signals that regulate symmetric and asymmetric division of progenitor cells (Johansson et al., 2010Johansson P.A. Cappello S. Gotz M. Stem cell niches during development - lessons from the cerebral cortex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 1-8Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In mammalian neural progenitors, homologs of C. elegans and Drosophila polarity proteins, including Par3 (partitioning defective protein 3) and Pals1 (protein associated with Lin 7), assemble as apical complexes that play essential roles in regulating self-renewal and cell fate (Margolis and Borg, 2005Margolis B. Borg J.P. Apicobasal polarity complexes.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5157-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The unequal distribution of apical surface components during mitosis is a key determinant of daughter cell fate in C. elegans and Drosophila (Fishell and Kriegstein, 2003Fishell G. Kriegstein A.R.

Molecular control of cell polarity and asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neuroblasts.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, mammalian Par3 was shown to promote asymmetric cell division by specifying differential Notch signaling in radial glial daughter cells (Bultje et al., 2009Bultje R.S.

Secreted signals can act at a distance to guide decisions governing progenitor proliferation and cell fate (Johansson et al., 2010Johansson P.A. Cappello S. Gotz M. Stem cell niches during development - lessons from the cerebral cortex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 1-8Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but little is known of how secreted signals interact with cell-autonomous ones. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) promotes progenitor proliferation (Hodge et al., 2004Hodge R.D. D'Ercole A.J. O'Kusky J.R.

Indeed, disrupting the apical complex via Pals1 leads to attenuated pS6 signaling, premature cell cycle exit, and rapid cell death, resulting in the absence of nearly the entire cerebral cortex (Kim et al., 2010Kim S. Lehtinen M.K. Sessa A. Zappaterra M.W. Cho S.H. Gonzalez D. Boggan B. Austin C.A. Wijnholds J.

In turn, Pals1-deficiency can be partially rescued by concomitant activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (Kim et al., 2010Kim S. Lehtinen M.K. Sessa A. Zappaterra M.W. Cho S.H.

Growth factor signaling, in particular via the type 1 Igf receptor (Igf1R), mediates powerful, age-dependent effects on the development and maintenance of many organ systems including the brain through the regulation of progenitor cell division (Baker et al., 1993Baker J.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms coordinating the availability of Igf ligands to cortical progenitor cells have remained unclear. Though vascular sources of secreted proliferative signals are well characterized (Palmer et al., 2000Palmer T.D. Willhoite A.R. Gage F.H. Vascular niche for adult hippocampal neurogenesis.J. Comp.

The CSF proteome shows a complex and dynamic pattern of protein expression (Dziegielewska et al., 1981Dziegielewska K.M. Evans C.A. Lai P.C. Lorscheider F.L. Malinowska D.H. Møllgård K. Saunders N.R.

The CSF has recently been implicated in carrying secreted proteins in several contexts, including Fgf2 to midbrain progenitors (Martín et al., 2006Martín C. Bueno D. Alonso M.I. Moro J.A. Callejo S.

Rubenstein J.L. et al.New neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain.Science. 2006; 311: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Regulation of cerebral cortical progenitor cells by growth factors distributed in the lateral ventricular CSF would provide potentially global control over cerebral cortical neurogenesis, but this hypothesis has not been examined. Here, we show that the apical complex couples autonomous regulation of progenitor proliferation to CSF-borne signals in the developing cerebral cortex. Pals1 and Pten interact genetically to regulate cerebral cortical size and progenitor proliferation and have opposing roles in localizing the Igf1R to the apical domain of cortical progenitors. Apically localized Igf1Rs respond to CSF-borne Igf ligands, particularly Igf2, and CSF regulates cortical progenitor proliferation in an Igf2-dependent fashion. Finally, CSF Igf2 concentration is elevated in patients with malignant glioblastoma, suggesting that CSF proteins may regulate CNS tumorigenesis. Our findings suggest that the apical complex couples autonomous and extrinsic signaling in cerebral cortical progenitors, enabling these cells to respond appropriately to diffusible CSF-borne signals that regulate cortical neural stem cells during development and disease. Since Pals1 loss disrupts growth factor signaling and cortical development (Kim et al., 2010Kim S. Lehtinen M.K. Sessa A. Zappaterra M.W. Cho S.H. Gonzalez D. Boggan B. Austin C.A. Wijnholds J. Gambello M.J. et al.The apical complex couples cell fate and cell survival to cerebral cortical development.Neuron. 2010; 66: 69-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we looked for potential interactions of Pals1 with other regulators of growth factor signaling and found genetic interactions between Pals1 and Pten (Groszer et al., 2001Groszer M.

Negative regulation of neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation by the Pten tumor suppressor gene in vivo.Science. 2001; 294: 2186-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Cerebral cortex-specific deletion of Pals1 was achieved by crossing mice with a conditional Pals1 allele (Pals1loxP/loxP) (Kim et al., 2010Kim S. Lehtinen M.K. Sessa A. Zappaterra M.W. Cho S.H.

Talley T. Qiu M. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Jones K.R. Cortical excitatory neurons and glia, but not GABAergic neurons, are produced in the Emx1-expressing lineage.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6309-6314PubMed Google Scholar). Pals1loxP/loxP/Emx1Cre+/− mice lacked nearly the entire cortical structure due to premature cell cycle exit and cell death (Kim et al., 2010Kim S. Lehtinen M.K. Sessa A. Zappaterra M.W. Cho S.H. Gonzalez D. Boggan B. Austin C.A. Wijnholds J.

In contrast, Pten deficiency, obtained by crossing PtenloxP/loxP mice (Groszer et al., 2001Groszer M. Erickson R. Scripture-Adams D.D. Lesche R. Trumpp A. Zack J.A. Kornblum H.I. Liu X. Wu H. Negative regulation of neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation by the Pten tumor suppressor gene in vivo.Science. 2001; 294: 2186-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) with either Emx1Cre+/− or NestinCre+/− mice, resulted in cortical hyperplasia arising from excessive and extended proliferation of apical progenitors (Figure 1A; see Figures S1A–S1E available online; Groszer et al., 2001Groszer M. Erickson R. Scripture-Adams D.D. Lesche R. Trumpp A. Zack J.A. Kornblum H.I. Liu X. Wu H. Negative regulation of neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation by the Pten tumor suppressor gene in vivo.Science. 2001; 294: 2186-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). While the broadest groupings of cells were preserved in Pten mutants, the cortical plate was disorganized across its entire radial extent (Figures S1A–S1C). No phenotypic abnormalities were observed in either heterozygous PtenloxP/+/NestinCre+/− mice or in PtenloxP/loxP/NestinCre−/− littermate controls (Figure S1A and data not shown). Conditional deletion of Pten in the Pals1loxP/+/Emx1Cre+/− mice resulted in an almost normal cortical size (Figure 1A). Histological analyses of Pals1loxP/+/Emx1Cre+/− mice or PtenloxP/+/Pals1loxP/+/Emx1Cre+/− mice revealed a severely disrupted laminar organization of the dorsomedial cortex (Figure 1B; Kim et al., 2010Kim S.

Double mutants showed a relatively normal organization of the marginal zone (Figure 1B), consistent with a genetic interaction between the apical complex and Pten. The expression of apical complex components, especially Cdc42, were abnormal in Pten cortex (Figure S1F and data not shown). The proportion of proliferative progenitor cells marked by Ki67-positive staining cells was greater in the double mutant cortex compared to conditional Pals1 heterozygotes (Figure 1C) and brain size was also more normal by embryonic day (E) 14.5 (Figures S1G and S1H). Proportions of early-born neurons marked by Tbr1 and Ctip2 were also more normal in the PtenloxP/loxP/Pals1loxP/+/Emx1Cre+/− mice than in either Pals1 or Pten mutants alone (Figure 1D and data not shown). However, cells in the double mutant brain appeared irregular in size and lamination (Figure 1D), a finding consistent with roles for Pten in the regulation of cell size and polarity (Figure S1C; Chalhoub et al., 2009Chalhoub N.

The genetic interaction between Pals1 and Pten and the decreased proliferation of progenitors and prominent cell death in Pals1 mutants (Kim et al., 2010Kim S. Lehtinen M.K. Sessa A. Zappaterra M.W. Cho S.H. Gonzalez D. Boggan B. Austin C.A. Wijnholds J.

Rio C. et al.Insulin receptor substrate-2 deficiency impairs brain growth and promotes tau phosphorylation.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7084-7092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Igf1R, which binds both Igf1 and Igf2, mediates the proliferative response to Igf signaling (Weber et al., 1992Weber M.M. Melmed S. Rosenbloom J. Yamasaki H. Prager D. Rat somatotroph insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) signaling: role of the IGF-I receptor.Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2147-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Igf1R was enriched in cortical progenitors at the apical, ventricular surface, interdigitating with β-catenin (Figures 2A–2D ), suggesting the apical region as the likely site for binding of Igf1R ligand. Apical Igf1R expression was strikingly decreased in Pals1loxP/loxP/Emx1Cre+/− mice (Figure 2E). By contrast in the absence of Pten, Igf1R immunoreactivity demonstrated a considerable basolateral spread in clusters of radial glia (Figure 2F and data not shown). Analyses of downstream signaling events, using a specific antibody against the phosphorylated form of Rsk substrate S6 ribosomal protein (phospho-S6rp), revealed an apical pattern of activity within control brains (Figure 2G). In contrast in Pten mutants, phospho-S6rp showed a broad distribution across the cortical tissue, with many robust phospho-S6rp-positive cells extending basally away from the lateral ventricle (Figure 2G). While the majority of cells positive for Igf1R were clearly apical progenitors, some upregulation of Igf1R in basal progenitors is possible. Though we cannot rule out that Pals1 and Pten could function independently to regulate Igf signaling and cortical growth, we interpret our data to suggest that within the cortical ventricular zone, Pals1 and Pten spatially restrict IgfR expression and Igf signaling to the apical membrane domain. Loss and gain of Igf signaling in mutant mice produced phenotypes similar to those seen when apical complex signaling is disrupted. Mice with Igf1R deficiency limited to neural precursors (Igf1RloxP/loxP/NestinCre+/−) were microcephalic (Figure 2H–2J; Kappeler et al., 2008Kappeler L. De Magalhaes Filho C. Dupont J. Leneuve P.

We did not observe differences in progenitor cell survival at the ventricular zone in these mice as assessed by cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) immunoreactivity (data not shown). Conversely, mice with increased Igf activity (Igf1 expressed from the human GFAP promoter) were macrocephalic (data not shown) (Ye et al., 2004Ye P. Popken G.J. Kemper A. McCarthy K. Popko B.

Together with published work demonstrating that Insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) deletion leads to microcephaly (Schubert et al., 2003Schubert M. Brazil D.P. Burks D.J. Kushner J.A. Ye J. Flint C.L. Farhang-Fallah J. Dikkes P. Warot X.M. Rio C. et al.Insulin receptor substrate-2 deficiency impairs brain growth and promotes tau phosphorylation.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7084-7092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggest that Igf signaling in cortical progenitors, facilitated at the apical surface via Pals1 and an intact apical complex, regulates cortical development. The normal apical localization of the Igf1R, and the fact that we did not observe Igf1 or Igf2 mRNA in neural progenitor cells by in situ hybridization (Figures 3A, 3B , and data not shown; Ayer-le Lievre et al., 1991Ayer-le Lievre C.

We confirmed the presence of Igf2 in an unbiased tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of CSF (Table S1; Binoux et al., 1986Binoux M. Lassarre C. Gourmelen M.

Igf1 expression in the CSF remained stable across the ages sampled (see above). In contrast, expression of Igf2 in rat CSF was temporally dynamic; it peaked during periods of neurogenesis and declined in adulthood (Figure 3C). High levels of Igf2 mRNA expression by the choroid plexus suggested this as a source of CSF Igf2 (Figure 3B), and quantitative PCR revealed that rat choroid plexus expressed 10.7-fold more Igf2 than its cortical counterpart at E17 (data not shown). We confirmed that Igf2 mRNA was also expressed in vascular endothelial cells, and leptomeninges in the rat embryo at E14 and E17 as well as pericytes at E17 (Figures 3A, 3B, and data not shown; Bondy et al., 1992Bondy C.

Immunogold labeling revealed Igf2 binding to progenitors along the apical, ventricular surface (Figure 3D).

We employed a new, parallel, compound-centric approach to identify a potent and selective LRRK2 inhibitor, LRRK2-IN-1, and demonstrated that inhibition of LRRK2 induces dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 and accumulation of LRRK2 within aggregate structures.

https://openalex.org/W2020381478,"Studies have suggested that CMV infection may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and mortality. However, there have been no large-scale examinations of these relationships among demographically diverse populations. The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) is also linked with CVD outcomes and mortality and may play an important role in the pathway between CMV and mortality. We utilized a U.S. nationally representative study to examine whether CMV infection is associated with all-cause and CVD-related mortality. We also assessed whether CRP level mediated or modified these relationships.Data come from subjects ≥ 25 years of age who were tested for CMV and CRP level and were eligible for mortality follow-up on December 31(st), 2006 (N = 14153) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988-1994). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause and CVD-related mortality by CMV serostatus. After adjusting for multiple confounders, CMV seropositivity remained statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.41). The association between CMV and CVD-related mortality did not achieve statistical significance after confounder adjustment. CRP did not mediate these associations. However, CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP levels showed a 30.1% higher risk for all-cause mortality and 29.5% higher risk for CVD-related mortality compared to CMV seropositive individuals with low CRP levels.CMV was associated with a significant increased risk for all-cause mortality and CMV seropositive subjects who also had high CRP levels were at substantially higher risk for both for all-cause and CVD-related mortality than subjects with low CRP levels. Future work should target the mechanisms by which CMV infection and low-level inflammation interact to yield significant impact on mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2145935269,"Cortical pyramidal neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs arriving at different dendritic locations with varying degrees of temporal synchrony. It is not known if different locations along single cortical dendrites integrate excitatory inputs in different ways. Here we have used two-photon glutamate uncaging and compartmental modeling to reveal a gradient of nonlinear synaptic integration in basal and apical oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Excitatory inputs to the proximal dendrite sum linearly and require precise temporal coincidence for effective summation, whereas distal inputs are amplified with high gain and integrated over broader time windows. This allows distal inputs to overcome their electrotonic disadvantage, and become surprisingly more effective than proximal inputs at influencing action potential output. Thus, single dendritic branches can already exhibit nonuniform synaptic integration, with the computational strategy shifting from temporal coding to rate coding along the dendrite."

The trehalose mycolyltransesterase enzymes (antigens 85A, 85B and 85C (Ag85A, Ag85B, Ag85C)) serve as essential mediators of cell envelope function and biogenesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Through the construction of a systematically varied sugar library, we show here that Ag85 enzymes have exceptionally broad substrate specificity. This allowed exogenously added synthetic probes to be specifically incorporated into M. tuberculosis growing in vitro and within macrophages. Even bulky substituents, such as a fluorescein-containing trehalose probe (FITC-trehalose), were incorporated by growing bacilli, thereby producing fluorescent bacteria; microscopy revealed selective labeling of poles and membrane. Addition of FITC-trehalose to M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages allowed selective, sensitive detection of M. tuberculosis within infected mammalian macrophages. These studies suggest that analogs of trehalose may prove useful as probes of function and for other imaging modalities."

The targeting of mRNAs to dendrites requires the recognition of cis dendritic targeting elements (DTEs) by trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), usually as part of a larger complex of ribonuclear proteins known as an RNA granule (Elvira et al., 2006Elvira G.

Dendritic localization of rat vasopressin mRNA: Ultrastructural analysis and mapping of targeting elements.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DTEs are almost exclusively found in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs and do not share an obvious consensus sequence (Andreassi and Riccio, 2009Andreassi C. Riccio A. To localize or not to localize: mRNA fate is in 3′UTR ends.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The dearth of known DTEs for the many other localized RNAs (Eberwine et al., 2002Eberwine J. Belt B. Kacharmina J.E. Miyashiro K. Analysis of subcellularly localized mRNAs using in situ hybridization, mRNA amplification, and expression profiling.Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1065-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggests that targeting signals may be transiently associated with the transcript, perhaps as a sequence or structure element that can be removed subsequent to localization. Introns are known to harbor various regulatory elements, though most of these are presumed to be relevant only for processes occurring inside the nucleus, such as splicing. Intron-containing sequences in the cytoplasm are presumed destined for nonsense-mediated decay. However, recent studies indicate that retention of specific intronic, nonprotein-coding sequences within cytoplasmic mRNA (cytoplasmic intron sequence-retaining transcripts, CIRTs) in mammalian neurons and other cells plays a role in producing functional proteins. The neuronal CIRT KCNMA1i16 contributes to the firing properties of hippocampal neurons and proper channel protein localization to dendrites (Bell et al., 2008Bell T.J. Miyashiro K.Y. Sul J.Y. McCullough R. Buckley P.T. Jochems J. Meaney D.F. Haydon P. Cantor C. Parsons T.D. Eberwine J.

USA. 2008; 105: 1901-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intron retention within IL1-β mRNA in anucleate platelets has been implicated in governing activity-dependent splicing and translation upon cell activation (Denis et al., 2005Denis M.M. Tolley N.D.

Finally, a retained intron in Tap mRNA contains a transport element that drives nuclear export in human 293T cells, facilitating expression of an alternate Tap protein product (Li et al., 2006Li Y. Bor Y.C. Misawa Y. Xue Y. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. An intron with a constitutive transport element is retained in a Tap messenger RNA.Nature. 2006; 443: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we report that retention of intronic sequence can mediate dendritic localization in neuronal transcripts that contain a specific DTE that arose from neofunctionalization of ID elements, a class of short interspersed repetitive elements (SINE) derived from BC1 RNA, a rodent-specific dendritically localized noncoding RNA (Kim et al., 1994Kim J. Martignetti J.A. Shen M.R. Brosius J. Deininger P. Rodent BC1 RNA gene as a master gene for ID element amplification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 3607-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We identified a large and diverse group of dendritically localized CIRTs by microarray and Illumina sequencing of mRNA from isolated dendrites and in situ hybridization. Computational analysis of the retained intron sequence revealed the enrichment of ID elements. Individual intronic ID elements from different genes were cloned, exogenously expressed in primary neurons, and shown by in situ hybridization to be capable of targeting mRNA to dendrites. Normal dendritic localization of ID-containing transcripts is disrupted when ID-containing transgenes compete for the dendritic targeting machinery, thus showing that ID-mediated localization is an endogenous mechanism. Our findings represent an example of a general dendritic targeting mechanism for multiple transcripts from different genes. To determine whether CIRTs are present in dendritic mRNA populations, we focused on a set of 33 candidate genes with mRNA previously found to localize to dendrites in rat (Eberwine et al., 2002Eberwine J. Belt B. Kacharmina J.E. Miyashiro K. Analysis of subcellularly localized mRNAs using in situ hybridization, mRNA amplification, and expression profiling.Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1065-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Three batches of dendritic mRNA, each consisting of 150–300 individually dissected dendrites from primary rat hippocampal neurons, were independently aRNA amplified (Miyashiro et al., 1994Miyashiro K. Dichter M. Eberwine J. On the nature and differential distribution of mRNAs in hippocampal neurites: Implications for neuronal functioning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 10800-10804Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and analyzed by using a custom-built microarray consisting of probes generated from the 5′ ends of selected introns from each gene of interest. Three additional batches were subjected to Illumina NextGen sequencing. Sequencing allows us to recover minor, variably expressed CIRTs in the different RNA pools, while microarrays provide additional evidence for a smaller set of hypothesized CIRTs that may escape detection by sequencing because of low-read depth or systematic biases such as nucleotide content (Harismendy et al., 2009Harismendy O. Ng P.C. Strausberg R.L. Wang X. Stockwell T.B. Beeson K.Y. Schork N.J. Murray S.S. Topol E.J. Levy S. Frazer K.A. Evaluation of next generation sequencing platforms for population targeted sequencing studies.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R32Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). By using these methods, many CIRTs were detected (Table 1). A wide range of expression was observed across the arrays, with intronic loci from CAMK2B and FMR1 among others consistently showing high signal (Figure S1A, available online, and Table S1). A similar pattern of intron retention was present in the sequencing data, supported by uniquely aligning end pairs to nonrepetitive intronic regions (Figure S1B, Table S2). For some genes such as ADCY4 and GRIK1, sequence reads spanned intron-exon boundaries. Retention of intronic sequence appears to be regulated, as some intronic loci consistently show retention while others do not. Some genes such as CAMK2A and SNCB lacked intron retention despite the confirmed presence of exonic regions in the RNA pool.Table 1Candidate Retained Intronic LociRefseq IDGene SymbolRetained Intronic LociNM_031007Adcy2i2, i14, i18NM_130779Adcy3i2NM_019285Adcy4i11,aSequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered. i12aSequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered.NM_022600Adcy5i17NM_019288Appi1, i2, i5, i6, i8, i13, i15NM_147141Cacna1bi18, i31NM_153814Cacna1hi9NM_021739CamK2bi1, i3NM_012519CamK2di2, i3, i11, i18NM_133605CamK2gi9, i13, i18NM_031334CDH1i15NM_031017Creb1i1NM_052804Fmr1i1, i7, i12NM_031028Gabbr1i4, i14NM_017289Gabrdi8NM_080587Gabra4i8NM_024370Gabrg3i2, i3, i5, i9NM_032990Gria3i2, i11,aSequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered. i12, i13,aSequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered. i15aSequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered.NM_017263Gria4i3, i4, i7, i13aSequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered.NM_017241Grik1i1, i7, i16aSequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered.NM_017010Grin1i8NM_031040Grm7i1, i5, i6NM_031730Kcnd2i1NM_013066Map2i4, i7, i9, i10NM_019169Sncai2, i4a Sequencing reads overlapping the splice junction were recovered. Open table in a new tab The protocol for RNA sample preparation, consisting of mechanical isolation of dendrites from cell bodies, makes it unlikely that the detected intronic sequence arises from genomic DNA or unspliced or nonspecifically, incompletely spliced nuclear mRNAs. Additionally, the pattern of sequence-read coverage is inconsistent with these sources of contamination, as we found no significant enrichment in intergenic reads, nor did we find any systematic pattern of intron presence or absence across all genes. We also analyzed each retained intronic locus by using base composition properties and public annotations and found that the majority had no evidence for unannotated alternate exons or overlapping genes (see Supplemental Text). Based on the retained intronic loci detected in the initial screen, we selected several candidates to visualize by using in situ hybridization to confirm retention and localization patterns. We assayed intronic probes designed to target microarrayed sequences from RNAs showing varying degrees of intronic sequence retention. Antisense riboprobes were generated and used for in situ hybridization to E18 rat neurons in primary cell culture. Cells were costained for MAP2 protein to indicate dendrito-somatic regions of neurons (Figure 1, insets). All sequences tested showed dendritic in situ hybridization signals consistent with microarray results (Figure 1A). In situ hybridization of exonic probes confirmed the dendritic localization patterns of the intron-containing transcripts (Figure S2). Further, oligo probes to intron-exon junctions with sequencing support successfully confirmed that each region was within the dendritic compartment by in situ hybridization (Figure 1B). Interestingly, GRIK1 shows a higher dendritic signal for intron 16 joined with an alternate exon than with the canonical exon 17, suggesting an interaction between intronic sequence and the isoforms of the transcript in localization (Bell et al., 2010Bell T.J. Miyashiro K.Y. Sul J.Y. Buckley P.T. Lee M.T. McCullough R. Jochems J. Kim J. Cantor C.R. Parsons T.D. Eberwine J.H. Intron retention facilitates splice variant diversity in calcium-activated big potassium channel populations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 21152-21157Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given the widespread occurrence of CIRTs, we hypothesized that sequence elements important for mRNA regulation may be embedded in the retained intronic sequences and searched for putative regulatory sequences. We found several sets of sequences shared among different introns, including a large number of BC1 RNA-like ID elements. While ID elements are not unique to retained introns, many are found in the dendritic introns detected by microarray and sequencing. Among these intronic ID elements, we found that many retain motifs previously identified as BC1 localization signals that confer targeting to microinjected mRNA (Muslimov et al., 2006Muslimov I.A. Iacoangeli A. Brosius J. Tiedge H. Spatial codes in dendritic BC1 RNA.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as evidenced by their predicted secondary structures (Figure 2A ). A total of 308 blocks of ID-derived sequence were found. Of these, 70 elements appearing in 46 introns across 23 genes were determined to possess mRNA targeting potential: these occurred in the sense orientation and forming a hairpin structure with a basal-medial unbranched helix, a uracil at position 22, and at least 90% sequence identity to the BC1 5′ domain (Table S3). Sequencing data provided evidence that many of these ID-containing loci were present in the dendritic RNA pools. We estimate a 20-fold enrichment in ID element sequence compared to other SINEs in dendritic RNA (Table S4), though because of the high-copy number of ID-related sequences in the rat genome, it is not possible to establish unambiguous genomic positions for most of the ID-derived reads. However, more than half of the 70 potentially functional ID loci fall within introns with uniquely mapping sequence reads, including six cases in which the ID elements themselves are spanned by end pairs uniquely aligning to neighboring nonrepetitive sequences (Table S3). To test targeting efficacy of intron-derived ID elements, we cloned PCR products consisting of ID elements plus flanking sequence from retained intron regions into pEGFP-N1 expression vectors with the ID region placed upstream of the EGFP coding sequence. ID-EGFP transcripts are generated upon transfection into primary rat hippocampal neurons and detected by in situ hybridization targeted to the EGFP portion of the sequence. pEGFP-N1-transfected cells were used as a control for ID-independent RNA localization (Figure 2B). The in situ results show that ID elements from the retained introns do indeed confer dendritic targeting to the transgene mRNA (Figures 2B and 2D). Versions of the construct with selective mutations to the ID element sequence significantly disrupted dendritic targeting (Figure 2C and Supplemental Text). Similarly, targeting was not observed for a construct containing an FMR1i1-isolated B2 SINE instead of an ID element, confirming that general structured intronic sequence is insufficient to confer localization (Figure S3C). To quantify the extent of targeting of the fusion constructs, we developed a custom program by using Igor (WaveMetrics, Inc.) to measure probe intensity along curves drawn in the in situ images through the dendritic processes, originating at the somal end based on MAP2 immunostaining. For each of the assays described below, three dendrites were quantified per cell and eight to ten cells were quantified for each probe. A greater signal can be seen in ID-EGFP- versus EGFP-transfected cells at further distances away from the cell body for all four ID elements. Transcripts were present at distances of ∼50–80 μm from the cell soma (>2 × the diameter of the soma) (Figure 2B). Actively transported RNAs are expected to have greater ISH intensity and a shallower gradient along the length of the dendrite, while nonactively transported RNA is expected to have less intensity and steeper gradients. We tested the intensity level differentials in 8 μm intervals along the dendrites out to a distance of ∼50 μm from the soma and found that all test probes showed significantly greater signal intensity compared to the EGFP control (p < 1E−10, Fisher's combined p value for Bonferroni-corrected t tests from each interval, see Supplemental Text). As a control for overexpression artifacts, we also used diffusion modeling to show fundamental differences in the targeting of exogenous EGFP transcripts relative to ID-EGFP transcripts and confirmed that the test probe in situs showed evidence of active transport of the mRNA (Supplemental Text). Despite similar expression levels, different distribution patterns along the length of the dendrites are observed for different ID constructs, which can be described as diffuse (GABRG3i5ID2), punctate (CAMK2Bi3ID1), and intense (FMR1i1ID1). These findings suggest the existence of different targeting mechanisms for ID-containing sequences that may be governed by flanking sequence or subtle sequence and/or structural variations. By using a stringent in vivo competition assay, we found that exogenous expression of ID elements can block the targeting of endogenous transcripts to dendrites. This results from transcript competition for localization machinery analogous to the competition between Drosophila I factor and gurken mRNA (Van De Bor et al., 2005Van De Bor V. Hartswood E. Jones C. Finnegan D. Davis I. gurken and the I factor retrotransposon RNAs share common localization signals and machinery.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours posttransfection with ID constructs, in situ hybridization was performed by using probes directed at intronic regions absent from the transfected ID-EGFP transcripts. Only endogenous transcripts containing the intronic sequence would be detected, allowing the study of the ID-EGFP transcript's effect on endogenous intron-containing mRNA (Figure 3). In all cases tested, ID-EGFP transfection significantly disrupted the localization of analogous endogenous intron-retaining transcripts, as measured by signal intensity differential along the length of the dendrite as above (p < 1E−6, Fisher and Bonferroni analysis, Supplemental Text). These data show that the endogenous localization mechanism is ID element dependent. To determine whether targeting mechanisms are specific to particular ID element variants or common to all targeted transcripts containing ID elements, we performed cross-competition experiments to assess the capacity of an ID element from one gene's transcript to disrupt the localization of a CIRT from a different gene. This was tested by using probes to introns from genes that do not contain the particular ID element being exogenously expressed. CAMK2Bi3ID1, when transfected into neurons, disrupts dendritic localization of endogenous CAMK2Bi3 transcripts and is also capable of disrupting FMR1i1 localization (Figure 3A), at a magnitude equal to or greater to that caused by FMR1i1ID1 (p < 1E−11, Fisher and Bonferroni analysis, Supplemental Text). This shows that the CAMK2Bi3-derived ID element can cross-compete for targeting machinery with the endogenous FMR1 intron-retaining transcript, suggesting a dendritic localization mechanism that accepts both CAMK2Bi3 and FMR1i1 as substrates. Conversely, transfection of FMR1i1ID1 disrupted the intronic in situ pattern of FMR1i1 transcripts, while dendritic targeting of CAMK2Bi3 transcripts was only minimally affected (Figure 3B, p < 1E−5, Fisher and Bonferroni analysis). This indicates that a more selective mechanism exists for FMR1i1ID1-mediated targeting, for which CAMK2Bi3 is not a substrate, and that the FMR1i1ID1 sequence can target to dendrites in a distinct manner from CAMK2Bi3. Additionally, transfection of either GABRGi5ID or GRIK1i1ID had no effect on either FMR1i1 or CAMK2Bi3 localization (Figure S4), confirming the specificity of the FMR1i1ID1- and CAMK2Bi3ID1-driven mechanisms. To assess whether transcript localization affects the location of the encoded protein product, we visualized the subcellular distribution of FMRP, which is encoded by FMR1, by using immunofluorescence. FMRP is normally distributed throughout both the cell soma and dendrites of neurons, as was the case for cells transfected with EGFP (Figure 4A ). Upon transfection with FMR1i1ID1-EGFP, the relative amount of FMRP in the dendrites decreases, with FMRP concentrating at the outer boundaries of the soma (Figure 4A). In contrast, subcellular distribution of CAMK2B protein is unaffected by FMR1i1ID1-EGFP transfection (Figure 4B). Thus, the function of this ID element containing CIRT is consistent with a role in regulating dendritically localized FMRP protein levels and subsequent function in the dendrite. By using three independent methods of detection in multiple cell cultures, we have described a large number of previously unreported intronic sequences in the dendritically localized mRNA of primary rat hippocampal neurons. These CIRTs represent a class of transcript that has important cellular function in neurons including involvement in dendritic targeting of mRNAs via co-opted retrotransposons. These dendritic targeting elements are additionally notable in that they occur outside of the transcript UTR or coding region and are found in more than two different gene transcripts. Our in situ hybridization results show a variety of dendritic distribution patterns, suggesting that localization is a complex process that likely involves multiple ID element-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The fact that exogenous expression of any particular intronic ID element does not necessarily disrupt targeting of all intron-retaining transcripts suggests the existence of multiple variant targeting mechanisms—if only a single mechanism existed, transfection of any intronic ID element would block the targeting of all endogenous intron-retaining transcripts containing an ID element. Our data reflect at least three targeting mechanisms for intron-retaining transcripts in dendrites: one that is distinct for FMR1i1ID1, one that is common to CAMK2Bi3iD1 and FMR1i1ID1, and at least one that is ID element independent. Further, we observed that FMRP localization is directly affected by the disruption of endogenous ID element-mediated FMR1i1 targeting, suggesting that CIRTs may be critically important in the presumptive role of FMRP in modulation of local dendritic protein synthesis (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M.

USA. 1997; 94: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). BC1-like ID elements have been implicated in brain-specific gene regulation since their discovery (Milner et al., 1984Milner R.J. Bloom F.E. Lai C. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Brain-specific genes have identifier sequences in their introns.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1984; 81: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and while it is believed that most of these sequences are removed from pre-mRNA via intron splicing, we show that some are retained in dendritically localized mRNA and facilitate dendritic targeting of the host transcript. Previous work with transgenic mice having ID elements fused to the 3′UTR of EGFP showed that these sequences were not sufficient for dendritic targeting (Khanam et al., 2007Khanam T. Raabe C.A. Kiefmann M. Handel S. Skryabin B.V. Brosius J. Can ID repetitive elements serve as cis-acting dendritic targeting elements? An in vivo study.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e961Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Additionally, ID elements occurring endogenously in the 3′UTRs of neuronally expressed genes also showed no evidence of dendritic localization. In contrast, earlier work showed that microinjected BC1-containing chimeric RNAs were successfully targeted to dendrites (Muslimov et al., 1997Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. RNA transport in dendrites: A cis-acting targeting element is contained within neuronal BC1 RNA.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the discrepancy may be sequence-position related and due to a requirement for partial nuclear processing of the nascent transcripts. If localization is coupled to splicing or nuclear export, it could be position dependent, such that 3′UTR placement of ID elements (as was the case for the Khanam et al., 2007Khanam T. Raabe C.A.

Assembly of the AIS requires interactions between scaffolding molecules and voltage-gated sodium channels, but the molecular mechanisms that stabilize the AIS are poorly understood.

Nevertheless, action potentials with a modified waveform can still be evoked and basic motor abilities remain intact.

In mammalian neurons, the site of initiation of the action potential is believed to be the axon initial segment (AIS), a specialized region located between the axon hillock and the myelin sheath in myelinated axons (Palay et al., 1968Palay S.L. Sotelo C. Peters A. Orkand P.M. The axon hillock and the initial segment.J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Hence, the properties of the AIS are likely to determine how a neuron responds to excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Recent experiments suggest that the composition and topographical organization of the initial segment are dynamically and precisely organized (Colbert and Pan, 2002Colbert C.M. Pan E.

Oichi Y. Ohmori H. Presynaptic activity regulates Na(+) channel distribution at the axon initial segment.Nature. 2010; 465: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The relatively low threshold for initiation of action potentials at the AIS is believed to rely on the high density and specialized gating properties of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav). Clustering of these sodium channels during development depends on the correct targeting of AnkyrinG to the AIS (Hedstrom et al., 2008Hedstrom K.L. Ogawa Y. Rasband M.N. AnkyrinG is required for maintenance of the axon initial segment and neuronal polarity.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 1998Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. AnkyrinG is required for clustering of voltage-gated Na channels at axon initial segments and for normal action potential firing.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that maintain an appropriate configuration of the AIS in adult neurons in vivo are poorly understood.In addition to Nav channels and AnkyrinG, the AIS contains a high density of proteins also found in nodes of Ranvier. These include voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) (Clark et al., 2009Clark B.D. Goldberg E.M. Rudy B. Electrogenic tuning of the axon initial segment.Neuroscientist. 2009; 15: 651-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the scaffolding protein βIV-Spectrin and the cell-adhesion molecules Neurofascin186 (Nfasc186) and neuron-glia related cell-adhesion molecule (NrCAM) (Rasband, 2010Rasband M.N. The axon initial segment and the maintenance of neuronal polarity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In contrast to nodes of Ranvier, assembly of these molecules at the axon initial segment does not require glial derived cues (Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007Dzhashiashvili Y. Zhang Y. Galinska J. Lam I. Grumet M. Salzer J.L. Nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments are ankyrin G-dependent domains that assemble by distinct mechanisms.J.

Neurosci. 2010; 11: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Moreover, although once considered a stable neuronal compartment, recent studies have shown that the AIS can change its position in an activity-dependent manner (Grubb and Burrone, 2010aGrubb M.S. Burrone J. Activity-dependent relocation of the axon initial segment fine-tunes neuronal excitability.Nature. 2010; 465: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, Grubb and Burrone, 2010bGrubb M.S.

Presynaptic activity regulates Na(+) channel distribution at the axon initial segment.Nature. 2010; 465: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It has also become increasingly clear that the molecular composition of the AIS varies between different cell-types (Lorincz and Nusser, 2008Lorincz A. Nusser Z. Cell-type-dependent molecular composition of the axon initial segment.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 14329-14340Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and within its distal and proximal compartments (Hu et al., 2009Hu W. Tian C. Li T. Yang M. Hou H. Shu Y.

Polarized distribution of ion channels within microdomains of the axon initial segment.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 500: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity may contribute to the specificity with which neurons initiate and shape action potentials (Nusser, 2009Nusser Z. Variability in the subcellular distribution of ion channels increases neuronal diversity.Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Despite its probable importance, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of assembly, maintenance and plasticity of the AIS is still limited. AnkyrinG has been proposed as the master organizer of the AIS (Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007Dzhashiashvili Y. Zhang Y. Galinska J. Lam I. Grumet M. Salzer J.L. Nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments are ankyrin G-dependent domains that assemble by distinct mechanisms.J.

During development this scaffold protein appears to be targeted to the domain earlier than other proteins (Jenkins and Bennett, 2001Jenkins S.M. Bennett V.

Rasband M.N. betaIV spectrin is recruited to axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier by ankyrinG.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Further support for this view comes from the failure of the Purkinje cell AIS to assemble in mice that lack cerebellar AnkyrinG during development (Jenkins and Bennett, 2001Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. Ankyrin-G coordinates assembly of the spectrin-based membrane skeleton, voltage-gated sodium channels, and L1 CAMs at Purkinje neuron initial segments.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Knockdown studies also show that AnkyrinG is required for assembly and maintenance of the AIS molecular complex in cultured hippocampal neurons (Hedstrom et al., 2007Hedstrom K.L. Xu X. Ogawa Y. Frischknecht R. Seidenbecher C.I. Shrager P. Rasband M.N. Neurofascin assembles a specialized extracellular matrix at the axon initial segment.J.

Deletion of the Ankyrin-interactor βIV-Spectrin leads to redistribution of AIS proteins but does not abolish the AIS (Lacas-Gervais et al., 2004Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E.

BetaIV spectrins are essential for membrane stability and the molecular organization of nodes of Ranvier.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7230-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Knocking down Nav channels also disrupts the AIS molecular complex in cultured spinal motor neurons (Xu and Shrager, 2005Xu X. Shrager P. Dependence of axon initial segment formation on Na+ channel expression.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 428-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but not in other types of neuron (Hedstrom et al., 2007Hedstrom K.L. Xu X. Ogawa Y. Frischknecht R. Seidenbecher C.I. Shrager P.

Indeed, the role of both Neurofascin and NrCAM at the AIS is still unclear. In contrast to its pioneer role in node of Ranvier formation in the PNS and CNS (Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007Dzhashiashvili Y. Zhang Y. Galinska J. Lam I. Grumet M. Salzer J.L.

Identification of a conserved ankyrin-binding motif in the family of sodium channel alpha subunits.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27333-27339Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Further, RNAi knockdown of NrCAM and Nfasc186 has suggested that they are not required for the assembly of the AIS in cultured hippocampal neurons, but rather that Nfasc186 has a role in targeting the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Brevican (Hedstrom et al., 2007Hedstrom K.L. Xu X. Ogawa Y. Frischknecht R. Seidenbecher C.I. Shrager P. Rasband M.N. Neurofascin assembles a specialized extracellular matrix at the axon initial segment.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). GABAergic innervation by basket cell axons to the Purkinje cell AIS, known as pinceau synapses, also appears to be directed by Nfasc186, through a mechanism that in turn depends on AnkyrinG (Ango et al., 2004Ango F. di Cristo G. Higashiyama H. Bennett V. Wu P. Huang Z.J. Ankyrin-based subcellular gradient of neurofascin, an immunoglobulin family protein, directs GABAergic innervation at purkinje axon initial segment.Cell. 2004; 119: 257-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).We have used an in vivo approach to ask if Nfasc186 has an active role in AIS structure and function. Our study shows that Nfasc186 is not required for the assembly of the AIS during development, although it is required to target NrCAM. In contrast, using an inducible conditional strategy to ablate Neurofascin biosynthesis in adult neurons, we show that loss of Nfasc186 causes breakdown of the AIS complex and impairment of normal action potential initiation in Purkinje cells. Surprisingly, Nfasc186 is much more stable in the nodal complex, and nodes of Ranvier are much less susceptible to disintegration. This has allowed us to study the functional consequences of AIS disruption in the presence of intact nodes of Ranvier in vivo. Our results show that AIS disruption due to loss of Nfasc186 prevents spontaneous action potential firing by cerebellar Purkinje cells, modifies the waveform of evoked action potentials, and leads to an impairment in motor performance. Our data suggest that the molecular mechanisms for stabilization of the AIS in adult neurons in vivo are distinct from the mechanisms used for assembly of the AIS in developing neurons. We propose a dynamic model for maintenance of the mature AIS, whereby Nfasc186 is constitutively required for anchoring of new protein components to the AIS complex.ResultsAIS Assembly without Neurofascin In VivoTo test whether proteins known to be constituents of the initial segment complex could cluster appropriately in the absence of the Neurofascins (the neuronal isoform Nfasc186 and the glial isoform Nfasc155), we examined the cerebella of wild-type and Neurofascin null mice at P6. NrCAM was the only component of the AIS complex found to be affected in mutant Purkinje cells (Figure 1A ), and the number of Purkinje cells positive for NrCAM was reduced from 93.0% ± 1.3% to 7.4% ± 0.1% (mean values ± SEM, n = 3, 40 cells per animal, p < 0.0001, unpaired Student's t test). In order to establish if the presence of NrCAM at the AIS was dependent on the neuronal isoform of Neurofascin, Nfasc186, we generated transgenic mice expressing FLAG-tagged Nfasc186 on a Neurofascin null background. The transgenic Nfasc186 was targeted appropriately and rescued NrCAM at the AIS (Figure 1B). Interestingly, although the stable targeting of NrCAM to the AIS was dependent on Nfasc186, the converse was not true (see Figure S1 available online); neither was NrCAM required for the long-term stability of the AIS (Figure S1). We concluded that although Nfasc186 is not required for in vivo assembly of voltage-gated sodium channels at the AIS, it recruits NrCAM to the AIS complex.Nfasc186 Stabilizes the AISSince the Neurofascins are not required for the clustering of sodium channels or the majority of their associated proteins in the AIS complex, we asked if instead they have a role in maintaining the complex. Since Neurofascin null mice die at P7 (Sherman et al., 2005Sherman D.L. Tait S. Melrose S. Johnson R. Zonta B. Court F.A. Macklin W.B. Meek S. Smith A.J. Cottrell D.F. Brophy P.J. Neurofascins are required to establish axonal domains for saltatory conduction.Neuron. 2005; 48: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), it is not possible to study the long-term stability of their initial segments in vivo. Hence, we first examined organotypic slice cultures derived from Neurofascin null cerebella. Such cultures are known to maintain viability for months (Kessler et al., 2008Kessler M. Kiliman B. Humes C. Arai A.C. Spontaneous activity in Purkinje cells: Multi-electrode recording from organotypic cerebellar slice cultures.Brain Res. 2008; 1218: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the absence of the Neurofascins clustering of components of the AIS was complete after 9 days in vitro (DIV). The exception was NrCAM, as found in vivo (Figures 1A and 2). Further culture for up to 15 days resulted in the dispersal of sodium channels, AnkyrinG and βIV-Spectrin, whereas the wild-type AIS remained intact (Figure 2). This suggests that the Neurofascins are required for AIS stability, at least in vitro.Figure 2Nfasc Is Required to Maintain the AIS Complex In VitroShow full captionImmunofluorescence of Calbindin-positive Purkinje cells in organotypic cerebellar slices from newborn Nfasc−/− and wild-type littermates. At 9 days in vitro (DIV), AIS proteins with the exception of NrCAM are correctly localized in wild-type slices. However, by 15 DIV Nav, AnkyrinG, and βIV-spectrin are no longer localized to the AIS in mutant slices (arrowheads point to AIS location). Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if the neuronal isoform of Neurofascin, Nfasc186, is also required for AIS stability in vivo, we used an inducible conditional knockout approach to inactivate the Nfasc gene specifically in adult neurons. To achieve this we generated mice carrying a floxed allele of Neurofascin (see Experimental Procedures) and a transgenic line in which the CreERT2 cassette was driven by the Thy1.2 promoter (TCE) (Caroni, 1997Caroni P. Overexpression of growth-associated proteins in the neurons of adult transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Feil et al., 1997Feil R. Wagner J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Regulation of Cre recombinase activity by mutated estrogen receptor ligand-binding domains.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Using a reporter line, we showed that these TCE mice expressed tamoxifen-inducible Cre robustly in cerebellar Purkinje cells (Figure S2).To inactivate the Nfasc gene efficiently using tamoxifen induction of Cre activity, we generated TCE transgenic mice with one floxed and one null allele of the gene (TCE/Nfascfl/−). Western blot analysis of hindbrain homogenates from TCE/Nfascfl/− mice 6 weeks after tamoxifen treatment showed that recombination resulted in a reduction in the level of Nfasc186, whereas the glial isoform (Nfasc155) was unaffected (Figure 3A ). Although we focused our analysis on brains 6 weeks posttamoxifen to ensure complete loss of Nfasc186 at AIS and AIS disruption, the disappearance of Nfasc186 at the AIS was clear at 3 weeks after tamoxifen-induced recombination, a time when the other components of the complex were still present (Figure 3B). Although there was some reduction in the length of NrCAM staining at 3 weeks, it was not lost completely until 4 weeks posttamoxifen. Between 3 and 4 weeks posttamoxifen, the kinetics of AnkyrinG, βIV-Spectrin, and NrCAM loss in vivo were rapid and coincident with the disappearance of sodium channel immunostaining at the AIS, which was complete by 4 weeks, thus precluding an informative evaluation of the sequence in which these components are lost (data not shown). Nfasc186 was efficiently eliminated at the AIS of Purkinje cells 6 weeks posttamoxifen (Figure 3C), since the number of Purkinje cells immunopositive for Nfasc186 was reduced from 99.2% ± 0.8% to 2.5% ± 2.5% (mean values ± SEM, n = 3, 40 cells per animal, p < 0.0001, unpaired Student's t test). Furthermore, and consistent with the results of the cerebellar slice culture experiment with Neurofascin null mice (Figure 2), loss of Nfasc186 from the AIS abolished the immunofluorescence signal for sodium channels, AnkyrinG, βIV-Spectrin, and NrCAM (Figure 3C). No demyelination was observed and the levels of myelin proteins, as assessed by western blotting, were unchanged (data not shown).Figure 3Nfasc186 Is Required to Maintain the AIS In VivoShow full caption(A) Western blotting using a pan-anti-Neurofascin antibody (NFC1) of hindbrain homogenates (20 μg per lane) from TCE/Nfascfl/− mice 6 weeks after tamoxifen (TAM) treatment showed that the levels of the Nfasc186 neuronal isoform are significantly reduced whereas the Nfasc155 glial isoform is unaffected.

Tubulin was the loading control.(B) Immunofluorescence of Calbindin positive Purkinje cells in cryostat sections of cerebella from Nfascfl/− and TCE/Nfascfl/− mice 3 weeks after tamoxifen (TAM) treatment shows that although Nfasc186 is lost, other components of the AIS, including sodium channels, are still present.

Thus, whereas assembly of the AIS appears to involve AnkyrinG acting as a master coordinator (Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007Dzhashiashvili Y. Zhang Y. Galinska J. Lam I. Grumet M. Salzer J.L.

Because Nfasc186 is also believed to be important for the establishment of inhibitory synaptic input from basket cells onto Purkinje cells"

This is in addition to a previously reported representation of sound spectral properties (also found here), running approximately perpendicular to the temporal map. Natural sounds are characterized by their spectral content and the modulation of energy over time. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake macaques, we observed topographical representations of these spectral and temporal dimensions in a single structure, the inferior colliculus, the principal auditory nucleus in the midbrain. These representations are organized as a map with two approximately perpendicular axes: one representing increasing temporal rate and the other increasing spectral frequency."

In the embryonic spinal cord, for example, a group of neuroepithelial stem cells (NSCs) generates motor neurons (MNs), before switching abruptly to oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs). We asked how transcription factor OLIG2 participates in this MN-OLP fate switch. We found that Serine 147 in the helix-loop-helix domain of OLIG2 was phosphorylated during MN production and dephosphorylated at the onset of OLP genesis. Mutating Serine 147 to Alanine (S147A) abolished MN production without preventing OLP production in transgenic mice, chicks, or cultured P19 cells. We conclude that S147 phosphorylation, possibly by protein kinase A, is required for MN but not OLP genesis and propose that dephosphorylation triggers the MN-OLP switch. Wild-type OLIG2 forms stable homodimers, whereas mutant (unphosphorylated) OLIG2S147A prefers to form heterodimers with Neurogenin 2 or other bHLH partners, suggesting a molecular basis for the switch.

Cell diversification occurs in stages. First, a neurogenic prepattern is laid down in the plane of the VZ, under the action of graded morphogens released from organizing centers within or outside the neural tube. This leads to a mosaic of molecularly distinct progenitor domains, each of which goes on to generate a characteristic subset of neurons and glia. Superimposed on this spatial pattern is a temporal pattern of cell generation from some regions of the VZ. For example, in the developing cerebral cortex, different classes of projection neuron are generated in sequence (Shen et al., 2006Shen Q. Wang Y. Dimos J.T. Fasano C.A. Phoenix T.N. Lemischka I.R. Ivanova N.B. Stifani S. Morrisey E.E. Temple S. The timing of cortical neurogenesis is encoded within lineages of individual progenitor cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar); these settle in stereotypic positions to generate the layered structure of the cortex. Subsequently, cortical NSCs start to produce glial lineages (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [OLs]). This late neuron-glial switch is a general property of NSCs in all parts of the developing brain and spinal cord. In some areas of the VZ, NSCs switch from neuron to astrocyte production, whereas other regions generate oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs), which migrate widely before differentiating into myelin-forming OLs (Rowitch, 2004Rowitch D.H. Glial specification in the vertebrate neural tube.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, Richardson et al., 2006Richardson W.D. Kessaris N. Pringle N. Oligodendrocyte wars.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Less is known about the temporal control of cell fate than the spatial patterning that precedes it. We set out to study this temporal aspect of cell diversification, focusing on neuron-glial switching in the ventral spinal cord. Spatial pattern in the ventral half of the developing spinal cord is established largely through the action of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein released from the notochord and floor plate at the ventral midline. SHH activates or inhibits different sets of transcription factors at different distances from the floor plate (different concentrations of SHH). Subsequently, cross-repressive interactions among the transcription factors expressed in adjacent regions of the VZ establish sharp boundaries of gene expression in the dorsal-ventral axis, establishing a set of ribbon-like NSC domains that run parallel to one another along the neuraxis. In the ventral half of the cord, these domains are known (from ventral to dorsal) as p3, pMN, p2, p1, and p0 (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Six additional NSC domains (dP1–dP6, dorsal to ventral) are formed in the dorsal half of the spinal cord under the influence of BMPs and WNTs secreted from the roof plate (Helms and Johnson, 2003Helms A.W. Johnson J.E. Specification of dorsal spinal cord interneurons.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). NSCs in the ventral pMN domain generate several different subtypes of motor neuron (MN) before switching abruptly to OLP production (reviewed by Richardson et al., 2000Richardson W.D. Smith H.K. Sun T. Pringle N.P. Hall A. Woodruff R. Oligodendrocyte lineage and the motor neuron connection.Glia. 2000; 29: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). NSCs in the neighboring p3 and p2 domains generate interneurons followed by astrocytes (Rowitch et al., 2002Rowitch D.H. Lu Q.R. Kessaris N. Richardson W.D. An ‘oligarchy’ rules neural development.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 417-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The pMN domain contributes all of the MNs and ∼80% of the OLPs in the mouse spinal cord (Fogarty, 2006Fogarty, M.H. (2006) Fate-mapping the mouse neural tube by Cre-loxP transgenesis.

Myelinogenesis and axonal recognition by oligodendrocytes in brain are uncoupled in Olig1-null mice.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, OLIG1 is believed to be crucial for OL regeneration in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Arnett et al., 2004Arnett H.A. Fancy S.P. Alberta J.A. Zhao C. Plant S.R. Kaing S.

The OLIG gene products are members of a large family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors, which also includes proneural proteins Neurogenin1/2 (NGN1/2) and MASH1/ASCL1 as well as cell lineage regulators MYOD and NEUROD. OLIG2 interacts with different protein partners to regulate specific developmental processes. It can form heterodimers with NGN2 to control MN differentiation, and it can bind NKX2.2 to promote OLP generation and/or differentiation (Novitch et al., 2001Novitch B.G. Chen A.I. Jessell T.M.

Given the central role of OLIG2 in both MN and OL development, we were keen to discover how this one transcription factor can specify two quite different cell types and especially how it participates in the MN-OLP temporal fate switch. We present evidence that OLIG2 controls the switch by reversible phosphorylation on Serine 147 (S147), a predicted protein kinase A (PKA) target; phosphorylation at this site is required for patterning of the ventral neuroepithelium and MN specification, whereas dephosphorylation favors OLP specification. S147 phosphorylation also causes OLIG2 to switch its preferred dimerization partner from OLIG2 (or OLIG1) to NGN2. We propose that this regulated exchange of cofactors is required for and triggers the MN-OLP fate switch. OLIG2 is rich in serine and threonine residues (50 serines and 14 threonines out of a total of 323 amino acids; see Table S1 available online), suggesting that it might possess multiple serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. To test this, we transfected a Myc epitope-tagged OLIG2 expression vector into Cos-7 cells, labeled the cells with [33P]phosphate, and analyzed radiolabeled OLIG2 proteins by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Myc followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Two major radioactive OLIG2 bands were visible (Figure 1A ). Separation of Olig2-transfected Cos-7 cell lysates by two-dimensional (2D) PAGE (pH gradient in the second dimension) followed by Western blotting (WB) confirmed that OLIG2 was phosphorylated on multiple sites and that most of the phosphates could be removed by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (Figures 1C and 1F). Bioinformatic analysis of OLIG2 using online services NetPhos 2.0 Server (Blom et al., 1999Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Sequence and structure-based prediction of eukaryotic protein phosphorylation sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) and NetPhosK 1.0 Server (Blom et al., 2004Blom N. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Gupta R. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Prediction of post-translational glycosylation and phosphorylation of proteins from the amino acid sequence.Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar) identified one potential PKA and one potential protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site (Table S1). Alignment of OLIG2 protein sequences from different species revealed that the predicted PKA site (R[R/K]X[S/T]) (X, any amino acid)—at S147 in the bHLH Helix-2 (H2) domain—is conserved during evolution (Figure 1B). This site is also conserved in OLIG1 but not in NGN1–3 or other bHLH proteins examined. We mutated S147 to Alanine (S147A), transfected the mutant (Olig2S147A) and wild-type (Olig2WT) constructs into Cos-7 cells, and visualized OLIG2 proteins by 2D PAGE and WB as before. This revealed an altered phosphorylation pattern of OLIG2S147A (Figure 1D), indicating that S147 is a bone fide phosphate acceptor. Moreover, cotransfection of Olig2WT with a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of PKA (dnPKA) strongly reduced the phosphoprotein signal in the low pH range of the 2D gel (the region affected by S147A mutation), implying that OLIG2 can be phosphorylated by PKA on several sites, including S147 (Figure 1E). To examine OLIG2-S147 phosphorylation status directly, we raised an antiserum in rabbits against a custom phosphopeptide and purified an antibody fraction that specifically recognizes the S147-phosphorylated form of OLIG2 (anti-OLIG2 ph-S147; Figure S1). We prepared nuclear extracts of embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), E11.5, and E13.5 mouse spinal cord tissue, immunoprecipitated endogenous OLIG2 protein with a goat anti-OLIG2 antibody, and visualized the precipitates by PAGE and WB with either rabbit anti-OLIG2 or rabbit anti-OLIG2 ph-S147. OLIG2 was expressed more or less equally at all stages examined (Figure 1G). The specific phosphorylated form OLIG2 ph-S147 was present at E9.5 and to a lesser extent at E11.5 (∼3.2-fold decrease; see Experimental Procedures) but was not detected at E13.5 (Figure 1H). These results demonstrate that endogenous OLIG2 is phosphorylated on S147 during MN production (∼E9–12) but is later dephosphorylated, coinciding with the switch from MN to OLP production that occurs around E12.5 in mice (Pringle et al., 1996Pringle N.P.

Given the location of the S147 phosphorylation site in the bHLH domain, it seemed likely that the phosphorylation status of this site might affect the interactions of OLIG2 with other proteins or with DNA. OLIG2 can form strong homodimers with itself as well as heterodimers with OLIG1 but forms weak heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, such as E12 or NGN2 (Lee et al., 2005Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C.

We compared the cofactor-binding properties of OLIG2S147A and OLIG2WT by coIP assays in transfected Cos-7 cells and found that, compared to OLIG2WT, OLIG2S147A had a reduced ability to form OLIG2-OLIG2 and OLIG2-OLIG1 dimers, whereas binding to NKX2.2, SOX10, or MASH1 was unaffected (Figures 2A and S2A). In contrast, OLIG2S147A complexed more readily with NGN2 (Figure 2A). Together, these experiments indicate that S147A mutation does not destabilize OLIG2 or grossly affect its structure but, nevertheless, alters its binding to transcriptional partners. We tried to mimic constitutive phosphorylation by mutating S147 to glutamic acid (E) or aspartic acid (D). However, both OLIG2S147E and OLIG2S147D exhibited reduced homodimer formation just like OLIG2S147A (data not shown). This sort of effect is not unique to OLIG2. For example, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of serine/threonine residues of the bHLH transcription factor HAND1 have been shown to regulate homodimer versus heterodimer formation, phosphorylation favoring heterodimers of HAND1 and E proteins and dephosphorylation favoring HAND1 homodimers (Firulli et al., 2003Firulli B.A. Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V.E. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1225-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the key serine/threonine phosphate acceptors to aspartic acid did not inhibit HAND1 homodimer formation, as would have been expected if these substitutions had mimicked constitutive phosphorylation, but instead strengthened homodimer formation just like serine/threonine → alanine substitution (Firulli et al., 2003Firulli B.A. Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V.E. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B.

We also compared the binding properties of OLIG2WT and OLIG2S147A using a mammalian two-hybrid system (CheckMate System, Promega) (Figures 2B–2E). This is a bipartite assay that depends on the physical association of test and target proteins at the promoter of a Luciferase reporter gene in Cos-7 cells, so activating Luciferase expression, which can be quantified by chemiluminescence. This assay confirmed the results of co-IP, namely, that association of OLIG2WT with an OLIG2S147A target was strongly reduced relative to either an OLIG2WT or OLIG1 target (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, and also in agreement with the co-IP data, association of NGN2 with OLIG2S147A was enhanced (Figure 2D). Furthermore, cotransfection of the catalytic subunit of PKA enhanced formation of OLIG2-OLIG2 and OLIG2-OLIG1 dimers while inhibiting OLIG2-NGN2 dimer formation, whereas a dnPKA had the opposite effect (Figures 2B–2E). In summary, phosphorylation of OLIG2 on S147, possibly by PKA, has a dramatic effect on cofactor choice, favoring NGN2 over other potential partners. In addition we assessed the DNA binding activities of OLIG2WT and OLIG2S147A by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). OLIG2S147A exhibited significantly weaker binding to the HB9/M100 E box (Lee et al., 2005Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Olig2 and Ngn2 function in opposition to modulate gene expression in motor neuron progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) compared to OLIG2WT (Figure S2B). Given that dimerization is needed for bHLH proteins to bind to DNA targets (Murre et al., 1989Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Interactions between heterologous helix-loop-helix proteins generate complexes that bind specifically to a common DNA sequence.Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), this result most likely reflects the reduced efficiency of OLIG2 homodimer formation as a result of S147A mutation. In order to study the phenotypic consequences of OLIG2-S147 phosphorylation in vivo, we generated Olig2S147A mutant mice. We modified OLIG2-coding sequence in an Olig2 PAC clone (not containing Olig1), introducing the S147A mutation while simultaneously adding a V5 epitope tag to the C terminus (Figure 3A ). Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection. V5-tagged Olig2S147A and Olig2WT mice were made in parallel and single-copy founders of both lines were selected for further study (Figure 3B). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that the Olig2S147A and Olig2WT PAC transgenes were faithfully expressed in the embryonic spinal cords of both lines (Figures 3C and 3D). We subsequently removed the endogenous Olig2 alleles by crossing the PAC transgenes into an Olig2 null background (Lu et al., 2002Lu Q.R. Sun T. Zhu Z. Ma N. Garcia M. Stiles C.D. Rowitch D.H. Common developmental requirement for Olig function indicates a motor neuron/oligodendrocyte connection.Cell. 2002; 109: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), thereby obtaining single-copy Olig2S147A and Olig2WT lines (i.e., Olig2S147A:Olig2−/− and Olig2WT:Olig2−/−). For some experiments we also bred the PAC transgenics with Olig1/Olig2 double-null mice (Zhou and Anderson, 2002Zhou Q. Anderson D.J. The bHLH transcription factors OLIG2 and OLIG1 couple neuronal and glial subtype specification.Cell. 2002; 109: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under transcriptional control of Olig2 (see below). Progenitors in p3, the ventral-most progenitor domain of the embryonic spinal cord, express the transcription factor NKX2.2, whereas progenitors in the p2 domain express IRX3 and a high level of PAX6 (Briscoe et al., 2000Briscoe J.

The pMN domain lies between p3 and p2 and is marked by expression of OLIG2 and a low level of PAX6 (Lu et al., 2000Lu Q.R. Yuk D. Alberta J.A. Zhu Z. Pawlitzky I. Chan J. McMahon A.P. Stiles C.D.

OLIG2 is essential for establishing and maintaining the pMN domain through cross-regulatory interactions with transcription factors in neighboring domains. For example, OLIG2 represses expression of Irx3 and Pax6 ; in the absence of OLIG2 function, Irx3 and Pax6 are derepressed in pMN, which takes on the character of p2, generating V2 interneurons and astrocytes instead of MNs and OLPs (Lu et al., 2002Lu Q.R.

This can be regarded as a “homeotic” transformation pMN → p2. We found that the pMN domain specifically was missing in our Olig2S147A mice (Figures 4C and 4D). Moreover, in Olig2S147A:Olig2 GFP/−, Olig1+/− embryos, most pMN precursors (marked by GFP) were observed to adopt a p2 fate (high PAX6 expression) (Figure S3).

https://openalex.org/W2049530893,"The bHLH transcription factors that regulate early development of the central nervous system can generally be classified as either antineural or proneural. Initial expression of antineural factors prevents cell cycle exit and thereby expands the pool of neural progenitors. Subsequent (and typically transient) expression of proneural factors promotes cell cycle exit, subtype specification, and differentiation. Against this backdrop, the bHLH transcription factor Olig2 in the oligodendrocyte lineage is unorthodox, showing antineural functions in multipotent CNS progenitor cells but also sustained expression and proneural functions in the formation of oligodendrocytes. We show here that the proliferative function of Olig2 is controlled by developmentally regulated phosphorylation of a conserved triple serine motif within the amino-terminal domain. In the phosphorylated state, Olig2 maintains antineural (i.e., promitotic) functions that are reflected in human glioma cells and in a genetically defined murine model of primary glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2055678177,"The microtubule-severing protein Katanin is now shown to possess microtubule depolymerising activity. Purified recombinant Katanin exerts both activities in vitro. In migrating cells from Drosophila, Katanin localizes at the leading edge where it negatively regulates cell motility. Regulation of microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex is important for cell motility, morphogenesis and division. Here we show that the Drosophila katanin Dm-Kat60 functions to generate a dynamic cortical-microtubule interface in interphase cells. Dm-Kat60 concentrates at the cell cortex of S2 Drosophila cells during interphase, where it suppresses the polymerization of microtubule plus-ends, thereby preventing the formation of aberrantly dense cortical arrays. Dm-Kat60 also localizes at the leading edge of migratory D17 Drosophila cells and negatively regulates multiple parameters of their motility. Finally, in vitro, Dm-Kat60 severs and depolymerizes microtubules from their ends. On the basis of these data, we propose that Dm-Kat60 removes tubulin from microtubule lattice or microtubule ends that contact specific cortical sites to prevent stable and/or lateral attachments. The asymmetric distribution of such an activity could help generate regional variations in microtubule behaviours involved in cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2038664279,"A causal role of mutations in multiple general transcription factors in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism suggested that alterations in global levels of gene expression regulation might also relate to disease risk in sporadic cases of autism. This premise can be tested by evaluating for changes in the overall distribution of gene expression levels. For instance, in mice, variability in hippocampal-dependent behaviors was associated with variability in the pattern of the overall distribution of gene expression levels, as assessed by variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in the hippocampus. We hypothesized that a similar change in variance might be found in children with autism. Gene expression microarrays covering greater than 47,000 unique RNA transcripts were done on RNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of children with autism (n = 82) and controls (n = 64). Variance in the distribution of gene expression levels from each microarray was compared between groups of children. Also tested was whether a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age, was associated with variance. A decrease in the variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in PBL was associated with the diagnosis of autism and a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age. Traditional approaches to microarray analysis of gene expression suggested a possible mechanism for decreased variance in gene expression. Gene expression pathways involved in transcriptional regulation were down-regulated in the blood of children with autism and children of older fathers. Thus, results from global and gene specific approaches to studying microarray data were complimentary and supported the hypothesis that alterations at the global level of gene expression regulation are related to autism and increased paternal age. Global regulation of transcription, thus, represents a possible point of convergence for multiple etiologies of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2050542278,"The role of signaling pathways in the regulation of cellular iron metabolism is becoming increasingly recognized. Iron chelation is used for the treatment of iron overload but also as a potential strategy for cancer therapy, because iron depletion results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This study examined potential signaling pathways affected by iron depletion induced by desferrioxamine (DFO) or di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT). Both chelators affected multiple molecules in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including a number of dual specificity phosphatases that directly de-phosphorylate MAPKs. Examination of the phosphorylation of major MAPKs revealed that DFO and Dp44mT markedly increased phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinases, JNK and p38, without significantly affecting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Redox-inactive DFO-iron complexes did not affect phosphorylation of JNK or p38, whereas the redox-active Dp44mT-iron complex significantly increased the phosphorylation of these kinases similarly to Dp44mT alone. Iron or N-acetylcysteine supplementation reversed Dp44mT-induced up-regulation of phospho-JNK, but only iron was able to reverse the effect of DFO on JNK. Both iron chelators significantly reduced ASK1-thioredoxin complex formation, resulting in the increased phosphorylation of ASK1, which activates the JNK and p38 pathways. Thus, dissociation of ASK1 could serve as an important signal for the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 activation observed after iron chelation. Phosphorylation of JNK and p38 likely play an important role in mediating the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by iron depletion."
https://openalex.org/W2081683634,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is crucial for the generation and maintenance of both embryonic and adult stem cells, thereby regulating development and tissue homeostasis. In the developing neocortex, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation. During neurogenesis, radial glial cells of the ventricular zone (VZ) are the predominant neocortical progenitors that generate neurons through both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. Despite its importance, relatively little is known of the molecular pathways that control the switch from symmetric proliferative to differentiative/neurogenic divisions in neural progenitors.Here, we report that conditional inactivation of Patched1, a negative regulator of the Shh pathway, in Nestin positive neural progenitors of the neocortex leads to lamination defects due to improper corticogenesis and an increase in the number of symmetric proliferative divisions of the radial glial cells. Hedgehog-activated VZ progenitor cells demonstrated a concomitant upregulation of Hes1 and Blbp, downstream targets of Notch signaling. The Notch signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of stem/progenitor cells and the regulation of glial versus neuronal identity. To study the effect of Notch signaling on Hh-activated neural progenitors, we inactivated both Patched1 and Rbpj, a transcriptional mediator of Notch signaling, in Nestin positive cells of the neocortex.Our data indicate that by mid neurogenesis (embryonic day 14.5), attenuation of Notch signaling reverses the effect of Patched1 deletion on neurogenesis by restoring the balance between symmetric proliferative and neurogenic divisions. Hence, our results demonstrate that correct corticogenesis is an outcome of the interplay between the Hh and Notch signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2017999389,"Ras and Rap small GTPases are important for synaptic plasticity and memory. However, their roles in homeostatic plasticity are unknown. Here, we report that polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2), a homeostatic suppressor of overexcitation, governs the activity of Ras and Rap via coordination of their regulatory proteins. Plk2 directs elimination of Ras activator RasGRF1 and Rap inhibitor SPAR via phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. Conversely, Plk2 phosphorylation stimulates Ras inhibitor SynGAP and Rap activator PDZGEF1. These Ras/Rap regulators perform complementary functions to downregulate dendritic spines and AMPA receptors following elevated activity, and their collective regulation by Plk2 profoundly stimulates Rap and suppresses Ras. Furthermore, perturbation of Plk2 disrupts Ras and Rap signaling, prevents homeostatic shrinkage and loss of dendritic spines, and impairs proper memory formation. Our study demonstrates a critical role of Plk2 in the synchronized tuning of Ras and Rap and underscores the functional importance of this regulation in homeostatic synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1972486019,"Background Loss to follow-up (LTF) challenges the reporting of antiretroviral treatment (ART) programmes, since it encompasses patients alive but lost to programme and deaths misclassified as LTF. We describe LTF before and after correction for mortality in a primary care ART programme with linkages to the national vital registration system. Methods and Findings We included 6411 patients enrolled on ART between March 2001 and June 2007. Patients LTF with available civil identification numbers were matched with the national vital registration system to ascertain vital status. Corrected mortality and true LTF were determined by weighting these patients to represent all patients LTF. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression to describe LTF, mortality among those LTF, and true LTF. Of 627 patients LTF, 85 (28.8%) had died within 3 months after their last clinic visits. Respective estimates of LTF before and after correction for mortality were 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.2–7.6) and 4.3% (95% CI 3.5–5.3) at one year on ART, and 23.9% (95% CI 21.0–27.2) and 19.7% (95% CI 16.1–23.7) at 5 years. After correction for mortality, the hazard of LTF was reversed from decreasing to increasing with time on ART. Younger age, higher baseline CD4 count, pregnancy and increasing calendar year were associated with higher true LTF. Mortality of patients LTF at 1, 12 and 24 months after their last visits was respectively 23.1%, 30.9% and 43.8%; 78.0% of deaths occurred during the first 3 months after last visit and 45.0% in patients on ART for 0 to 3 months. Conclusions Mortality of patients LTF was high and occurred early after last clinic visit, especially in patients recently started on ART. Correction for these misclassified deaths revealed that the risk of true LTF increased over time. Research targeting groups at higher risk of LTF (youth, pregnant women and patients with higher CD4 counts) is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2080570422,"Excitatory synaptic transmission is modulated by inhibitory neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. We found that the synaptic transmission of somatic sensory afferents can be rapidly regulated by a presynaptically secreted protein, follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), which serves as a direct activator of Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA). The FSTL1 protein is highly expressed in small-diameter neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). It is transported to axon terminals via small translucent vesicles and secreted in both spontaneous and depolarization-induced manners. Biochemical assays showed that FSTL1 binds to the α1 subunit of NKA and elevates NKA activity. Extracellular FSTL1 induced membrane hyperpolarization in cultured cells and inhibited afferent synaptic transmission in spinal cord slices by activating NKA. Genetic deletion of FSTL1 in small DRG neurons of mice resulted in enhanced afferent synaptic transmission and sensory hypersensitivity, which could be reduced by intrathecally applied FSTL1 protein. Thus, FSTL1-dependent activation of NKA regulates the threshold of somatic sensation."
https://openalex.org/W1997032529,"Programmed cell death (PCD) associated with immunity is triggered when a plant disease resistance (R) protein recognizes a corresponding pathogen virulence protein. In tomato, detection by the host Pto kinase of the Pseudomonas syringae proteins AvrPto or AvrPtoB causes localized PCD. Previously, we reported that both MAPKKKα (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) and the tomato 14-3-3 protein 7 (TFT7) positively regulate Pto-mediated PCD in tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana. In addition, in contrast to MAPKKKα, TFT7 is required for PCD mediated by four other R proteins. Here we investigate why TFT7 is required for PCD induced by diverse R proteins in plants. We discovered that a MAPKK, SlMKK2, which acts downstream of SlMAPKKKα, also interacts with TFT7 in plant cells. Gene silencing experiments revealed that the orthologous genes of both SlMKK2 and TFT7 in N. benthamiana are required for PCD mediated by the same set of R proteins. SlMKK2 and its orthologs contain a 14-3-3 binding site in their N terminus, and Thr(33) in this site is required for interaction with TFT7 in vivo. Like the structurally similar human 14-3-3ε protein, TFT7 forms a homodimer in vivo. Because TFT7 interacts with both SlMAPKKKα and SlMKK2 and also forms a homodimer, we propose that TFT7 may coordinately recruit these client proteins for efficient signal transfer, leading to PCD induction."
https://openalex.org/W2074300393,"Nonmelanoma skin cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers in the United States. Chronic exposure to UVB irradiation is a major cause of this cancer. Daidzein, along with genistein, is a major isoflavone found in soybeans; however, little is known about the chemopreventive effects of daidzein and its metabolites in UVB-induced skin cancer. Here, we found that 7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone (THIF), a major metabolite of daidzein, effectively inhibits UVB-induced cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression through the inhibition of NF-κB transcription activity in mouse skin epidermal JB6 P+ cells. In contrast, daidzein had no effect on COX-2 expression levels. Data from Western blot and kinase assays showed that 7,3',4'-THIF inhibited Cot and MKK4 activity, thereby suppressing UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pull-down assays indicated that 7,3',4'-THIF competed with ATP to inhibit Cot or MKK4 activity. Topical application of 7,3',4'-THIF clearly suppressed the incidence and multiplicity of UVB-induced tumors in hairless mouse skin. Hairless mouse skin results also showed that 7,3',4'-THIF inhibits Cot or MKK4 kinase activity directly, resulting in suppressed UVB-induced COX-2 expression. A docking study revealed that 7,3',4'-THIF, but not daidzein, easily docked to the ATP binding site of Cot and MKK4, which is located between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase domain. Collectively, these results provide insight into the biological actions of 7,3',4'-THIF, a potential skin cancer chemopreventive agent."

We examined how the loss of CLC-3 might affect GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. An electrophysiological study of synaptic function in hippocampal slices taken from Clcn3(-/-) mice before the onset of neurodegeneration revealed a substantial decrease in the amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents compared with those in wild-type slices. We found that CLC-3 colocalized with the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Acidification of inhibitory synaptic vesicles induced by Cl(-) showed a marked dependence on CLC-3 expression. The decrease in inhibitory transmission in Clcn3(-/-) mice suggests that the neurotransmitter loading of synaptic vesicles was reduced, which we attribute to defective vesicular acidification. Our observations extend the role of Cl(-) in inhibitory transmission from that of a postsynaptic permeant species to a presynaptic regulatory element."

https://openalex.org/W2169766629,"Transcription regulation by histone modifications is a major contributing factor to the structural and functional diversity in biology. These modifications are encrypted as histone codes or histone languages and function to establish and maintain heritable epigenetic codes that define the identity and the fate of the cell. Despite recent advances revealing numerous histone modifications associated with transcription regulation, how such modifications dictate the process of transcription is not fully understood. Here we describe spatial and temporal analyses of the histone modifications that are introduced during estrogen receptor α (ERα)-activated transcription. We demonstrated that aborting RNA polymerase II caused a disruption of the histone modifications that are associated with transcription elongation but had a minimal effect on modifications deposited during transcription initiation. We also found that the histone H3S10 phosphorylation mark is catalyzed by mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) and is recognized by a 14-3-3ζ/14-3-3ε heterodimer through its interaction with H3K4 trimethyltransferase SMYD3 and the p52 subunit of TFIIH. We showed that H3S10 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for H3K4 trimethylation. In addition, we demonstrated that SET8/PR-Set7/KMT5A is required for ERα-regulated transcription and its catalyzed H4K20 monomethylation is implicated in both transcription initiation and elongation. Our experiments provide a relatively comprehensive analysis of histone modifications associated with ERα-regulated transcription and define the biological meaning of several key components of the histone code that governs ERα-regulated transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2067652111,"Actin is a key regulator of RNA polymerase (Pol) II-dependent transcription. Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a Cdk9/cyclin T1 heterodimer, has been reported to play a critical role in transcription elongation. However, the relationship between actin and P-TEFb is still not clear. In this study, actin was found to interact with Cdk9, a catalytic subunit of P-TEFb, in elongation complexes. Using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays, Cdk9 was found to bind to G-actin through the conserved Thr-186 in the T-loop. Overexpression and in vitro kinase assays showed that G-actin promotes P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain. An in vitro transcription experiment revealed that the interaction between G-actin and Cdk9 stimulated Pol II transcription elongation. ChIP and immobilized template assays indicated that actin recruited Cdk9 to a transcriptional template in vivo and in vitro. Using cytokine IL-6-inducible p21 gene expression system, we revealed that actin recruited Cdk9 to endogenous gene. Moreover, overexpression of actin and Cdk9 increased histone H3 acetylation and acetylized histone H3 binding to a transcriptional template through the interaction with histone acetyltransferase, p300. Taken together, our results suggested that actin participates in transcription elongation by recruiting Cdk9 for phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain, and the actin-Cdk9 interaction promotes chromatin remodeling. Actin is a key regulator of RNA polymerase (Pol) II-dependent transcription. Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a Cdk9/cyclin T1 heterodimer, has been reported to play a critical role in transcription elongation. However, the relationship between actin and P-TEFb is still not clear. In this study, actin was found to interact with Cdk9, a catalytic subunit of P-TEFb, in elongation complexes. Using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays, Cdk9 was found to bind to G-actin through the conserved Thr-186 in the T-loop. Overexpression and in vitro kinase assays showed that G-actin promotes P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain. An in vitro transcription experiment revealed that the interaction between G-actin and Cdk9 stimulated Pol II transcription elongation. ChIP and immobilized template assays indicated that actin recruited Cdk9 to a transcriptional template in vivo and in vitro. Using cytokine IL-6-inducible p21 gene expression system, we revealed that actin recruited Cdk9 to endogenous gene.

Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of EcN on Salmonella Typhimurium invasion of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, focusing on EcN effects on the various stages of Salmonella infection including intracellular and extracellular Salmonella growth rates, virulence gene regulation, and adhesion. We show that EcN affects the initial Salmonella invasion steps by modulating Salmonella virulence gene regulation and Salmonella SiiE-mediated adhesion, but not extra- and intracellular Salmonella growth. However, the inhibitory activity of EcN against Salmonella invasion always correlated with EcN adhesion capacities. EcN mutants defective in the expression of F1C fimbriae and flagellae were less adherent and less inhibitory toward Salmonella invasion. Another E. coli strain expressing F1C fimbriae was also adherent to IPEC-J2 cells, and was similarly inhibitory against Salmonella invasion like EcN. Conclusions We propose that EcN affects Salmonella adhesion through secretory components. This mechanism appears to be common to many E. coli strains, with strong adherence being a prerequisite for an effective reduction of SiiE-mediated Salmonella adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2027050701,"Cancer originates from cells that have acquired mutations in genes critical for controlling cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Often, tumors continue to depend on these so-called driver mutations, providing the rationale for targeted anticancer therapies. To date, large-scale sequencing analyses have revealed hundreds of mutations in human tumors. However, without their functional validation it remains unclear which mutations correspond to driver, or rather bystander, mutations and, therefore, whether the mutated gene represents a target for therapeutic intervention. In human colorectal tumors, the neurotrophic receptor TRKB has been found mutated on two different sites in its kinase domain (TRKB(T695I) and TRKB(D751N)). Another site, in the extracellular part of TRKB, is mutated in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (TRKB(L138F)). Lastly, our own analysis has identified one additional TRKB point mutation proximal to the kinase domain (TRKB(P507L)) in a human melanoma cell line. The functional consequences of all these point mutations, however, have so far remained elusive. Previously, we have shown that TRKB is a potent suppressor of anoikis and that TRKB-expressing cells form highly invasive and metastatic tumors in nude mice. To assess the functional consequences of these four TRKB mutations, we determined their potential to suppress anoikis and to form tumors in nude mice. Unexpectedly, both colon cancer-derived mutants, TRKB(T695I) and TRKB(D751N), displayed reduced activity compared to that of wild-type TRKB. Consistently, upon stimulation with the TRKB ligand BDNF, these mutants were impaired in activating TRKB and its downstream effectors AKT and ERK. The two mutants derived from human tumor cell lines (TRKB(L138F) and TRKB(P507L)) were functionally indistinguishable from wild-type TRKB in both in-vitro and in-vivo assays. In conclusion, we fail to detect any gain-of-function of four cancer-derived TRKB point mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2010867962,"Infection with multiple types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the main risk factors associated with the development of cervical lesions. In this study, cervical samples collected from 1,810 women with diverse sociocultural backgrounds, who attended to their cervical screening program in different geographical regions of Colombia, were examined for the presence of cervical lesions and HPV by Papanicolau testing and DNA PCR detection, respectively.The negative binomial distribution model used in this study showed differences between the observed and expected values within some risk factor categories analyzed. Particularly in the case of single infection and coinfection with more than 4 HPV types, observed frequencies were smaller than expected, while the number of women infected with 2 to 4 viral types were higher than expected. Data analysis according to a negative binomial regression showed an increase in the risk of acquiring more HPV types in women who were of indigenous ethnicity (+37.8%), while this risk decreased in women who had given birth more than 4 times (-31.1%), or were of mestizo (-24.6%) or black (-40.9%) ethnicity.According to a theoretical probability distribution, the observed number of women having either a single infection or more than 4 viral types was smaller than expected, while for those infected with 2-4 HPV types it was larger than expected. Taking into account that this study showed a higher HPV coinfection rate in the indigenous ethnicity, the role of underlying factors should be assessed in detail in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2069053268,"Entry into and progression through mitosis depends on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key substrates. In yeast, the nucleolar phosphatase Cdc14 is pivotal for exit from mitosis counteracting Cdk1-dependent phosphorylations. Whether hCdc14B, the human homolog of yeast Cdc14, plays a similar function in mitosis is not yet known. Here we show that hCdc14B serves a critical role in regulating progression through mitosis, which is distinct from hCdc14A. Unscheduled overexpression of hCdc14B delays activation of two master regulators of mitosis, Cdc25 and Cdk1, and slows down entry into mitosis. Depletion of hCdc14B by RNAi prevents timely inactivation of Cdk1/cyclin B and dephosphorylation of Cdc25, leading to severe mitotic defects, such as delay of metaphase/anaphase transition, lagging chromosomes, multipolar spindles and binucleation. The results demonstrate that hCdc14B-dependent modulation of Cdc25 phosphatase and Cdk1/cyclin B activity is tightly linked to correct chromosome segregation and bipolar spindle formation, processes that are required for proper progression through mitosis and maintenance of genomic stability."

In addition to substrate recognition to facilitate neurotrophic intoxication, BoNTs bind to dual host receptors that are specific to neurons (1Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). BoNT/A first binds a ganglioside on resting neurons, and upon fusion of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane, it binds to the luminal domain of the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein 2 (SV2) (16Dong M.

As the SV matures and acidifies, the translocation domain of the heavy chain (HCT) inserts into the SV membrane. Membrane-inserted HCT facilitates LC translocation into the cytosol, where LC cleaves plasma membrane-associated SNAP-25 (18Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although earlier studies reported the intracellular localization of ectopic expressed BoNT/A LC to the host plasma membrane (21Fernández-Salas E. Ho H. Garay P. Steward L.E. Aoki K.R. Mov. Disord. 2004; 19: S23-S34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Fernández-Salas E. Steward L.E. Ho H. Garay P.E. Sun S.W. Gilmore M.A. Ordas J.V. Wang J. Francis J. Aoki K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In this study, a new interaction between LC/A and SNAP-25 is identified that facilitates high affinity binding of LC/A to SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane of neurons. Neuro-2A cells were purchased from the ATCC (CCL131). pEGFP, pERFP, and pEYFP were purchased from Invitrogen. α-SNAP-25 IgG and α-myelin IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lipofectamine LTX was purchased from Invitrogen. Rat cerebral cortex was purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals and stored at −80 °C prior to processing. SuperSignal, Ultra TMB, and α-3xFLAG-HRP were purchased from Pierce Biochemicals. LC/A was expressed in Neuro-2A cells, as a GFP fusion protein within pEGFP. LC/A derivatives were constructed by PCR amplification of the indicated regions of LC/A and subcloning into pEGFP. YFP-SNAP-25 was engineered by subcloning the full length of SNAP-25(1–206) into pEYFP. RFP-LC/E was constructed by subcloning DNA encoding LC/E(1–418) into pERFP. Expression plasmids encoding LC/A, SNAP-25, and the respective truncated derivatives were constructed by PCR-amplifying DNA encoding LC/A, SNAP-25, and their different truncation mutations into pET-15b. Plasmids encoding these constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL or BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). Protein expression and purification were achieved as described previously (13Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neuro-2A cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 1.4% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by using Lipofectamine LTX as suggested by the manufacturer. Cells were fractionated as described previously (22Fernández-Salas E. Steward L.E. Ho H. Garay P.E. Sun S.W. Gilmore M.A. Ordas J.V. Wang J. Francis J. Aoki K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3208-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy (Leica), cells were cultured on 12-mm coverslips and transfected as indicated. Cells were fixed and subjected for immunostaining or imaged directly. Fluorescence was captured in grayscale; imaged colors may not match fusion protein fluorescence. Rat brain membranes were prepared as described previously (23Baldwin M.R. Barbieri J.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3200-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Membranes were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min to pellet rat brain cell membranes, which were suspended in PBS or extracted with detergent. Rat brain membrane was extracted in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. Proteins in the insoluble pellet were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm transfer and blocked in PBS with 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with 0.1 μm 3xFLAG-LC/A or 3xFLAG-LC/A(8–438) for 2 h at room temperature. After washes, membranes were incubated with mouse α-3xFLAG-HRP antibody (1:10,000 final dilution) and developed with SuperSignal. Recombinant SNAP-25 derivatives (100 μl at 5 μg/ml) in 50 mm Na2CO3 (pH 9.6) were added to 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times in PBS and then blocked with 50 mm Na2CO3 (pH 9.6) containing 1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After washes, 100 μl of 3xFLAG-LC/A or 3xFLAG-LC/A(8–438) (0.4–800 nm in PBS + 1% BSA) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed three times and incubated with mouse α-3xFLAG-HRP antibody (1:10000 final dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, and developed with 100 μl of Ultra TMB for 20 min at room temperature. Absorbance (450 nm) was read after quenching with 100 μl of 1 m H2SO4. A450 was plotted versus LC/A, and the k50 (amount of LC/A that bound 50% of SNAP-25) was determined. Linear velocity of SNAP-25 cleavage by LC/A and LC/A(8–438) was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing: 2 μm SNAP-25 derivatives and the indicated amounts of LC in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 20 mm NaCl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were assayed for the cleavage of substrate by densitometry. The percentage of substrate cleavage and the concentration of LCs were plotted, and the LCs required to cleave 50% of substrate were derived. Deletion mapping showed that N- and C-terminal regions of LC/A facilitated localization to the plasma membrane of Neuro-2A cells (Fig. 1). Upon ectopic expression, LC/A(1–438) localized primarily to the plasma membrane, whereas LC/A(1–425) localized to the plasma membrane and showed a diffuse cytoplasmic presence. Although this indicated that the C terminus (residues 426–438) contributed to membrane localization, deletions to the N terminus of LC/A had a greater effect on the plasma membrane association where LC/A(8–438) and LC/A(17–438) were present primarily within the cytoplasm. This indicated that the N-terminal 17 amino acids of LC/A contributed membrane localization. Subcellular fractionation showed that ∼90% of LC/A(1–438), 75% of LC/A(1–425), 35% of LC/A(8–438), and 5% of LC/A(17–438) were membrane-bound, supporting a primary role for the N terminus in plasma membrane localization (Fig. 1). Protein modeling showed that residues Lys6 and Lys11 of LC/A were surface-exposed and thus candidate residues for interactions with the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Upon ectopic expression, LC/A(K6A,K11A) was present as a diffuse cytoplasmic protein in Neuro-2A cells with ∼50% of LC/A(K6A,K11A) located in the cytoplasm. Because LC/A(17–438) was not catalytically active, LC/A(8–438) was used as the representative N-terminal deletion protein. Far Western analysis of detergent-extracted rat brain membranes showed that LC/A bound the membrane as a tight band at ∼25 kDa, whereas LC-A(8–438) did not show detectable binding to the membrane (Fig. 2). The background signal from LC/A was greater than LC/A(8–438). LC/MS-MS analysis of the band of membrane where LC/A bound identified two rat-specific proteins: SNAP-25 and myelin (Table 1). The membrane was next probed with α-SNAP-25 and α-myelin antibodies. α-SNAP-25 antibody bound at the site where LC/A bound the membrane, whereas myelin antibody bound to a faster migrating band and the signal was more diffuse than bound LC/A (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the N terminus of LC/A facilitates high affinity binding to SNAP-25, a previously unrecognized interaction.TABLE 1Identification of LC/A binding proteins in the rat brain plasma membrane lysatesProtein identifiedMassPeptides matchedDagi number 149023409, synaptosomal-associated protein 25272913gi number 8381631, myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein249481 Open table in a new tab A solid phase binding assay showed that LC/A bound SNAP-25 with a higher affinity (k50 ∼13 nm) than LC/A(8–438), which showed a k50 of ∼100 nm for SNAP-25 (Fig. 3). These data support a role for the N terminus of LC/A for high affinity binding to SNAP-25. Deletion mapping also localized the region(s) in SNAP-25 that contributed to high affinity binding to LC/A. Although truncation of the N-terminal 80 amino acids of SNAP-25 did not influence LC/A affinity, extending the truncation to the N-terminal 93 amino acids decreased LC/A affinity by ∼6-fold, and truncation of the N-terminal 110 amino acids had a greater effect on LC/A affinity (Fig. 4). This indicated that residues 80–110 of SNAP-25 contributed to high affinity binding to LC/A. The contribution of the C terminus of SNAP-25 for high affinity LC/A binding was also determined. Although LC/A bound SNAP-25(1–197) and SNAP-25(1–206) with similar affinity, LC/A had a lower affinity for SNAP-25(1–180) (Fig. 4). This indicated that contact with residues on adjacent sites to the scissile bond contributed to the high affinity of LC/A for SNAP-25. Thus, two regions (80–110 and 180–197) of SNAP-25 contribute to the high affinity binding to LC/A. Ectopic expression characterized LC localization within Neuro-2A cells. Initial experiments showed that GFP-LC/A colocalized with endogenous SNAP-25 or YFP-SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). A 4-amino acid mutation of SNAP-25(C85A,C88A,C90A,C92A) was engineered and observed to be expressed in the cytosol, consistent with palmitoylation at these cysteines being responsible for plasma membrane localization of SNAP-25 (24Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Coexpression of SNAP-25(C85A,C88A,C90A,C92A) with GFP-LC/A changed the localization of LC/A to the cytoplasm. Quantification showed that ∼90% of GFP-LC/A was plasma membrane-bound when coexpressed with SNAP-25, whereas ∼80% of GFP-LC/A was cytosolic when coexpressed with SNAP-25(C85A,C88A,C90A,C92A) (Fig. 5). These data support the direct intracellular binding of LC/A to SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane of neurons. Another experiment utilized the LC of BoNT/E (LC/E) to determine how SNAP-25 influenced the localization of LC/A in Neuro-2A cells. LC/E cleaves SNAP-25 between residues 180 and 181, which releases SNAP-25(1–180) into the cytosol (25Bajohrs M. Rickman C. Binz T. Davletov B. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1090-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Upon coexpression with LC/E, LC/A localization changed from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). Controls showed that the movement of LC/A from the cytoplasm was due to the enzymatic activity of LC/E because upon coexpression with LC/E(R347A,R349F), a catalytically inactive form of LC/E (26Agarwal R. Binz T. Swaminathan S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8291-8302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Binz T. Bade S. Rummel A. Kollewe A. Alves J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), LC/A remained plasma membrane-localized. Other controls showed that upon coexpression with the LC of Tetanus toxin or GFP, LC/A remained plasma membrane-localized. These experiments also supported the direct interaction of LC/A with SNAP-25 within cells. Experiments determined the influence of N terminus of LC/A on SNAP-25 cleavage. SNAP-25(40–206) was used as a substitute for full-length SNAP-25 because SNAP-25(40–206) is readily purified as a recombinant protein in E. coli (13Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). LC/A cleaved SNAP-25(40–206) ∼20-fold more efficiently than LC/A(8–438), whereas LC/A showed an ∼10-fold higher rate of SNAP-25(141–206) cleavage than LC/A(8–438) (Fig. 7). Thus, the N terminus of LC/A facilitates SNAP-25 cleavage through interactions with the N-terminal coiled residues of SNAP-25, with some N-terminal LC/A interactions with SNAP-25(146–206) also contributing to catalysis. Although earlier studies reported the intracellular localization of the LC of BoNT/A to the plasma membrane (21Fernández-Salas E. Ho H. Garay P. Steward L.E. Aoki K.R. Mov. Disord. 2004; 19: S23-S34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Fernández-Salas E. Steward L.E. Ho H. Garay P.E. Sun S.W. Gilmore M.A. Ordas J.V. Wang J. Francis J. Aoki K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3208-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the basis for plasma membrane association was not determined. The current study shows that LC/A binds directly to SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane of neurons. The LC/A-SNAP-25 interaction appears stable, with little detectable LC/A present in the cytoplasm. The N terminus of LC/A contributes to high affinity binding of LC/A to SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane and ultimately to the efficient cleavage of SNAP-25. Two interactions were detected, and high affinity binding of LC/A to SNAP-25 required the presence of residues 80–110 and 180–197 of SNAP-25. Identification of a SNAP-25 interaction with the N terminus of LC/A was not expected because BoNT/A or LC/A was previously to bind and utilize SNAP-25(146–206) as an efficient substrate for cleavage (13Chen S.

The role of the N terminus of LC/A in SNAP-25 binding/cleavage may not have been detected in the earlier studies due to the experimental conditions used. The interaction between the N terminus of LC/A and SNAP-25 residues 80–110 increased the efficiency of SNAP-25 cleavage, implicating a functional consequence for this interaction. The significance of the interaction between the N terminus of LC/A and SNAP-25 residues 80–110 may be related to the SNARE complex of which SNAP-25 is a component (Fig. 4d). Within neurons, SNAP-25 is associated with syntaxin 1a forming a pre-SNARE complex for VAMP-2 recruitment (29Pérez-Brangulí F. Ruiz-Montasell B. Blasi J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Washbourne P. Cansino V. Mathews J.R. Graham M. Burgoyne R.D. Wilson M.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the C terminus of SNAP-25 may not be accessible to LC/A because SNAP-25(1–87) and SNAP-25(131–206) form a double helix complex (31Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions of LC/A with the non-SNARE complex region of SNAP-25, residues 80–110, may allow LC/A initial access to SNAP-25 within the complex and compete with syntaxin 1a for SNAP-25 binding. The finding that LC/A localizes to the plasma membrane through direct interactions with SNAP-25 also provides a basis for the potency of BoNT/A within neurons. The recent finding that an N-terminal deletion to BoNT/A has reduced toxicity supports a role of the N terminus in substrate recognition (32Wang J. Zurawski T.H. Meng J. Lawrence G. Olango W.M.

This study also reported that the deletion of the N-terminal 7 amino acids of BoNT/A did not affect the longevity of SNAP-25 cleavage or neuromuscular paralysis, indicating that intracellular targeting to the plasma membrane does not influence LC half-life within a neuron. These studies are consistent with the recent determination that recognition by the proteasome contributes to LC stability within neurons (33Tsai Y.C. Maditz R. Kuo C.L. Fishman P.S. Shoemaker C.B.

The intracellular trafficking and localization of bacterial toxins within host cells have been reported for several exotoxins and type III effectors but remain a relatively under investigated field of study. The limited focus on intracellular trafficking of toxins may be due to the high sensitivity needed to detect this activity and earlier observations that both bacterial toxin and viruses, which often utilize similar entry strategies, can utilize multiple pathways to enter and traffic in host cells (34Watson P.

For example, exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses a KDEL-like endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence that is utilized to retrograde traffic from the early endosome to the endoplasmic reticulum where the catalytic domain is translocated into the cytosol to ADP-ribosylate elongation factor II (39Smith D.C.

Possibly more analogous to LC/A, we have reported that ExoS, a type III-delivered cytotoxin, traffics on the cytoplasmic face of endosomes to retrograde traffic to the endoplasmic reticulum. This trafficking facilitates the targeting of Ras and Rho GTPases (41Zhang Y. Deng Q. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol.

The unique property of the interaction between LC/A and SNAP-25 was that the interaction also enhanced the rate of substrate cleavage. This study provides insight toward understanding the mechanism of action of LC/A inside the neuron. These findings help explain the potency of BoNT/A by utilizing the substrate, SNAP-25, as an intracellular receptor to increase the efficiency of substrate cleavage. This is a layer of sophistication of BoNT action that has not been previously appreciated. Understanding the intracellular localization and substrate recognition of LC/A may provide insight into designing new therapeutics to neutralize BoNT intoxications.

https://openalex.org/W2085721588,"MKR mice, lacking insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling in skeletal muscle, are lean yet hyperlipidemic, hyperinsulinemic, and hyperglycemic, with severe insulin resistance and elevated hepatic and skeletal muscle levels of triglycerides. We have previously shown that chronic peripheral administration of the adipokine leptin improves hepatic insulin sensitivity in these mice independently of its effects on food intake. As central leptin signaling has been implicated in the control of peripheral glucose homeostasis, here we examined the ability of central intracerebroventricular leptin administration to affect energy balance and peripheral glucose homeostasis in non-obese diabetic male MKR mice. Central leptin significantly reduced food intake, body weight gain and adiposity, as well as serum glucose, insulin, leptin, free fatty acid and triglyceride levels relative to ACSF treated controls. These reductions were accompanied by increased fat oxidation as measured by indirect calorimetry, as well as increased oxygen consumption. Central leptin also improved glucose tolerance and hepatic insulin sensitivity determined using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps relative to pair fed vehicle treated controls, as well as increasing the rate of glucose disappearance. Hepatic vagotomy only partially reversed the ability of central leptin to improve glucose tolerance. These results demonstrate that central leptin dramatically improves insulin sensitivity independently of its effects on food intake, in a lean mouse model of type 2 diabetes. The findings also suggest that: 1) both hepatic vagal and non-vagal pathways contribute to this improvement, and 2) central leptin alters glucose disposal in skeletal muscle in this model."
https://openalex.org/W1979704967,"Tumor suppressor menin, the product of the MEN1 gene, plays a key role in controlling histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and gene transcription, which can regulate proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. However, little is known as to whether menin controls gene expression and cell proliferation and survival via regulating Polycomb group (PcG) protein complex/H3K27me3. Here we show that menin specifically represses transcription factor Paired box gene 2 (Pax2) through PcG-mediated H3K27me3 and Wilms tumor suppressor protein (WT1), a zinc finger domain-containing DNA-binding protein. Menin does not directly bind to the Pax2 locus, instead, it up-regulates WT1 expression. WT1 recruits PcG complex to the Pax2 promoter and represses expression of Pax2 through PcG-dependent H3K27me3. Moreover, WT1 also interacts with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and recruits DNMT1 to the Pax2 promoter, resulting in hypermethylation of CpG in the Pax2 promoter. Together, these studies have uncovered a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby menin regulates H3K27me3 and promoter DNA methylation via WT1 and suggest that WT1 protein plays an important, yet previously unappreciated role in regulating the function of the menin/PcG axis, H3K27 methylation, and DNA methylation, resulting in repression of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2022296847,"Vasoregression is a hallmark of vascular eye diseases but the mechanisms involved are still largely unknown. We have recently characterized a rat ciliopathy model which develops primary photoreceptor degeneration and secondary vasoregression. To improve the understanding of secondary vasoregression in retinal neurodegeneration, we used microarray techniques to compare gene expression profiles in this new model before and after retinal vasoregression. Differential gene expression was validated by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Of the 157 genes regulated more than twofold, the MHC class II invariant chain CD74 yielded the strongest upregulation, and was allocated to activated microglial cells close to the vessels undergoing vasoregression. Pathway clustering identified genes of the immune system including inflammatory signaling, and components of the complement cascade upregulated during vasoregression. Together, our data suggest that microglial cells involved in retinal immune response participate in the initiation of vasoregression in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2030003453,"Control of neuronal positioning is fundamental to normal brain development. However, the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that govern neuronal positioning remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that the spliced protein products of the transcriptional regulator SnoN, SnoN1 and SnoN2, harbor opposing functions in the coordinate regulation of neuronal branching and positioning. Knockdown of SnoN2 stimulates axon branching in primary neurons and impairs migration of granule neurons in the rat cerebellar cortex in vivo. By contrast, SnoN1 knockdown suppresses SnoN2 knockdown-induced neuronal branching and strikingly triggers excessive migration of granule neurons in the cerebellar cortex. We also find that SnoN1 forms a complex with the transcription factor FOXO1 that represses the X-linked lissencephaly gene encoding doublecortin (DCX). Accordingly, repression of DCX mediates the ability of SnoN1 to regulate branching in primary neurons and granule neuron migration in vivo. These data define an isoform-specific SnoN1-FOXO1 transcriptional complex that orchestrates neuronal branching and positioning in the brain with important implications for the study of developmental disorders of cognition and epilepsy."

Neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates and their deposition in senile plaques are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We observed that the overall content of αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein molecular chaperone, decreased in AD model mice in an age-dependent manner. We hypothesized that αB-crystallin protects cells against Aβ toxicity. To test this, we crossed αB-crystallin/HspB2 deficient (CRYAB⁻/⁻HSPB2⁻/⁻) mice with AD model transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein. Transgenic and non-transgenic mice in chaperone-sufficient or deficient backgrounds were examined for representative behavioral paradigms for locomotion and memory network functions: (i) spatial orientation and locomotion was monitored by open field test; (ii) sequential organization and associative learning was monitored by fear conditioning; and (iii) evoked behavioral response was tested by hot plate method. Interestingly, αB-crystallin/HspB2 deficient transgenic mice were severely impaired in locomotion compared to each genetic model separately. Our results highlight a synergistic effect of combining chaperone deficiency in a transgenic mouse model for AD underscoring an important role for chaperones in protein misfolding diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2046524202,"Orexin G protein-coupled receptors (OxRs) and their cognate agonists have been implicated in a number of disorders since their recent discovery, ranging from narcolepsy to formation of addictive behavior. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays of agonist-occupied OxRs provided evidence for a strong dose-dependent interaction with both trafficking proteins β-arrestin 1 and 2 that required unusually high agonist concentrations compared with inositol phosphate signaling. This appears to be reflected in functional differences in potency with respect to orexin A (OxA) and OxR2-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation after 90 min compared with 2 min, potentially consistent with β-arrestin-mediated versus G protein-mediated signaling, respectively. Furthermore, extended bioluminescence resonance energy transfer kinetic data monitoring OxA-dependent receptor-β-arrestin and β-arrestin-ubiquitin proximity suggested subtype-specific differences in receptor trafficking, with OxR2 activation resulting in more sustained receptor-β-arrestin-ubiquitin complex formation than elicited by OxR1 activation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data also revealed that OxR1 underwent significantly more rapid recycling compared with OxR2. Finally, we have observed sustained OxA-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of OxR2 compared with OxR1. Although both OxR subtypes could be classified as class B receptors for β-arrestin usage based on the initial strength of interaction with both β-arrestins, our temporal profiling revealed tangible differences between OxR subtypes. Consequently, OxR1 appears to fit uneasily into the commonly used β-arrestin classification scheme. More importantly, it is hoped that this improved profiling capability, enabling the subtleties of protein complex formation, stability, and duration to be assessed in live cells, will help unlock the therapeutic potential of targeting these receptors.

Agonist-induced GPCR activation promotes phosphorylation of intracellular serine/threonine residues of many GPCRs by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (8Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 465-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Typically, this event promotes recruitment of the multiadaptor proteins β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 (also known as arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, respectively) that results in desensitization of G protein-mediated signaling, and it generally provides a scaffold for internalization of the activated GPCR complex into endosomes inside the cell (9Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M.

Indeed, there is notable evidence for some receptors not preferentially internalizing with β-arrestins despite interacting with them (13Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A.

However, the majority of GPCRs appear to utilize β-arrestins at some stage in the trafficking process, and it appears that an important factor in determining the ultimate fate of the receptor-β-arrestin complex tends to be the strength of the receptor-β-arrestin interaction. In general terms, there are believed to be two possible outcomes for the GPCR following internalization. Resensitization may occur by dephosphorylation of the receptor complex allowing recycling back to the cell membrane. Alternatively, the complex may be targeted to late endosomes for proteosomal or lysosomal degradation (17Marchese A. Paing M.M. Temple B.R. Trejo J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 601-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that GPCR-β-arrestin complexes can act as scaffolds for alternative downstream kinase signaling pathways, such as Src tyrosine kinases, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, independently of G protein coupling of the receptors (18Luttrell L.M.

Importantly, this can alter the spatio-temporal nature of receptor-mediated kinase signaling (23Pouysségur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Further functional outcomes of activated GPCR complexes have been correlated with the stability of ubiquitination of both GPCRs and β-arrestins (24Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination involves a multistep process culminating in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a protein that is consequently targeted for degradation through either the 26 S proteasome or lysosomes (26Hislop J.N.

Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). However, it also appears that ubiquitin modification can also compartmentalize protein complexes directly, or through the binding of ubiquitin-binding elements, to host a range of other nonproteolytic processes. These include regulation of endocytosis and cellular signaling (28Hislop J.N. von Zastrow M. Traffic. 2011; 12: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Haglund K. Dikic I.

In addition, the state of these interactions seems to parallel the duration and magnitude of ERK1/2 phosphorylation through the scaffold activity exhibited by the multiadaptor protein properties of β-arrestin (34Ahn S.

Here, we show that both human orexin receptor subtypes interact with both β-arrestins 1 and 2 in an agonist dose-dependent manner but with 2 orders of magnitude lower potency than observed for G protein signaling. These potencies are lower than we have observed for other GPCRs interacting with β-arrestins. Furthermore, this difference is reflected in a potency shift between early (2 min) and late (90 min) OxA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation that is likely to result from predominantly G protein-mediated versus predominantly β-arrestin-mediated signaling, respectively (34Ahn S.

Furthermore, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) data indicate that the nature of the receptor-arrestin-ubiquitin complex differs between OxR subtypes, with OxA-induced BRET kinetics for proximity between receptor and β-arrestin or β-arrestin and ubiquitin correlating with the kinetics of both receptor recycling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Venus was kindly provided by Atsushi Miyawaki (RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-city, Japan), and Rluc8 was kindly provided by Andreas Loening and Sanjiv Gambhir (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). cDNA encoding ubiquitin (Addgene plasmid 11928) (38Dantuma N.P. Groothuis T.A. Salomons F.A. Neefjes J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was similarly subcloned into a Venus (no stop codon)-pcDNA3.1+ vector. Because of the ability of ubiquitin to form polyubiquitin chains, lysine residues at positions 48 and 63 were mutated to alanine. This has been done previously when BRET assays involving ubiquitin have been carried out, to avoid the potential for multiple acceptor moieties causing quenching or interference phenomena (39Perroy J. Pontier S. Charest P.G. Aubry M. Bouvier M. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fusion cDNA constructs were verified by ABI Prism BigDye terminator sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Brisbane, Australia) and compared with published sequence data. Ligands used were OxA and OxB (American Peptide Company). COS-7, HEK293, and HEK293FT cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and complete media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.3 mg/ml glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen)). HEK293FT media also contained geneticin (G418; 400 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Transfections were carried out 24 h after cell seeding using GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 stable cell lines were maintained in 400–500 μg/ml G418. COS-7 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 700,000 cells/dish, and total inositol phosphate production was measured as described previously (37Pfleger K.D. Dromey J.R. Dalrymple M.B. Lim E.M. Thomas W.G. Eidne K.A. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). COS-7 or HEK293FT cells transfected 48 h earlier were harvested and prepared as described previously in white 96-well plates (Nunc) (37Pfleger K.D. Dromey J.R. Dalrymple M.B. Lim E.M. Thomas W.G. Eidne K.A. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For BRET1 dose-response assays, coelenterazine h substrate was added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and analysis was carried out immediately. Samples were incubated for 5 min in the presence of various concentrations of agonist and then measured for four sequential reads. For extended BRET (eBRET) assays, cells were resuspended in HEPES-buffered (25 mm) phenol-red free DMEM with 5% FCS to maintain viability. EnduRenTM substrate (Promega) was added to each well at a final concentration of 60 μm. Cells were left for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in order for the cell-permeable substrate to equilibrate. Samples were sequentially read using either a MithrasTM LB940 luminescence plate reader (Berthold) or VICTOR LightTM 1420 luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using appropriate filter sets as detailed below. eBRET kinetics were measured for ∼30 min to obtain a basal signal. Cells were then treated with vehicle or ligand and read continuously for several hours. BRET ratios for β-arrestin recruitment to OxRs were calculated by subtracting the ratio of >500 nm emission over the 400–475-nm emission for a cell sample containing only the Rluc construct from the same ratio for a sample containing both the Rluc and EGFP fusion proteins as described previously (37Pfleger K.D.

The ligand-induced BRET signal for β-arrestin-ubiquitin proximity was calculated by subtracting the ratio of 520–540-nm emission over the 400–475-nm emission for a vehicle-treated cell sample containing both Rluc8 and Venus fusion proteins from the same ratio for a second aliquot of the same cells that was treated with ligand as described previously (40Kocan M.

The final pretreatment reading is presented at the zero time point (time of ligand or vehicle addition). HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 650,000 cells/well, and confocal microscopy procedures were carried out as described previously (37Pfleger K.D. Dromey J.R. Dalrymple M.B. Lim E.M. Thomas W.G. Eidne K.A. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). OxR constructs were generated with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag incorporated at the N terminus of OxR1 and OxR2. Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing either HA-OxR1 or HA-OxR2 were plated into 24-well plates at 200,000 cells/well with complete media. The next day, media were removed, and 0.5 ml of media containing a 1:2500 dilution of anti-HA serum (raised in rabbit and generously provided by S. Schulz, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Jena, Germany) was added to wells. Cells were then incubated with antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Media were removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of media containing OxA. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). They were then fixed in 0.5 ml of Zamboni's fixative at room temperature for ∼30 min, either immediately (0 min washout) or following incubation for 20, 40, or 60 min in media. Fixative was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS before adding 0.5 ml of PBS containing secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish-peroxidase-linked whole antibody raised in donkey; Amersham Biosciences). Secondary antibody was diluted 1:2000. Samples were incubated at room temperature with gentle rocking for ∼2 h. Finally, cells were washed twice with PBS before 250 μl of horseradish peroxidase substrate 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma) was added to wells and incubated at room temperature with rocking for ∼15 min. 200-μl aliquots were then transferred to a clear-bottomed 96-well plate, and samples were measured at 405 nm using an Envision 2102 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All treatments were performed in triplicate, and each assay included a primary antibody control. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was measured using the SureFire ERK1/2 phosphorylation kit (TGR Biosciences) with IgG Protein A AlphaScreen donor/acceptor beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (41Lee H.J.

HEK293 cells stably expressing OxR cDNA constructs were seeded in white 96-well plates (Nunc) at a density of 60,000 cells/well in serum-free DMEM. After 16 h, media were replaced, and treatments were carried out 1 h later. Treated cells were assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and samples were measured using an Envision 2102 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data were presented and analyzed using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad). Sigmoidal dose-response curves were fitted to the data for inositol phosphate production, β-arrestin recruitment to OxRs, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation using nonlinear regression. Statistical comparisons of logEC50 values and recycling time course data were assessed using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test analysis or Student's t test where appropriate. Statistical significance for eBRET and ERK1/2 phosphorylation kinetic data was determined using a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test analysis. Wild type (WT) and EGFP-tagged human OxR constructs for both subtypes were able to induce robust inositol phosphate production in the presence of either orexin ligand. In response to OxA or OxB treatment, the signaling potencies of EGFP-tagged OxR1 and OxR2 constructs were not significantly different from respective WT receptors (Table 1). As expected, a nanomolar effective concentration of agonist was shown to elicit a half-maximal response for OxA at OxR1 and OxR2, as well as OxB at OxR2. Additionally, the potency of OxB was substantially lower at OxR1 compared with that observed with OxA at OxR1 or OxB at OxR2, as has been similarly observed for G protein-mediated Ca2+ signaling (4Sakurai T.

Open table in a new tab BRET EC50 values for OxR-β-arrestin proximity were found to be 2 orders of magnitude higher (Table 2) than the EC50 values observed for inositol phosphate production (Table 1). These data were generated using COS-7 cells; however, similar BRET EC50 values were observed using HEK293FT cells (data not shown). The use of phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin mutants had little effect, indicating that receptor phosphorylation was not generally a limiting factor under these conditions. A small but significant difference in potency was observed for OxR1 compared with OxR2 in COS-7 cells treated with OxA (Table 2). This was also observed with the phosphorylation-independent mutants. Again, similar observations were made with HEK293FT cells, although the differences between receptors treated with OxA were not statistically significant in these cells (data not shown).TABLE 2EC50 data for BRET OxR-β-arrestin proximity dose-response assaysOxR1 EC50OxR2 EC50nmnmOxAβ-Arrestin 1-WT777.0 ± 54.6ap < 0.05 compared with OxR2.375.9 ± 121.5β-Arrestin 2-WT719.4 ± 102.2ap < 0.05 compared with OxR2.214.7 ± 75.7β-Arrestin 1-R169E412.1 ± 44.1ap < 0.05 compared with OxR2.138.7 ± 22.7bp < 0.05 compared with the respective β-arrestin WT.

Note that as EC50 values for OxB-induced OxR1 proximity with β-arrestin 1 or 2 WT were too high to determine, statistical comparisons involving these values could not be carried out. Open table in a new tab BRET EC50 values for OxR2 proximity to mutant β-arrestins in the presence of OxB were significantly less than those observed for OxR1 paired with the same β-arrestins (Table 2). BRET EC50 values for OxR1 proximity to WT β-arrestins treated with OxB could not be obtained, as sufficiently high concentrations of OxB could not be tested (Table 2). This indicates substantially lower potency than at OxR2, even if statistical analysis is precluded. OxB BRET EC50 values for OxR2 proximity to β-arrestins were not significantly different than respective EC50 values from OxA dose-response analyses. The β-arrestin proximity potency shift observed between the different OxR subtypes activated by OxB (Table 2) appears to reflect that observed for inositol phosphate production (Table 1), which in turn reflects published differences in OxB binding affinity at the two receptors (4Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.S.

Therefore, for the remainder of the study, we focused our attention on investigating potential differences between the OxR subtypes when activated by OxA, which has similar binding affinity (4Sakurai T.

Following treatment with 1 μm OxA, COS-7 cells transfected with BRET-tagged pairs of OxR and β-arrestin subtypes elicited a robust initial increase in BRET response (Fig. 1, A and B). The response was similarly observed for all OxR-β-arrestin combinations, although slightly heightened for OxR interactions with β-arrestin 2. However, subsequent kinetics differed between OxR subtypes. OxR2-expressing cells displayed a significantly more stable BRET signal with both β-arrestins in comparison with OxR1 over 4 h of continual stimulation with OxA. A significant divergence between OxR subtype kinetic profiles was observed after 67 min for β-arrestin 1 (p < 0.05; Fig. 1A), and 75 min for β-arrestin 2 (p < 0.05; Fig. 1B) and continued over"
https://openalex.org/W2098722551,"Retinal hemorrhages have been described as a component of high altitude retinopathy (HAR) in association with altitude illness. In this prospective high altitude study, we aimed to gain new insights into the pathophysiology of HAR and explored whether HAR could be a valid early indicator of altitude illness.28 mountaineers were randomly assigned to two ascent profiles during a research expedition to Mt. Muztagh Ata (7546 m/24,751 ft). Digital fundus photographs were taken prior to expedition at 490 m (1,607 ft), during expedition at 4497 m (14,750 ft = base camp), 5533 m (18,148 ft), 6265 m (20,549 ft), 6865 m (22,517 ft) and 4.5 months thereafter at 490 m. Number, size and time of occurrence of hemorrhages were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and hematocrit were also assessed. 79% of all climbers exhibited retinal hemorrhages during the expedition. Number and area of retinal bleeding increased moderately to medium altitudes (6265 m). Most retinal hemorrhages were detected after return to base camp from a high altitude. No post-expeditional ophthalmic sequelae were detected. Significant negative (SpO₂ Beta: -0.4, p<0.001) and positive (hematocrit Beta: 0.2, p = 0.002, time at altitude Beta: 0.33, p = 0.003) correlations with hemorrhages were found.When closely examined, a very large amount of climbers exhibit retinal hemorrhages during exposure to high altitudes. The incidence of retinal hemorrhages may be greater than previously appreciated as a definite time lag was observed between highest altitude reached and development of retinal bleeding. Retinal hemorrhages should not be considered warning signs of impending severe altitude illness due to their delayed appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2033679556,"SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases are crucial regulators of cell cycle progression. As the F-box protein is the substrate-specifying subunit of this family of ligases, their availability dictates the timing and the location of the ubiquitination of substrates. We report here our investigation into the regulation of the localization of F-box proteins, in particular Fbxo7, whose mislocalization is associated with human disease. We identified a motif in Fbxo7 that we have characterized as a functional leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES), and which allowed binding to the nuclear export protein, exportin 1 (CRM1). Unusually, the NES was embedded within the F-box domain, which is bound by Skp1 and enables the F-box protein to form part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The NES of Fbxo7 controlled its localization and was conserved in Fbxo7 homologues in other species. Skp1 binding prevented Fbxo7 from contacting CRM1. We propose that this competitive binding allowed Fbxo7 to accumulate within the nucleus starting at the G1/S transition. More than ten other F-box proteins also contain an NES at the same location in their F-box domains, indicating that this competitive binding mechanism may contribute to the regulation of a sixth of the known F-box proteins.

Many complex biological processes are regulated by the timely synthesis and degradation of cellular proteins. The degradation of proteins can help ensure irreversibility and thus the unidirectionality of processes like the cell cycle. Proteins are marked for degradation by the covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains, targeting them to the proteasomes for destruction. This post-translational modification is carried out by E3 ubiquitin ligases including those of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) 2The abbreviations used are: SCF, Skp1-Cullin-F-box; FBP, F-box protein; FBD, F-box domain; NES, nuclear export sequence; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; Ubl, ubiquitin-like domain; FP domain, Fbxo7-PI31 domain; LMB, leptomycin B; N, nuclear; C, cytoplasmic; PD, Parkinson disease; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine. family. The specificity of these enzymes is determined by their associated F-box protein (FBP). Functioning as adaptors, FBPs bind the Skp1 component of the SCF using a conserved 50 amino acid motif known as the F-box domain (FBD) and recruit post-translationally modified protein substrates to the holoenzyme for ubiquitination via additional protein-protein interaction domains (1Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The FBP superfamily is separated into several different subclasses based on their interaction domains (2Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 3Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The Fbxw proteins contain WD-40 repeats, and Fbxl proteins contain leucine-rich repeats. The remaining FBPs containing other or unclassified interaction domains are designated Fbxo. The activity of FBPs can be controlled by restricting them to a certain subcellular compartment, bringing them to or restricting them from their substrates. This can be achieved by a number of different methods. For example, the localization of Fbxw7 is controlled by differential splicing (4Welcker M. Orian A. Grim J.E. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The α isoform contains at least two redundant nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and is largely nuclear, whereas the β isoform contains an N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain and is permanently anchored in the cytoplasm. The γ isoform contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS), which is present in all three isoforms but is overridden by dominant targeting signals in the other isoforms. Only the Fbxw7γ isoform is able to counteract the growth-promoting properties of the c-Myc oncogene in the nucleolus (4Welcker M. Orian A. Grim J.E. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There is also some evidence to suggest that reversible modification of FBPs can regulate their localization. For example, Skp2/Fbxl1 localization is controlled by phosphorylation. It has been shown that phosphorylation of Skp2/Fbxl1 at Ser-72 during M phase may trigger its export to the cytoplasm affecting its ability to form functional SCF complexes (5Gao D. Inuzuka H.

Fbxo7 is remarkable in that it operates as a conventional SCF adaptor, stimulating ubiquitination of proteins substrates (which include hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) (12Chang Y.F.

It is this property of Fbxo7 that enables it to transform immortalized murine fibroblasts, which are capable of forming tumors when injected into athymic nude mice. Fbxo7 may also be a human proto-oncogene, and it has been shown to be overexpressed in various human cancers including lung and colon carcinomas (10Laman H. Funes J.M. Ye H. Henderson S.

In addition to increases in its expression level, the mislocalization of Fbxo7 may also contribute to its role in cancer. We reported Fbxo7 as having a predominantly cytoplasmic localization in cultured cell lines; however, it was found to be enriched in nuclei of more than half of human colon carcinoma biopsies (10Laman H. Funes J.M. Ye H. Henderson S. Galinanes-Garcia L. Hara E. Knowles P. McDonald N. Boshoff C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3104-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This pronounced nuclear localization may enable its participation in pathogenic signaling pathways. In this study, we sought to understand the mechanisms controlling Fbxo7 localization, and how it is regulated in cell cycle. Our results demonstrated that the subcellular localization of Fbxo7 and a subset of FBPs was regulated by a functional NES embedded within the FBD, which set up a competitive relationship between Skp1 and CRM1 binding. This also contributed to the maintenance of a net cytoplasmic localization of Fbxo7 and at least two other FBPs with this NES/FBD configuration. U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were obtained from Cancer Research UK (LRI Cell Production), T98G human glioblastoma cells and 293T human embryonic kidney cells were kind gifts from Dr. Koichi Ichimura and Prof. Chris Boshoff, respectively. Cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA Laboratories, GmbH), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. T98G cells were induced to enter G0 by contact inhibition coupled with 72 h of starvation in growth medium containing 0.1% FCS. Cells were stimulated to re-enter cell cycle by seeding cells at lower density into medium containing 10% FCS. pcDNA3 vectors expressing N-terminal Flag or T7 epitope fusions to Fbxo7 (full-length isoform 1 (1–522), truncated, or ΔF-box) and to Skp1 have previously been described (10Laman H.

PCR mutagenesis was used to create Fbxo7-NESmt and Fbxo7-H1mt alleles, which were cloned into pGEX-(KG) vectors (Invitrogen). Transfections of plasmid DNA were performed using GeneJuice (Merck Biosciences) 24 h after cells were seeded onto glass or tissue culture-treated plastic. Plasmid constructs for the expression of FBPs as fluorescent fusions with Venus as a C-terminal tag were generated in the following way: the Venus cDNA sequence was subcloned from pCS2-Venus (a gift from Prof. Atsushi Miyawaki, RIKEN Institute, Japan), into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), replacing the EGFP gene. Sequences encoding Fbxo7 (1–522), Fbxo7 (1–522)-ΔF-box, Fbxo7 (1–522)-NESmt and Fbxo7 (1–522)-H1mt were then cloned into this pVenus-N1 plasmid. Sequences encoding full-length Fbxo2 (1–296) or (89–296) which removed the FBD from Fbxo2, were amplified by PCR from pYFP-Fbxo2 (from Chi-Yong Eom, Korea Basic Science Institute) and cloned into pVenus-N1. Sequence encoding full-length Fbxo4 (1–387) or (100–387), which removed the FBD from Fbxo4 were amplified by PCR from an Fbxo4 IMAGE clone (Source BioScience plc) and cloned into pVenus-N1. All clones generated by PCR were sequenced fully. The FUCCI lentiviral vector pCSII-EF-MCS-mAG-geminin, (a gift from Prof. Atsushi Miyawaki, RIKEN Institute, Japan) encodes a truncation of human geminin (1–110) fused to monomeric Azami green protein (mAG). This construct was transfected into 293T cells, and the lentiviruses produced by these cells were used to infect U2OS cells. Cells expressing mAG-geminin were separated and collected by FACS and single cell cloned. For fluorescence imaging of fixed samples, cells were grown on glass coverslips prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with ice-cold methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. Staining for Flag epitopes was achieved using anti-Flag antibodies (F3165, Sigma) and with anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor488 or AlexaFluor555 fluorescent dyes (Invitrogen). DNA was stained using Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Fixed cells were imaged using an Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss). Images were captured using an AxioCam MRm digital camera (Carl Zeiss) driven by AxioVision 4.6.3 software (Carl Zeiss). For live imaging experiments, cell were grown in 35 mm coverslip dishes and visualized with a Zeiss Axiovert widefield fluorescence microscope equipped with a heated stage, humidity chamber and CO2 supply. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Images were acquired using a C4742–95 ORCA 100 digital camera (Hamamatsu) and AQM Advance software 6 (Kinetic Imaging). Single cell measurements of Hoechst 33342 and mAG fluorescence were obtained from thresholded images by delineating regions of interest around cell nuclei in Image J (NIH), recording the integrated intensity value for each cell. Fluorescence intensity is displayed as arbitrary units. Cells were transfected using GeneJuice (Merck Biosciences), and 48 h later were pulsed for 1 h with the nucleoside analog, EdU, prior to harvesting and fixation. EdU incorporation was detected using the Click-iT EdU Flow Cytometry Assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Samples were analyzed using a FACS CyAn ADP with Summit Software. FACS data were gated to include only single cells expressing EGFP which was used as a marker of transfection. T98G and U2OS cells were fractionated by resuspending in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT with protease inhibitors. Triton X-100 was added at 0.1% (v/v). Cells were incubated on ice for 5 min, and lysates were centrifuged at 1,200 rcf at 4 °C for 4 min. Pelleted nuclei were lysed in RIPA buffer. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and pre-cleared with a 1:1 mix of protein A and protein G-Sepharose beads. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation with anti-Flag M2 agarose (Sigma). Beads were washed four times with NET2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitates were then boiled in 4× Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Bi-cistronic expression vectors expressing recombinant GST-tagged alleles of human Fbxo7 and Skp1 have been previously described (15Kirk R. Laman H. Knowles P.P. Murray-Rust J. Lomonosov M.

For the protein expression, vectors were transformed into FB810 Escherichia coli. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 250 μm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using lysozyme and sonication in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using glutathione-Sepharose beads. T7-tagged Fbxo7 proteins were synthesized using TnT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System® (Promega) and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Beads were washed four times with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm NaCl). The beads were boiled in 4× Laemmli buffer and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting. Antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays (IFA) were as follows: actin (A2066, Sigma), E2F1 (sc-193, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Fbxo7 (previously described (10Laman H. Funes J.M. Ye H. Henderson S. Galinanes-Garcia L. Hara E. Knowles P. McDonald N. Boshoff C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3104-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), Flag (F3165, Sigma), GFP (3EI, Cancer Research UK), MEK-1 (sc-6250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p27 (sc-528, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and T7 (69522, Novagen). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies raised against rabbit and mouse IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, respectively. Amino acid sequences were analyzed using NetNES 1.1 Server to detect putative NES motifs (16la Cour T. Kiemer L. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The software uses a hidden Markov model and an artificial neural network to analyze amino acid sequences and generate an “NES score” for each residue. Amino acids with a score exceeding a given threshold are expected to participate in an NES. We have previously reported in experiments utilizing a fluorescent fusion protein of dsRED to the C terminus of Fbxo7 that in an asynchronous population of live cells, its localization is predominantly cytoplasmic and that it can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (10Laman H. Funes J.M. Ye H. Henderson S. Galinanes-Garcia L. Hara E. Knowles P. McDonald N. Boshoff C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3104-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fbxo7 localization was further investigated using an N-terminal Flag epitope-tagged Fbxo7 construct, which was transfected into U2OS cells, which were fixed and subjected to indirect IFAs. We found that a small number of cells had Fbxo7 localized predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 1A), indicating that Fbxo7 can accumulate in the nucleus. To investigate the dynamics of Fbxo7 subcellular localization, U2OS cells expressing a fluorescent Fbxo7-Venus fusion protein were treated with the nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB) and the localization of the fusion protein was monitored in live cells over a 24 h period. Surprisingly, the rate of LMB-induced nuclear accumulation of Fbxo7-Venus was slow, taking up to 24 h for nuclear fluorescence to exceed that of cytoplasmic fluorescence in most cells (Fig. 1, B and C). This was much slower than seen for other proteins such as NF-κB which is also exported from the nucleus in a CRM1-dependent manner (17Nelson G. Paraoan L. Spiller D.G. Wilde G.J. Browne M.A. Djali P.K. Unitt J.F. Sullivan E. Floettmann E. White M.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This slow nuclear accumulation of Fbxo7 after LMB treatment might indicate that its translocation was influenced by the cell cycle. To see whether the rate of Fbxo7 nuclear import to export changed as cells progressed through the cell cycle, live cell imaging was used to monitor individual Fbxo7-Venus-expressing cells growing normally in culture. In some cells, a clear shift in bulk Fbxo7 localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus took place over a period of a few hours (Fig. 1D), suggesting that at a particular point in the cell cycle the rate of export had decreased, or the rate of import increased, allowing nuclear accumulation. We then investigated whether the shift in Fbxo7 localization was correlated with a particular phase of the cell cycle. Human glioblastoma cells (T98G) were made quiescent by contact inhibition and serum starvation and then stimulated to synchronously re-enter the cell cycle by seeding at lower density into medium containing full serum (18Stein G.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 99: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at different time points post release from quiescence and used to produce either whole-cell protein lysates or nuclear- and cytoplasmic-enriched fractions, which were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). While we saw only a very subtle increase in the total levels of Fbxo7 as cells re-entered the cell cycle, a clear increase in its nuclear concentration was observed, starting at 10 h post release. This coincided with other markers of the G1/S phase transition, including a decrease in nuclear p27 levels and a marked increase in E2F1 levels at 15 h post release. Together these data indicate that the increase in nuclear Fbxo7 occurred around the G1/S phase transition. However, no changes in the total levels or in the nuclear concentrations of Skp1, the SCF-recruiting component, at the G1/S transition were observed, indicating that there was no net change in the levels or localization of the total pool of SCF complexes during the cell cycle. To further investigate when this shift in Fbxo7 localization occurred, an S/G2 phase marker, mAG-geminin, from the fluorescence ubiquitin cell cycle indicator system (FUCCI) (19Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A. Hama H. Osawa H. Kashiwagi S. Fukami K. Miyata T. Miyoshi H. Imamura T. Ogawa M. Masai H. Miyawaki A. Cell. 2008; 132: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar) was utilized. The fusion protein, mAG-geminin, is unstable in early G1 but accumulates throughout the remainder of the cell cycle after the G1/S transition. In clonal U2OS cells stably expressing mAG-geminin, mAG fluorescence intensity correlated with total cellular DNA content, as measured by quantification of Hoechst staining. This indicated that the combination of the mAG-geminin and Hoechst staining could be used to distinguish between cells in G1 or in S/G2 phase (Fig. 1F). The mAG-geminin-expressing U2OS cells were transiently transfected with Flag-Fbxo7 (1–522) and assayed by IFA staining for the Flag epitope to track Fbxo7 localization during the cell cycle (Fig. 1G). In cells where staining for Flag-Fbxo7 was predominantly cytoplasmic, Hoechst, and mAG fluorescence was low, consistent with cells being in early G1 phase (Fig. 1H). In those cells were Fbxo7 staining was evenly distributed or predominantly nuclear, cells expressed higher levels of mAG-geminin and had increased Hoechst staining, consistent with being in S/G2 phase. Together these data strongly suggest that Fbxo7 was cytoplasmic during G0/G1 and accumulated in the nucleus as cells transited into S/G2 phase. To identify sequence motifs that regulated Fbxo7 localization, we undertook a systematic analysis of the primary sequence of Fbxo7. Although no canonical nuclear localization sequences could be identified, three candidate motifs were identified that closely conformed to an NES consensus: Φ-x2–3-Φ-x2–3-Φ-x-Φ, where Φ is Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, or Met and x is any amino acid (Fig. 2A, indicated with arrows). These were located within the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain at amino acids 69–78, within the FP dimerization domain at amino acids 199–208, and within the FBD at amino acid 332–341. As well as scrutinizing the primary sequence, the NES recognition software, NetNES 1.1 Server (16la Cour T. Kiemer L. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), was used to analyze and predict whether any of these putative NESs was likely to be functional. Only NES3 contained amino acids exceeding the “NES score” threshold, indicating that it was highly likely to be functional. To begin to test the activity of these NESs in vivo, Flag-tagged truncation mutants of Fbxo7 that removed one or more of the putative NESs (239–522, 169–398, and ΔF-box) were transfected in U2OS cells, which were then fixed and assayed for the presence of the Flag epitope. Transfected cells were visualized by microscopy and at least 400 cells were scored as having predominantly cytoplasmic (C>N), predominantly nuclear (C<N), or an equivalent (C = N) signal intensity. This experiment revealed that the mutant lacking the FBD showed a dramatic change in its localization, becoming predominantly nuclear in 90% of cells, as compared with WT (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the Fbxo7 mutants lacking either NES1 or NES1 and NES2, showed a subcellular distribution similar to WT Fbxo7 (Fig. 2B). The fact that the deletion of the FBD alone resulted in such a dramatic change to protein localization suggested that NES3 was the only functional NES and largely responsible for the export of Fbxo7 from the nucleus. To verify this finding in live cells, fusions of WT or ΔF-box mutant Fbxo7 to Venus fluorescent protein were generated and transfected into U2OS cells. Consistent with the results in fixed cells, the Fbxo7 (ΔF-box)-Venus protein was found to be predominantly nuclear in the majority of cells as compared with Fbxo7-Venus, which was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 2, C and D). These data suggest that the mostly cytoplasmic localization of WT Fbxo7 was due to sequences within the FBD, which bring about its export from the nucleus. To determine the capacity of NES3 to bring about nuclear export, we tested its ability to influence the localization of a protein other than Fbxo7. To achieve this, a fluorescent reporter protein, consisting of two Venus proteins separated by NES3 was created. This reporter protein was of sufficient size to prevent its diffusion across the nuclear membrane, and the synthesis of the full-length fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The Venus-NES3-Venus protein was expressed in U2OS cells and visualized in live cells. As can be seen in Fig. 2E, it was excluded from the nucleus; moreover, the cytoplasmic localization of this protein was not due to its inability to enter the nucleus, as evidenced by the fact that LMB treatment induced its accumulation in the nucleus. These data argue that NES3 alone was sufficient to mediate nuclear export. NES sequences function by direct interaction with the nuclear export receptor, CRM1. The ability of Fbxo7 to bind to CRM1 was therefore tested using in vitro binding assays. GST alone and a GST fusion protein to CRM1 were produced in bacteria (Fig. 2F) and tested for their ability to interact with full-length Fbxo7 (1–522) and Fbxo7 (169–398), which lacked the other putative NESs. Both Fbxo7 proteins interacted specifically with GST-CRM1, but not GST alone, in vitro (Fig. 2G). Moreover, this interaction was dependent on the presence of the FBD, because when it was deleted, the interaction with GST-CRM1 was lost (Fig. 2H). Together, these experiments indicate that Fbxo7 contained a functional NES sequence within its FBD, which imposed its predominantly cytoplasmic localization. In addition, an alignment of multiple Fbxo7 homologues from different species from zebrafish to higher mammals showed that the defining leucine residues of the NES were conserved (Fig. 2I), suggesting that it is important for Fbxo7 localization across multiple species. In a study by Cenciarelli et al. (3Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) it was suggested that neither the FBD nor Skp1 binding influenced the localization of FBPs. However, because the NES was evolutionarily conserved and the loss of the FBD clearly altered Fbxo7 localization, we were interested in determining if other FBPs also contained an NES within their FBD and whether this affected their localization. In 2004, Jin et al. (20Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) reported the identification of 68 human FBPs. The subcellular localization of 23 out of 68 FBPs has been reported, and of these, 8 had a consensus NES at the start of the FBD (Table 1) as identified by sequence alignment. This included Fbxo2/NFB42, Fbxo4, Fbxo6, Fbxo7, Fbxo8, Fbxl5, Fbxw2, and Fbxw7. Most (5 out of 8) of these NESs also scored above the threshold for a functional NES by NetNES analy"
https://openalex.org/W2168613795,"This work describes a proteomics profiling method, optimized and applied to berry cell suspensions to evaluate organ-specific cultures as a platform to study grape berry ripening. Variations in berry ripening within a cluster(s) on a vine and in a vineyard are a major impediment towards complete understanding of the functional processes that control ripening, specifically when a characterized and homogenous sample is required. Berry cell suspensions could overcome some of these problems, but their suitability as a model system for berry development and ripening needs to be established first.In this study we report on the proteomic evaluation of the cytosolic proteins obtained from synchronized cell suspension cultures that were established from callus lines originating from green, véraison and ripe Vitis vinifera berry explants. The proteins were separated using liquid phase IEF in a Microrotofor cell and SDS PAGE. This method proved superior to gel-based 2DE. Principal component analysis confirmed that biological and technical repeats grouped tightly and importantly, showed that the proteomes of berry cultures originating from the different growth/ripening stages were distinct. A total of twenty six common bands were selected after band matching between different growth stages and twenty two of these bands were positively identified. Thirty two % of the identified proteins are currently annotated as hypothetical. The differential expression profile of the identified proteins, when compared with published literature on grape berry ripening, suggested common trends in terms of relative abundance in the different developmental stages between real berries and cell suspensions.The advantages of having suspension cultures that accurately mimic specific developmental stages are profound and could significantly contribute to the study of the intricate regulatory and signaling networks responsible for berry development and ripening."
https://openalex.org/W2057941368,"In our previous study, menstrual-like changes in mouse were provoked through the pharmacologic withdrawal of progesterone with mifepristone following induction of decidualization. However, mouse is not a natural menstruation animal, and the menstruation model using external stimuli may not truly reflect the occurrence and development of the human menstrual process. Therefore, we established a model of menstruation based on human endometrial xenotransplantation. In this model, human endometrial tissues were transplanted subcutaneously into SCID mice that were ovarectomized and supplemented with estrogen and progestogen by silastic implants with a scheme imitating the endocrinological milieu of human menstrual cycle. Morphology, hormone levels, and expression of vimentin and cytokeratin markers were evaluated to confirm the menstrual-like changes in this model. With 28 days of hormone treatment, transplanted human endometrium survived and underwent proliferation, differentiation and disintegration, similar to human endometrium in vivo. Human CD45+ cells showed a peak of increase 28 days post-transplantation. Three days after progesterone withdrawal, mouse CD45+ cells increased rapidly in number and were significantly greater than human CD45+ cell counts. Mouse CD31+ blood vascular-like structures were detected in both transplanted and host tissues. After progesterone withdrawal, the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 2, and 9 were increased. In summary, we successfully established a human endometrial xenotransplantation model in SCID mice, based on the results of menstrual-like changes in which MMP-1, 2 and 9 are involved. We showed that leukocytes are originated from in situ proliferation in human xenografts and involved in the occurrence of menstruation. This model will help to further understand the occurrence, growth, and differentiation of the endometrium and the underlying mechanisms of menstruation."

However, prior work suggests that socially oriented norms and behaviors, which characterize recent immigrant ethnic groups, may be protective against suicide risk. Here we explored suicide rates and their determinants among AAs in Michigan, the state with the largest proportion of AAs in the US.ICD-9/10 underlying cause of death codes were used to identify suicide deaths from among all deaths in Michigan between 1990 and 2007. Data from the 2000 U.S. Census were collected for population denominators. Age-adjusted suicide rates among AAs and non-ethnic whites were calculated by gender using the direct method of standardization. We also stratified by residence inside or outside of Wayne County (WC), the county with the largest AA population in the state. Suicide rates were 25.10 per 100,000 per year among men and 6.40 per 100,000 per year among women in Michigan from 1990 to 2007. AA men had a 51% lower suicide rate and AA women had a 33% lower rate than non-ethnic white men and women, respectively. The suicide rate among AA men in WC was 29% lower than in all other counties, while the rate among AA women in WC was 20% lower than in all other counties. Among non-ethnic whites, the suicide rate in WC was higher compared to all other counties among both men (12%) and women (16%).Suicide rates were higher among non-ethnic white men and women compared to AA men and women in both contexts. Arab ethnicity may protect against suicide in both sexes, but more so among men. Additionally, ethnic density may protect against suicide among Arab-Americans."
https://openalex.org/W2055747482,"RNA editing, catalyzed by the multiprotein editosome complex, is an essential step for the expression of most mitochondrial genes in trypanosomatid pathogens. It has been shown previously that Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing ligase 1 (TbREL1), a core catalytic component of the editosome, is essential in the mammalian life stage of these parasitic pathogens. Because of the availability of its crystal structure and absence from human, the adenylylation domain of TbREL1 has recently become the focus of several studies for designing inhibitors that target its adenylylation pocket. Here, we have studied new and existing inhibitors of TbREL1 to better understand their mechanism of action. We found that these compounds are moderate to weak inhibitors of adenylylation of TbREL1 and in fact enhance adenylylation at higher concentrations of protein. Nevertheless, they can efficiently block deadenylylation of TbREL1 in the editosome and, consequently, result in inhibition of the ligation step of RNA editing. Further experiments directly showed that the studied compounds inhibit the interaction of the editosome with substrate RNA. This was supported by the observation that not only the ligation activity of TbREL1 but also the activities of other editosome proteins such as endoribonuclease, terminal RNA uridylyltransferase, and uridylate-specific exoribonuclease, all of which require the interaction of the editosome with the substrate RNA, are efficiently inhibited by these compounds.

IntroductionTrypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major are three major trypanosomatid pathogens that cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and infect millions of people in tropical and subtropical areas of the world (1Stuart K.

Current trypanocidal drugs have a number of limitations such as high rate of toxicity, low rate of efficacy, and drug resistance (2Denise H. Barrett M.P. Biochem.

Therefore, it is important to look for a drug that is effective and does not produce harmful side effects. RNA editing is a unique post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial mRNAs that is shared in all trypanosomatid pathogens (4Simpson L. Sbicego S. Aphasizhev R.

To specify species, we have used species-specific abbreviations (e.g. TbREL1 for REL1 in T. brucei).Although other ligases such as T7 DNA ligase have a catalytic domain and an OB fold domain, KREL1 and KREL2 contain only the catalytic domain (19Worthey E.A.

Ligation requires three distinct and reversible steps: (i) the ligase adenylylation step in which the conserved catalytic lysine of the ligase attacks the α-phosphate of ATP and displaces pyrophosphate, forming an enzyme-AMP intermediate through the phosphoamide linkage; (ii) the ligase deadenylylation step in which the guide RNA/nicked mRNA duplex binds to the protein and AMP is transferred from the adenylylated ligase to the 5′-phosphate of the RNA molecule, forming an adenylylated RNA with a 5′,5′-phosphoanhydride bond; and (iii) the ligation step in which the free 3′-hydroxyl at the nick site attacks the phosphoanhydride bond of the adenylylated RNA fragment, forming a phosphodiester bond, ligating the double-stranded RNA, and releasing AMP.TbREL1 is an essential enzyme for the editing process and parasite viability (18Schnaufer A. Panigrahi A.K. Panicucci B. Igo Jr., R.P. Wirtz E. Salavati R. Stuart K. Science. 2001; 291: 2159-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the TbREL1 N-terminal catalytic domain has been determined, making virtual screening of chemical compounds against TbREL1 possible (29Amaro R.E. Schnaufer A. Interthal H.

PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2010; 4: e803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The unique characteristics of the TbREL1 ATP-binding pocket and the absence of any close homolog in the human genome make TbREL1 an ideal target for design of selective inhibitors that block the essential RNA ligase function.A recent study has found several inhibitors against TbREL1 using a combination of in silico analysis and in vitro adenylylation assays (29Amaro R.E. Schnaufer A. Interthal H. Hol W. Stuart K.D. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17278-17283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Some of these inhibitors have been validated as inhibitors of full-round deletion RNA editing in the presence of the purified editosome (31Moshiri H. Salavati R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e138Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). While we were preparing this manuscript, a second study (30Durrant J.D. Hall L. Swift R.V. Landon M. Schnaufer A. Amaro R.E. PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2010; 4: e803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was published that reported a number of naphthalene-based inhibitors of TbREL1. In the present study, we have studied the effect of one of the naphthalene-based inhibitors provided by the National Cancer Institute, chemical number 162535 (previously referred to as V2 (30Durrant J.D. Hall L. Swift R.V. Landon M. Schnaufer A. Amaro R.E. PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2010; 4: e803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and designated in this study as C35), on the editosome, and we report that upon addition of this new inhibitor all the different essential catalytic steps of RNA editing are inhibited, most likely as a result of losing the interaction of the core editosome with substrate RNA.DISCUSSIONIn the course of this work, we have examined the mechanism of action of two naphthalene-based inhibitors of the RNA editing process, C35 and S5, and have shown that these compounds affect virtually all editosome activities that require editosome-RNA interaction, suggesting that they block the interaction of the editosome with its substrate RNA. This hypothesis is further supported by direct experiments showing that the editosome cannot interact with substrate RNA in the presence of C35 and S5. Therefore, although the exact molecular mechanism of action of naphthalene-based compounds remains to be determined, our data present C35 and S5 as the first known druglike compounds that can interfere with editosome-RNA interaction. In addition, we examined the effect of the more potent compound C35 on complex integrity and showed that this compound could interfere with the integrity and/or assembly of the editosome complex, shifting the 20 S editosome sedimentation to the lower 5–10 S region. This resembles the results obtained from treatment of core editosome proteins by RNases (47Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that the editosome requires its substrate RNA for initiating assembly and/or maintaining its integrity.It has been reported that C35 and S5 inhibit the adenylylation step of ligation with the inhibitory compounds competing with ATP for binding to the adenylylation pocket (29Amaro R.E. Schnaufer A. Interthal H. Hol W. Stuart K.D. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17278-17283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Durrant J.D. Hall L. Swift R.V. Landon M. Schnaufer A. Amaro R.E. PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2010; 4: e803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in our partially purified editosome fraction, as estimated, the minimum concentration of TbREL1 that is able to perform full-round editing is about 50 nm, which is about 10 times higher than the concentration of recombinant TbREL1 used in previous reports. With this amount of editosome, we could not observe any inhibition at the adenylylation step. However, we were able to see inhibition of adenylylation after we diluted our editosome preparation 10 times, indicating that adenylylation inhibition only occurs at very low protein concentrations. On the other hand, we observed efficient inhibition of editing using the non-diluted amount of editosome that is required for successful completion of full-round in vitro RNA editing, suggesting that adenylylation inhibition is most likely not the mechanism through which C35 and S5 inhibit the editing process at higher protein concentrations.Our results suggest that the main mechanism of action of C35 is through inhibition of a protein-RNA interaction that is integral to the process of editing (Fig. 7A). Alternative molecular mechanisms can lead to such observation. For example, freezing the OB fold-containing interacting partner of ligases in a closed conformational state can lead to their inability to interact with the RNA substrate. During the deadenylylation step in capping enzymes and DNA ligases, it has been shown that the OB fold rotates and positions itself at a distance from the AMP-binding pocket that allows the ligase to have an open conformation to bind to the nicked double-stranded DNA (49Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, one possible model is that in the presence of compound when the OB fold provides the ATP for the adenylylation pocket the OB fold gets locked and induces the closed ligase-interacting partner conformation, which does not allow the interaction of protein with RNA (Fig. 7B, top panel). In other words, due to the compound-induced locked position of the OB fold on the adenylylated catalytic pocket, the OB fold cannot rotate and is not capable of positioning its nucleic acid binding surface toward the active site awaiting nick binding. Although this model corresponds to in silico modeling studies that suggest the interaction of C35 and S5 with TbREL1 (this work as well as Refs. 29Amaro R.E. Schnaufer A. Interthal H. Hol W. Stuart K.D. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17278-17283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 30Durrant J.D. Hall L. Swift R.V. Landon M. Schnaufer A. Amaro R.E. PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2010; 4: e803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is not fully supported by our experimental data especially in that the main target of C35 does not seem to be in association with TbREL1 (Fig. 5B). Alternatively, C35 may inhibit a yet unidentified protein(s) that is responsible for bringing the substrate RNA into the editosome complex (Fig. 7B, bottom panel). This may result from similarity of physiochemical properties of RNA-binding regions of proteins to nucleoside triphosphate-binding clefts; C35 was designed to be positioned in the adenylylation pocket of RNA editing ligases, which can structurally be similar to other nucleotide- and nucleic acid-binding pockets. Furthermore, we have shown that in the presence of C35 there is a shift in the 20 S editosome toward 5–10 S. This result is very similar to the reports showing that upon treatment of the editosome complex with nucleases the editosome is disintegrated (47Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that the loss of integrity after treatment of the editosome with C35 is because the editosome loses its RNA-interacting capacity. Treatment with the compounds does not result in loss of RNA binding activity of KREPA4, suggesting that these compounds do not directly affect KREPA4 and that they do not block protein-RNA interactions in a nonspecific manner but rather target a particular protein.The RNA-protein complex that we found to be most affected by C35 has been previously designated as G1 (46Read L.K. Göringer H.U. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The most abundant gRNA-binding protein of G1 has been shown to be a 25-kDa protein. G1 has been proposed to be an intermediate during the formation of the complete editosome (48Göringer H.U. Koslowsky D.J. Morales T.H. Stuart K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1776-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This supports our observation that C35 inhibits the formation of high molecular weight RNA-containing editosome complexes. Another candidate target of C35 can be RBP38, a previously identified essential protein that has been shown to be able to bind to both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA and is important for the stability of mitochondrial RNA (50Sbicego S. Alfonzo J.D. Estévez A.M. Rubio M.A. Kang X. Turck C.W. Peris M. Simpson L. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The properties of this protein match the observation that C35 abolishes the interaction of its target with both single-stranded gRNA and double-stranded gRNA-mRNA complex (Fig. 5A), which leads to instability of RNA after drug treatment as shown by the guanylyltransferase assay (Fig. 6E).Although our data support a role for RNA to maintain editosome complex integrity, there are contradicting reports showing that mutants that lack mitochondrial DNA and hence lack mitochondrial mRNA and gRNA contain catalytically active editosomes (51Domingo G.J. Palazzo S.S. Wang B. Pannicucci B. Salavati R. Stuart K.D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Resolving the exact mechanism of inhibitory compounds such as C35 would provide a more detailed understanding for assembly of functional editosomes. IntroductionTrypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major are three major trypanosomatid pathogens that cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and infect millions of people in tropical and subtropical areas of the world (1Stuart K. Brun R. Croft S. Fairlamb A. Gürtler R.E. McKerrow J. Reed S. Tarleton R. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Current trypanocidal drugs have a number of limitations such as high rate of toxicity, low rate of efficacy, and drug resistance (2Denise H. Barrett M.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Delespaux V. de Koning H.P. Drug Resist. Updat. 2007; 10: 30-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to look for a drug that is effective and does not produce harmful side effects. RNA editing is a unique post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial mRNAs that is shared in all trypanosomatid pathogens (4Simpson L. Sbicego S. Aphasizhev R.

The crystal structure of the TbREL1 N-terminal catalytic domain has been determined, making virtual screening of chemical compounds against TbREL1 possible (29Amaro R.E. Schnaufer A. Interthal H.

The unique characteristics of the TbREL1 ATP-binding pocket and the absence of any close homolog in the human genome make TbREL1 an ideal target for design of selective inhibitors that block the essential RNA ligase function.A recent study has found several inhibitors against TbREL1 using a combination of in silico analysis and in vitro adenylylation assays (29Amaro R.E.

Historically, the use of uridine as a therapeutic agent has been limited by poor bioavailability. A food supplement containing nucleosides, NucleomaxX®, has been reported to raise plasma uridine to supraphysiologic levels.Single- and multi-dose PK studies following NucleomaxX® were compared to single-dose PK studies of equimolar doses of pure uridine in healthy human volunteers. Product analysis documented that more than 90% of the nucleoside component of NucleomaxX® is in the form of triacetyluridine (TAU). Single and repeated dosing with NucleomaxX® resulted in peak plasma uridine concentrations 1-2 hours later of 150.9 ± 39.3 µM and 161.4 ± 31.5 µM, respectively, levels known to ameliorate mitochondrial toxicity in vitro. C(max) and AUC were four-fold higher after a single dose of NucleomaxX® than after uridine. No adverse effects of either treatment were observed.NucleomaxX®, containing predominantly TAU, has significantly greater bioavailability than pure uridine in human subjects and may be useful in the management of mitochondrial toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2028538873,"Bacterial transcription activators of the XylR/DmpR subfamily exert their expression control via σ54-dependent RNA polymerase upon stimulation by a chemical effector, typically an aromatic compound. Where the chemical effector interacts with the transcription regulator protein to achieve activation is still largely unknown. Here we focus on the HbpR protein from Pseudomonas azelaica, which is a member of the XylR/DmpR subfamily and responds to biaromatic effectors such as 2-hydroxybiphenyl. We use protein structure modeling to predict folding of the effector recognition domain of HbpR and molecular docking to identify the region where 2-hydroxybiphenyl may interact with HbpR. A large number of site-directed HbpR mutants of residues in- and outside the predicted interaction area was created and their potential to induce reporter gene expression in Escherichia coli from the cognate PC promoter upon activation with 2-hydroxybiphenyl was studied. Mutant proteins were purified to study their conformation. Critical residues for effector stimulation indeed grouped near the predicted area, some of which are conserved among XylR/DmpR subfamily members in spite of displaying different effector specificities. This suggests that they are important for the process of effector activation, but not necessarily for effector specificity recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2062881254,"The flourishing of studies on the neural correlates of decision-making calls for an appraisal of the relation between perceptual decisions and conscious perception. By exploiting the long integration time of noisy motion stimuli, and by forcing human observers to make difficult speeded decisions – sometimes a blind guess – about stimulus direction, we traced the temporal buildup of motion discrimination capability and perceptual awareness, as assessed trial by trial through direct rating. We found that both increased gradually with motion coherence and viewing time, but discrimination was systematically leading awareness, reaching a plateau much earlier. Sensitivity and criterion changes contributed jointly to the slow buildup of perceptual awareness. It made no difference whether motion discrimination was accomplished by saccades or verbal responses. These findings suggest that perceptual awareness emerges on the top of a developing or even mature perceptual decision. We argue that the middle temporal (MT) cortical region does not confer us the full phenomenic depth of motion perception, although it may represent a precursor stage in building our subjective sense of visual motion."

In this issue of Neuron, Sasaki et al. present evidence for a new endogenous survival pathway involving the kinase SIK2 and the CREB coactivator TORC1. The powerful neuroprotection conferred by this pathway has considerable translational potential for stroke therapy. Activation of NMDA receptors during cerebral ischemia triggers signaling pathways that promote both neuronal death and survival. In this issue of Neuron, Sasaki et al. present evidence for a new endogenous survival pathway involving the kinase SIK2 and the CREB coactivator TORC1. The powerful neuroprotection conferred by this pathway has considerable translational potential for stroke therapy. N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are essential for brain development and function (Citri and Malenka, 2007Citri A. Malenka R.C. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2007; 33: 18-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, Cohen and Greenberg, 2008Cohen S. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 183-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), but they also have a dark side, playing central roles in neuronal death during cerebral ischemia and other brain pathologies (Szydlowska and Tymianski, 2010Szydlowska K. Tymianski M. Cell Calcium. 2010; 47: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Remarkably, even in such deleterious settings, NMDARs set in motion powerful molecular programs that attempt to protect neurons from the excitotoxic damage resulting from their activation. Thus, NMDAR activation enables the expression of prosurvival genes through the transcription factor cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) (Lonze and Ginty, 2002Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of CREB in neuroprotection is well established (Kitagawa, 2007Kitagawa K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3210-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, Lonze and Ginty, 2002Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms by which NMDAR activation promotes CREB-dependent neuronal survival, while also promoting cell death, remain poorly understood. In this issue of Neuron, Sasaki et al., 2011Sasaki T. Takemori H. Yagita Y. Terasaki Y. Uebi T. Horike N. Takagi H. Susumu T. Teraoka H. Kusano K. Hatano O. Oyama N. Sugiyama Y. Sakoda S. Kitagawa K. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 106-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar shed light on the issue by identifying ischemia-induced degradation of salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) as a pivotal step in the activation of CREB-dependent transcription, an effect involving dephosphorylation and nuclear import of the CREB coactivator transducer of regulated CREB activity 1 (TORC1) (Figure 1). The findings establish SIK2 and TORC1 as critical regulators of a novel endogenous neuroprotective pathway with significant implications for the treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies and other brain diseases linked to NMDARs. CREB activation involves multiple signaling cascades that phosphorylate CREB to assemble a functional transcriptional complex (Lonze and Ginty, 2002Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Therefore, as they set out to investigate post-ischemic CREB-dependent transcription, Sasaki et al. first examined CREB phosphorylation at the well-described regulatory Ser133 using oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) in cortical neuronal cultures, a model that recapitulates key features of ischemia-reperfusion injury. They uncovered an intriguing temporal dissociation between CREB phosphorylation and the upregulation of CRE activity, as measured using gene reporter assays, suggestive of a phosphorylation-independent mechanism of CREB activation. Consequently, they hypothesized the involvement of a recently discovered family of CREB transcriptional coactivators the TORC family of proteins (Conkright et al., 2003Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

TORCs translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to increases in calcium and cAMP, a step that requires dephosphorylation (Bittinger et al., 2004Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E. Meltzer J.

Once in the nucleus, TORCs bind CREB and promote CREB-dependent gene expression, an effect independent of Ser133 phosphorylation (Bittinger et al., 2004Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E. Meltzer J.

Using constitutively active or dominant-negative constructs, they provided convincing evidence that TORC1 upregulation or downregulation is causally linked to CREB-dependent gene expression and neuronal survival after OGD. Although TORC1 has already been implicated in other CREB-dependent neuronal functions, such as synaptic plasticity (Kovacs et al., 2007Kovacs K.A. Steullet P. Steinmann M. Do K.Q. Magistretti P.J.

While dephosphorylation is necessary for its nuclear translocation, phosphorylation can sequester TORC in the cytoplasm (Screaton et al., 2004Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L.

To begin to unravel the factors regulating TORC phosphorylation during OGD, Sasaki et al., 2011Sasaki T. Takemori H. Yagita Y. Terasaki Y. Uebi T. Horike N. Takagi H. Susumu T. Teraoka H. Kusano K. Hatano O. Oyama N. Sugiyama Y. Sakoda S. Kitagawa K. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 106-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar focused on AMPK, SIK1, and SIK2, kinases known to phosphorylate TORC. They observed that SIK2 was enriched in neurons and that its levels did not change during OGD, much like CRE activity. However, SIK2 levels were markedly reduced after OGD in parallel with the increase in CRE activity and TORC1 dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. AMPK and SIK1 did not exhibit such temporal associations with TORC1 and CRE activity. These observations raised the possibility that SIK2 regulates CREB-dependent transcription through an effect on TORC1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of a constitutively active SIK2 suppressed OGD-induced CRE activity and increased cell death, whereas an inactive SIK2 was neuroprotective. Similarly, RNAi downregulation or pharmacological inhibition of SIK2 increased CRE activity and neuronal survival. The demonstration that SIK2 overexpression reduced CRE activity in cells cotransfected with a wild-type (WT) TORC1 construct, but was unable to do so in the presence of a phosphorylation-resistant mutant of TORC1, clearly established that these effects of SIK2 were mediated by TORC1 phosphorylation. Next, the authors set out to investigate the upstream mechanisms by which OGD modulates SIK2 levels and CREB transcriptional activity. After identifying CaMK I/IV as potential upstream mediators of TORC1-CREB activation, the authors explored how CaMK I/IV activity could lead to the reduction in SIK2 levels induced by OGD. They found that overexpression of dominant-negative CaMK I or CaMK IV constructs prevents the OGD-induced downregulation of SIK2. In addition, SIK2 degradation was associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of a specific SIK2 residue (Thr484). The importance of this site for SIK2 degradation was demonstrated by the fact that a phosphorylation-resistant Thr484 did not result in SIK2 degradation. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser587, a SIK2 site also known to negatively regulate TORC phosphorylation (Katoh et al., 2006Katoh Y. Takemori H. Lin X.z. Tamura M. Muraoka M. Satoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Min L. Doi J. Miyauchi A. et al.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2730-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), did not impact SIK2 protein levels. In support of this conclusion, OGD increased SIK2 Thr484 phosphorylation, but not Ser587 phosphorylation, suggesting that Thr484, but not Ser587, is an important target of CaMK I/IV-dependent SIK2 degradation. Sasaki et al., 2011Sasaki T. Takemori H. Yagita Y. Terasaki Y. Uebi T. Horike N. Takagi H. Susumu T. Teraoka H. Kusano K. Hatano O. Oyama N. Sugiyama Y. Sakoda S. Kitagawa K. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 106-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar provide further support that SIK2 is a principal regulator of neuronal survival by generating sik2−/− mice and investigating whether neurons from these mice are protected from OGD. They found that sik2−/− neurons display higher survival rates than WT following OGD, an effect associated with a concomitant increase in TORC1-CREB activity and induction of prosurvival genes such as Bdnf and Ppargc-1a. Importantly, to determine whether SIK2 is involved in the mechanisms of neuronal death in vivo, they examined ischemic lesions in WT and sik2−/− mice following occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, a well-established model of ischemic stroke. They found that sik2−/− mice have reduced ischemic lesions compared with WT mice and that this neuroprotection is associated with TORC1 dephosphorylation only in the ischemic hemisphere of the sik2−/− brains. Consistent with in vitro results, sik2−/− mice were also found to have increased expression of CREB-dependent prosurvival genes like Bdnf and Ppargc-1a, while CREB-independent genes are unaffected. However, sik2−/− mice exhibited reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), suggesting that suppression of post-ischemic inflammation may also contribute to the observed neuroprotection. Sasaki et al., 2011Sasaki T. Takemori H. Yagita Y. Terasaki Y. Uebi T. Horike N. Takagi H. Susumu T. Teraoka H. Kusano K. Hatano O. Oyama N. Sugiyama Y. Sakoda S. Kitagawa K. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 106-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar provide extensive evidence in support of SIK2 as a major determinant of neuronal survival by its regulation of CREB-induced gene expression through a TORC1-dependent mechanism. These results advance the current understanding of CREB activation in the context of neuronal survival. Although CREB phosphorylation has long been linked to CREB activation in various aspects of neuronal function, including neuroprotection (Lonze and Ginty, 2002Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), this study highlights the functional relevance of an alternative mechanism present in neurons that activates CREB. Given the complexity of neuronal CREB activation, future studies could be aimed at further elucidating the mechanisms regulating TORC1. For example, synaptic activity can simultaneously activate a number of signaling cascades that lead to CREB-dependent gene expression (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008Cohen S. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 183-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Understanding the contribution of each of these different pathways to TORC1 activation may help unravel the biological advantage conferred by utilizing multiple means to promote the expression of CREB-dependent genes. Moreover, addressing the signaling events involved in the dephosphorylation of TORC1 and SIK2 may also reveal new regulatory mechanisms. Because the signaling pathways described in this study were demonstrated to be downstream of synaptic NMDARs, these findings are highly relevant to other neural functions involving NMDAR-induced gene expression and to pathological states mediated by these receptors. In addition, the attenuation in TNF observed in sik2−/− mice raises the possibility that SIK2 is also involved in post-ischemic inflammation. Further studies exploring the mechanisms underlying this effect would be of interest because they might unveil a previously unrecognized link between SIK proteins and inflammatory signaling. The findings of the present study are particularly relevant to the pathobiology of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and to strategies to protect the brain from the devastating consequences of ischemic stroke. Treatments targeting the NMDARs and other pathogenic factors in the ischemic cascade have not been successful in stroke clinical trials (Ginsberg, 2009Ginsberg M.D. Stroke. 2009; 40: S111-S114Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). While the issues surrounding these disappointing results are still being debated, it has also become clear that therapeutic approaches mimicking endogenous neuroprotective strategies have a great translational potential, but are relatively unexplored (Moskowitz et al., 2010Moskowitz M.A. Lo E.H. Iadecola C. Neuron. 2010; 67: 181-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). By identifying and characterizing a series of novel mediators in a critical, yet poorly understood, neuroprotective signaling cascade (Figure 1), Sasaki et al., 2011Sasaki T. Takemori H. Yagita Y. Terasaki Y. Uebi T. Horike N. Takagi H. Susumu T. Teraoka H. Kusano K. Hatano O. Oyama N. Sugiyama Y. Sakoda S. Kitagawa K. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 106-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar have provided valuable insight into new targets for therapeutic ischemic stroke and other pathologies involving NMDARs. Therapeutic approaches targeting the SIK2-TORC1-CREB pathway using small molecules or other clinically applicable pharmacological tools have great potential for stroke treatment and are eagerly awaited.
