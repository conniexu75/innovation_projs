https://openalex.org/W2030307932,"There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to epilepsy, but it is commonly assumed that this genetic contribution is limited to ‘generalized’ epilepsies, and that most forms of ‘partial’ epilepsy are nongenetic. In a linkage analysis of a single family containing 11 affected individuals, we obtained strong evidence for localization of a gene for partial epilepsy. This susceptibility gene maps to chromosome 10q, with a maximum two–point lod score for D10S192 of 3.99 at θ=0.0. All affected individuals share a single haplotype for seven tightly linked contiguous markers; the maximum lod score for this haplotype is 4.83 at θ=0.0. Key recombinants place the susceptibility locus within a 10 centimorgan interval."

In the presence of a lipid source, apoE3 enhances and apoE4 inhibits neurite outgrowth. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that there is a higher concentration of apoE3 than apoE4 in both the cell bodies and neurites. Cells treated with apoE4 showed fewer microtubules and a greatly reduced ratio of polymerized to monomeric tubulin than did cells treated with apoE3. The effect of apoE4 on depolymerization of microtubules was shown by biochemical, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural studies. The depolymerization of microtubules and the inhibition of neurite outgrowth associated with apoE4 suggest a mechanism whereby apoE4, which has been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, may prevent normal neuronal remodeling from occurring later in life, when this neurodegenerative disorder develops.

Apolipoprotein E is a major apolipoprotein in the nervous system, where it is thought to redistribute lipoprotein cholesterol among the neurons and their supporting cells and to maintain cholesterol homeostasis(5Boyles J.K.

Apart from this function, apoE in the peripheral nervous system functions in the redistribution of lipids during regeneration(8Ignatius M.J. Gebicke-Härter P.J. Skene J.H.P. Schilling J.W.

McPherson J. Bruns G.A.P. Karathanasis S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6240-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein E3, the most common isoform, has cysteine and arginine at positions 112 and 158, respectively, whereas apoE2 has cysteine at both of these positions and apoE4 has arginine at both(1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 12Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the apoE4 allele (∊4) is specifically associated with sporadic and familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease and is a major risk factor for the disease (13Corder E.H.

In accord with these findings, apoE immunoreactivity is associated with both the amyloid plaques and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles seen in postmortem examinations of brains from Alzheimer's disease patients(17Namba Y.

The mechanism by which apoE4 might contribute to Alzheimer's disease is unknown. However, our recent data demonstrating that apoE4 stunts the outgrowth of neurites from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons suggest that apoE may have a direct effect on neuronal development or remodeling(19Handelmann G.E.

Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In an extension of these previous studies, we have now examined the effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth and on the cytoskeleton of Neuro-2a cells, a murine neuroblastoma cell line. Apolipoprotein E4 inhibits neurite outgrowth from these cells, and this isoform-specific effect is associated with depolymerization of microtubules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell LinesMurine neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells and murine fibroblasts (BALB/c) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Neuro-2a cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12; 50%:50%) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For experiments, Neuro-2a cells were plated in this medium in 6-well plates at 25,000 cells/well. After 3-6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with N2 medium (DMEM/F12 containing growth supplements) alone(21Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar), N2 medium containing rabbit β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL) alone (40 μg cholesterol/ml), or N2 medium containing β-VLDL and either purified human apoE3 (30 μg/ml) or purified human apoE4 (30 μg/ml), and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. BALB/c fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. Experiments with BALB/c cells were performed in DMEM. Rabbit β-VLDL from cholesterol-fed animals were isolated as described(22Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human apoE was purified from the plasma of apoE3 and apoE4 homozygotes(23Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); biological activity was assessed by LDL receptor-binding assay(24Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5454-5460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Quantitation of Neurite OutgrowthTo assess neurite outgrowth, Neuro-2a cells were grown in test reagents and then nonspecifically stained with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, as described previously(20Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Neurons were imaged in fluorescence mode with a confocal laser scanning system (MRC-600, Bio-Rad), and the images were digitized with an Image-1/AT image analysis system (Universal Images, West Chester, PA)(20Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The neuronal images were coded, and the neurite extension (the distance from the cell body to the end of the longest neurite) was measured for each neuron. Approximately 50-60 treatment-responsive cells (cells with at least one neurite longer than the diameter of the cell body) were measured for each treatment condition, and the data were calculated as the percent difference between each treatment group and the matched control (N2 medium alone) for each experiment. The percent differences for the different experiments then were averaged. The value for the N2 medium alone was set at 100%. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistics were done using Stat View II software.ImmunocytochemistryImmunocytochemistry of apoE was performed on Neuro-2a cells and fibroblasts incubated for 48 h with β-VLDL and either apoE3 or apoE4. Cells were fixed for 3 days at 4°C in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde and quenched with 150 mM sodium acetate in PBS containing 0.1% milk powder (quench buffer). The cells were further incubated for 15 min at room temperature in quench buffer with or without 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then washed with PBS containing 15 mM sodium acetate and 0.1% nonfat dry milk (wash solution) and incubated with a polyclonal antibody to apoE (GHE) at a concentration of 1:1000 in wash solution containing goat serum (1:50 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature followed by extensive washes with wash solution. The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Texas Red, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was incubated for 1 h before use at a 1:100 dilution in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed with PBS and coverslipped, and serial optical sections (∼1 μm in thickness) were made using a confocal laser scanning microscope.Immunocytochemistry to detect tubulin was performed on Neuro-2a cells and fibroblasts grown for 48 h in medium alone, with β-VLDL alone, or with β-VLDL and either apoE3 or apoE4. Following incubation with test reagents, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde, followed by several quick washes with PBS. The cells were quenched with 0.05 M ammonium chloride in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Immunocytochemistry was performed for 45 min at room temperature, using a monoclonal antibody to β-tubulin (Boehringer Mannheim) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA. Following incubation, the cells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and then incubated for 30 min in the dark with goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (10 μl/ml) in PBS containing 1% BSA. Cells were coverslipped, and optical sections of 0.5 μm thickness were made using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser scanning microscope; the sections were overlaid to obtain a composite image.For localization of actin, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% BSA. The permeabilized cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 5 units/ml of rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were washed twice with PBS and coverslipped, and optical sections were made as described above.In immunocytochemistry experiments, 15-20% of the cells did not respond to the treatments and were similar to control neurons. These cells may represent cells injured during plating.125I-ApoE Binding AssayThe cells were grown in 12-well plates until they reached half of maximal confluence. Cells were washed with medium and incubated with β-VLDL (40 μg cholesterol/ml) along with 30 μg/ml of either 125I-apoE3 or 125I-apoE4 for 48 h. Following incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.2% BSA at 4°C. The cells were solubilized with 0.1 N NaOH and assayed for protein, and radioactivity was determined by gamma counting. Apolipoprotein E was iodinated using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The average specific activity was 50 counts/min/ng apoE.Electron Microscopy of Neuro-2a CellsNeuro-2a cells were incubated with test reagents as described above. Following incubation, the cells were lifted from the plates using 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were fixed for 1 h with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and post-fixed for 1 h in 2% OsO4. The cells were dehydrated, embedded in Epon 812, sectioned (80 nm) using a Reichert Ultracut E, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The cells were photographed using a JEOL CX-100II electron microscope. Consistent results were obtained in three independent experiments performed with fresh preparations of apoE and β-VLDL.Binding of 125I-ApoE to MicrotubulesNeuro-2a cells in a 100-mm plate were grown to confluence as described above, scraped from the plate in PBS, and lysed by sonication in PME buffer, pH 7.2 (80 mM PIPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin), containing 1 mM GTP. The solution was centrifuged and pelleted cell debris discarded. The supernatant was incubated at 37°C for 1 h to facilitate tubulin polymerization. The resultant pellet of microtubules was resuspended in PME buffer, aliquoted into microfuge tubes, and incubated at 37°C with either 125I-apoE3 (2 μg/ml) or 125I-apoE4 (2 μg/ml). Following incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to separate the free 125I-apoE from that bound to microtubules. The radioactivity associated with the supernatant and pellet was estimated by gamma counting.Immunoblotting of TubulinNeuro-2a cells were incubated with test reagents, and cell extracts were prepared as described above. An aliquot of each extract containing an equal amount of protein was centrifuged through a sucrose cushion (PME + 20% sucrose) at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 37°C to separate the microtubules (polymeric tubulin preparation) from the tubulin (monomeric tubulin preparation). The monomeric tubulin preparation was polymerized for 1 h at 37°C by incubating the sample in PME buffer containing 20% sucrose and 1 mM GTP, followed by centrifugation as described above(25Tiwari S.C. Suprenant K.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The polymeric tubulin preparation was subjected to a temperature-dependent depolymerization-polymerization cycle to remove cellular debris, followed by centrifugation to obtain the microtubules. Aliquots of the cell extract (total tubulin) and the monomeric and polymeric tubulin preparations were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and immunoblotted using a monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin (ICN, Irvine, CA) at a dilution of 1:100, as described by the manufacturer. The tubulin bands in the immunoblots were quantitated by densitometry (Ambis Systems, San Diego, CA). The value obtained with N2 medium alone was set at 100%, and the data were calculated as the percent difference between each treatment group and the matched control (N2 medium alone) for each experiment. The percent differences for the different experiments then were averaged. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistics were done using Stat View II software.Other Assays and MethodsProtein assay was performed as described(26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of cholesterol in cells incubated for 48 h with β-VLDL (40 μg cholesterol/ml) and human apoE3 or apoE4 (30 μg/ml) was assayed using a commercially available kit (Monotest, Boehringer Mannheim). The [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was performed with Neuro-2a cells incubated with β-VLDL and apoE3 or apoE4 using a previously published procedure(27Browning P.J. Roberts D.D. Zabrenetzky V.

The lactate dehydrogenase assay was performed as described(28Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The DiI-labeled β-VLDL uptake was performed as described(19Handelmann G.E. Boyles J.K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1677-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSDifferential Effects of ApoE3 and ApoE4 on Neurite OutgrowthOur previous studies examined the effects of apoE and lipoproteins on the outgrowth of neurites from primary rabbit DRG neurons in vitro(19Handelmann G.E.

Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The addition of purified human apoE3, together with rabbit β-VLDL (cholesterol-rich lipoproteins), increased neurite extension from these peripheral nervous system neurons, whereas apoE4 when added to the cells together with β-VLDL inhibited neurite outgrowth.In this study, we found a similar differential effect of apoE3 and apoE4 on the outgrowth of neurites from Neuro-2a cells. In the presence of β-VLDL, apoE3 and apoE4 had dramatic isoform-specific effects on neurite outgrowth from Neuro-2a cells, as assessed by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 1). Incubation of the cells with β-VLDL (Fig. 1B) stimulated neurite outgrowth slightly as compared with cells grown in N2 medium alone (Fig. 1A); however, a more dramatic effect was seen with the addition of apoE. Cells incubated with apoE3 and β-VLDL (Fig. 1C) had more neurite extension than cells incubated with β-VLDL, whereas cells incubated with apoE4 and β-VLDL had less neurite extension (Fig. 1D). These observations were confirmed when neurite outgrowth was quantitated using an image analysis system (Fig. 2). Incubation of the cells with β-VLDL enhanced neurite extension, as compared with cells maintained in N2 medium alone (Fig. 2). Addition of human apoE3 with β-VLDL further increased the extension (p < 0.005), whereas human apoE4 along with β-VLDL significantly reduced neurite extension as compared with the extension observed from cells incubated with β-VLDL (p < 0.001).Figure 2:Quantitation of the effect of apoE on neurite extension from Neuro-2a cells. Neuro-2a cells were incubated with test reagents as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Neurite extension then was measured for 50-60 neurons from each group as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were calculated as the percent difference between each treatment group and the matched control (N2 medium alone) for each experiment. The percent differences for the various experiments then were averaged. The value for the N2 medium alone was set at 100% (dashed line). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three different studies were performed to rule out a general toxic effect of apoE4 on neurons. We assayed lactate dehydrogenase activity, a commonly used indicator of cell death, measured thymidine incorporation into DNA as an indication of cell replication, and examined the ability of the cells to develop neurites following incubation with apoE4 and β-VLDL. No significant differences in lactate dehydrogenase activity (apoE3 +β-VLDL, 212 ± 26.2 units/ml; apoE4 +β-VLDL, 205 ± 22 units/ml) or [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (apoE3 +β-VLDL, 17.37 ± 1.66 counts/min × 106; apoE4 +β-VLDL, 18.13 ± 1.42 counts/min × 106) were seen with cells incubated with β-VLDL and either apoE3 or apoE4. The inhibitory effect of apoE4 was reversible, since removal of apoE4 and β-VLDL from the cells in culture and addition of medium alone or medium containing β-VLDL resulted in normal outgrowth (data not shown). These findings taken together demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of apoE4 on neurite outgrowth is not due to a cytotoxic effect of apoE4 on the cells.To determine if lipoproteins were required for the differential effects of apoE3 and apoE4, the cells were incubated with free apoE for 48 h and the effects on neurite outgrowth examined. In the absence of lipoprotein, neither apoE3 nor apoE4 had an effect on neurite extension (data not shown). This result suggests that receptor-mediated endocytosis of apoE is necessary for the differential effects on neurite outgrowth, as previous studies have shown that apoE is a ligand for the LDL receptor and the LRP only when it is present on lipoproteins(1Mahley R.W.

Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 2Herz J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 107-113Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Brown M.S. Herz J. Kowal R.C.

Both apoE3- and apoE4-containing lipoproteins exhibit similar binding activity in nonneuronal cells(1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 22Kowal R.C.

Incubation of the cells with β-VLDL and apoE3 or apoE4 for 48 h did in fact lead to similar levels of lipid accumulation (apoE3 +β-VLDL, 115 ± 3.9 μg cholesterol/mg of cell protein; apoE4 +β-VLDL, 121 ± 5.8 μg cholesterol/mg of cell protein), suggesting that the stimulation of β-VLDL uptake was similar with the two apoE isoforms. In comparison, Neuro-2a cells accumulated 20 ± 0.9 and 86 ± 2.6 μg of cholesterol/mg of cell protein when incubated with N2 medium and β-VLDL alone, respectively. Examination of the uptake of fluorescently labeled β-VLDL in the presence of either apoE3 or apoE4 supported the conclusion that apoE3 and apoE4 stimulated β-VLDL uptake similarly.To determine whether apoE3 and apoE4 were processed differently by neurons and by fibroblasts, we incubated Neuro-2a cells or murine fibroblasts with apoE3 or apoE4 in the presence of β-VLDL and examined the accumulation of apoE in the cells. Immunocytochemical detection of apoE in Neuro-2a cells incubated with β-VLDL and either apoE3 or apoE4 revealed that both isoforms were present within neurons (Fig. 3). There was, however, a substantial difference in the intensity of reactivity of apoE3 (Fig. 3A) and apoE4 (Fig. 3B). Apolipoprotein E3 was present both in the cell body and in the neurites at a substantially higher concentration than was apoE4 (Fig. 3, A and B). Both apoE3 and apoE4 were observed in nearly all serial optical sections made throughout the cell, suggesting that apoE was intracellular (Fig. 3, A and B).Figure 3:Immunocytochemical localization of apoE in Neuro-2a cells. Neuro-2a cells were grown for 2 days in medium containing β-VLDL (40 μg of cholesterol/ml) together with 30 μg/ml of either human apoE3 (A) or human apoE4 (B). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Serial optical sections (∼1 μm in thickness) were made from the top (section 1) to the bottom (section 6) of the cells using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Scale bar = 15 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The possibility that apoE was localized intracellularly was examined using two additional approaches. First, Neuro-2a cells were incubated with β-VLDL and either apoE3 or apoE4 and treated with suramin (a polyanion known to remove lipoproteins nonspecifically bound to the cell surface and specifically bound to their receptors), followed by immunocytochemistry for apoE. Treatment with suramin did not significantly reduce the apoE immunoreactivity associated with the cells. Second, immunocytochemical studies were performed in cells that were not permeabilized to permit access of antibody to the cytoplasm. No immunoreactivity of apoE was observed in nonpermeabilized cells incubated with β-VLDL together with either apoE3 or apoE4. These results demonstrated that the apoE was intracellular. The observed intracellular accumulation of apoE was unexpected, since lipoproteins and their apoproteins, when internalized by nonneuronal cell types, are rapidly degraded. To determine if the accumulation of apoE was specific to neurons, we performed similar immunocytochemistry experiments in murine fibroblasts. In these studies no apoE immunoreactivity was observed in the fibroblasts incubated with β-VLDL and either apoE3 or apoE4, suggesting either that apoE enters neurons and fibroblasts through different pathways or that in neurons apoE, especially apoE3, can escape lysosomal degradation. These results demonstrate that apoE3 is retained in Neuro-2a cells to a greater extent than apoE4 and that the metabolism of apoE in neuronal and nonneuronal cells is different.The differences observed in the accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4 were confirmed by incubating the neurons with 125I-labeled apoE and β-VLDL at 37°C for 48 h, and the amount of cell-associated apoE (bound and internalized) was quantitated. A differential accumulation of 125I-apoE was observed, with twice as much 125I-apoE3 as 125I-apoE4 being associated with the cells at the end of the incubation period (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Cell association of 125 I-apoE with Neuro-2a cells. Neuro-2a cells were grown for 2 days in medium containing β-VLDL (40 μg of cholesterol/ml) together with 30 μg/ml of either 125 I-apoE3 or 125 I-apoE4.

Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and its precursor are found in neurofibrillary tangle-containing neurons. Aβ is the major component of extracellular plaques. We showed that Aβ acts as an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in vitro. We examined the effect of Aβ on the steps of this proteolytic pathway that contribute to the level of ubiquitin conjugates in the cell. Neither conjugate formation nor conjugate deubiquitination was affected by the presence of Aβ. However, Aβ significantly reduced the rate of conjugate degradation. Our results indicate that Aβ interacts with the proteolytic step of the ubiquitin degradative pathway. Since this step is performed by the 26 S proteasome, the effect of Aβ on the catalytic core of this proteolytic complex, the 20 S proteasome, was determined. We found that Aβ selectively inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome. Under pathological conditions in the affected neuron, Aβ could interfere with ubiquitin-dependent degradation by inhibiting the 26 S proteasome activity. This finding may explain the origin of the accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates."

To further understand the diverse roles of antigen receptor signaling throughout T cell development, we have identified a new NFATc family member, NFATc3, that is expressed at highest levels in the thymus. NFATc3 is the product of a gene on murine chromosome 8 that is not linked to the other NFATc genes.

INTRODUCTIONThe antigen receptor of T lymphocytes subserves diverse functions during development. In the thymus, signals from the antigen receptor rescue from death those cells that have low avidity receptors for self-antigens bound to major histocompatability complex molecules (positive selection), whereas high avidity self-antigens induce programmed cell death (negative selection)(1Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Tonegawa S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 362-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In mature, peripheral T cells, interaction with foreign antigen leads to immunologic activation. In each case characteristic sets of genes are activated or repressed by signals emanating from the antigen receptor. For example, antigen receptor-induced repression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes (2Turka L.A. Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Chun J.J. Gorka C. Lee K. McCormack W.T. Thompson C.B. Science. 1991; 253: 778-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and activation of the CD69 gene (3Yamashita I. Nagata T. Tada T. Nakayama T. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) are hallmarks of thymic selection. In mature T cells, antigen receptor-induced expression of growth factor genes such as IL-2 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinNFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsNFATccytosolic component of NFATPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTCRT cell antigen receptorARREantigen receptor response elementGM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorTNFtumor necrosis factorPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidRSDrel similarity domain(s). and genes that encode cell-cell interaction molecules, such as the CD40 ligand, are essential for immunologic function and proliferation. How these diverse cell fates and functions are initiated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is not understood, but likely involve the use of distinct antigen receptor response elements to activate genes essential for specific developmental transitions.T cell antigen receptor response elements (ARREs) were initially described in the IL-2 gene of mature T cells(4Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The protein complex that binds to one of these elements, designated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT; (5Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)), appears to integrate Ras- and calcium-dependent signals initiated by the antigen receptor through the assembly of cytosolic (NFATc) and nuclear (NFATn) components. NFATc is present in the cytosol of resting lymphocytes in a transcriptionally active form and translocates to the nucleus within 5 min of T cell activation(6Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). This translocation event, as well as NFAT complex formation and NFAT site-dependent transcription, is calcium- and calcineurin-dependent and completely blocked by the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A(6Flanagan W.M.

Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). NFATn is synthesized within 20 min of T cell activation by a Ras/protein kinase C-dependent pathway and can be replaced by high levels of AP1(6Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R.

In addition to the NFAT site within the IL-2 gene promoter, putative NFAT DNA binding sites have been identified in the promoters of several genes that are transcriptionally induced upon antigen receptor activation in a CsA/FK506-sensitive manner, including IL-3/GM-CSF(12Cockerill P.N.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, NFAT represents a multicomponent transcription factor complex that integrates signals transduced by the TCR through the use of constituents that are the targets of distinct signaling pathways.In addition to its role in the transcriptional induction of cytokine genes in mature T lymphocytes, NFAT may also be involved in T cell ontogeny in the thymus. Although ARREs have not been defined for TCR signaling in the thymus, the ability of thymocytes to induce NFAT DNA binding activity to the IL-2 ARRE appears to be developmentally regulated. This conclusion is based upon results demonstrating that in short term thymocyte cultures, NFAT is inducible in CD4-CD8- cells, noninducible in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, and inducible in the single-positive populations(20Riegel J.S. Richie E.R. Allison J.P. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3611-3618PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A role for NFAT in thymic maturation is also suggested by the observations that cyclosporin A or FK506, which inhibits calcineurin and completely blocks transcription directed by the NFAT site(6Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 8Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), blocks the development of the CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ subpopulations of thymocytes(22Jenkins M.K. Schwartz R.H. Pardoll D.M. Science. 1988; 241: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 23Gao E.K. Lo D. Cheney R. Kanagawa O. Sprent J. Nature. 1988; 336: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, although a variety of studies suggest a role for the NFAT transcription factor complex in regulating development in the thymus, there is no clear understanding of the specific mechanism by which this occurs. This is due, in part, to a lack of understanding of the molecular characteristics of the NFAT complex in developing thymocytes and the lack of definition of ARREs for intrathymic signaling by the T lymphocyte receptor.The purification and molecular cloning of the preexisting or cytosolic component of NFAT resulted in the identification of two distinct genes, NFATp (24McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and NFATc(25Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), both of which encode proteins that are capable of binding to NFAT DNA sites and are present in the NFAT gel shift complex. These proteins share a conserved region of limited similarity (∼20% amino acid identity) to the rel homology domain of dorsal/rel/NFκB transcription factors, and therefore appear to define a distinct family or subfamily of transcription factors(25Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Whether this family will also be characterized by other features shared by NFATc and NFATp, such as their function as targets of calcium-dependent signal transduction, is uncertain. 2To facilitate study of these proteins, we have employed a system of nomenclature proposed by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (see footnote, (29Li X. Ho S.N. Luna J. Giacalone J. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Crabtree G.R. Francke U. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1995; 68: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) in which the family of NFATc- or NFATp-related transcription factor genes is designated NFATC (as known family members are cytosolic as originally described and to maintain the distinction between the separate components of the NFAT complex; (6Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar)), and each member of this family is numbered sequentially. Thus, NFATC1 and NFATC2 are used to indicate the NFATc and NFATp genes, respectively (Nfatc1 and Nfatc2 refer to the murine genes). Here we refer to the NFATC-encoded RNA/cDNA or protein as NFATc. To further investigate the role of the NFATc family of transcription factors in signal transduction and T cell development, a cDNA library derived from thymocytes induced to undergo negative selection (26Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) was screened for additional NFATc family members. An additional cDNA was isolated that encodes a novel NFATc family member, NFATc3. Characterization of this cDNA indicates that NFATc3 RNA is preferentially expressed in thymus, spleen, and lymph node and that NFATc3 exhibits DNA binding specificity distinct from that of other NFATc family members. Furthermore, thymic NFATc3 undergoes alterations in apparent molecular mass in response to increases in intracellular calcium that are reversed by the immunosuppressant FK506, suggesting that NFATc3 is regulated by calcineurin in a manner similar to the other NFATc family members. These results extend our understanding of the molecular characteristics of NFATc proteins and should permit a more rigorous analysis of the role of the NFATc family of transcription factors in thymic development and signal transduction.MATERIALS AND METHODSNFATc3 cDNA CloningA cDNA library (kindly provided by B. Osborne) was derived from T cell receptor transgenic murine thymus stimulated in vivo by inducing negative selection with injected antigen(26Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The library, constructed in the UNI-Zap XR vector (Stratagene), was screened using a radiolabeled DNA probe corresponding to the rel similarity domain of murine NFATc1 and NFATc2 (24McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The probe was labeled by PCR amplification, as described(27Schowalter D.B. Sommer S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides 5′-TGATCACCTCCAAGATATGGAAGACCAGTCC and 5′-GCGCGTCGACGGCAGAGCGCTGAGAGCA were used to amplify a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 434-1206 of the murine NFATc2 cDNA (24McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T.

The murine NFATc1 cDNA clone used as a template in PCR reactions was obtained by low stringency screening of the same library using the full-length human NFATc1 clone (25Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) as a probe. 3L. A. Timmerman and G. R. Crabtree, unpublished data. Colonies that hybridized under low stringency conditions only were isolated. The clone containing the longest cDNA insert, clone 3, was sequenced in its entirety on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Analysis of the NFATc3 sequence, including data base searches, alignments, and motif searches, employed both the GCG version 7.4 (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) and the Intelligenetics Suite release 5.4 (Intelligenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA) software packages.Plasmid ConstructsThe NFATc3 expression construct was made as follows: a 3215-bp NFATc3 fragment was obtained from clone 3 by XhoI digestion (an XhoI site was present in the vector at the 3′ end of the clone), filling in of the 5′ overhang with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and digestion with XbaI (site present at nucleotide 404). This fragment was inserted in frame into the 5′ FLAG epitope-tagged expression vector pDF30 (kindly provided by D. Fiorentino) at the XbaI-MscI sites within the polylinker, resulting in the plasmid pSH250A. This vector is a derivative of the pBJ5 mammalian expression vector, which contains the SRα promoter(28Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NFATc2 expression construct, pSH210, consists of a human NFATc2 cDNA fragment inserted into the pBJ5 vector. The human homolog of the murine NFATc2 cDNA (24McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T.

N. Ho, D. J. Thomas, and G. R. Crabtree, unpublished results. The NFATc1 expression construct, pSH107c, contains the human NFATc1 cDNA (25Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A.

Primers (forward: 5′ TCAGCTGTGGGAAACGAG and reverse: 5′ CTATGCAACCAGGTCACC) were designed from the 3′-untranslated region of the NFATc3 cDNA and gave rise to the expected 154-bp DNA fragment upon PCR amplification (95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min). Fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out as described previously(30Milatovich A. Travis A. Grosschedl R. Francke U. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1040-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Ribonuclease Protection AssaysRNA was isolated from whole tissues or cell lines by guanidinium thiocyanate lysis and cesium chloride centrifugation(31Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). A NFATc3 cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1191-1355) in pBluescriptIIKS+ and a 131-bp human γ-actin cDNA fragment in pSP64 (Promega) which cross-hybridizes to murine γ-actin were used as templates for the synthesis of antisense RNA labeled to high specific activity with [32P]UTP. Full-length RNA probes were isolated on a denaturing acrylamide gel and hybridized in excess to 10 μg of total RNA overnight at 42°C in 40 mM PIPES (pH 6.7), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 80% formamide. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 42°C with 300 μl of digestion buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 35 units of RNase TI, 1 μg of RNase AIII. Proteinase K (40 μg) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (20 μl of 10% solution) were added and the incubation continued for 20 min. Samples were then extracted twice with phenol:chloroform (1:1, v:v), precipitated, resuspended in gel loading buffer, and analyzed by 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.NFATc AntibodiesThe NFATc3 antiserum was raised against a 74-amino acid peptide of NFATc3 extending from residues 321 to 395 (Fig. 2A). This peptide was selected for the generation of antisera, because it did not overlap with either the conserved rel similarity domain or the SP repeat region and therefore could be expected to give rise to antisera that would not cross-react with other NFATc family members. The protein used for immunization consisted of a bacterially produced glutathione S-transferase-NFATc3 fusion protein. The bacterial expression construct was prepared by in-frame ligation of the 227-bp ScaI-MscI fragment from the NFATc3 cDNA clone (nucleotides 958-1185) into the EcoRI site of pGex3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose as specified by the manufacturer (Pharmacia) and used to immunize rabbits (Josman Laboratories). Antisera was affinity-purified on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). The NFATc1 (NFATc) monoclonal antibody 7A6 was described previously(25Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A.

The NFATc2 (NFATp) monoclonal antibody 5H8 was used as a hybridoma culture supernatant and will be described elsewhere. 5L. Timmerman, manuscript in preparation. Cell Culture and TransfectionThe Jurkat TAg (SV40 T antigen) cell line (10Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and COS cells (obtained from ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine (complete media) in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified atmosphere. Jurkat TAg cells (107) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of the indicated plasmid by electroporation in 0.4 ml of complete medium (Bio-Rad gene pulser; 960 μF, 250 V, 0.4-cm gap width). Cells were harvested after 24 h and aliquoted in triplicate into 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (2 × 105 cells/well in 100 μl of complete medium) and stimulated with various combinations of ionomycin (1 μM), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 20 ng/ml), or FK506 (2 ng/ml) in a final volume of 200 μl. Reporter gene activity was measured 12-24 h after stimulation. COS cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence in 150-mm2 plastic tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and transiently transfected by electroporation (960 μF, 230 V, 0.4-cm gap width) in 0.4 ml of complete medium.Reporter Gene AssaySecreted alkaline phosphatase activity was measured 16-24 h after stimulation, as described previously(32Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 33Cullen B.R. Malim M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were heated to 65°C for 1.5-2 h, and 100-μl aliquots from each well were incubated with an equal volume of 2 M diethanolamine bicarbonate (pH 10.0), 1 mM methylumbelliferyl phosphate (Sigma) at 37°C. Relative alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by quantitating the accumulation of fluorescent product using a Titertek Fluoroskan II (ICN) with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.Preparation of Cell ExtractsNuclear extracts from Jurkat TAg and COS1 cells were prepared essentially as described previously (34Fiering S. Northrop J.P. Nolan G.P. Mattila P.S. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1823-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in buffer A (10 mM Hepes (pH 7.8), 15 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA), pelleted by low speed centrifugation (Eppendorf microcentrifuge, setting 3 for 3 min), and resuspended in buffer A + 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The resulting nuclei were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in buffer C (50 mM Hepes at pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol). The nuclei were lysed by addition of 0.10 volume of 3 M ammonium sulfate (pH 7.9) followed by rotation at 4°C for 30 min. The nuclear debris was pelleted by high speed centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 15 min (Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge, TLA 100.2 rotor). Protein in the supernatant was precipitated by addition of an equal volume of 3.0 M ammonium sulfate (pH 7.9), pelleted by centrifugation (50,000 rpm for 8 min), and resuspended in 50-100 μl of buffer C. All buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were stored at −75°C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye assay (Bio-Rad). Thymus, spleen, and lymph node extracts were prepared as above from unfractionated cell suspensions. Thymus whole cell extracts were prepared from an unfractionated cell suspension treated with the indicated stimuli for 15 min. Cells were subsequently washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate and protease inhibitors (listed above). Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation. COS whole cell extracts were similarly prepared.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayDNA binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 15 μl containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 80 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, varying concentrations of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μg of nuclear extract, and 0.1 ng of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. After addition of nuclear extract, samples were incubated at room temperature for 45-60 min, loaded onto a prerun 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 30:0.8) cast in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE), and electrophoresed at 180 V for 2-2.5 h using 0.5 × TBE running buffer. Supershifts were performed by addition of 1 μL of a 1:10 dilution of an ascites preparation of the monoclonal antibody 7A6, or 2 μl of a hybridoma culture 5H8 supernatant, to the preformed gel shift complex and incubating for an additional 30 min on ice. Gel shift probes included: the murine IL-2 NFAT site, 5′ ACTGACCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATGATC; the murine IL-4 NFAT site, 5′ CTTTACATTGGAAAATTTTAT(35Todd M.D. Grusby M.J. Lederer J.A. Lacy E.

After a 1-h incubation on ice, the Sepharose was washed three times with lysis buffer and subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed using protein A-purified rabbit anti-NFATc3 antiserum (1:500 dilution) and protein A-peroxidase (Sigma) as the secondary (1:2500 dilution).RESULTSMolecular Cloning of NFATc3DNA fragments encoding the rel similarity domains (RSD) of the murine NFATc1 and NFATc2 cDNA clones were used to screen a thymus cDNA library(26Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Low stringency hybridization and washing resulted in 220 positive plaques (approximately 9 × 105 plaques screened). All but 21 of these plaques were resistant to high stringency wash conditions. The 21 plaques that hybridized under low stringency conditions only were characterized and found to represent overlapping clones of a common cDNA sequence. The longest of these clones (#3) contained a cDNA sequence spanning 3619 nucleotides (Fig. 1). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1065 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 115 kilodaltons, and contains a putative polyadenlyation signal 16 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail. However, it lacks a 5′ in-frame stop codon or translation initiation codon and therefore likely represents a partial cDNA clone. As expected, comparison of the cDNA sequence to sequences present in the Genbank.Figure 1:Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of murine NFATc3.

Signal sequence cleavage and processing could be reproduced with reconstituted vesicles containing Sec61, signal recognition particle receptor, and signal peptidase complex. INTRODUCTIONSignal sequences mediate the entry of proteins into the secretory pathway (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975a). As soon as they emerge from the ribosome, signal sequences are recognized by the cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRPsignal recognition particleERendoplasmic reticulumSPCsignal peptidase complexPPLpreprolactinPLprolactinPSPprocessed signal peptideSPsignal peptideMHCmajor histocompatibility complexTAPtransporter associated with antigen presentation. (Walter et al., 1981), which targets the nascent proteins to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specific binding of the ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex to the ER membrane occurs through binding to the membrane-bound SRP receptor (also called docking protein) (Gilmore et al., 1982; Meyer et al., 1982). After SRP displacement and insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation complex, the signal sequence is cotranslationally cleaved (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975b), and the mature part of the protein is translocated into the lumen of the ER.Although signal sequences display almost no sequence similarities, they share some common features. They can be found at the amino terminus of the respective proteins and consist in most cases of 20-30 amino acid residues. Furthermore, they usually show a characteristic tripartite structure; a positively charged amino-terminal region precedes a central hydrophobic core, which is followed by a COOH-terminal polar region that contains the cleavage site for the signal peptidase (von Heijne, 1985).The microsomal signal peptidase has been purified as a complex of five subunits (signal peptidase complex (SPC)) with apparent molecular masses of 12, 18, 21, 22/23, and 25 kDa (Evans et al., 1986). The 18-kDa and the 21-kDa subunits, SPC18 and SPC21, are mammalian homologues of the Escherichia coli leader peptidase (van Dijl et al., 1992), which performs the signal sequence cleavage as a single protein (Zwizinski and Wickner, 1980). Both subunits are also homologous to the yeast SEC11 protein (Greenburg et al., 1989; Shelness and Blobel, 1990), which is an essential component of the signal peptidase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Böhni et al., 1988). All leader peptidase homologues contain a highly conserved serine residue that is supposed to catalyze the actual signal peptidase reaction (Sung and Dalbey, 1992).In E. coli, cleaved signal peptides are digested by signal peptide peptidases (Hussain et al., 1982). This degradation is thought to be initiated by membrane-bound protease IV, which cleaves the peptide within the hydrophobic core (Novak and Dev, 1988). The resulting fragments can be released into the cytosol and further hydrolyzed by oligopeptidase A (Novak and Dev, 1988). Both signal peptide peptidases are endoproteases and account for the majority of signal peptide degrading activity in vitro (Novak et al., 1986).Most likely, signal peptides are also degraded in eukaryotic cells (Habener et al., 1979), but the process itself, the enzymes involved, and the sites of cleavage have not yet been elucidated. We show here that the preprolactin (PPL) signal peptide is further processed in rough microsomes. The resulting COOH-terminal signal peptide fragment could be detected in the cytosolic fraction of translocation assays. Further results suggest that signal peptide processing is required although not sufficient for the release of the signal peptide from the membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction enzymes and cycloheximide were from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (cap analogue) was supplied by New England Biolabs GmbH (Schwalbach, Germany), and [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine were from Amersham Buchler GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). Puromycin was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Vertriebs GmbH (Deisenhofen, Germany), and proteinase K was supplied by E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).Plasmids and TranscriptionThe plasmid encoding PPL has been previously described (High et al., 1993). Codons 12 and 13 of the coding region were replaced by two methionine (ATG) codons using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (Ho et al., 1989) to yield the PPLMM mutant. mRNA coding for full-length PPL and PPL86 was produced by linearizing the plasmid with EcoRI and PvuII, respectively, and subsequent transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Transcription was performed at 42°C in the presence of 500 nM m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G.Translation and TranslocationTranslation was performed in wheat germ extract for 15 min at 25°C in the presence of [35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine, SRP, and dog pancreatic rough microsomes or reconstituted vesicles. SRP, rough microsomes, and reconstituted vesicles were prepared as previously described (Walter and Blobel, 1983a, 1983b; Görlich and Rapoport, 1993).After translation of PPL86, samples were put on ice, and the salt concentration was raised to 500 mM KOAc. The samples were incubated for 5 min on ice and layered on top of a 50-μl cushion containing 500 mM sucrose, 500 mM KOAc, 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Membranes were pelleted by a 3-min centrifugation at 48,000 rpm and 4°C in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor. Reconstituted vesicles were sedimented twice through a cushion containing only 100 mM sucrose under otherwise identical conditions. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 70 mM KOAc, 10 mM KCl, 3 mM Mg(OAc)2, 200 μM GTP, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Nascent chains were released from ribosomes by the addition of puromycin, pH 7.9, to the final concentration of 1 mM and by a 12-min incubation at 28°C. Membranes were pelleted by centrifuging translocation assays for 3 min at 48,000 rpm and 4°C in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor.Proteinase K treatment was performed by incubating translocation assays for 10 min at 25°C in the presence of 300 μg/ml proteinase K. For controls, proteinase K was omitted or added in the presence of 1% Triton X-100.Analysis of Translation and Translocation ProductsFull-length PPL was analyzed in 12.5% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli(1970). PPL86 and its processed products were separated in 16.5% T, 3% C gels according to Schägger and von Jagow(1987). Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography or a Fuji phosphoimager BAS1000. Radioactivity in respective bands was quantified using the phosphoimager and Fuji MacBAS V1.0 software. The amount of radioactivity was determined in the area of relevant peptides, and the corresponding amount in lanes containing unprocessed PPL86 was subtracted as background.PPL signal peptide-specific molecular weight markers were produced by in vitro transcription/translation of PPL TAG18, PPL TAG25 (High et al., 1993), and PPL30 (synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification according to Nilsson et al. (1994)).RESULTSCharacterization of the PPLMM MutantSignal sequence cleavage and processing was studied in an in vitro system that relies on translation in wheat germ extract in the presence of radioactive amino acids (e.g. [35S]methionine) and dog pancreatic rough microsomes. For better detection of the cleaved signal peptide, a preprolactin mutant with two additional methionines within the signal sequence was constructed (PPLMM, Fig. 1A). To test whether the signal sequence of this mutant is cleaved by signal peptidase, mRNA encoding PPLMM was translated in the presence of rough microsomes. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, signal peptide cleavage for this mutant is as efficient as for the wild type (compare lane3 and lane2). Thus, the mutant can be used for the intended investigation with the advantage of a more easily detectable signal peptide.Identification of the Processed Preprolactin Signal PeptideFor the analysis of the signal peptide, the plasmids encoding PPL and PPLMM, respectively, were linearized within their coding sequence by PvuII and transcribed in vitro. The resulting truncated mRNAs code for the amino-terminal 86 amino acids of PPL (PPL86). Since these mRNAs lack a stop codon, normal termination of translation cannot occur, and the nascent chains remain bound to the ribosomes as peptidyl-tRNA (Gilmore et al., 1991). When translation takes place in the presence of SRP and rough microsomes, nascent chains become functionally inserted into translocation complexes. Since ribosome-bound, membrane-inserted PPL86 is too short to be cleaved by signal peptidase, it accumulates in its unprocessed form. Unrelated polypeptides that are also present in our translocation assay and interfere with the analysis of the signal peptide were removed by sedimenting the microsomes through a high salt sucrose cushion (Fig. 2A, lanes1 and 2).Figure 2:Puromycin release of ribosome-bound PPL86. A, PPLMM86 mRNA (lanes1-4) or PPL86 mRNA (lane5) was translated in the presence of SRP and RM. After translation, membranes were sedimented through a high salt sucrose cushion. The supernatant (SN, lane1) was removed, and the pellet (P, lane2) was resuspended and incubated with 4 mM cycloheximide (CHI, lane3) or 1 mM puromycin (Puro, lane4). B, quantification of the results shown in panel A, lanes3-5. The amount of radioactivity in the area of PPL85, PL56, and PSP was determined by using the phosphoimager as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of radioactivity in unprocessed PPL86 (A, lane2) was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When nascent chains are released from the ribosomes by puromycin, they become translocated across the microsomal membrane (Redman and Sabatini, 1966), and their signal sequence is cleaved. Accordingly, we detected two peptides with apparent molecular masses of about 5 and 3 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes4 and 5) representing the mature part of PPL86 (PL56) generated by signal sequence cleavage between amino acid residues 30 and 31 (Sasavage et al., 1982) and the processed signal peptide (PSP), respectively. Processing was only observed when puromycin was added and did not occur in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2A, lane3). The ratios of label in the 5- and 3-kDa peptides were roughly 1:1 for the MM mutant (Fig. 2B, lane4) and 3:1 for the wild type (Fig. 2B, lane5). These ratios are consistent with the methionine content of PL56 (three methionines) and of the processed signal peptide (three methionines in MM mutant, one in wild type).Localization of the Processed Signal PeptideTo determine whether the processed signal peptide is exposed to the cytoplasmic surface of microsomes, we treated translocation assays with proteinase K. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, lane2, PL56 but not the PSP was protected against proteolysis. This indicates that PL56 was translocated into the lumen of the microsomes, whereas the PSP was in the cytosol or on the cytoplasmic surface of the membranes.Figure 3:Localization of the processed signal peptide. A, proteinase K treatment of microsomal membranes. Microsomes containing puromycin-released PPLMM86 (lane1) were incubated with proteinase K in the absence (lane2) or presence (lane3) of Triton X-100. B, pelleting of microsomes. Assays containing rough microsomes and membrane-inserted PPLMM86 were centrifuged directly (lanes1-3) or after treatment with puromycin (lanes4-6) and separated into supernatant (lanes2 and 5) and pellet (lanes3 and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When membranes were pelleted after puromycin release, the PSP was found in the supernatant (Fig. 3B, lane5), whereas PL56 was found in the microsomal pellet (Fig. 3B, lane6). We therefore conclude that the PSP is released into the cytosol.Characterization of the Processed Signal PeptideTo determine the apparent size of the processed signal peptide, we synthesized marker peptides representing the intact PPL signal peptide (30 amino acid residues) or amino-terminal fragments of 24 and 17 amino acid residues, respectively. Parallel analysis of these peptides with puromycin-released wild type PPL86 (Fig. 4A) revealed that the PSP is not the intact signal peptide but only a fragment of about 20 amino acid residues. Since the only methionine in the wild type PPL signal sequence is the initiating methionine, the fragment must be COOH-terminally truncated.Figure 4:Characterization of the processed signal peptide. A, parallel electrophoretic analysis of puromycin-released wild type PPL86 (lane2) and marker peptides (lanes1 and 3). B, cysteine labeling of PPL86 and its processed products. PPLMM86 mRNA was translated in the presence of [35 S]cysteine (lanes1 and 2) or [35 S]methionine (lane3). The assay was performed as described for Fig. 2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This conclusion was confirmed by labeling PPL86 with [35S]cysteine. The signal sequence of PPL contains one cysteine at position 25, and PL56 contains two cysteines. If the signal peptide were truncated amino-terminally of cysteine 25, the PSP should not be detectable on gels. Indeed, after puromycin treatment of cysteine-labeled PPL86, PL56 accumulated, whereas the PSP remained invisible (Fig. 4B, lane2).Time Dependence of Signal Sequence Processing and ReleaseTo investigate the time dependence of signal sequence processing, we performed a pulse-chase experiment. Nascent chains were released from the ribosomes by the addition of puromycin followed by an incubation at 25°C. At the time points indicated, aliquots were taken and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then thawed on ice, separated into supernatant and pellet, and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). 1 min after the addition of puromycin, PL56 and two small peptides of about 3 kDa were detected in the microsomal pellet (Fig. 5, lane4). Due to its apparent comigration with in vitro synthesized intact signal peptide (Fig. 5, lane15), we designated the slower migrating peptide signal peptide (SP). Over time, the amount of the SP decreased, whereas the PSP became the predominant small processing product, which was gradually released into the supernatant (Fig. 5, lane13). This suggests that the cleaved signal peptide is processed to the PSP during the chase. Furthermore, the PSP is retained in the microsomes for several minutes prior to its release into the cytosol.Figure 5:Pulse-chase experiment. Nascent PPLM86 was released from the ribosomes by puromycin and incubated at 25°C. Aliquots were taken at the time points indicated and separated into supernatant (SN) and pellet (P).

The latter finding suggests that the signal peptide processing activity resides in the membrane fraction of microsomes. To characterize this activity, we used reconstituted vesicles containing the minimal components for PPL translocation, Sec61 and SRP receptor (Görlich and Rapoport, 1993), and the microsomal SPC. Proteoliposomes were reconstituted from purified Sec61 complex, purified SRP receptor, purified SPC, and a mixture of phospholipids. The SPC preparation used for reconstitution shows the characteristic composition with proteins of 12, 18, 21, 22/23, and 25 kDa (Evans et al., 1986) (Fig. 6A). Reconstituted vesicles were tested by in vitro translation of PPL in the presence of SRP (Fig. 6B). Posttranslational treatment of the assay mixture with proteinase K (Fig. 6B, lanes4-6) revealed protection of processed PPL against proteolytic digestion (Fig. 6B, lane6). This proves the reconstituted vesicles to be competent for membrane translocation and signal sequence cleavage.Figure 6:Membrane translocation and signal sequence cleavage by reconstituted vesicles. A, protein composition of the SPC preparation used for reconstitution. The proteins were separated on a 16% acrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. B, translocation into reconstituted vesicles. PPL mRNA was translated in the presence of SRP and membrane buffer (lanes1 and 4) or reconstituted vesicles containing Sec61 and SRP receptor (lanes2 and 5) or reconstituted vesicles containing Sec61, SRP receptor, and SPC (lanes3 and 6). After translation, half of the samples were treated with proteinase K (lanes4-6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assay for signal peptide processing by the reconstituted vesicles, we used membrane-inserted and puromycin-released PPL86. When reconstituted vesicles containing only Sec61 and SRP receptor were used, no processing of PPLMM86 was observed (Fig. 7A, lane1). When reconstituted vesicles containing Sec61, SRP receptor, and SPC were used, a peptide of about 5 kDa and, similar to early steps in microsomes (Fig. 5, lane4), two peptides of about 3 kDa were generated (Fig. 7A, lane2). The 5-kDa peptide and the faster migrating 3-kDa peptide comigrated with PL56 and the PSP, respectively (Fig. 7B, lanes4 and 5). However, the SP∗ is not the intact signal peptide, as it exhibits a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility when compared to in vitro synthesized intact signal peptide (PPL30, Fig. 7C). Thus, reconstituted vesicles can process the signal sequence; however, the processing sites differ from those in microsomes. Furthermore, the considerable amount of SP∗ suggests that signal peptide processing is inefficient in reconstituted vesicles.Figure 7:Processing of PPL86 by reconstituted vesicles. A, puromycin release of PPLMM86 bound to reconstituted vesicles with (lane2) or without (lane1) SPC.

This allowed a comparatively easy detection of the processed signal peptide and provided circumstantial evidence for its identity by comparison to the wild type peptide. To overcome the problem with unrelated small peptides in the reaction mixture, we used a two stage in vitro system. In the first stage, nascent PPL86 was inserted into membranes with signal peptidase being unable to cleave the signal sequence. Membrane-inserted chains were purified by centrifugation, thus leaving unrelated small peptides in the supernatant. In a second reaction, translocation and signal peptide cleavage were induced by liberation of the nascent chains from the ribosomes by puromycin. This allowed also the synchronization of the translocation and processing reactions.The PPL signal peptide fragment generated by microsomes and released into the cytosol comprises the amino-terminal, roughly 20 amino acid residues of the signal sequence. The approximate size was estimated from a comparison with defined amino-terminal PPL signal peptide fragments as standards. According to our size estimation, cleavage occurs between the two leucine clusters in the middle of the hydrophobic core of the PPL signal peptide (see Fig. 1A). This indicates that the mammalian signal peptide peptidase like its E. coli counterpart cleaves the signal peptide in the hydrophobic core.After short incubation with puromycin, the apparently intact SP accumulated and was processed to the PSP over time. Initially, the SP as well as the PSP were associated with the microsomes. Only after prolonged incubation, the PSP was released into the supernatant, whereas the SP stayed in the pellet. This suggests that cleavage within the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide is required although not sufficient for its release from the membrane and indicates that the PSP undergoes a time-dependent release into the cytosol. The release of the PSP might be important for subsequent polypeptide translocation across the membrane, a notion being supported by the finding that inhibition of E. coli signal peptide peptidase results in inhibition of translocation (Chen and Tai, 1989). Degradation of signal peptides might thus contribute to the maintenance of fast and efficient protein translocation across the ER membrane.It has been shown before that the addition of prepromelittin to vesicles reconstituted from rat liver microsomes resulted in the generation of the intact signal peptide (Mollay et al., 1982). This finding does not contradict our results, as prepromelittin signal sequence cleavage occurred from polypeptides not inserted into the membrane, and signal peptides accumulating in the cytosol could have escaped further processing by signal peptide peptidase. Furthermore, an extraction procedure was used that specifically selects for hydrophobic peptides (Mollay et al., 1982), thus excluding processed signal peptide fragments from detection.Signal Sequence Processing in Reconstituted VesiclesSignal sequence cleavage has been previously investigated with detergent-solubilized SPC. In contrast to these studies, we used here a reconstituted system where ribosome-attached nascent chains are functionally inserted into membranes prior to cleavage by the SPC. This system maintains the spatial arrangement of the nascent polypeptide at the translocation site, and it can therefore be expected to reproduce the sequentially occurring events of membrane translocation and signal sequence processing. Using reconstituted vesicles we observed signal sequence cleavage as previously described (Görlich and Rapoport, 1993). However, in contrast to microsomes, we did not obtain the predicted intact signal peptide of 30 amino acid residues (Sasavage et al., 1982) but a slightly shorter fragment (SP∗). Most likely, this is due to signal peptidase cleavage at a second site between amino acid residues 25 and 26, which is also predicted by the(−1, −3) rule (von Heijne, 1983).Reconstituted vesicles containing SPC were able to process the signal peptide to the PSP, which was released into the supernatant. This suggests that the reconstituted vesicles containing SPC contained also signal peptide peptidase activity. Signal peptide processing was, however, found to be less efficient with reconstituted vesicles than with microsomes. Whether the signal peptide peptidase is one of the known subunits of the SPC or partially copurified with one of the components used for reconstitution remains to be determined. Signal peptide peptidase from E. coli has been characterized before (Ichihara et al., 1986). It shows no homologies to any one of the SPC subunits (Shelness et al., 1988; Greenburg et al., 1989; Shelness and Blobel, 1990; Greenburg and Blobel, 1994). This includes SPC12, of which the cDNA has been recently cloned and sequenced. 2E. Hartmann, S. Prehn, K.-U. Kalies, and T. A. Rapoport, unpublished results. The Fate of Signal Peptide FragmentsOur data suggest that the amino-terminal PPL signal peptide fragment is released into the cytosol, where it may be further processed or degraded by the proteasome, a large multicatalytic protease (Goldberg and Rock, 1992). Since the COOH-terminal PPL signal peptide fragment is too small to be resolved by our gel system, we could not investigate its fate. For the following reason, however, we can assume that COOH-terminal signal peptide fragments are released into the ER lumen. Nascent presecretory proteins are thought to span the membrane in a loop-like conformation with the amino terminus of the signal sequence facing the cytoplasm and the cleavage site for signal peptidase facing the ER lumen (discussed in High and Dobberstein, 1992). Upon cleavage of the signal peptide within its hydrophobic core, the amino- and COOH-terminal fragments may be released to the sites they are exposed to, the cytosol and the lumen, respectively. Furthermore, fragments of the signal peptides from the interferon-inducible protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa (IP-30) and from calreticulin have been found associated with MHC class I molecules in cells lacking TAP transporters (Wei and Cresswell, 1992; Henderson et al., 1992). TAP transporters are thought to transport peptides generated in the cytosol into the ER lumen. In the presence of the TAP transporters, peptides of cytosolic origin are found associated with MHC class I molecules. Thus, if fragments derived from signal peptides are associated with MHC class I molecules in TAP-deficient cell lines, they are probably released into the ER lumen after their cleavage in the membrane. Like the PPL signal peptide fragment, they result from cleavage in the middle of the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence (Fig. 9). The amino-terminal signal peptide fragment also found among the peptides bound to MHC class I molecules is unusual as it lacks charged amino acid residues. Probably, the hydrophobic nature of this fragment caused its release into the ER lumen.Figure 9:Compilation of so far characterized signal peptide fragments. The localization of the fragments is indicated below the description of the source signal peptide. A, signal peptide fragments found associated with MHC class I molecules. Data are from Wei and Cresswell(1992) and Henderson et al.(1992). B, signal peptide fragment characterized in this study (dots indicate that the COOH-terminal end of the fragment is estimated from comparison with marker peptides) (see Fig. 4A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Steps in Signal Sequence Cleavage and ProcessingWe can distinguish at least three distinct steps in the signal sequence processing reaction (Fig. 10). 1) after membrane insertion of the nascent chain, the signal sequence is cleaved by signal peptidase; 2) the cleaved signal peptide is further processed by signal peptide peptidase; and 3) the signal peptide fragments are released from the membrane, either into the cytosol or into the ER lumen, where they could be further processed or completely hydrolyzed. The release of the signal peptide allows the clearance of the translocation complex and the subsequent insertion of a new polypeptide chain. This outline shows principal similarities to the corresponding processes in E. coli. Here, leader peptidase cleaves the signal sequence from the precursor protein. Processing of signal peptides is initiated by a membrane-bound signal peptide peptidase (protease IV), and the signal peptide fragments are released into the cytosol where they are degraded by cytosolic proteases.Figure 10:Schematic illustration of signal sequence cleavage and processing in rough microsomes. After membrane insertion of the nascent chain (1), the signal sequence is cleaved by signal peptidase (2), and the signal peptide is further processed by signal peptide peptidase (3). The signal peptide fragments are then released from the translocation complex either to the cytosol or into the ER lumen (4) to allow a new round of translocation. Proteins at the translocation site are shaded, and enzyme activity is indicated by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) INTRODUCTIONSignal sequences mediate the entry of proteins into the secretory pathway (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975a). As soon as they emerge from the ribosome, signal sequences are recognized by the cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRPsignal recognition particleERendoplasmic reticulumSPCsignal peptidase complexPPLpreprolactinPLprolactinPSPprocessed signal peptideSPsignal peptideMHCmajor histocompatibility complexTAPtransporter associated with antigen presentation. (Walter et al., 1981), which targets the nascent proteins to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specific binding of the ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex to the ER membrane occurs through binding to the membrane-bound SRP receptor (also called docking protein) (Gilmore et al., 1982; Meyer et al., 1982). After SRP displacement and insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation complex, the signal sequence is cotranslationally cleaved (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975b), and the mature part of the protein is translocated into the lumen of the ER.Although signal sequences display almost no sequence similarities, they share some common features. They can be found at the amino terminus of the respective proteins and consist in most cases of 20-30 amino acid residues. Furthermore, they usually show a characteristic tripartite structure; a positively charged amino-terminal region precedes a central hydrophobic core, which is followed by a COOH-terminal polar region that contains the cleavage site for the signal peptidase (von Heijne, 1985).The microsomal signal peptidase has been purified as a complex of five subunits (signal peptidase complex (SPC)) with apparent molecular masses of 12, 18, 21, 22/23, and 25 kDa (Evans et al., 1986). The 18-kDa and the 21-kDa subunits, SPC18 and SPC21, are mammalian homologues of the Escherichia coli leader peptidase (van Dijl et al., 1992), which performs the signal sequence cleavage as a single protein (Zwizinski and Wickner, 1980). Both subunits are also homologous to the yeast SEC11 protein (Greenburg et al., 1989; Shelness and Blobel, 1990), which is an essential component of the signal peptidase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Böhni et al., 1988). All leader peptidase homologues contain a highly conserved serine residue that is supposed to catalyze the actual signal peptidase reaction (Sung and Dalbey, 1992).In E. coli, cleaved signal peptides are digested by signal peptide peptidases (Hussain et al., 1982). This degradation is thought to be initiated by membrane-bound protease IV, which cleaves the peptide within the hydrophobic core (Novak and Dev, 1988). The resulting fragments can be released into the cytosol and further hydrolyzed by oligopeptidase A (Novak and Dev, 1988). Both signal peptide peptidases are endoproteases and account for the majority of signal peptide degrading activity in vitro (Novak et al., 1986).Most likely, signal peptides are also degraded in eukaryotic cells (Habener et al., 1979), but the process itself, the enzymes involved, and the sites of cleavage have not yet been elucidated. We show here that the preprolactin (PPL) signal peptide is further processed in rough microsomes. The resulting COOH-terminal signal peptide fragment could be detected in the cytosolic fraction of translocation assays. Further results suggest that signal peptide processing is required although not sufficient for the release of the signal peptide from the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2136220160,"The acetylcholinesterase active site consists of a gorge 20 A deep that is lined with aromatic residues. A serine residue near the base of the gorge defines an acylation site where an acyl enzyme intermediate is formed during the hydrolysis of ester substrates. Residues near the entrance to the gorge comprise a peripheral site where inhibitors like propidium and fasciculin 2, a snake neurotoxin, bind and interfere with catalysis. We report here the association and dissociation rate constants for fasciculin 2 interaction with the human enzyme in the presence of ligands that bind to either the peripheral site or the acylation site. These kinetic data confirmed that propidium is strictly competitive with fasciculin 2 for binding to the peripheral site. In contrast, edrophonium, N-methylacridinium, and butyrylthiocholine bound to the acylation site and formed ternary complexes with the fasciculin 2-bound enzyme in which their affinities were reduced by about an order of magnitude from their affinities in the free enzyme. Steady state analysis of the inhibition of substrate hydrolysis by fasciculin 2 revealed that the ternary complexes had residual activity. For acetylthiocholine and phenyl acetate, saturating amounts of the toxin reduced the first-order rate constant kcat to 0.5-2% and the second-order rate constant kcat/Kapp to 0.2-2% of their values with the uninhibited enzyme. To address whether fasciculin 2 inhibition primarily involved steric blockade of the active site or conformational interaction with the acylation site, deuterium oxide isotope effects on these kinetic parameters were measured. The isotope effect on kcat/Kapp increased for both substrates when fasciculin 2 was bound to the enzyme, indicating that fasciculin 2 acts predominantly by altering the conformation of the active site in the ternary complex so that steps involving proton transfer during enzyme acylation are slowed."

This is, in fact, the first substrate ever shown to interact specifically with Drosophila hsc72. Most surprisingly, expression of heavy chains in the absence of LC led to the efficient secretion of heavy chain dimers. Moreover, this secretion occurred in association with hsc72. This dramatically contrasts with what is seen in vertebrate cells where in the absence of LC, HC remains sequestered inside the cell in stable association with BiP. Our results clearly suggest that Drosophila BiP can substitute for its mammalian counterpart and chaperone the secretion of active IgG. However, the finding that Drosophila BiP can also uniquely chaperone heavy chain dimers indicates mechanistic differences that may relate to the evolved need for retaining immature IgGs in vertebrates.

Immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) is the only member of the stress 70 protein family that is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumhsc and HSCheat shock cognateHCheavy chainLClight chainmAbmonoclonal antibodyCHOChinese hamster ovaryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. of eucaryotic cells, where its functions as a chaperone are believed to support proper protein folding and protein translocation into the ER lumen (Gething and Sambrook, 1992). In vertebrate cells, BiP has been identified in association with various secretory proteins traversing the ER, in particular immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) polypeptides (Haas and Wabl, 1983). The most stable of these interactions are formed with proteins that are incompletely folded or aberrantly glycosylated (Bole etal., 1986; Gething, et al., 1986; Dorner et al., 1987), suggesting that BiP may promote proper protein folding and/or prevent immature proteins from leaving the cell. endoplasmic reticulum heat shock cognate heavy chain light chain monoclonal antibody Chinese hamster ovary enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vertebrate B lymphocytes, BiP associates stably with unassembled HC. BiP dissociation is triggered after LC is added to HC and the maturation of the immunoglobulin (Ig) structure is completed. This is exemplified in myeloma and pre-B cell lines expressing HC but not LC, where BiP remains tightly associated with HC immunoglobulins, allowing them to form dimers intracellularly, which are not secreted in the absence of LC association (Morrison and Scharff, 1975; McCune and Fu, 1981; Haas and Meo, 1988). This situation can be reversed by forming hybrids between these cell lines and lines expressing LC only, leading to the synthesis and secretion of complete HC•LC heterodimers (McCune and Fu, 1981; Mains and Sibley, 1982; Bole et al., 1986). Moreover, the HC dimers, which are bound irreversibly by BiP prior to such cell fusions, are released from BiP following fusion. Apparently, BiP sequesters the incompletely assembled antibodies in the ER, and LC incorporation participates in the release of BiP from the newly folded antibody (Hendershot, 1990). The release of antibody from BiP is known to be an ATP-dependent process (Munro and Pelham, 1986; Gaut and Hendershot, 1993; Dorner et al., 1990). This has been shown by the fact that antibody-BiP complexes can be dissociated in vitro by the addition of ATP (Munro and Pelham, 1986). Furthermore, mutations within the nucleoside binding site of BiP inhibit ATP hydrolysis and, in turn, the in vivo release of immunoglobulin heavy chain from BiP complexes (Gaut and Hendershot, 1993). Dissociation from BiP and secretion can also be blocked by depleting cellular ATP levels (Dorner et al., 1990). Therefore, ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for the release of HC from BiP. Recently, a BiP homologue in Drosophila melanogaster called heat shock cognate 3 (HSC3) has been cloned and characterized (Rubin et al., 1993). This gene encodes a 72-kDa protein (hsc72) that is 80% identical to human BiP (Haas and Meo, 1988) and one of at least five constitutively expressed heat shock cognate proteins in Drosophila, but the only ER-resident (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Pelham, 1988; Dean and Pelham, 1990). Drosophila BiP (hsc72) also contains the ATP-binding domain that is well conserved within the heat shock protein family (Lindquist and Craig, 1988; Gaut and Hendershot, 1993). The function of hsc72 in Drosophila is therefore likely to be analogous to that of BiP in vertebrates. To date, no substrates have been identified upon which hsc72 acts in Drosophila. The aim of the present study was to examine the ability of Drosophila cells to support the expression of antibodies and, most importantly, to examine the potential role of Drosophila BiP (hsc72) in the maturation and secretion of these antibodies. Our results indicate that Drosophila cells are capable of efficiently producing IgG molecules and that hsc72 interacts with HC in an ATP-dependent manner that is analogous to the action of BiP in vertebrate cells. Surprisingly, in Drosophila, HC dimers are efficiently secreted after BiP interaction in a manner independent of LC. The fact that LC does not appear to be required suggests mechanistic differences between hsc72 action in Drosophila and BiP in vertebrates.

Trill, S. Ganguly, and C. Silverman, unpublished data. The heavy and light chain cDNAs were then subcloned as separate EcoRI fill in/EcoRV restriction fragments into the EcoRV site of the Drosophila expression plasmid, pMtaL (Angelichio et al., 1991), thus creating pMtHC and pMtLC. Both pMtHC and pMtLC were confirmed by restriction analysis and by sequencing across cloning junctions. D. melanogaster S2 cells (Schneider, 1972) were grown in a modified M3 media (Shields and Sang, 1977). Cells were transfected, and stable lines were selected as described previously (Johansen et al., 1989). For line mtHZ19, 19 μg of pMtHC and 19 μg of pMtLC were co-transfected with 1 μg of hygromycin B resistance vector, pCOHygro (van der Straten et al., 1989). For line mtHC, 19 μg of pMtHC was transfected alone with 1 μg of pCOHygro. HC and LC expression under the control of the metallothionein promoter was induced as described previously (Johansen et al., 1989). Binding of RSHZ19 antibody to recombinant F protein expressed in S2 cells 4D. Sindoni and C. Silverman, unpublished data. was performed using a solid phase ELISA. 100 ng (50 μl) of F protein was diluted in PBS, pH 7.0, and adsorbed onto polystyrene round bottom microplates (Dynatech, Immunolon II) for 18 h at 4°C. Wells were then aspirated and blocked with 0.5% boiled casein in PBS containing 1% Tween (PBS, 0.5% boiled casein) for 2 h. Antibodies (50 μl/well) were diluted to varying concentrations in PBS, 0.5% boiled casein containing 0.025% Tween 20 and incubated in antigen-coated wells for 1 h. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG (50 μl) diluted 1:2500 (Amersham Corp.). TMBlue™ substrate (TSI, number TM102) was then added, and plates were incubated an additional 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 N H2SO4, and absorbence was read at 450 nm using a BioTek ELISA reader. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Antibody titers were defined by ED50 values based on regression analysis of the antibody titration curves using RS/1 statistical procedures. Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 cells at the times indicated after induction using the Tri reagent™ RNA isolation reagent (Molecular Research Center). Northern analysis was performed by standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989) using 32P-labeled BamHI probe fragments from pMtHC and pMtLC, respectively. Cell lines were induced for 6 days as described above for cell culture and cell lines. 1 × 107 cells were isolated from each culture, washed once with 1 ml of ice cold PBS, and lysed for 30 min in 500 μl of ice cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Debris was removed from cell lysates by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to each lysate as a 1:1 slurry with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated on an orbital platform for 1.5 h at 4°C. Protein G-Sepharose complexes were isolated by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 2 min, washed twice with 1.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and once with 1.5 ml of ice-cold Tris-saline (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2). hsc72•HC complexes were dissociated in the last wash by addition of ATP to a final concentration of 1 mM. Line mtHZ19 was seeded at 2 × 106 cells/ml at 25°C and grown to a density of 7 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were then washed twice with labeling medium (methionine, cysteine, and yeastolate-free M3 medium) and resuspended to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in prewarmed labeling medium plus 10% heat-inactivated dialyzed FBS and incubated for 90 min at 25°C to deplete methionine and cysteine from the cells. Cells were recovered again by centrifugation and resuspended in prewarmed labeling medium, 10% heat-inactivated dialyzed FBS. To these cells, 0.5 mM CuSO4 was added for induction of RSHZ19 expression and 250 μCi/ml TranS-label (ICN) was added for metabolic labeling. Cells were harvested after 16 h at 25°C. Secreted RSHZ19 mAb expressed in Drosophila cells was purified from the conditioned medium of Drosophila cultures using protein G-Sepharose (fast flow, Pharmacia) according to manufacturer's specifications. Proteins were resolved by reducing 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or nonreducing 0.1% SDS, 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected either directly by Coomassie Blue staining or by Western analysis after electroblotting onto nitrocellulose. Heavy and light chains were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG polyclonal antisera (Amersham Corp.) with the ECL detection system for horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.). Heavy and light chain subunits from purified control RSHZ19 antibody are detected with equal sensitivity using this antisera (data not shown). Detection of hsc72 was performed using a rat mAb raised to flight wing troponin purified from the waterbug, Lethocerus cordofanus as a primary antibody (Bullard et al., 1988). This antibody is reactive only to hsc72 in Drosophila S2 cells. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Amersham Corp.) was used as a secondary antibody followed by detection with ECL. We were interested initially in whether Drosophila cells could stably support the expression and secretion of recombinant antibody. In order to examine this, HC and κ LC cDNAs encoding a humanized IgG1 mAb, specific for the F antigen of respiratory syncytial virus, were inserted into an expression vector designed for stable introduction into Drosophila Schneider cells (S2) (Johansen et al., 1989). In these vectors the HC and LC genes were placed under the control of the Drosophila metallothionein promoter, which is inducible in response to heavy metal addition (Maroni et al., 1986). A stable cell line was selected, mtHZ19, and inducible expression of immunoglobulin mRNAs was examined by Northern analysis (Fig. 1A). Both genes were transcribed into mRNA in response to metal induction. Furthermore, HC and LC polypeptides were produced and secreted at levels that appeared to be equivalent as monitored by Western analysis of conditioned media (Fig. 1B). In order to examine the maturation of the IgG product into complete HC•LC heterodimers, the mAb (RSHZ19) was purified using protein G affinity chromatography from the conditioned media and examined under nonreducing conditions. The results indicate that the antibody had the appropriate molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa (Fig. 1C, lanes1 and 2), indicating that proper maturation and disulfide bond formation had occurred. Under reducing conditions, the Drosophila-produced respiratory syncytial virus mAb resolved into separate HC and LC polypeptides of the expected sizes, 55 and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that Drosophila cells can support the production of properly folded immunoglobulin HC and LC into complete antibody heterodimers. To assess the functionality of mAb produced in Drosophila, the binding of RSHZ19 to respiratory syncytial virus envelope glycoprotein F was compared with that of the same antibody produced in CHO cells. The results (Fig. 2) show that the Drosophila-expressed RSHZ19 antibody retained potent binding to respiratory syncytial virus F antigen, identical to its mammalian counterpart. These results confirm that Drosophila cells support the proper folding of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains into functional antibodies. The level of RSHZ19 mAb secreted from Drosophila cells was estimated by both Western analysis and ELISA to be ≥1.0 μg/ml (Table 1). These levels are comparable with the levels of this same antibody expressed in a rat myeloma cell line (Tempest et al., 1991).Table I Open table in a new tab The folding and secretion of mature antibodies from mammalian cells is known to require the specific interaction of immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP) with heavy chain. This interaction appears to be necessary for proper HC folding and subsequent interaction with LC (Munro and Pelham, 1986; Hendershot, 1990). Since Drosophila cells also contain a BiP homologue (hsc72) and, as shown above, fold and secrete functional antibody, we examined the potential role of hsc72 in antibody production. To examine the interaction between hsc72 and HC in cells producing recombinant IgG, cells expressing antibody were 35S-labeled, and lysates were analyzed using protein G-Sepharose to look for the presence of HC-associated, co-precipitating hsc72. The results (Fig. 3) show that three selective 35S-labeled protein bands were detected by protein G precipitation (Fig. 3A, lane2). The most prominent of these is consistent with the 55-kDa molecular mass of HC itself brought down directly by protein G precipitation. A second more minor band at 29 kDa is consistent with LC and suggests that some of the HC being precipitated with the lysate is already associated with LC. Most importantly, the prominent band at 72 kDa is precisely the size expected for hsc72. None of these proteins were detected in Drosophila cell lysates prepared from cells not expressing antibody (Fig. 3A, lane1). Thus, Drosophila BiP appears to be selectively interacting with the recombinant HC produced in these cell lines. We next examined Drosophila cell lysates prepared in the absence of 35S label for the presence of hsc72 using standard Western analysis. The results (Fig. 3B) show that hsc72 is detected readily in cells either induced (lane1) or uninduced (lane2) for antibody expression. These lysates were then incubated with protein G, and the resulting precipitates were analyzed for the presence of hsc72, HC, and LC. In the absence of IgG expression, no hsc72 was detected in the protein G precipitate (Fig. 3C, lanes1 and 2). In contrast, when cells were induced to express antibody, protein G precipitates clearly contained significant levels of hsc72 (Fig. 3C, lane3), again indicating a selective interaction between hsc72 and HC. Finally, as a direct measure of the specificity of this interaction, we examined the effect of ATP on the release of HC from hsc72. In vertebrate cells BiP is known to undergo ATP hydrolysis during release of bound protein (Munro and Pelham, 1986). If the binding of hsc72 to immunoglobulin HC mimics that of mammalian BiP, then the same ATP-dependent substrate release should be observed. To test this hypothesis, Protein G precipitates were treated with ATP, and the release of hsc72 into the supernatant was monitored. The results indicate that after ATP treatment, approximately 90% of the hsc72 was dissociated from heavy chain (Fig. 3C, lane4; toppanel) and subsequently appeared in the supernatant (Fig. 3B, lane6; toppanel). In the absence of ATP, all of the hsc72 remained associated with HC (Fig. 3C, lane3; toppanel), and none was released into the supernatant (Fig. 3C, lane5; toppanel). As an internal control, we measured HC directly and showed it to be equivalent in both ATP-treated and untreated samples (Fig. 3C, lanes3 and 4; bottompanel). In addition, no HC was found in the supernatant in response to ATP addition (Fig. 3C, lanes5 and 6; bottompanel). These results demonstrate a specific, ATP-dependent hsc72•HC interaction in Drosophila cells that is analogous to the BiP•HC interaction in vertebrates. In vertebrate cells, the interaction of LC with HC appears to be required for antibody secretion. LC interaction is necessary for the efficient dissociation of BiP from HC. Thus, HC dimers alone are not secreted from mammalian cells (Bole et al., 1986) except in rare circumstances where specific mutations in the HC constant region enable it to bypass this process, presumably by allowing BiP•HC dissociation in the absence of LC (Hendershot et al., 1987). To examine and compare the role of hsc72 in immunoglobulin secretion from Drosophila cells, we tested the need for LC synthesis for HC dimer production. We constructed a stable Drosophila cell line, mtHC, containing only the HC gene construct in the absence of the LC gene, and analyzed HC expression from these cells. Surprisingly, and in contrast to what has been found in mammalian systems, the heavy chains were efficiently expressed and secreted from this cell line (Fig. 4, lane2) (Table 1). Furthermore, the apparent molecular weight of the HC produced from this line was found to be identical to that expected for an intact HC dimer, indicating that HC folding and association had occurred in the absence of LC. We next examined whether hsc72 interacts with these HC molecules during synthesis and secretion from this cell line. Lysates from these cells were precipitated with protein G and analyzed by Western blotting. The results show that hsc72 was co-precipitated selectively with HC (Fig. 5, lane3). No hsc72 was precipitated from control lysates that did not contain HC (lanes1 and 2). Clearly, hsc72 specifically interacts with immunoglobulin HC in this cell line, just as was found in the Drosophila cells producing complete antibodies. Apparently, the secretion of HC dimers from this cell line also involves an interaction with hsc72.Figure 5:Association of hsc72 with RSHZ19 immunoglobulin HC, secreted as dimers. Western detection of hsc72 (toppanel) or HC immunoglobulins (bottompanel) from protein G precipitations of mtHC cell lysates is shown.

Again, protein G precipitates were treated with ATP and monitored by Western analysis for release of hsc72 into the supernatant. In the absence of ATP, all of the hsc72 remained associated with HC, and none was released into the supernatant (Fig. 5, lanes3 and 5, respectively). In contrast, in the presence of ATP more than 80% of the hsc72 was released from HC into the supernatant (Fig. 5, lanes4 and 6, respectively). Again as an internal control, the level of HC precipitating in the presence or in the absence of ATP was found to be equivalent (Fig. 5, lanes3 and 4; bottompanel). These results demonstrate that hsc72 specifically interacts with immunoglobulin HC dimers during their maturation and secretion and that this process occurs in the absence of light chain expression. Moreover, the efficiency of the process is equivalent to that observed for complete antibodies (Table 1). We have created a stable Drosophila melanogaster cell line that can be selectively induced to co-express IgG HC and LC and that efficiently secretes fully folded antibody exhibiting normal substrate binding affinity. Although Drosophila cells do not naturally produce antibodies, they apparently do possess conserved ER components that can recognize immunoglobulins, properly fold them, and secrete them as mature antibodies from the cell. We have demonstrated that Drosophila hsc72, the insect counterpart to mammalian immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), is selectively associated with the IgG HC and released from HC in an ATP-dependent fashion. This is analogous to the interaction of BiP with HC characterized in vertebrate cells. Further, we find that Drosophila cells can efficiently secrete HC dimers in the absence of LC production. This dramatically contrasts with vertebrate systems, in which LC synthesis and interaction with HC is known to be required for BiP release and the subsequent secretion of IgG. Although hsc72 specifically interacts with HC in Drosophila, the release is independent of LC association, thereby allowing efficient secretion of these HC dimers. Our results indicate that hsc72 interacts with HC immunoglobulins and plays a role in heterologous IgG production in Drosophila cells but that its release mechanism from HC is independent from LC and therefore mechanistically different from that of its mammalian counterpart. The ability to efficiently express and secrete antibody in Drosophila cells is consistent with the existence of a highly conserved protein folding and secretion mechanism. Insects do not naturally produce antibodies (Marchalonis and Schluter, 1994), although several insect proteins having homology to the Ig superfamily have been identified (Seeger et al., 1988; Bieber et al., 1989; Pulido et al., 1992; Garbe et al., 1993; Kania et al., 1993). Moreover, the expression of recombinant IgA immunoglobulins has been demonstrated in bacculovirus-infected Spodotera cells (Carayannopoulos et al., 1994). However, in these studies the relative contribution of antibody made as a naturally secreted product versus antibody derived from the lytic stage of the bacculovirus infection was not characterized (Carayannopoulos et al., 1994). Furthermore, no attempt was made to identify virus and/or host components that participated in antibody expression and secretion. Our demonstration that the Drosophila hsc72 protein selectively interacts with HC during either IgG or HC dimer production, suggests strong similarities between BiP substrates found in vertebrate and nonvertebrate systems. Although no natural substrates upon which hsc72 interacts have been identified to date, one likely candidate group of proteins is composed of those belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (Williams and Barclay, 1988). Several Drosophila members of this family have been characterized as cell surface proteins related to cell adhesion molecules (Seeger et al., 1988; Bieber et al., 1989; Sun, et al., 1990; Pulido et al., 1992; Garbe et al., 1993; Kania et al., 1993). The mechanism operating in mammalian systems to retain HC dimers in the absence of LC expression may represent a safety function that has evolved to ensure proper immune function. The importance of this mechanism in maintaining homeostasis is best illustrated by its disruption in humans leading to lymphoproliferative diseases (Franklin and Frangione, 1975; Seligmann et al., 1979). In mouse tumor lines, mutant heavy chain molecules containing deletions in the CH1 domain can bypass this mechanism leading to the secretion of HC in the absence of LC (Morrison and Scharff, 1975; Dackowsi and Scharff, 1981). These mutant HCs also fail to associate with BiP, suggesting that this specific interaction is important for HC retention by BiP (Hendershot, et al., 1987). There are at least two possible explanations for the efficient secretion of HC dimers in Drosophila. One possibility is that the inability of Drosophila cells to retain HC dimers may be due to the absence of a specific cellular retention domain in hsc72 that is separate from its substrate-binding domain. This retention domain would be operative in mammalian BiP to retain inappropriately produced heavy chain dimers. Such a hypothesis would be consistent with the fact that specific HC mutations that eliminate BiP interaction in mammalian systems also result in efficient secretion of heavy chain dimers and, subsequently, disease. Thus, the absence of a retention domain in hsc72 would allow for heavy chain dimer secretion. Alternatively, the retention of HC in the absence of LC in vertebrate systems could involve ER components other than BiP that are absent in Drosophila cells. For example, in vertebrates there exist additional protein chaperones localized in the ER lumen that have no known Drosophila counterparts. One of these, GRP94, is a member of the hsp90 protein family and has been shown to associate directly with newly synthesized HC and LC immunoglobulins (Melnick et al., 1992). Like BiP, GRP94 associates more stably with aberrant protein forms that are not secreted than with normal secreted proteins, suggesting that it too could contribute to the retention of immunoglobulins (Melnick, et al., 1992). Thus, the mechanism for the retention of incomplete antibodies in vertebrates could involve other ER chaperones, and the absence of functionally equivalent proteins in Drosophila would lead to the efficient secretion of HC in the absence of LC. The Drosophila antibody expression systems that we have created could be quite useful in determining the importance of various vertebrate chaperones in the retention of incomplete antibodies. Stable introduction of any of these genes into our HC-secreting Drosophila line could be used to determine if their presence will lead to HC retention. Moreover, the ability of Drosophila cells to secrete active antibodies raises the possibility of the transgenic insertion of immunoglobulin genes for the production of monoclonal antibodies in flies. By targeting mAbs against extracellular and cell surface associated proteins, it may therefore be possible to assess biological function by disrupting specific protein interactions. This would be especially useful in the Drosophila system where site directed knock-out experiments are not easily performed without a means of genetically selecting for the loss of the gene being disrupted. We thank Dr. Belinda Bullard for the generous gift of rat mAb for detection of hsc72. We are also grateful to Drs. Karen Palter and David Rubin for many valuable suggestions in the course of this work."

MIDA can, in principle, be applied to very long polymers such as proteins or to simple dimers.

Chandramouli V. Wahren J. Kalhan S.C. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E18-E26PubMed Google Scholar) infused [U-13C3]glycerol to 60-h fasted humans and assayed the MID of plasma glucose. The contribution of GNG to glucose production, calculated from the MID of glucose, was much lower than what could be expected to occur in 60-h starved humans. In these subjects, glycogenolysis could contribute only a minuscule fraction of glucose production. It was hypothesized (14Landau B.R. Fernandez C.A. Previs S.F. Ekberg K. Chandramouli V. Wahren J. Kalhan S.C. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E18-E26PubMed Google Scholar) that this apparent dilution results from variations in the MPE of triose phosphates (TP) across the liver lobule. Such variation could result from a large decrease in the glycerol concentration across the lobule. In the present study, we investigated in perfused rat livers and in live rats and monkeys, the mechanism that results in this unexpected labeling of glucose from [U-13C3]glycerol. We also tested the validity of [U-13C3]lactate as a tracer of GNG. Our data show that physiological zonation of glycerol metabolism in liver results from a major decrease in substrate concentration across the lobule. Zonation of glycerol metabolism results in gradients of enrichment of TP, which explain the observed MID of glucose. In addition, we found evidence for the operation of a substrate cycle between extracellular glycerol and liver TP. Enzymes and coenzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. [U-13C3]Lactate (99%), [U-13C3]pyruvate (99%), [U-13C3]glycerol (99%), [2-13C]glycerol (99%), and [2H8]glycerol (98%) were from Isotec. Livers from 48-h starved Sprague-Dawley rats (150-160 g, Charles River) were perfused (15Des Rosiers C. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1574-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with non-recirculating Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer (20 ml/min) containing glucose (0 or 4 mM), octanoate (0 or 0.2 mM), lactate (1 mM), and glycerol (0.1 mM). After 10 min of equilibration, unlabeled lactate or glycerol was replaced by [U-13C3]lactate, [U-13C3]glycerol, or [2-13C]glycerol. Other perfusions were conducted with 1 mM [U-13C3]pyruvate. At 30 min, the livers were freeze-clamped and stored in liquid N2 until analysis. To measure the kinetics of hepatic glycerol uptake, eight rat livers were perfused each with four sequential 10-min plateaus of increasing [2H5]glycerol concentration, to cover the range 0.1-3.5 mM. The perfusate also contained 1 mM lactate. The concentration and MID of glycerol were measured in effluent perfusate sampled at the end of each plateau. In some experiments, the concentration of pyruvate was assayed at 10 min, before switching to labeled tracers. To measure the loss of 2H from [2H5]glycerol, we perfused six livers with 300 ml of recirculating perfusate containing 1 mM lactate and [2H5]glycerol at initial concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mM. Perfusate was sampled every 30 s for 10 min to measure the concentration and the MID of glycerol. Two-day starved rats (170-180 g), prefitted with permanent catheters in the jugular vein and carotid artery, were infused with lactate (10 μmol × min−× kg−) and glycerol (5 μmol × min−× kg−). In the first series, lactate was [U-13C3]lactate (99%); in the second series, glycerol was [U-13C3]glycerol (99%). Arterial blood samples (0.8 ml) were taken at 3, 4, and 5 h. The animals were then quick-killed and the liver freeze-clamped. Female Maccaca mulatta monkeys were anesthetized with halothane and infused with [U-13C3]lactate (7 and 10 μmol × min−× kg−) or [U-13C3]glycerol (2 μmol × min−× kg−). Arterial blood samples were taken at 3, 4, and 5 h. Samples of liver were then freeze-clamped. Glucose and glycerol were isolated from the effluent perfusate and from neutralized perchloric acid extracts of plasma, using mixed-bed ion exchange resins. Part of the glucose was permethylated (16Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3177) Google Scholar) and assayed by ammonia positive chemical ionization GC-MS to get the MID of the whole molecule(17Previs S.F. Ciraolo S.T. Fernandez C.A. Beylot M. Agarwal K.C. Soloviev M.V. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ions monitored were m/z 268-274. The MID of glycerol was measured by ammonia chemical ionization GC-MS of the triacetyl derivative (m/z 236-241). The MID of lactate was measured by electron ionization GC-MS of the TBDMS derivative (m/z 261-264). The concentration of unlabeled pyruvate in the 10-min effluent perfusate was assayed by isotope dilution GC-MS as a hydroxamate di-TBDMS derivative, using [U-13C3]pyruvate as internal standard. The MID of PEP was assayed 3S. F. Previs, M. Beylot, F. David, and H. Brunengraber, submitted for publication. in neutralized perchloric acid extracts of livers. Briefly, the analysis involves reducing pyruvate in the extract to lactate with NaBH4, enzymatic conversion of PEP to pyruvate, and assay of the latter as hydroxamate di-TBDMS derivative. All GC-MS analyses were run with 3 injections/sample. Areas under all peaks were determined by computer integration and corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes, taking into account (i) the variability of measured natural MID compared to theoretical values (18Fernandez C.A. Ameen L. Brunengraber H. Proceedings of the Symposium on International Federation of Automatic Control, March 1994, Galveston, TX. Omnipress, Madison WI1994: 367-368Google Scholar) and (ii) the skew of natural 13C enrichment in multiply labeled compounds(18Fernandez C.A. Ameen L. Brunengraber H. Proceedings of the Symposium on International Federation of Automatic Control, March 1994, Galveston, TX. Omnipress, Madison WI1994: 367-368Google Scholar). This skew has been originally described by Rosenblatt et al.(19Rosenblatt J. Chinkes D. Wolfe M. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E584-E596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assume the existence of a single hepatic pool of DHAP/GAP labeled from either [U-13C3]glycerol or [U-13C3]lactate. [13C]Glucose made by GNG is diluted by unlabeled glucose derived from either glycogenolysis, or GNG from an unlabeled pool of DHAP/GAP. The steady-state MID of glucose leaving the liver, corrected for natural enrichment(18Fernandez C.A. Ameen L. Brunengraber H. Proceedings of the Symposium on International Federation of Automatic Control, March 1994, Galveston, TX. Omnipress, Madison WI1994: 367-368Google Scholar), can be written in terms of the steady-state MID of the TP pool and the fractional inflow of unlabeled glucose: Mn(GLUC)=f∑i=0nMi(GAP)Mn-i(DHAP)+[1-f]Mn(UNLAB)(Eq. 1) where Mn represents the mol fraction of the nth mass isotopomer of the subscripted compound, and f is the fraction of glucose produced by GNG. For n > 0, Mn(UNLAB) = 0. The parameter n ranges from 0 to 6 since up to six 13C atoms are incorporated in glucose molecules. Note that Mi(GAP) and Mi(DHAP) = 0 for i > 3. Isotopic equilibrium between DHAP and GAP is assumed. We used non-linear parameter estimation techniques (20Lasdon L.S. Waren A.D. GRG & User's Guide. University of Texas, Austin1989Google Scholar) to determine the MID of TP and f values that best fit the measured MID of glucose. Hellerstein et al.(2Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hellerstein M.K. Christiansen M. Kaempfer S. Kletke C. Wu K. Reid J.S. Mulligan K. Hellerstein N.S. Shackleton C.H.L. J.

A similar calculation can be derived from a simplification of. When [U-13C3]glycerol is infused, the MID of glucose includes mostly M0, M3, and M6. Thus, the TP are mostly M0 and M3. The explicit expressions for M3 and M6 of glucose are given by and. M3(GLUC)=f[M0(GAP)M3(DHAP)+M3(GAP)M0(DHAP)](Eq. 2) M6(GLUC)=f[M3(GAP)M3(DHAP)](Eq. 3) Assuming isotopic equilibrium of GAP and DHAP, i.e.Mn(GAP) = Mn(D−HAP = Mn(TP), and become and. M3(GLUC)=2f[M0(TP)M3(TP)](Eq. 4) M6(GLUC)=f[M3(TP)]2(Eq. 5) Using the approximation M0(TP) = (1 - M3(TP)), the ratio of excess mass isotopomer in the product is shown by, M6M3=M3(TP)/[2M0(TP)]=M3(TP)/[2(1-M3(TP))](Eq. 6) or using the notation of Hellerstein and Neese (p = M3(TP); (5Hellerstein M.K. Neese R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E988-E1001PubMed Google Scholar)), by. M6M3=p/[2(1-p)](Eq. 7) The use of [U-13C]glycerol greatly simplifies the technique of Hellerstein et al. because of the low natural abundance at M3 and M6 glucose. All MIDs here are corrected for natural abundance(18Fernandez C.A. Ameen L. Brunengraber H. Proceedings of the Symposium on International Federation of Automatic Control, March 1994, Galveston, TX. Omnipress, Madison WI1994: 367-368Google Scholar). For this case, the construction of a theoretical standard curve (2Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hellerstein M.K. Christiansen M. Kaempfer S. Kletke C. Wu K. Reid J.S. Mulligan K. Hellerstein N.S. Shackleton C.H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1841-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) for the particular glucose derivative used is unnecessary. Therefore, the enrichment of the triose phosphate pool can be calculated directly by solving for p in terms of M6/M3. Using the calculated value of p, the fraction of glucose production derived from GNG, i.e.f, is calculated by solving or for f. f=M3(GLUC)/[2p(1-p)]=M6(GLUC)/p2(Eq. 8) Assuming there are two pools of labeled TP, the relative abundances of M3 and M6 mass isotopomers of glucose assuming isotopic equilibrium between DHAP and GAP are given by and, M(3)GLUC=2f1[M0(TP,1)M3(TP,1)]+2f2[M0(TP,2)M3(TP,2)](Eq. 9) M6(GLUC)=f1[M3(TP,1)]2+f2[M3(TP,2)]2(Eq. 10) where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the fractional glucose contributions from labeled TP pools 1 and 2. Then, has four unknowns, f1 and f2 (the fractional contributions of each pool of TP to GNG) and M3(TP),1 and M3(TP),2 (their enrichments). M6M3=[f1[M3(TP,1)]]2+f2[M3(TP,2)]2]/[2f1M0(TP,1)M3(TP,1)+2f2M0(TP,2)M3(TP,2)](Eq. 11) The TP enrichment calculated using MIDA under the assumption of one labeled pool does not reflect the arithmetic average of the enrichments of the two pools (f1+ f2). With no further information, one cannot determine the enrichments of these two pools and thus the fractional contribution of GNG to glucose. This holds true whenever there are more than two labeled TP pools or, more likely, when a gradient of enrichment exists between the periportal and perivenous regions of the liver lobule. The total amount (μg atom) of 13C in a population of glucose molecules with a given MID is given by. TotalC13=(μmol glucose)∑i=16Mi×i(Eq. 12) The liver lobule is simulated as a plug-flow reactor(21Byron Bird R. Stewart W.E. Lightfoot E.N. Transport Phenomena. John Wiley & Sons, New York1960: 554-591Google Scholar), i.e. a tube of length L, cross-section A, and inside surface/length SL. A substrate, e.g. glycerol, flows through this tube with inlet and outlet concentrations of Cin and Cout, respectively (Cout < Cin), and perfusion rate Q. The steady-state rate of change of glycerol concentration at position z, C(z), along the length of the tube can be obtained from a one-dimensional mass balance that accounts for flow and metabolism. QA∂C∂z=JSLA(Eq. 13) The right side of this equation represents the loss of substrate by metabolism expressed as a Michaelis-Menten reaction rate, as shown by, J=Jmax(z)CKa+C(Eq. 14) where Ka is a constant. Jmax(z), the maximum rate, may vary with position. In the following analysis, let us assume steady-state conditions and that Jmax decreases linearly with length along the lobule, as shown by, dCdz=SLJmax0Q1-αzLCKa+C;C=Cin,z=0(Eq. 15) where Jmax0 is the initial rate. When the constant α is zero, the reaction rate does not change along the lobule. Using the dimensionless terms: ψ = C(z)/Cin, η = z/L, β = Ka/Cin, θ = J0LSL/QCin, we can express the model as shown by. dΨdη=-θ(1-αη)Ψβ+Ψ;Ψ=1,η=0(Eq. 16) Upon solution using separation of variables, we find [Ψ-1]+βlnΨ=-θη-α2η2(Eq. 17) where 0 ≤η≤1 and 0≤ψ≤ 1. If we consider η(ψ), for α > 0, then is quadratic and its solution is given by. η(Ψ)=1α1+1+2αθ(Ψ+βlnΨ-1)(Eq. 18) The solution for α = 0 is given by. η(Ψ)=-Ψ+βlnΨ-1θ(Eq. 19) We can solve for θ using measured outlet concentrations (η = 1) by rearrangement of, as shown by. θ=1+CoutCin-KaCinlnCoutCin1-α/2(Eq. 20) We can calculate the relative flux along the lobule using the dimensionless form of, which is shown in. J(η)Jmax0=Ψθ+Ψ(1-αη)(Eq. 21) Fig. 1A (solidsymbols) shows the kinetics of [2H5]glycerol uptake by perfused livers from 2-day starved rats. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the data, for influent concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 mM (r = 0.99), yields Ka and Vmax of 0.78 mM and 2.1 μmol × min−× (g, wet weight)−, respectively. The Vmax is similar to that reported in (22Lin E.C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 765-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and (23Sestoft L. Fleron P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 375: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Ka, which is in the range of the Ka of glycerol uptake from dog plasma (1.7 mM; (24Winkler B. Steele R. Altszuler N. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 216: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)), is much greater than the Km of glycerol kinase in rat liver (3-10 μM; Refs. 22, 25, and 26). This confirms that glycerol uptake by the liver is diffusion-limited(23Sestoft L. Fleron P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 375: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A also shows (opensymbols) the fractional uptake of glycerol; 85-90% of physiological influent concentrations (0.05-0.2 mM) was taken up in a single passage through the liver. In the same experiments, we found that the MPE of [2H5]glycerol decreased in a single passage through the liver. Fig. 1B (opensymbols) shows the M5 MPE of effluent glycerol. Note that this decrease in MPE occurs mostly in the physiological range of plasma glycerol concentrations. Fig. 1B (closedsymbols) also shows the absolute release of unlabeled glycerol. This release was erratic and independent of inflowing glycerol concentration. At high inflowing [2H5]glycerol concentrations, the release of unlabeled glycerol was not measurable with precision. Similar decreases in total MPE were observed in experiments with [2-13C] and [U-13C3]glycerol (not shown). In addition, for influent concentrations of [2H5]glycerol of 0.4-1.0 mM, effluent glycerol contained a greater MPE of M1 to M4 isotopomers than the influent perfusate. This could not be accounted for by the natural enrichment of released unlabeled glycerol. The production of M1 to M4 isotopomers could not be detected in experiments with influent [2H5]glycerol concentrations lower than 0.4 mM and higher than 1.0 mM because of (i) the near complete exhaustion of the labeled substrate, and (ii) its low isotopic dilution, respectively. The release of M1 to M4 glycerol isotopomers corresponds to 7-10% of the uptake of M5 glycerol. The relative proportions of the M1 to M4 isotopomers were 3 (M1), 5 (M2), 32 (M3), and 100 (M4). To better characterize the loss of 2H from [2H5]glycerol, we perfused livers with a large volume (300 ml) of recirculating perfusate containing 1 mM lactate and various concentrations of [2H5]glycerol. Fig. 2 shows the accumulation of M1 to M4 glycerol isotopomers (M3 > M4 > M2 > M1) when the recirculating perfusate contained initially 0.8 mM [2H5]glycerol. Similar MIDs of perfusate glycerol were obtained when the initial [2H5]glycerol concentration was 0.4 and 0.2 mM (not shown). Total glycerol concentration decreased from 0.6 to 0.4 mM and from 0.2 to 0.05 mM, respectively. Table 1 shows the MID of glucose isolated from non-recirculating effluent liver perfusates, rat plasma, and monkey plasma. Glucose was labeled from [U-13C3]lactate, [U-13C3]pyruvate, [U-13C3]glycerol, or [2-13C]glycerol. In many cases, lactate and glycerol were infused together (with alternate labeling) to simulate the physiological supply of gluconeogenic substrates. All data of Table 1 are corrected for natural 13C enrichment by a technique that takes into account the skew of natural enrichment in multiply 13C-labeled molecules(18Fernandez C.A. Ameen L. Brunengraber H. Proceedings of the Symposium on International Federation of Automatic Control, March 1994, Galveston, TX. Omnipress, Madison WI1994: 367-368Google Scholar).Table I Open table in a new tab In livers perfused with [U-13C3]glycerol (Table 1, rows 2, 4, 8, and 9), the main labeled glucose isotopomers were M3 and M6, with much lower abundances of the other labeled isotopomers. This was expected since glycerol is a very direct precursor of glucose. Only a small fraction of [U-13C3]glycerol was processed in the CAC, with loss of 13C, before generating M1, M2, M4, and M5 glucose. In contrast, with [U-13C3]lactate (rows 1 and 3), the MID of glucose was more evenly distributed since all the label from the substrate passes through oxaloacetate and PEP. This results in losses of label in the CAC and in the PEP → pyruvate → oxaloacetate cycle. In livers perfused with unlabeled lactate and [2-13C]glycerol (rows 10, 11), only M1- and M2-labeled glucose isotopomers were detected, as expected. Since the isolated livers were taken from 2-day starved rats, they were essentially glycogen-depleted(27Minassian C. Ajzannay A. Riou J.-P. Mithieux G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16585-16588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and all glucose production must have been derived from GNG. Parameter f, which quantitates the contribution of GNG to glucose production (and), should have been 100% in all cases (Table 1, rows 1-11). In fact, f ranged from 36 to 92%. When the influent concentration of [U-13C3]glycerol was increased from 0.1 to 0.5 and to 1.5 mM, f increased from 75 to 85 and to 92%, respectively (Table 1, rows 2, 8, and 9). When glucose was labeled from [U-13C3]lactate, f was 54% and 36%, in the absence and presence of 0.2 mM octanoate, respectively (rows 1 and 3). Also, when uniform labeling of lactate and glycerol was alternated, substantially different values of f were calculated (compare f in rows 1 and 2 and in rows 3 and 4). In similar perfusions conducted with 4 mM glucose in addition to 1 mM lactate and 0.1 mM [U-13C3]glycerol, M3 and M6 glucose isotopomers were the only two for which MPE could be precisely measured (rows 9 and 10) corresponding to f of 3% and 1%. This was expected since unlabeled glucose was added to the perfusate to simulate the production of glucose from unlabeled precursors. In 2-day fasted rats infused with lactate and glycerol (Table 1, rows 14 and 15), f was 97% and 75% when lactate or glycerol were uniformly labeled, respectively. When [U-13C3]lactate was infused, no label was detected in plasma glycerol, and the final MID of plasma lactate was 0.41 ± 0.06 (M1), 0.67 ± 0.10 (M2), and 9.69 ± 1.14% (M3, n = 6). When [U-13C3]glycerol was infused, the MPE of plasma glycerol was stable between 3 and 5 h, with final level of 15.3 ± 1.8% (n = 6). In the same rats, lactate became labeled with final MID of 0.82 ± 0.10 (M1), 0.53 ± 0.08 (M2), and 1.82 ± 0.21% (M3). So, of all the above cases where f should have been 100% (rows 1-11, 14, and 15), only in 2-day starved rats infused with [U-13C3]lactate did f approach this value (row 14). In overnight-fasted monkeys (rows 13 and 14), f was also greater when [U-13C3]lactate versus [U-13C3]glycerol was infused (80% and 48%, respectively). So, for in vivo experiments in rats and monkeys, f for [U-13C3]glycerol was 3/4 and 3/5 that for [U-13C3]lactate. In perfused livers, the MID of glucose labeled from [U-13C3]glycerol or [2-13C]glycerol yielded similar values for f (Table 1, rows 2 and 10) when the substrates were used at their maximal MPE. However, when [2-13C]glycerol was used at 30% MPE, which is closer to what would occur in in vivo experiments, values of f were erratic (not shown). This is ascribed to the sensitivity of the M2/M1 ratio when the M2 enrichment is low (a"
https://openalex.org/W2098571898,"The product of the c-myc proto-oncogene (c-Myc) is involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as a transcription factor that recognizes the CACGTG motif. This sequence has also been found in the glucose-responsive elements of genes involved in the control of liver glycolysis and lipogenesis. To determine whether c-Myc can regulate hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in vivo, transgenic mice that overexpress c-myc under control of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene promoter have been generated. These mice showed a threefold increase in c-Myc protein in liver nuclei. Hepatocytes from transgenic mice were normal and did not acquire the fetal phenotype. However, transgenic mice showed higher levels (threefold) of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA and enzyme activity than control mice. The increase in pyruvate kinase activity led to a three- to fivefold increase in liver lactate content and a fivefold induction of lactate production by hepatocytes in primary culture. The expression of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase gene was also increased in the liver of these transgenic mice. The induction of hepatic glycolysis was related with an increase in the expression (about fourfold) and activity (about threefold) of liver glucokinase, whereas no change was noted in hexokinase-I. This change in glucokinase activity led to an increase in both glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen contents in the liver of transgenic mice. The expression of the liver-specific glucose transporter GLUT2 was also increased in transgenic mice, whereas no change was noted in the mRNA concentration of GLUT1. Furthermore, the changes of liver glucose metabolism led to a marked reduction of blood glucose (25%) and insulin (40%) concentrations in starvation, whereas the fall in both was only 10% in fed mice. Thus, liver glucose metabolism could determine the blood glucose and insulin set points in the transgenic mice. All these results indicated that the increase in c-Myc protein was able to induce liver glucose utilization and accumulation, and suggested that c-Myc transcription factor is involved in the control in vivo of liver carbohydrate metabolism."

Rigor tension development at a low MgATP concentration was greatly influenced by phosphocreatine in control but not in transgenic mice as should be expected. In calcium-activated ventricular preparations, although the force developed by each cross-bridge was the same in control and transgenic animals, the rate constant of tension changes appeared to be markedly slowed in transgenic animals. As the ventricular isomyosin pattern was not altered, we suggested that, in transgenic animals, cross-bridge cycling was hindered by a local decrease in the MgATP to MgADP ratio, due to lack of a local MgATP regenerating system. Myokinase activity was not significantly changed while activities of pyruvate kinase or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were found to be increased in transgenic animals. These results show that no fundamental remodelling occurs in myofibrils of transgenic animals but that important adaptations modify the bioenergetic pathways including glycolytic metabolism.

Creatine kinase (CK) 1The abbreviations used are: CKcreatine kinaseM-CKmuscle form of creatine kinaseβ-GPAβ-guanidinopropionic acidPCrphosphocreatine. is an important enzyme catalyzing the reversible transfer of a phosphate moiety between ATP and creatine. A major part of muscle creatine kinase exists as dimers composed of two subunits, M and B, giving three isoenzymes, MM, BB, and MB. In addition, there is a fourth isoenzyme in the mitochondria (mitochondrial CK), which differs biochemically and immunochemically from the cytosolic forms and can present octameric and dimeric structures (Wyss et al., 1992). Studies with subcellular fractionation or histochemical localization have revealed that CK isoenzymes are present in cytosol or bound to intracellular structures. M-CK has been found in myofibrils and described as a structural protein of the M-band participating in the connections between myosin filaments inside muscle fibers (Wallimann et al., 1977). Additional binding sites have been described on actin filament (Wegmann et al., 1992) or on the entire myosin filament (Otsu et al., 1989). M-CK activity in myofibrils is as high as about 2 IU/mg of protein in skeletal and ventricular muscles and represents 5% of total CK activity in fast-twitch muscle compared to 23% in ventricular muscle (Wallimann et al., 1977; Ventura-Clapier et al., 1987b; for review see Ventura-Clapier et al.(1994)). M-CK has been shown to be functionally coupled to myosin ATPase. That means that myosin ATPase preferentially uses ATP supplied by creatine kinase rather than cytosolic ATP (Bessman et al., 1980; Saks et al., 1984). Myofibrillar CK can rephosphorylate all of the ADP produced by myosin ATPase (Saks et al., 1976; Wallimann et al., 1984; Arrio-Dupont et al., 1992) and can provide enough energy for maximal force and normal kinetics even in the absence of MgATP, at the expense of phosphocreatine (PCr) (Ventura-Clapier et al., 1987a; for review see Ventura-Clapier et al.(1994)). creatine kinase muscle form of creatine kinase β-guanidinopropionic acid phosphocreatine. The creatine kinase/phosphocreatine system is considered to fulfill important roles in the energy metabolism of skeletal and cardiac muscles (for reviews see Wallimann et al.(1992), Wyss et al.(1992), and Saks et al.(1994)). In skeletal muscles, activity pattern determines fiber type and metabolic profile. Fast-twitch (white) muscles exhibiting rapid and brief activity patterns are mainly glycolytic and contain high amounts of PCr and CK (Iyengar, 1984; Yamashita and Yoshioka, 1991). By contrast, slow-twitch (red) skeletal muscle or cardiac muscle, exhibits prolonged and sustained activity associated with well developed oxidative metabolism and relatively low contents of PCr and CK. The organization of the CK system appears different in these two kinds of muscles; there is an abundance in cytosol of the muscle form of creatine kinase (M-CK) enzyme in fast-twitch muscle and compartmentation of the mitochondrial and M- isoenzymes in slow-twitch muscle and ventricle. Functional consequences and adaptive strategies observed in animal models of long term deficiency in the CK system may give insights into the physiological role of this system in different muscle types. Long term alterations in the creatine kinase/phosphocreatine system have been developed by feeding animals with slowly metabolized analogues of creatine (β-guanidinopropionic acid, β-GPA). These animals exhibit decreased PCr and ATP concentrations in cardiac and skeletal muscles (Shoubridge and Radda, 1984; Kapelko et al., 1988; Zweier et al., 1991). In addition, a clear cardiac hypertrophy and isoenzyme shift from fast V1 to slow V3 myosin have been observed (Mekhfi et al., 1990). Adaptive strategy in the heart is directed toward an increase in the number of contractile units together with an increased efficiency of each unit to respond to decreased metabolic fluxes. In the same animal model, skeletal muscles exhibited an enhanced oxidative metabolism and an isomyosin shift from fast- to slow-type isomyosins (Shoubridge et al., 1985; Moerland et al., 1989). More recently, a mouse line bearing a null mutation of M-CK has been developed (van Deursen et al., 1993). Genetic M-CK knocking out is a unique model of complete isoenzyme-specific CK deficiency in contrast to GPA feeding, a model of substrate deficiency. Another important difference between these two models is that mutant muscles keep mitochondrial and, in principle, brain isoforms of CK which could participate in energy metabolic pathways. It was shown that M-CK deficiency does not lead to compensatory overexpression of other CK isoenzymes. Muscles from these mice, which do not express the muscle form of CK, are able to use PCr but lack the ability to perform burst activity. In order to get insights into the functional characteristics and possible adaptational processes at the level of myofibrils in these transgenic mice, we characterized intrinsic mechanical properties of ventricular, soleus, and gastrocnemius muscles using the skinned fiber technique which allows us to investigate myofibrillar properties without interference with cytosolic substrate and ion changes. The results show that intrinsic mechanical capacities and calcium sensitivity were maintained in transgenic animals, although skinned fibers were not able to utilize PCr. However, contractile kinetics were markedly slowed down despite an unchanged myosin isoenzyme profile. In addition, the energy supply pattern was changed since glycolytic capacity seemed to increase in fast-twitch muscle as well as in ventricular muscle. Mice bearing a null mutation of the M-CK gene were obtained as described previously (van Deursen et al., 1993). Heterozygous mutants were interbred to generate mice deficient in M-CK. Offsprings were genotyped 2 weeks after birth. Six control adult female mice C57BL/6 and 5 adult transgenic mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone according to the recommendations of the Institutional Animal Care Committee (INSERM, Paris, France) and weighed. While under anesthetics, animals were exsanguinated, and various organs were isolated and weighed. Heart, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles were placed in a modified Krebs solution containing (mM): NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.7; NaHCO3, 25; KH2PO4, 1.2; and MgSO4, 1.2. Organ samples were frozen for further analysis. Other samples were minced with scissors, placed into cold solution (50 mg wet weight per 1 ml) containing (mM): K2HPO4, 100 (pH 8.7); EGTA, 1; N-acetyl cysteine, 15; and homogenized in a Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. Tissue homogenates were incubated for 60 min at 0°C for complete extraction of CK and other enzymes, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was used for determination of CK and myokinase and frozen. Muscle fiber bundles were dissected from soleus or gastrocnemius or from papillary muscles of the left ventricle of mice in a zero-Ca2+ Krebs solution, pH 7.4. Bundles were incubated for 1 h in a relaxing solution (pCa 9, see solutions below) containing 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize the membranes and were then transferred to the relaxing solution without detergent and kept at 4°C until use. After the skinning procedure, one bundle was snared at both ends with hair emerging from stainless steel tubes in the experimental apparatus. It was adjusted to slack length, stretched by 20%, and subjected to an activation/relaxation cycle. Sarcomere length was controlled by laser diffraction (10-milliwatt He-Ne laser, Spectra-Physics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The length and diameter of the muscles were measured by use of a graticule in the dissecting microscope. Muscles were immersed in 2.5-ml chambers arranged around a disk in a temperature-controlled bath positioned on a magnetic stirrer. Each solution was well stirred at high speed. All experiments were performed at 22°C. The tubes were connected to a transducer (model AE 801, SensoNor Microelectroniks, Horten, Norway) and a vibrator as described previously (Mayoux et al., 1994). The bandwidth of the transducer and tube was 2 kHz. The permanent magnet and coil came from a standard loudspeaker (Pioneer TS-130A, Pioneer Electric and Research Corp., Forest Park, IL). The coil was glued to a glass tube axis (2 mm in diameter) driven in an axial ball bearing (total moving mass < 1.5 g). A flag with a narrow window was glued on the glass axis between a lamp and a position detector (type S1543, Hamamatsu, Japan), allowing measurements of the displacement length. A feedback with the length signal combined with a power amplifier allowed control of muscle length. The system had a rise time of about 1 ms without overshoot. Length and tension changes were monitored on a digital storage oscilloscope (OS4020, Gould, Inc., Cleveland, OH). Tension tracings were digitized at 20 kHz (12-bit analog/digital converter), analyzed on-line using a PC compatible computer, and stored on a videotape. Solutions were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato(1988). All solutions were calculated to contain (mM): EGTA, 10; imidazole, 30; Na+, 30.6; Mg2+, 3.16; and dithiothreitol, 0.3; ionic strength was adjusted to 0.16 M with potassium acetate. pH was adjusted to pH 7.1 with acetic acid. In relaxing and rigor solutions, pCa was 9. In activating solution, pCa was 4.5. Relaxing and activating solutions also contained 3.16 mM MgATP and 12 mM PCr. Rigor solutions were obtained by mixing two solutions of pMgATP 2.5 and 6 or pMgATP 4 and 6. EGTA was obtained from Sigma. PCr (Neoton, Schiapparelli Farmaceutica SEARLE, Turin, Italy) was a kind gift of Prof. E. Strumia. pCa/tension relations were determined under isometric conditions by briefly placing each fiber into solutions of increasing calcium concentration until maximal tension was reached. Data were fitted using linearization of the Hill equation for relative tensions above 10% and under 90% as follows: T = [Ca2+]n/(K + [Ca2+]n) were T is relative tension, K a constant, and n the Hill coefficient. n and pCa for half-maximal activation (pCa50 = -log10K/n) were calculated for each fiber by means of linear regression analysis. Resting tension was measured at pCa 9. Active tension (expressed as mN/mm2) was the total tension at pCa 4.5 minus resting tension. pMgATP/rigor tension relations were established by stepwise decreasing ATP concentrations until maximal rigor tension was obtained. The fiber was then placed in the relaxing solution for 10 to 15 min before a new set of rigor solutions was applied. Data were fitted using the Hill equation. The pMgATP for half-maximal rigor tension, pMgATP50 = (-log10K)/n, was calculated for each experimental condition using linear regression analysis. To determine fiber bundle stiffness and the rate constant of tension recovery in cardiac preparations, quick length changes (0.3-3% of initial muscle length) were applied in the relaxing and activating solutions. Twelve successive stretches and releases were made, starting with the relaxing solution. Only responses to stretches were used for calculations. Each value for each fiber was the mean of five to seven stretches of varying amplitudes performed in a given experimental condition. The spike of tension in phase with the length change characterized the elastic phase (Huxley and Simmons, 1971). Stiffness was the extreme tension reached during stretching (mN/mm2) divided by the length change (μm). A first series of length changes was imposed in the relaxing solution to assess passive properties of each fiber. Resting stiffness was calculated by linear regression analysis on the responses to stretches. Then a second series of length changes was initiated in control activating solution. The tension level before the first stretch was taken as the maximal tension and used for normalizations. Active or rigor stiffness were calculated as the difference between total stiffness minus resting stiffness. The rate constant of tension recovery after quick stretches was calculated by a least square regression analysis, according to a single exponential model, between 50% and 80% of recovery and using stretches of more than 1%. Enzyme activities were determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (Gilford Spectrophotometer, Corning, NY), 30°C, by using coupled enzyme systems. Results are given in IU/g wet weight. Myokinase activity was determined at pH 7.1 using the coupled enzyme assay of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase producing NADPH. Activity was assayed in a medium containing (in mM): HEPES, 20; MgCl2, 5; dithiothreitol, 0.5; ADP, 1.2; glucose, 20; NADP, 0.6; and 2 IU/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and hexokinase. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was determined at pH 7.6, in a medium containing (in mM): triethanolamine, 82.5; 3-phosphoglycerate, 6; ATP, 1.1; EDTA, 0.9; MgSO4, 1.7; NADH, 0.2; and 15 IU/ml 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Pyruvate kinase activity was measured at pH 7.6 in a medium containing (in mM): triethanolamine, 82.5; phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.54; MgSO4, 2.5; KCl, 10; ADP, 4.7; NADH, 0.2; and 9.2 IU/ml lactate dehydrogenase. Fructose-6-phosphokinase was determined at pH 8.5 in a medium containing (in mM): Tris-HCl, 70; MgSO4, 1.4; KCl, 4.5; phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.71; fructose 1,6-diphosphate, 0.64; fructose 6-phosphate, 1.8; ATP, 1.1; NADH, 0.2; and 9.6 IU/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 4.2 IU/ml pyruvate kinase. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined at pH 7.4 using a medium containing (in mM): KH2PO4, 20; KCl, 120; dithiothreitol, 0.5; pyruvate, 10; NADH, 0.2. Frozen muscles were thawed on ice, cut into small pieces, and washed with 5 volumes of 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM sodium phosphate, and 1 mM EGTA (pH 6.5). Myosin was then extracted with 3 volumes of 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (pH 8.5); after 30 min of gentle shaking, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The supernatant containing myosin was diluted with 1 volume of glycerol and stored at −20°C (d'Albis et al., 1979). Gel running buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.5), 10% glycerol, 0.01% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM MgCl2. Cylindrical (6 × 0.5 cm) gels contained 4% polyacrylamide (3.88% acrylamide and 0.12% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide). Between 1 and 5 μg of myosin was loaded on each gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 90 V, for 22 h, between 0 and 2°C (d'Albis and Gratzer, 1973; Hoh, 1975). Electrophoresis was performed as described by Talmadge and Roy(1993). Minigels were used in the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II Dual Slab Cell. Electrophoresis took place in a cold cupboard, at 10°C for 28 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and the relative amounts of the different myosin heavy chains were measured using a densitometer equipped with an integrator. Values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare the means between control and transgenic animals or inside groups between two experimental conditions. Statistical significance was reached when p < 0.05. Comparing control and transgenic mice, no statistical difference was observed between heart, lung, liver, kidney, and body weights (Table 1). The heart weight to body weight ratio was in consequence not altered in transgenic animals. Thus, no sign of organ dysfunction or change in muscle mass or cardiac insufficiency could be detected.Table I Open table in a new tab Fibers of similar diameter were dissected from control and transgenic mice. Diameters were, respectively, for control and transgenic: 207 ± 23 and 179 ± 16 μm for ventricle, 160 ± 15 and 138 ± 20 μm for soleus, 155 ± 26 and 170 ± 26 μm for gastrocnemius. No statistical difference was observed, which allowed accurate comparison of mechanical performances. Table 2 shows mechanical parameters of skinned fibers, normalized per cross-sectional area, in resting (pCa 9) and activating (pCa 4.5) conditions. Whatever the muscle, resting tensions were not modified in transgenic animals. Although clear differences existed between active forces developed by the different muscles, no differences were observed between control and transgenic animals.Table II Open table in a new tab Each fiber bundle was submitted to a set of solutions of increasing calcium concentrations (see “Materials and Methods”), and pCa/tension relations were calculated according to the Hill equation. Mean pCa for half-maximal activation (pCa50) and n values are reported in Table 2. No significant change in calcium sensitivity could be detected except a small increase in Hill coefficient in gastrocnemius muscle. It is known, however, that inactivation of myofibrillar CK, either by inhibition or in the absence of PCr, leads to a change in the calcium/tension relationship. This was confirmed in cardiac fibers of control mice (Fig. 1) where omission of PCr in activating solution led to an increase in calcium sensitivity from 5.68 ± 0.03 to 5.98 ± 0.03 (n = 4, p < 0.001). The next series of experiments was undertaken to study the influence of PCr on the relaxation of rigor tension in control and transgenic muscles. Rigor tension is the tension induced in the virtual absence of calcium by decreasing MgATP concentration. We have shown in ventricular muscle that the development of rigor tension is greatly influenced by CK bound in myofibrils. The concentration of MgATP necessary to obtain half-maximal rigor is greatly reduced when PCr is provided as a substrate. In order to characterize more precisely this effect in control and transgenic mice, complete pMgATP/rigor tension relations have been established in presence or absence of PCr in sets of solutions of decreasing MgATP concentrations. In Fig. 2, pMgATP/rigor tension relations have been drawn using Hill equation and pMgATP50 (pMgATP for half-maximal rigor force) values given in Table 2 for ventricle, soleus, or gastrocnemius. When PCr was added, a clear shift of the relation was observed in control muscles. While pMgATP/tension relations without PCr were identical in control and transgenic animals, no shift could be evidenced in the presence of PCr for the three muscle types of transgenic animals. pMgATP50 values in the presence of PCr, as well as CK efficacy, which is defined as the difference between pMgATP50 values in the presence and absence of PCr, were both highly significantly different between control and transgenic mice (Table 2). This result is in complete agreement with the absence of M-CK in these animals and clearly shows that myofibrils from transgenic mice have no enzyme able to utilize PCr. Active stiffness as measured by the tension responses to a quick length change was not significantly different in ventricular fiber bundles of control and transgenic mice (450 ± 57 mN/μm/mm2 (n = 8) versus 644 ± 69 mN/μm/mm2 (n = 6) respectively). It should be noted, however, that a small tendency toward an increase in both tension and stiffness could be observed, although not reaching significance, possibly as a result of poor estimation of the fibers' effective cross-section. However, the ratio of force to stiffness was not altered (Fig. 3) in transgenic mice showing that force developed by each cross-bridge was preserved. When a length perturbation was applied to activated muscle, force first increased in phase with the increase in length and then decreased toward the value of the tension before the length change. The rate constant of tension recovery reflects the cross-bridge cycling rate, while the extent of recovery characterizes the cross-bridge state. The rate constant of tension recovery following stretches was greatly decreased in transgenic mice compared to control while the extent of recovery was not different (Fig. 3). This result suggests a decrease in the cross-bridge cycling rate in transgenic ventricular fibers. Indeed, inhibition of myofibrillar CK slows down tension kinetics in skinned rat cardiac muscle, probably due to local accumulation of protons and MgADP (Ventura-Clapier et al., 1987b). This was also observed in mouse heart where withdrawal of PCr decreased the rate constant from 103 ± 17 s−1 to 38 ± 4 s−1 (n = 4, p < 0.05). A decrease in cross-bridge cycling rate may arise from an altered pattern in myosin isoenzyme distribution. In order to see if transgenic animals exhibit a change in myosin isoforms, the myosin phenotype was determined in the different muscles. Two types of gel electrophoresis were used to analyze the content in myosin isoforms of the cardiac and skeletal muscles, respectively. The cardiac ventricular myosins are best separated by gel electrophoresis under nondissociating conditions (Lompréet al., 1981), as shown here in a control rat heart, which displayed the three isoforms V1, V2, and V3 (Fig. 4a). Both control and transgenic mouse ventricles displayed only the V1 isoform. To analyze the myosin isoform content in the skeletal muscles, gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS allowed the separation of the slow type isoform 1 and the three fast type isoforms 2 (Fig. 4b). The only transgenic mouse soleus muscle contained the 2A and the 1 isoforms in the same proportions, 35% and 65%, respectively, as the control muscle. The gastrocnemius muscles mainly contained the 2B isoform, 94 ± 2% (n = 4) in the control mice and 89 ± 2% (n = 4) in the transgenic mice; the difference was not significant. The remaining myosin was distributed between a trace of the slow-type 1 isoform and the two other fast-type 2A and 2X isoforms. Since no change in isomyosin pattern could be detected in muscles of transgenic mice, the question arose as to how MgATP and MgADP concentrations could be controlled in transgenic animals. Indeed, it has been shown that myofibrillar CK, by keeping high ATP/ADP ratio and low proton concentrations close to myosin ATPase, ensures optimal efficiency of myosin ATPase in skeletal (Bessman et al., 1980) as well as cardiac muscle (Ventura-Clapier et al., 1987a, 1987b). Other MgATP regenerating enzymes may exist in cytosol or may be loosely bound to myofibrils. To check for possible overexpression of such enzymes, glycolytic enzymes as well as myokinase activities were measured in the different muscles. Results are shown in Table 3. Myokinase activity was not significantly increased in transgenic animals while some glycolytic enzymes like pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase increased in ventricles and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase increased in gastrocnemius. No significant changes were seen for soleus muscle.Table III Open table in a new tab In this study, attempts were made to characterize the intrinsic properties of cardiac and skeletal myofibrils of mice bearing a null mutation for the M-form of CK. Skinned fiber technique was used to destroy cellular membranes, while keeping the cellular architecture intact, so that intrinsic mechanical properties of the myofibrillar network, in a definite medium surrounding myofibrils, could be investigated. The results showed that maximal force and stiffness characteristics were not altered while kinetics of force changes assessed in ventricular tissue were markedly reduced despite an unchanged isomyosin profile. Sensitivity to added ATP was not altered, while addition of PCr was without effect in mutants, suggesting no unknown route for PCr utilization inside myofibrils. Increased glycolytic activity could be one possible adaptational way to control the ATP/ADP ratio inside myofibrils devoid of bound CK during contraction. Muscle contraction is the result of cyclic association between the thin and thick filaments resulting in the relative sliding of these filaments past each other when muscle is allowed to shorten, or resulting in force development in isometric conditions. This mechanical interaction or cross-bridge cycling is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP by myosin ATPase located on the thick filament and regulated by the binding of calcium to the troponin complex of the thin filament. The products of ATP hydrolysis are released when myosin is attached to actin during the power stroke portion of the cycle, and an increase in hydrolytic products such as ADP, inorganic phosphate, and H+ is expected to influence the different steps and thereby the power stroke. Earlier studies have shown that MgADP increases isometric tension and calcium sensitivity and decreases maximal velocity of shortening or kinetics of force development (Brandt et al., 1982; Cooke and Pate, 1985; Ventura-Clapier et al., 1987a; Hoar et al., 1987). ADP detachment is considered to be the rate-limiting step in crossbridge detachment and for the overall cross-bridge cycle (Siemankowski et al., 1985). ADP accumulation may inhibit the interaction between actin and myosin by competing with MgATP at the active site of the myosin molecule, thus slowing down MgADP detachment and further MgATP binding and cross-bridge detachment (for review see Ventura-Clapier et al.(1994)). The rate constant of tension recovery following stretches is an estimate of the kinetics of cross-bridge cycling and reflects the rate-limiting step in the cycle; it was shown to vary with myosin isoform composition as well as following alterations in concentrations of substrates or products of myosin ATPase (Ventura-Clapier et al., 1987a; Mekhfi and Ventura-Clapier, 1988; Mayoux et al., 1994). We have observed a 3-fold decrease in cross-bridge cycling rate in cardiac myofibrils of transgenic animals compared to control without any shift in myosin isoforms. A similar change was observed in control mice when PCr was omitted in the solution. Thus, this decreased rate of force changes can be attributed to changes in ATP/ADP ratio in the vicinity of myosin ATPase with a consequent product inhibition of ATPase activity. Accumulation of MgADP as a result of a lack of myofibrillar CK will induce an increase in force production and a decrease in rate of cross-bridge cycling, leading to a lower energy consumption and better economy of force production. As a consequence, the rates of force production and relaxation of the muscle twitch would be decreased. However, for cardiac muscle having cyclic activity, this would tend to increase the end-diastolic pressure and to decrease the ventricular filling, except if the intrinsic heart rate is decreased. Unfortunately, no information are as yet available concerning heart rate, developed pressure, or the force-length relationship of cardiac muscle in transgenic animals. Although the cross-bridge cycling rate of skeletal muscle could not be determined in this study, it is highly probable that tension kinetics would be slowed also. Further studies are needed to clarify the contraction kinetics of the intact muscles in these animals. In Triton X-100-treated fibers, loosely bound enzymes are usually detached from the myofibrillar structures. In intact cells, many enzymes including glycolytic enzymes, AMP deaminases, and myokinase are bound to myofibrillar proteins, mainly to the thin filament, and may participate in MgADP/MgATP regulation in myofibrils (Maughan and Godt, 1989). Indeed, we observed in total tissue extracts of both cardiac and skeletal muscles of transgenic mice, an increase in glycolytic enzyme activities, with no increase in total myokinase activity. It is thus possible that a fraction of these enzymes is bound to myofibrils in vivo and ensures local rephosphorylation of MgADP. When PCr was omitted, it was clear that calcium sensitivity of control cardiac fibers was increased. Such a result was already obtained in rat heart (Ventura-Clapier et al., 1987a) and is due to cross-bridge slowing and cooperative interaction between attached cross-bridges. Surprisingly, such an increased calcium sensitivity was not observed in soleus, gastrocnemius, or ventricular muscles of transgenic mice, and a similar force/calcium relationship was observed in control and transgenic muscles, suggesting that another mechanism compensated for the increased calcium sensitivity following changes in the local ATP/ADP ratio. Calcium sensitivity is determined by the binding of calcium to troponin C as well as by interactions between the other constituents of the thin filament. Calcium sensitivity of cardiac or skeletal muscle is developmentally regulated, and the role of troponin T isoforms is often put forward to explain changes in calcium sensitivity in spite of unchanged troponin C expression (Solaro et al., 1988; Nassar et al., 1991; Pan and Potter, 1992). One may suggest that a phenotypic change in the proteins constitutive of the thin filament will participate in maintaining constant calcium sensitivity in these transgenic muscles. Alternatively, at least in cardiac muscle, cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of the inhibitory unit of troponin (troponin I) decreases the sensitivity of myofibrils for calcium by diminishing the Ca2+-affinity of troponin C (Ray and England, 1976). Phosphorylation of troponin I has been shown to be very stable (Garvey et al., 1988). It may thus be possible that myofibrils of transgenic mice exhibit an enhanced phosphorylation level of contractile proteins which would decrease calcium sensitivity and compensate for the change induced by the altered ATP/ADP ratio inside myofibrils. Unfortunately, experimental data in support of such a hypothesis are lacking. The skeletal muscle function of mice deficient in muscle CK has been investigated previously (van Deursen et al., 1993). Mice lacking M-CK have lost the ability to sustain maximal force output during short periods of high work, while apparently being adapted for endurance exercise. However, cardiac function of mutant mice has not been investigated at present. To elucidate the role of the CK system in energy metabolism, other strategies designed to reduce the activity of the CK system were used, such as feeding animals with creatine analogs. This affects the creatine kinase/phosphocreatine system at the substrate site. Alternatively, acute iodoacetamide poisoning of CK has also been used (Fossel and Hoefeler, 1987; Kupriyanov et al., 1991). In these models, where the function of isolated heart was impaired, a decreased developed pressure and rate pressure product were described (Mekhfi et al., 1990; Zweier et al., 1991). Furthermore, impairment of diastolic function and a steeper rise in stiffness at increased afterloads in association with increased energy breakdown were observed (Kapelko et al., 1988; Kupriyanov et al., 1991). Even more interesting was the observation, in these models, of phenotypic conversion of fast-twitch to slow-twitch fibers in skeletal muscle together with isomyosin transitions (Moerland et al., 1989) and cardiac enlargement and increased economy of contraction by a shift from the fast isoform of myosin to the slow isoform in heart (Mekhfi et al., 1990). It could be concluded that CK/PCr system alterations induce contractile abnormalities and that alterations in metabolic state per se, may lead to changes in the expression of contractile proteins. No obvious change in size and distribution of the three fiber type populations was observed in M-CK-deficient mice (van Deursen et al., 1993). However, M-CK-deficient type 2A and 2B fibers exhibited a clear metabolic phenotype change by elaborating an intermyofibrillar mitochondrial network, with a high number of relatively large mitochondria, the potential for aerobic energy generation being increased approximately twice (Veksler et al, 1995) explaining improved endurance performance during low intensity exercise (van Deursen et al., 1993). In addition, we showed in the companion paper that mitochondria in ventricular and soleus muscles from transgenic mice have an increased sensitivity to ADP (Veksler et al., 1995). Increase in mitochondrial content in “glycolytic” muscles and increased sensitivity to ADP in “oxidative” muscles appear to represent adaptations toward increased energy turnover via the adenylate pathway. Absence of marked isomyosin shift, either in skeletal or cardiac muscle in M-CK knocked out mice is in contrast with what was observed in rat cardiac or mice skeletal muscles following β-GPA feeding (Shoubridge et al., 1985; Moerland et al., 1989; Mekhfi et al., 1990). In these situations, a better economy of contractile force development was achieved by a switch from fast to slower myosin isoforms. The reason for such a difference is not straightforward. Despite the absence of an isomyosin shift in mouse heart following β-GPA feeding, these hearts can potentially switch totally from fast to slow myosin as has been shown under the influence of hypothyroidic treatment (Ng et al., 1991). The main difference between the two models is that ATP as well as PCr contents are preserved in the case of the M-CK mutation in comparison with β-GPA feeding where both compounds appear to be decreased. A consequence of this would be that the expression of proteins of the contractile apparatus is more under the control of the concentrations of metabolites. On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that targeted mutations affect the animals in the early embryonic life where the potentialities for adaptations are much larger than in the adult animals and may have involved more integrated adaptation mechanisms. NMR experiments showed that fluxes through CK were not detectable in skeletal muscle of CK-deficient mice until a threshold of activity was reached (van Deursen et al., 1993, 1994). This suggested that bound CK fluxes are NMR invisible and only when CK activity reaches a certain level which allows saturation of binding sites, and when cytosolic CK appears, CK fluxes become detectable. However, contracting muscles were still able to hydrolyze PCr which suggested that M-CK was not the only enzyme catalyzing the transfer of PCr to ATP. In myofibrils, PCr is actively used up by bound CK; this has been shown in cardiac skinned fibers by the shift of the dependence of rigor tension development toward lower ATP concentrations induced by PCr (Ventura-Clapier and Veksler, 1994, for review see Ventura-Clapier et al.(1994)). Although we showed that such a shift was also present in fast-twitch and slow-twitch control skeletal muscle fibers, it was absent in skeletal as well as ventricular fibers of M-CK-deficient mice. No unknown enzyme or other isoform of CK, retained after skinning, was thus present and able to use PCr and regenerate ATP inside the myofibrillar compartment. In M-CK-deficient mice, due to the absence of local rephosphorylation, ADP should accumulate in myofibrils and diffuse in the cytosol toward mitochondria to be rephosphorylated either by mitochondrial CK which could work in both directions, explaining utilization of PCr during activity, or directly through translocase and oxidative phosphorylations. This direct route for ADP is favored by a decreased Km of mitochondrial respiration for ADP, an increased mitochondrial network, and mitochondrial activity and increased glycolytic capacities (van Deursen et al., 1993; Veksler et al., 1995). Thus, alterations in one side of the CK system, i.e. utilization site, induces adaptations in the opposite site, i.e. synthesis site, showing the important role of CK in coupling utilization and consumption of energy inside muscle cells (for review see Saks et al.(1994)). Of primary importance to clearly understand the exact extent and limit of adaptational processes in M-CK-deficent muscles is to know the kinetics of force development and, for the heart, to which extent it will sustain normal activity and respond to adrenergic stimulation or increase in workload. A need for more classical but necessary physiological data is evident in order to infer the exact extent and limit of adaptational processes as well as the real role of the specific isoenzymes of CK in muscle cells. The possibility of completely and selectively abolishing a given function using transgenic technology is a fantastic tool for studying the exact role of one given protein within a pathway or a function, or for life. It has been disappointing, however, since functions considered as essential for life could be suppressed without lethal or morbid consequences. However, considering the dynamic of life, more may be learned from the adaptive strategies developed during this period of high potentiality which is embryonic life, in response to such specific alterations. It should be borne in mind that these strategies may involve “exotic” pathways and that thorough examination of biochemical and physiological characteristics of these animals would be of potentially high significance in the understanding of the role of a given pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2037902728,"Members of the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) family are involved in several cellular processes such as secretion, motility, mitosis, and transformation. In addition to their ability to bind calmodulin and to cross-link actin filaments, reversible binding to the plasma membrane is most certainly an important component of the so far unknown functions of these proteins. We have therefore investigated the binding of murine MARCKS-related protein (MRP) to lipid vesicles. The partition coefficient, Kp, describing the affinity of myristoylated MRP for acidic lipid vesicles (20% phosphatidylserine, 80% phosphatidylcholine) is 5-8 × 103M−1, which is only 2-4 times larger than the partition coefficient for the unmyristoylated protein. Interestingly, the affinity of MRP for acidic lipid membranes is 20-30-fold smaller than reported for murine MARCKS (Kim, J., Shishido, T., Jiang, X., Aderem, A. A., and McLaughlin, S.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28214-28219). Since only a marginal binding could be observed with neutral phosphatidylcholine vesicles, we propose that electrostatic interactions are the major determinant of the binding of MRP to pure lipid membranes. Although the myristoyl moiety does not contribute drastically to the binding of MRP to vesicles, photolabeling experiments with a photoreactive phospholipid probe show that the fatty acid is embedded in the bilayer. The same membrane topology was found for bovine brain MARCKS. Since the relatively low affinity of MRP for vesicles is insufficient to account for a stable anchoring of the protein to cellular membranes, insertion of the myristoyl moiety into the bilayer might favor the interaction of MRP with additional factors required for the binding of the protein to intracellular membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2065209133,"We examined the effects of the bronchoconstrictor agonists serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and histamine on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation in cultured bovine tracheal myocytes. Kinase renaturation assays demonstrated activation of the 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinases within 2 min of 5-HT exposure. MAP kinase activation was mimicked by α-methyl-5-HT and reduced by pretreatment with either phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate or forskolin, suggesting activation of the 5-HT2 receptor, protein kinase C, and Raf-1, respectively. Raf-1 activation was confirmed by measurement of Raf-1 activity, and the requirement of Raf-1 for 5-HT-induced MAP kinase activation was demonstrated by transient transfection of cells with a dominant-negative allele of Raf-1. Histamine pretreatment significantly inhibited 5-HT and insulin-derived growth factor-1-induced MAP kinase activation. Attenuation of MAP kinase activation was reversed by cimetidine, mimicked by forskolin, and accompanied by cAMP accumulation and inhibition of Raf-1, suggesting activation of the H2 receptor and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. However, histamine treatment inhibited Raf-1 but not MAP kinase activation following treatment with either platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor, implying a Raf-1-independent MAP kinase activation pathway. In summary, our data suggest a model whereby 5-HT activates MAP kinase via a protein kinase C/Raf-1 pathway, and histamine attenuates MAP kinase activation by serotonin via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and inhibition of Raf-1.

INTRODUCTIONAbnormal growth of airway smooth muscle may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of two important human airways diseases, asthma (1James A.L. Pare P.D. Hogg J.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 139: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia(2Margraf L.R. Tomashefski J.F. Bruce M.C. Dahms B.B. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 143: 391-400Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the signaling pathways responsible for such proliferation. We have examined the role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPmitogen-activated proteinPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorEGFepidermal growth factor5-HT5-hydroxytryptaminePDBuphorbol 12,13-dibutyrateIGF-1insulin-like growth factor-1DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumMBPmyelin basic proteinMEKMAP kinase/ERK-activating kinasePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. kinase, a family of 40-46-kDa cytosolic serine/threonine kinases, which participate in the transduction of mitogenic and differentiation-promoting signals to the cell nucleus, in cultured bovine tracheal myocytes(3Abe M.

A variety of substances activate MAP kinase in these cells, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that MAP kinase occupies a central position in a complex signaling system regulating airway smooth muscle cell proliferation.In the human airway diseases asthma and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, excess airway smooth muscle mass coexists with airway constrictor hyperresponsiveness(1James A.L.

Keens T.G. Pediatrics. 1984; 73: 509-514PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, abnormal airway smooth muscle DNA synthesis and airway hyperreactivity have been correlated in two animal models of airway disease: hyperoxia-exposed, immature Sprague-Dawley rats (7Hershenson M.B. Kelleher M.D. Naureckas E.T. Abe M.K. Rubinstein V.J. Zimmermann A. Bendele A.M. McNulty J.A. Panettieri R.A. Solway J. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol.

Care Med. 1994; 149 (abstr.): A303Google Scholar). The association of airway smooth muscle proliferation and bronchoconstriction suggests that bronchoconstrictor agonists may regulate not only airway smooth muscle tone but cell proliferation. Thus, signaling events subsequent to airway cell stimulation with bronchoconstrictor agonists are of particular interest.The biogenic amines serotonin (5-HT) and histamine are potent bronchoconstrictors (9Buckner C.K.

Stimulation of the 5-HT2 receptor activates a G protein that is positively coupled to phospholipase C, whereas stimulation of the 5-HT1B receptor activates a Gi protein negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase (13Meloche S.

Thus, the net effect of histamine treatment on MAP kinase activation in cultured airway smooth muscle cells may depend on the relative stimulation of the two pathways.In the current study, we tested the effects of the 5-HT and histamine on MAP kinase activation. Our data suggest a model whereby 5-HT activates MAP kinase via a protein kinase C/Raf-1 pathway, and histamine inhibits MAP kinase activation via stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and inhibition of Raf-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAnti-human α-smooth muscle actin, 5-HT, histamine, myelin basic protein, goat anti-rabbit IgG, isobutyl methylxanthine, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), pertussis toxin, and forskolin were purchased from Sigma. α-Methyl-5-HT and cimetidine were obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc. PDGF and EGF were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. IGF-1 was from Becton-Dickinson. Biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG and ABC reagent (avidin plus biotinylated horseradish peroxidase) were purchased from Vectastain Laboratories. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from DuPont NEN. For Western analyses of MAP kinase activation, a rabbit antiserum (antibody 283) raised against a peptide fragment of ERK1 (amino acid residues 283-306) was used as the primary antibody(31Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); MAP kinase bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Corp. For in vitro phosphorylation assays, antibodies against Raf-1 and the hemagglutinin epitope tag were purchased from Santa Cruz and Babco, respectively. A plasmid coding for an inactive MAP kinase/ERK-activating kinase (MEK-1) was obtained from Dr. Gary Johnson(24Russell M. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2343-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the p301-1 dominant-negative Raf-1 was supplied by Dr. David Foster(32Chao T-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A hemagglutinin-tagged p42 MAP kinase expression vector was constructed by ligating a DNA fragment encoding the influenza hemagglutinin epitope to the 5′ end of murine p42 MAP kinase cDNA. The resulting cDNA was ligated into the expression vector pcDNAI Neo (Invitrogen). Lipofectamine was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.Cell CultureBovine trachea smooth muscle cells were cultured as described previously(3Abe M. Chao T-S.O. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Kelleher M.D. Abe M.K. Chao T-S.O. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Physiol. (Lung Cell. Mol.

Confluent flasks exhibited the typical “hill and valley” appearance under phase contrast microscopy and exhibit specific immunostaining with an antibody against α-smooth muscle actin.Preparation of Cell Extracts for Analysis of MAP Kinase ActivationBovine tracheal smooth muscle cell cultures in 100-mm plates were serum-starved by incubation in DMEM for 24 h. After incubation with the relevant stimulus, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.3-0.5 ml of a homogenization solution consisting of 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mM sodium vanadate. Cells were scraped off culture plates and lysed by passing through a 26-gauge needle 10 times. The homogenate was centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C), and supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube.Kinase Renaturation AssayAll isoforms of the MAP kinase family will phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP) in vitro on a threonine residue(33Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, after electrophoretic resolution on a MBP-impregnated polyacrylamide gel, MAP kinases may be renatured to active form and detected by phosphorylation of MBP(3Abe M. Chao T-S.O. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Kelleher M.D. Abe M.K. Chao T-S.O. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J.

Cell extracts (5-10 μg of protein/lane) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with 0.1 mg/ml of MBP copolymerized in the running gel. After electrophoresis the gel was washed twice with 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 5 mM mercaptoethanol plus 30% isopropyl alcohol to remove SDS (1 h each at room temperature). After another wash in 50 mM Hepes and mercaptoethanol alone (1 h), gels were incubated in 6 M guanidine HCl plus 5 mM mercaptoethanol to denature proteins (two washes, 1 h each). Next, gels were equilibrated twice in renaturation buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% Tween 20 (total incubation time approximately 16 h, each at 4°C), The renatured gels were then incubated in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, and 90 μM sodium vanadate for 30 min. The phosphorylation step was conducted by setting each gel in 10 ml of the aforementioned buffer supplemented with 5 mM mercaptoethanol, 50 μM ATP, and 150-200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for a period of 1 h at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by washing in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and dried. Autoradiograms were developed by exposing Kodak X-Omat film to the dried gel. Quantitation of MBP phosphorylation by MAP kinases was measured by optical scanning (Ambis image analyzer, San Diego, CA).Western Blotting of MAP KinasesCell extracts were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer unit (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA). After incubation with rabbit anti-MAP kinase antiserum (antibody 283), immunoblots were amplified and visualized using goat anti-rabbit IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. A shift in the MAP kinase bands toward a slower mobility reflects the phosphorylation of MAP kinases at threonine and tyrosine residues, which is required for enzyme activity (34Anderson N.G. Mailer J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar).Raf-1 Kinase AssayRaf-1 kinase activity was analyzed by immune complex kinase assay(24Russell M. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2343-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After incubation with the appropriate stimulus, cells were washed twice and lysed in 500 μl of buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μM Na3VO4, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C), supernatants were incubated with anti-c-Raf-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 90 min at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose was added for another 30 min. Next, after addition of an equal volume of lysis buffer plus 10% sucrose, the Sepharose beads were allowed to settle, and the mixtures were centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm. Each pellet was then washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with PAN (10 mM Pipes, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and finally twice with PAN alone. Each pellet was then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mM Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mM MnCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μM Na3VO4) containing approximately 1 ng of kinase-inactive MEK. The immune complex kinase reaction was initiated by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to the mixture, which was then incubated at 30°C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and boiling for 2-5 min. Samples were resolved on a 10% SDS gel, and the MEK phosphorylation was assessed by optical scanning.Transient Transfection of Bovine Tracheal MyocytesCells were seeded into 100-mm plates at a density of 5×105 cells/plate and incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM for 24 h. After rinsing, cells were incubated with a liposome solution consisting of serum- and antibiotic-free medium, plasmid DNA (total of 8 μg/plate), and Lipofectamine (40 μl/plate). After 5 h, the liposome solution was replaced with 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding a hemagglutinin-tagged murine ERK2 and either the dominant inhibitory Raf-1 p301-1 or calf thymus DNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved in DMEM. The next day, cells were treated with the relevant stimulus and harvested for analysis of ERK2 kinase activity.Epitope-tagged ERK2 Kinase AssayERK2 kinase activity was assessed by immunoprecipitation of the epitope tag followed by in vitro phosphorylation assay(35Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were stimulated and lysed with 0.5 ml of cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Cell lysates were then incubated with 25 μl of protein A precoupled with the antibody 12CA5 specific to the hemagglutinin epitope. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the immune complexes were washed four times with the lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 200 μM Na3VO4, and 10 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate. The immune complex kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of MBP. Immune complexes were resuspended in a final volume of 40 μl of kinase buffer with 0.25 mg/ml MBP and 50 μM ATP (5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 20 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 20 μl of Laemmli buffer. Samples were resolved on a 10% SDS gel, and an autoradiogram was developed from the dried gel. The MBP bands were excised from the gel, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation.Enzyme-linked Immunoassay for Cyclic AMPAfter pretreatment for 15 min with isobutyl methylxanthine, cells were exposed to histamine (10−4-10−8M) for 15 min. The medium was then aspirated, and the monolayer was exposed to 0.1 N hydrochloric acid overnight. The cAMP content of each plate was then measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Amersham Corp.), and the results were normalized to cell number.RESULTSEffects of 5-HT and Histamine on MAP Kinase Activity in Bovine Tracheal MyocytesBovine tracheal smooth muscle cell extracts were electrophoresed on a MBP-impregnated polyacrylamide gel, renatured to active form, and detected by phosphorylation of the substrate MBP. As we have shown previously(4Kelleher M.D. Abe M.K. Chao T-S.O. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Physiol. (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol.). 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), 5-HT induced an approximately 4-fold increase in the activation of both the 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinases (Fig. 1A). Unlike 5-HT, histamine failed to stimulate MAP kinase in bovine tracheal myocytes, and in some instances, it appeared to reduce MAP kinase activation below that observed at base line. Immunoblotting with anti-MAP kinase antiserum antibody 283 demonstrated a slight upward shift in the position of the MAP kinase bands following 5-HT treatment, confirming phosphorylation of the enzymes (Fig. 1B).Mechanism of MAP Kinase Activation following 5-HT StimulationWe assessed the effects of a specific 5-HT2 receptor agonist, α-methyl-5-HT, on MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2A). Stimulation with α-methyl-5-HT-activated MAP kinase, consistent with the notion that 5-HT activates MAP kinase via this receptor subtype. Stimulation of the 5-HT2 receptor activates a G protein, which is positively coupled to phospholipase C(13Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol.

Pretreatment with PDBu (200 ng/ml for 24 h) reduced 5-HT-induced activation of both the 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinase homologues (Fig. 2, A and B), demonstrating that 5-HT-induced stimulation of MAP kinase is in part dependent on protein kinase C. On the other hand, pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 4 h), an inhibitor of the Gi protein, had little effect on the kinase activity induced by 5-HT (Fig. 2A). The failure of pertussis toxin to inhibit MAP kinase activation suggests that stimulation of the Gi-linked 5-HT1B receptor subtype is not involved in 5-HT-induced MAP kinase activation.Figure 2:Panel A, kinase renaturation assay demonstrating the effects of α-methyl-5-HT (10−4M), pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 4 h), and forskolin (50 μM for 15 min) on MAP kinase activity. The potency of the pertussis toxin was confirmed by demonstrating that a corresponding treatment inhibited thrombin-induced MAP kinase activation in these cells (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. C, control sample. Panel B, autoradiogram of a representative experiment demonstrating the effect of phorbol ester pretreatment on the time course of MAP kinase activation by 5-HT. Cells were incubated with PDBu (200 ng/ml) 24 h prior to stimulation with 5-HT. PDBu pretreatment also prevented phorbol ester-induced kinase activation, confirming the effectiveness of chronic PDBu treatment in down-regulating protein kinase C activity (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. Panel C, the activation of Raf-1 by 5-HT was confirmed by measurement of Raf-1 kinase activity. Cells were stimulated with 5-HT, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for Raf-1. The kinase activity of Raf-1 was measured by in vitro phosphorylation assay using kinase-inactive MEK-1 as substrate. Panel D, autoradiogram of ERK2 activation in bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells transiently co-transfected with an epitope-tagged murine ERK2 and the p301-1 dominant-negative Raf-1.

We therefore examined the effect of forskolin, which augments intracellular cAMP concentration, on MAP kinase activation following 5-HT exposure. Pretreatment with forskolin (50 μM for 15 min) abolished MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2A), suggesting that 5-HT-induced MAP kinase activation involves activation of Raf-1. The activation of Raf-1 by 5-HT was confirmed by measurement of Raf-1 kinase activity using a kinase-inactive MEK-1 as substrate(24Russell M. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2343-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Administration of 5-HT increased Raf-1 activation 4-fold (Fig. 2C).The requirement of Raf-1 for 5-HT-induced MAP kinase activation was tested by examining ERK2 activation in bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells transiently transfected with an epitope-tagged murine ERK2 and the p301-1 dominant-negative Raf-1. Treatment with 5-HT increased MBP-phosphorylating activity 2-3-fold; expression of the mutant Raf-1 returned 5-HT-induced ERK2 activity to base line (Fig. 2D).Effect of Histamine on MAP Kinase Activation by 5-HT and Peptide Growth FactorsThe absence of MAP kinase activation following histamine exposure led us to test whether histamine might inhibit MAP kinase activation via i"

It also participates in the amplification of the complement classical pathway. Alone, factor B is a zymogen with little known biochemical activity, but in the context of the alternative pathway convertases, the factor B serine protease is activated in a process that first involves the association with C3b and subsequently the cleavage of factor B into two fragments, Ba and Bb. Ba, the NH2-terminal fragment, is composed mainly of three tandem short consensus repeats, globular domains found in other complement proteins. It dissociates from the convertase during assembly, leaving the active C3 convertase, C3bBb. Previous reports suggest that the Ba region may be instrumental in convertase assembly. This hypothesis was tested using site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant factor B and monoclonal antibody epitope mapping to evaluate the relative importance of specific short consensus repeat amino acid residues. Three sites of interest were identified. Site 1 is a stretch of 19 contiguous amino acids in short consensus repeat 1 that form the epitope of a monoclonal antibody that effectively blocks factor B function. Site 2, composed of 6 contiguous amino acids in short consensus repeat 2, and site 3, consisting of 7 contiguous amino acids in short consensus repeat 3, were defined by mutations that reduce factor B hemolytic activity to 3% or less. Further analyses indicated that sites 2 and 3 contribute to factor B-C3b interactions. Human factor B is required for the initiation and propagation of the complement alternative pathway.

Further analyses indicated that sites 2 and 3 contribute to factor B-C3b interactions. The complement system consists of about 30 proteins that function in the identification and removal of foreign substances and immune complexes and in the stimulation of inflammatory responses (reviewed in (1Muller-Eberhard H.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 33-62Google Scholar)). There are two major pathways of complement activation, the classical pathway and the alternative pathway. Activation of the classical pathway is induced primarily by antibody-antigen complexes, while the alternative pathway is initiated by the binding of C3b to activating surfaces, frequently microbial in nature. A third pathway induced by lectins has recently been described(2Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 3Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In each case sequential activation of a series of serine proteases occurs, each protease amplifying the effects of the previous one. Key constituents of both pathways are the C3 and C5 convertases, which are assembled on target surfaces and produce biologically active fragments through the cleavage of the circulating complement components C3 and C5. The first step in the assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase is the association of factor B with C3b(1Muller-Eberhard H.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 33-62Google Scholar, 4Volanakis J.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 153: 1-18Google Scholar). In this context factor B can be cleaved by factor D, resulting in Ba and Bb, a process that requires a divalent cation. Ba then dissociates from the complex while Bb remains bound to C3b. C3bBb can be partially stabilized by association with properdin. C3bBb and C3bBbP (where P represents properdin) are active enzymes that cleave C3 at a single point, generating more C3b and ultimately more convertases. Alternative pathway C5 convertase activity occurs through the association of C3 convertase and additional C3b. In all cases, dissociation of Bb from the convertases is inevitable, irreversible, and followed by inactivation of proteolytic function(5Oglesby T.J. Accavitti M.A. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ueda A. Kearney J.F. Roux K.H. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1143-1149PubMed Google Scholar). Factor B is a 90-kDa single-chain glycoprotein composed of five protein domains(7Mole J.E. Anderson J.K. Davison E.A. Woods D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3407-3412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region (Ba) consists predominantly of three short consensus repeats (SCRs), 1The abbreviations used are: SCRshort consensus repeatPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodybpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBphosphate buffer. domains found in complement regulatory proteins(8Kristensen T.

The carboxyl-terminal region (Bb) consists of a type A domain found in von Willebrand factor and complement receptors(9Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by a trypsin-like serine protease domain(10Perkins S.J. Smith K.F. Biochem.

Since C3b binding is mediated by SCR domains in a number of complement proteins(8Kristensen T. D'Eustachio P. Ogata R.T. Chung L.P. Reid K.B.M. Tack B.F. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar), the Ba fragment has affinity for C3b(12Pryzdial E.L.G. Isenman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1519-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some monoclonal antibodies directed against Ba block factor B-C3b interactions(6Ueda A. Kearney J.F. Roux K.H. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1143-1149PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that the association of the factor B SCRs with C3b could be instrumental in the earliest stages of convertase assembly. We tested this hypothesis using site-directed mutagenesis and anti-Ba mAb epitope mapping to evaluate the relative roles of specific SCR amino acid residues in factor B function. A full-length human factor B cDNA was isolated by screening a size-selected oligo(dT)-primed human acute phase liver cDNA λ ZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) library (a gift of Dr. Rick Wetsel, St. Louis Children's Hospital) with a 32P-labeled partial human factor B cDNA insert derived from pBfA28 ((7Mole J.E. Anderson J.K. Davison E.A. Woods D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3407-3412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); also a gift of Dr. Wetsel). The partial factor B probe hybridized to about of the plaques. Selected isolates were subjected to Southern blot analysis with the pBfA28 probe. Isolates containing 1900- and 600-bp EcoRI fragments homologous to factor B underwent in vivo excision, performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The insert of one of the resulting plasmids, A14, was sequenced completely in both directions using a collection of primers derived from the published partial cDNA sequence(7Mole J.E. Anderson J.K. Davison E.A. Woods D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3407-3412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complete A14 factor B cDNA insert was excised from its plasmid by partial digestion with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of expression vector pSG5 ((13Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar); Stratagene) and used to transform Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones were isolated that carried the factor B cDNA in the sense (B(+)) and the antisense (B(-)) directions. Two oligonucleotide-directed methods were employed to mutagenize factor B/pSG5 constructs directly. In the first method (double take double-stranded mutagenesis; Stratagene), a unique vector XmnI restriction site was utilized to cut parental plasmids. The resulting 3′ ends were biotinylated and bound to avidin-coated beads. Mutant strands were synthesized by T7 polymerase and T4 ligase utilizing mutagenic primers (Table 1), extension primers, and bead-bound parental template. DNA was dissociated, and the mutagenic strands were purified from the parental strands by centrifugation. Mutant plasmids were completed by T7 polymerase and T4 ligase utilizing a bridging primer. DNA was used to transform competent E. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transformants were grown on LB plates supplemented with ampicillin. This method was curtailed when the beads were no longer available.Table I Open table in a new tab In the second method (transformer site-directed mutagenesis; (14Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar); Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), simultaneous mutagenesis of a factor B site with a mutagenic primer and a unique XbaI vector site with a selection primer (5′-monophosphate-GGAAGCGGAAGAGTCGCGAGTCGACCAGACATG-3′) formed the basis of efficient selection of mutant plasmids: Parental plasmids (grown in E. coli strain BMH 71-18 mutS) were denatured by alkaline treatment and neutralized, and mutant strands were synthesized by T4 polymerase and T4 ligase utilizing mutagenic primers (Table 1) and the selection primer. DNA was digested with XbaI and used to transform competent BMH 71-18 mutS. A mixed population of DNA was isolated from the transformant pool and cut with XbaI. DNA was used to transform competent E. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transformants were grown on LB plates supplemented with ampicillin. The B(+) template was used for all mutagenic procedures. Transformants were screened by DNA sequencing(15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). In general, 5-10 candidates were sufficient to obtain at least one desired mutant. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard Mini-Prep DNA isolation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). SV40-transformed green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were maintained as described(16Krych M. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4353-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).

For immunoprecipitation, samples were first precleared with protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) and then incubated with goat anti-factor B polyclonal antibody (IgG fraction, 12.9 mg/ml, Incstar) or normal goat serum (Sigma). Immune complexes adsorbed to protein A-agarose were washed twice with PBS (8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM NaH2PO4, 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 360 mM NaCl, 5 mM Na2EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.25% SDS, and twice with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were eluted in an SDS/glycerol/glycine dissociation buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%; (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar)). Signal was enhanced utilizing Amplify (Amersham Corp.) followed by autoradiography. Nunc MaxiSorp microtiter plates (VWR Scientific; Chicago, IL) were coated with murine anti-human factor Bb monoclonal antibody (catalog number 227; Quidel, San Diego, CA) at 2 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 4°C, blocked with 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (1 h, 37°C), and washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Factor B standards were dilutions of commercially purified factor B protein (Quidel). Standards, controls, and samples, diluted in 4% BSA and 0.25% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After washing, wells were treated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-human factor B polyclonal antibody (see above) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Wells were washed, treated with a 1:15,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Color was developed using a 0.2% orthophenylenediamine and H2O2 solution in a citrate/phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. Absorbance at 414 nm was read in a microplate reader (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA). Standards, samples, and controls were assayed in duplicate. Standard curves were determined using a 2-fold dilution series of purified factor B between 50 ng/ml and 1.56 ng/ml. The optical density was graphed versus the log of antigen concentration, yielding a straight line between 2 and 25 ng/ml, and used to determine the concentration of the unknowns. Standard sera samples were measured along with mutant and wild type recombinant factor B at four different dilutions. In a variation of the factor B quantitation ELISA assay, microtiter plates were coated with 5 μg/ml C3b (19Whaley K. Whaley K. Methods in Complement for Clinical Immunologists. Churchill Livingston, New York1985: 77-139Google Scholar) in PBS overnight at 4°C, blocked with 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (1 h, 37°C), and washed with in PB (8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM NaH2PO4) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2. Standards, controls, and samples were diluted in PB supplemented with 4% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 75 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2. Subsequent antibodies were diluted in PB supplemented with 4% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2. Factor B samples and controls were incubated in triplicate in the microtiter wells for 2 h at 37°C. After washing, wells were treated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-human factor B polyclonal antibody (see above) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Wells were washed, treated with a 1:15,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (see above), and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Color was developed and absorbance was determined as above. A near linear signal was detected with recombinant wild type factor B from 25 to 400 ng/ml. No signal was detected with equivalent volumes of control A14E COS supernatants or with BSA-coated microtiter wells. Factor B mutants were assayed at 200 ng/ml. All COS supernatants were first dialyzed into 25 mM NaCl PB, factor B concentrations were determined by ELISA, and aliquots were brought to 75 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 prior to the C3b binding assay. Results are representative of three or more separate determinations. In the experiments shown in Table II, Table IV, Table V, Table VI, factor B forms at 200 ng/ml were preincubated with C3b or mAb at various molar ratios in 75 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 PB overnight at 4°C. In a variation of the protocol above, anti-Ba mAb 14-III-33 (catalog number A225; Quidel) was used as capture antibody. After treatment with blocking buffer and subsequent washing, factor B mutants or wild type recombinant factor B (diluted to 20 μg/ml as determined using an anti-Bb mAb, above) was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Detection was as above. mAb recognition was determined for each mutant and expressed as (calculated concentration of mutant)/(calculated concentration of wild type recombinant factor B) × 100. A variation of the assays described by Whaley (19Whaley K. Whaley K. Methods in Complement for Clinical Immunologists.

Sheep erythrocytes were obtained precoated with antibody, guinea pig C1, and human C4b (109/ml; catalog number 789-053; Diamedix Corp., Miami, FL). 0.5 ml of cells were washed twice (5 ml of DGVB2+ (2.5% dextrose, 0.1% gelatin, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 71 mM NaCl, 0.051% sodium 5′,5″-diethyl barbiturate, pH 7.35), 4°C), resuspended to 0.5 ml, prewarmed at 30°C for 5 min, and treated with C2 and C3 (50 μl of purified human C3 (1 mg/ml, Quidel) and 50 μl of purified human C2 (0.58 μg/ml, a gift of Dr. Paul Higgins of CytoMed, Inc., Cambridge, MA), 400 μl of DGVB2+ preincubated for 5 min at 30°C). The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min with gentle mixing every 5 min to allow the assembly of active convertases (C2aC4b) and the coating of the cells with C3b. The mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mM EDTA buffer (10 mM Na2EDTA, 0.1% gelatin, 128 mM NaCl, 0.092%, sodium 5′,5″-diethyl barbiturate, pH 7.35) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h to allow dissociation of the active convertases and inhibit the production of new convertases. The cells were washed twice in 10 mM EDTA buffer, washed twice in 10 mM Mg2+-EGTA buffer (10 mM Na2EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 2.075% dextrose, 0.083% gelatin, 59 mM NaCl, 0.042% sodium 5′,5″-diethyl barbiturate, pH 7.3-7.6), and resuspended to a calculated final concentration of 108/ml. Purified factor B (Quidel) was used as a standard. COS supernatants were diluted in Mg2+-EGTA buffer to equivalent levels (20-80 ng/ml) as predetermined by ELISA. For each determination, 100 μl of prepared (C3b-coated) sheep erythrocytes, 50 μl of purified factor D (5 ng in Mg2+-EGTA buffer; Quidel), 50 μl of properdin (45 ng in Mg2+-EGTA buffer; Quidel), and 50 μl of factor B source or standard were mixed together and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. A negative control substituted 50 μl of DGVB2+ buffer for the factor B source. Additional controls included complete cell lysis and cells mixed with buffer only. All points were determined in triplicate. Alternative pathway C3 convertase sites were developed with 300 μl of a 1:40 dilution of guinea pig serum (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO) in 40 mM EDTA buffer (40 mM Na2EDTA, 0.1% gelatin, 85 mM NaCl, 0.061%, Na-5′-5′′-diethyl barbiturate, pH 7.35) (except for the 450 μl of distilled water and the 450 μl of DGVB2+ buffer controls), samples were centrifuged, and A414 of the supernatants was determined. Z values (average lethal hits/cell) were calculated for each sample (see (19Whaley K. Whaley K. Methods in Complement for Clinical Immunologists. Churchill Livingston, New York1985: 77-139Google Scholar)). Z values for wild type factor B were linear between 10 and 160 ng/ml. The activity of our recombinant factor B was similar to that of commercially purified factor B. In most cases, COS supernatants were diluted to 80 ng/ml, which resulted in a Z value between 0.5 and 1.00 for recombinant wild type factor B. Hemolytic activity levels for the factor B mutants were expressed as percentage of the average Z value obtained for the wild type recombinant protein determined in parallel. Wild type recombinant factor B preparations, separately measured by ELISA to determine factor B concentration, varied up to 20% in specific hemolytic activity (i.e. in one experiment that compared 5 preparations isolated over the course of 6 months, average of Z = 1.04, S.D.= 0.167). In one experimental design, 80 ng/ml recombinant factor B (or mutant factor B) was preincubated with mAb at various molar ratios in Mg2+-EGTA buffer for 30 min at 4°C. Aliquots were taken and used to assay hemolytic activity. Percentage of activity was determined as percentage of the average hemolytic activity of the recombinant factor B form preincubated in buffer alone. In a second experimental design, C3 convertase assembly was divided into two steps: 50 μl of pure factor B (500 ng/ml in Mg2+-EGTA buffer) was mixed with 100 μl of C3b-coated cells and 100 μl of Mg2+-EGTA buffer and incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Cells were subjected to centrifugation, washed with 5 ml of Mg2+-EGTA, and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer. Cells were treated with factor D and properdin (to 250 μl) and incubated for 30 min at 30°C. The alternative pathway C3 convertases were detected as described above. mAb was preincubated (30 min at 4°C) at a 5:1 molar ratio with factor B before addition to cells, or mAb was incubated with washed C3bB cells (30 min at 4°C) prior to factor D + properdin treatment. The mAb treatments and the nontreated controls included both preincubation steps, with or without mAb. A full-length human factor B cDNA (designated A14) was isolated from an acute phase liver cDNA library. The A14 sequence is 2483 bp, composed of a 115-bp 5′-untranslated region, a 2292-bp open reading frame, and a 3′-untranslated region of 76 bp, including a 20-bp poly(A) tail. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 764 amino acids. The carboxyl-terminal 739 amino acids are identical to the published sequence of secreted factor B (7Mole J.E. Anderson J.K. Davison E.A. Woods D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3407-3412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with only one exception, a Q rather than R at position 7 of the mature protein. Since there are two methionines in the first 12 amino acids of the open reading frame, it is not clear whether one or both is utilized as the start of translation. In either case, the NH2-terminal region appears to be a standard signal peptide, rich in hydrophobic residues (21von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar COS-7 cells were transfected with A14 cDNA oriented in expression vector pSG5 (13Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) in the forward (B(+)) or reverse (B(-)) direction. Proteins were recovered from the supernatants of biosynthetically labeled and transfected cells, isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-human factor B polyclonal antibody, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. B(+) supernatants yielded a predominant band of 90 kDa in apparent molecular size, the appropriate position for mature human factor B (Fig. 1, lane2). A weak band present in the B(-) cell supernatant (Fig. 1, lane4) was most likely endogenous monkey factor B synthesized by the COS cells. Neither band was present when normal goat serum was used in place of anti-factor B antibody (Fig. 1, lanes1 and 3). Supernatants derived from the transfection of unlabeled cells were assayed by ELISA for the presence of human factor B protein. By this criterion, the B(+) cells produced 500-2000 ng/ml factor B in 72 h while the B(-) cells produced 1-10% of the B(+) value. Supernatants were assayed for factor B-dependent hemolytic activity. The recombinant factor B was comparable in activity with the purified factor B (data not shown), while the B(-) activity was negligible (≤1% activity for an equivalent volume of supernatant). SCR mutants were generated employing a strategy known as homolog-scanning mutagenesis(22Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). By this method, amino acids are replaced by those of the corresponding region of a structural homolog. In principle, homolog-scanning mutagenesis can identify sequences causing functional variation among homologous proteins. In practice, it has proved helpful for the analysis of the SCRs of complement receptor 1(16Krych M. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4353-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a panel of SCR mutations was generated that spanned all three factor B SCRs (Fig. 2). Most mutants feature short amino acid substitutions derived from the corresponding SCR region of human C2, which is 46% homologous to factor B in this region (24Bentley D.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) but does not interact with C3b or factor D. In a few cases substitutions derived from a sea lamprey factor B/C2 sequence were used(25Nonaka M. Takahashi M. Sasaki M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2263-2269PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant factor B proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by PAGE and by ELISA (data not shown). Those that produced sufficient full-length factor B forms were assayed for hemolytic activity (Fig. 2). Most mutants retained hemolytic capacity similar to the recombinant factor B control. In contrast, two mutants derived by substitution of human C2 sequence resulted in 5% activity or less. In one case substitution of S127GQTAI → DGETAV in SCR-2 (mutant 16) reduced hemolytic activity to 3 ± 2% of wild type recombinant levels. At a second site, substitution of P146IGTRKV → SLGAVRT in SCR-3 (mutant 18) reduced activity to less than 3%. The Bmut16 and Bmut18 regions were mutated one amino acid at a time. In the case of Bmut16, single substitutions resulted in relatively modest reductions in hemolytic activity (Table 2). In contrast, in the case of the Bmut18 region, substitution of Pro146 with Ser resulted in 11% activity, while substitution of Val152 with Thr left no more than 3% activity.Table II Open table in a new tab An ELISA procedure was developed that detected the binding of factor B to immobilized C3b at salt and cation concentrations similar to those of the hemolytic assay. Binding of the wild type factor B was Mg2+-dependent (9 ± 2% binding observed without Mg2+), and binding capacity was constant between 25 and 75 mM NaCl (data not shown). Moreover, factor B von Willebrand factor mutations Bmut28 and Bmut29 were also examined; in each of these mutants, an amino acid residue that is homologous to one that coordinates Mg2+ binding in the von Willebrand factor domain of CR3 (26Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) has been replaced. Bmut28 and Bmut29 lacked both C3b binding capacity and hemolytic activity (Fig. 2). Binding assays were performed on the SCR mutations (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Normal hemolytic activity was accompanied by at least normal binding levels. Of the mutations that reduced hemolytic activity severely, Bmut16 retained full binding levels while Bmut18 and its related single amino acid substitutions reduced binding substantially. Binding of wild type recombinant factor B to immobilized C3b could be inhibited by preincubation with fluid phase C3b (Table 3). Selected factor B mutants were preincubated with fluid phase C3b (Table 3). In the case of wild type recombinant factor B, as well as mutants Bmut7L and Bmut9, fluid phase C3b was an effective inhibitor of C3b binding at molar ratios no greater than 5:1. Fluid phase C3b was ineffective as an inhibitor with Bmut16 at 5:1 and 20:1.Table II Open table in a new tab The factor B mutant panel was used to map the epitope of 014-III-33, an anti-Ba mAb reported to block factor B function (Quidel). It was seen that 014-III-33 recognized all but three of the 26 SCR mutants (Fig. 3). Those three mutants defined a discrete region of 19 amino acids in length between the conserved tryptophan of SCR-1 and the first conserved cysteine of SCR-2. mAb 014-III-33 was examined for its effects on hemolytic capacity (Table 4, Experiment I). Our observations confirmed its inhibitory effects: Even at a 2:1 mAb:factor B molar ratio, 014-III-33 inhibited over 80% of hemolytic activity. Two factor B mutations not recognized by the mAb (Bmut7L and Bmut8) were similarly unaffected by 014-III-33 in hemolytic assays (Table 4, Experiment 2).Table IV"

Chem. 1993; 268: 23933-23939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the expression of v-Ras activates the Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway in cells(10Gallego C. Gupta S.K. Heasley L.E.

A. 1992; 89: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the interaction of Raf-1 with Ras•GTP in vitro is insufficient to substantially activate Raf-1 kinase activity(11Macdonald S.G.

One predicted role of Ras•GTP is to bring Raf-1 into proximity at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane for a second regulatory event required for Raf-1 activation(13Leevers S.J.

Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). This second regulatory event has been proposed to involve protein kinase C in some cell types(15Cai H. Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Moscat J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7645-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and different protein kinase C isotypes have been shown to directly phosphorylate Raf-1(16Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G.

Protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of Raf-1 increased Raf-1 autophosphorylation but alone did not increase activity toward MEK-1(11Macdonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R.

Thus, it is probable that both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent regulatory events are required for Raf-1 activation leading to increased MAP kinase activity. The Ras-independent events leading to Raf-1 activation are not unequivocally defined but may involve protein kinase C.Seven transmembrane receptors coupled to Gi and Gq are capable of activating the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway in different cell types(18Winitz S.

Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (in press)Google Scholar). βγ subunits can activate the MAP kinase pathway in a Ras dependent manner(20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In most cell types activated Gαi or Gαq subunits do not activate the MAP kinase pathway by themselves. An exception is Rat1a cells, where GTPase-deficient αi2 (αiQ205L) is capable of activating MAP kinase(21Gupta S. Gallego C. Johnson G.L. Heasley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we have used the C5a receptor (C5aR) expressed in HEK293 cells. The C5aR couples to Gi and G16, a homolog of Gq,11 expressed in hematopoietic cells, but not to Gq or G11(22Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Buhl A.M. Eisfelder B.J. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Russell M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using this receptor system and the ability to selectively signal through Gi, G16, or Gi and G16, we demonstrate that two signal inputs are required for maximal MAP kinase activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsC5a was from Sigma. The protein kinase C inhibitor bisindoylmaleimide (GF109203X) was from Calbiochem.Cell Culture and TransfectionHEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% bovine calf serum. cDNAs were inserted in pCMV5 and used for transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure with 1 μg/ml of each expression plasmid(24Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 15 h and glycerol-shocked in 15% glycerol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 min. After 65 h the cells were assayed in the various experiments.Other ProceduresPhospholipase C activity was assayed as described(23Buhl A.M. Eisfelder B.J. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Russell M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MAP kinase activity was assayed following fractionation of cell lysates using Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography(21Gupta S. Gallego C. Johnson G.L. Heasley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of transfected proteins by immunoblot was performed as described previously(23Buhl A.M. Eisfelder B.J. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Russell M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All antisera were raised in rabbits against C-terminal peptides of the C5aR, α16, and transducin βγ, respectively. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments giving similar results.RESULTSMAP Kinase Activation in Response to C5a Receptor StimulationThe C5aR was expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized for its ability to regulate MAP kinase activity. C5a activation of the expressed C5aR modestly stimulates MAP kinase activity (Fig. 1A). When coexpressed with the G16α subunit (α16), activation of the C5aR gives a strong MAP kinase stimulation. Expression of α16 in the absence of the C5aR did not influence basal MAP kinase activity. Immunoblotting demonstrated expression of both the C5aR and α16 (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Immunoblotting of expressed C5aR, α16, and β1 subunit. Sixty-five h after transfection with pCMV5C5aR, pCMV5α16 or pCMV5β1+ pCMV5γ2 cells were lysed and 200 μg of each lysate separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rabbit sera for C5aR, α16, and β1 proteins were used for immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The modest activation of MAP kinase in response to stimulation of the C5aR was pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating this response was coupled to Gi proteins in 293 cells (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the MAP kinase activation observed with C5aR stimulation in the presence of α16 was inhibited approximately 60% by pertussis toxin. Although pertussis toxin treatment of cells markedly inhibited the MAP kinase response to C5aR stimulation in the presence of α16, it had no significant effect on the C5aR activation of phospholipase Cβ activity (Fig. 1C). These findings indicate that both a functional Gi and G16 protein were required for maximal MAP kinase activation in response to C5aR stimulation, but only G16 was required for phospholipase C activation.βγ Subunit Complex Activation of MAP KinaseIt has been postulated that G protein βγ subunits, not α subunits, are the major contributor to seven transmembrane receptor stimulation of MAP kinase activity(20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A demonstrates that transient expression of different β1, β2, γ2, and γ3 combinations are capable of modestly activating MAP kinase. The magnitude of the MAP kinase activation with βγ subunit expression was comparable to that observed with the pertussis toxin-sensitive acute C5aR stimulation in the absence of α16 (Fig. 1). It is important to note that activated Ras (Val12Ras), when transiently expressed in HEK293 gave a very strong MAP kinase activation (Table 1). Thus, the MAP kinase pathway can sustain a high activity for the 48-65 h after transfection with a constitutively activated upstream regulator. The fact that βγ-stimulated MAP kinase activity is modest in this assay suggests that βγ overexpression is unable to sustain maximal MAP kinase activation even though βγ subunit expression can persistently activate phospholipase Cβ activity (see below). βγ-Subunit overexpression was unable to activate MAP kinase in a manner similar to Val12Ras, indicating that βγ-subunits alone cannot sustain a significant Ras activation in HEK293 cells.Figure 3:Activation of MAP kinase activity by G protein βγ subunits. A, cells were cotransfected with pCMV5 expression plasmids encoding β1 and γ 2, or γ 3 and β2 and γ 2, or γ 3. Sixty-five h after transfection, cells were lysed and the lysates fractionated by Mono Q-FPLC and assayed for MAP kinase activity. B, cells were transfected with pCMV5PLCβ2, pCMV5β2+ pCMV5γ 2, or the combination of all three expression plasmids. Forty-nine h after transfection, cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol and 16 h later assayed for phospholipase C activity. C, cells transfected as in B were assayed for MAP kinase activity as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I Open table in a new tab The C5aR coexpressed with the α16 subunit polypeptide gives a strong acute activation of MAP kinase. Since α16 activates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)(22Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Buhl A.M. Eisfelder B.J. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Russell M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), this suggests that products of PLCβ-catalyzed reactions involving either diacylglycerol and/or inositol phosphates are critical for mediating maximal MAP kinase activation in response to C5aR stimulation. Coexpression of β2γ2 G protein subunits with PLCβ2 resulted in a significant PLCβ activation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). However, persistent activation of PLCβ2 in the presence of β2γ2 overexpression did not significantly stimulate MAP kinase activity over that observed with β2γ2 alone (Fig. 3C). Thus, persistent PLCβ2 stimulation in the presence of βγ overexpression cannot sustain a maximal MAP kinase activity. This contrasts with activated Ras which is able to sustain a high MAP kinase activity (Table 1).Protein Kinase C Inhibition Inhibits C5aR/Gα16Stimulation of MAP KinaseThe protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X (25Toullec D.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) strongly inhibits the robust MAP kinase activation observed with coexpression of C5aR and α16 (Fig. 4). The modest MAP kinase activation seen with the C5aR in the absence of α16 coexpression is unaffected by incubation of HEK293 cells with GF109203X. We have previously shown inhibition of cells with GF109203X does not inhibit MAP kinase activation in response to N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) peptide in human neutrophils(26Worthen G.S. Avdi N. Buhl A.M. Suzuki N. Johnson G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 815-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings therefore indicate that a functional protein kinase C is required for maximal C5aR stimulation of MAP kinase activity, and that GF109203X is not inhibiting component kinases in the sequential MAP kinase pathway (Raf/MEK/MAP kinase).Figure 4:Effect of the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X (GF) on C5aR stimulation of MAP kinase activity. Cells were transfected with the indicated pCMV5 expression plasmids encoding the C5aR, α16, or having no cDNA insert (Control). Sixty-four h after transfection cells were incubated with 3.5 μM GF109203X in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide alone for 60 min, and then stimulated with 50 nM C5a for 5 min. The cells were then lysed, and the lysate fractionated by Mono Q FPLC and assayed for MAP kinase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of αsG226A Inhibits C5aR-stimulated MAP Kinase and PLCβ ActivityMutation of Gly-226 → Ala in Gαs (αsG226A) prevents the mutant αs polypeptide from dissociating from βγ subunits even in the presence of bound GTP(27Tyler Miller R. Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Beiderman B. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The αsG226A polypeptide can therefore function as a “sink” for βγ subunits similar to the use of Gαt by other investigators(20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 28Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of αsG226A inhibited C5aR/α16 stimulated MAP kinase and PLCβ activity (Fig. 5). The approximate 50% inhibition of both MAP kinase and PLCβ activity by αsG226A, when α16 and the C5aR are coexpressed, indicates that αsG226A probably competes with α16 for βγ subunits in transfected HEK293 cells. The concomitant loss of MAP kinase and PLCβ stimulation argues that functional Gα16βγ heterotrimers in addition to Gαiβγ are required for maximal C5aR activation of MAP kinase. This is similar to the requirement of Gα16βγ complexes for PLCβ stimulation by the C5aR(29Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Figure 5:Inhibitory effects of αsG226A expression on C5aR/α16 regulation of MAP kinase activation. A, cells were transfected with pCMV5C5aR or pCMV5C5aR+pCMV5α16 with or without αsG226A (1 μg/ml). Sixty-five h post-transfection, MAP kinase activity was measured following a 5-min stimulation with C5a. B, cells were transfected with the various cDNAs as in A. Forty-five h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol and 20 h later assayed for phospholipase C activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONG protein-regulated pathways leading to MAP kinase activation have not been clearly delineated. As with tyrosine kinases, a functional Ras protein is required for G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptor activation of MAP kinase(18Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.-X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In several studies the inhibitory mutant Asn17Ras protein inhibits G protein-mediated MAP kinase activation(20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), 2N.-X. Qian and G. L. Johnson, manuscript in preparation. and it has also been postulated that βγ subunits mediate G protein activation of Ras leading to increased MAP kinase activity(20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In one study in particular, using COS cell transient transfections, it was postulated that G protein βγ subunits were sufficient to activate MAP kinase and that βγ subunits mimicked receptor stimulation of the MAP kinase pathway(20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). A second study also using COS cell transfections suggested the ability of G protein βγ subunits to activate MAP kinase was modest at best(28Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that overexpression of βγ subunits was insufficient to give a strong MAP kinase activation.Our studies presented here with the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled C5a receptor and the work of others (11Macdonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson R.L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 12Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using tyrosine kinase-regulated MAP kinase activation indicate that two regulatory responses are required for maximal MAP kinase stimulation. We demonstrate that for the C5aR both a Gi and a G16 regulatory event are required for maximal MAP kinase activation. The G16 regulatory event is inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. The role of protein kinase C may be to directly regulate Raf-1 activity (16Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) or to regulate the activity of a second kinase that regulates Raf-1 activity(15Cai H. Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Moscat J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7645-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GF109203X treatment of cells has no effect on C5aR stimulation of PLCβ activity, so the action of the inhibitor must be downstream of G protein activation. 3A. M. Buhl and G. L. Johnson, unpublished results. The ability of pertussis toxin to block C5aR activation of MAP kinase indicates that Gi is also involved. Because GTPase-deficient αi2 does not activate MAP kinase in HEK293 cells,3 the apparent contribution from Gi is its βγ subunit. This is consistent with the magnitude of βγ-mediated MAP kinase activation being similar to the C5aR response in the absence of Gα16. Coexpression of βγ subunits and PLCβ was insufficient, however, to persistently activate a strong MAP kinase activity. It is likely that either the protein kinase C or the Ras GDP exchange factor regulatory pathways become refractory to activation with persistent PLCβ stimulation. Consistent with this idea is the finding that phorbol ester down-regulation of protein kinase C partially inhibits stimulation of MAP kinase activity by Gq-coupled receptors(32Qian N.-X. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 4077-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).From these observations and the necessity of two signal inputs for maximal MAP kinase activation, G protein βγ subunits alone could maximally activate MAP kinase activity only if the two signal inputs were both βγ-stimulated. For example, significant expression of PLCβ2 or PLCβ3 activated by βγ subunits could provide the second signal input in addition to Ras activation for strong MAP kinase stimulation. Neither HEK293 nor COS (not shown) cells have a measurable PLCβ response to the C5aR in the absence of Gα16 expression, indicating that there is insufficient PLCβ2 or PLCβ3 expressed for a Gi-dependent, βγ-mediated C5aR response; the PLCβ response must be reconstituted by expression of Gα16. The requirement for two signal inputs for G protein regulation of MAP kinase activation obviously restricts the ability of different G protein-coupled receptors to regulate MAP kinase activity. Release of βγ subunits without an appropriate second input will give only modest responses. If cAMP is also elevated, the MAP kinase response may actually be inhibited(33Burgering B.M.Th Pronk G.J. van Corven P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L.

Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), preventing the modest βγ activation of the pathway. Similarly, persistent Gα subunit responses such as those observed with the GTPase-deficient αi2Q205L and αqQ209L polypeptides is insufficient for MAP kinase activation(32Qian N.-X. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 4077-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).3 The requirement for two signal inputs for maximal MAP kinase activity allows a graded MAP kinase response to be regulated by one or more G protein signals from one or more receptor inputs. Thus, the MAP kinase pathway is another example of “coincidence detection” of multiple signal inputs in regulating cytoplasmic signaling in response to extracellular stimuli for the control of cell phenotype(31Bourne H.R.

Ironically, diets enriched in saturated fat and cholesterol (HF/HC diets), which tend to accelerate atherosclerotic processes by increasing LDL cholesterol levels, also raise HDL-C. We have recently reported, using a human apoA-I (hapoA-1) transgenic mouse model, that the elevation of HDL-C by a HF/HC diet is attributable, in part, to an increase in the hepatic production of hapoA-1. To further define the hepatocellular processes associated with this induction, we have prepared primary hepatocytes from hapoA-1 transgenic mice. Rates of hapoA-1 secretion were 40% greater from cells prepared from animals fed the HF/HC relative to a low fat-low cholesterol (LF/LC) control diet. The abundance of hapoA-1 mRNA in these cells was similar between hepatocytes prepared from the HF/HC and LF/LC diet fed animals, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism that does not involve mRNA stability. Inhibition of secretion using brefeldin A revealed an increase in cellular hapoA-1 accumulation. Thus, the HF/HC diet apparently affects hepatic hapoA-1 production via a mechanism that is manifest prior to the exit of newly synthesized hapoA-1 from the Golgi. Pulse-chase experiments revealed a 39% greater peak hapoA-1 synthesis, with no difference in the degradation of total labeled hapoA-1 protein, as a result of the HF/HC diet feeding. Finally, resolution of liver S10 extracts via sucrose density sedimentation and metrizamide density equilibrium gradient centrifugation analyses both revealed similar increases (31 and 24%, respectively) in the relative percentage of hapoA-1 mRNA associated with the translating polysomal fractions as a result of the HF/HC feeding. Together, these data suggest that the HF/HC diet affects hepatic hapoA-1 production via a specific modulation in the relative amount of hapoA-1 mRNA in the polysomal pool. These observations provide an opportunity to explore a new mechanism regulating apoA-1 production and might lead to the development of novel therapies to elevate plasma HDL-C levels.

INTRODUCTIONEpidemiological studies have shown a strong inverse correlation between high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL-Chigh density lipoprotein cholesterolLDLlow density lipoproteinhapoA-1human apolipoprotein A-ImRNPmessenger ribonucleoproteinBFAbrefeldin AHF/HChigh fat-high cholesterolLF/LClow fat-low cholesterolMEMminimum essential mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase(s). levels and coronary heart disease risk. Ironically, however, diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol, which increase atherosclerosis risk, raise HDL-C levels. To probe the mechanism whereby dietary fat influences apoA-1 metabolism, an animal model, the human apoA-1 transgenic (hapoA-1) mouse, was studied. ApoA-1 is normally expressed in liver and intestine, but these mice expressed the hapoA-1 transgene only in liver(1Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as summarized in a previous report(2Hayek T. Ito Y. Azrolan N. Verdery R.B. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), increasing dietary fat and cholesterol in these mice raised HDL-C levels 65% and hapoA-1 levels 41%. Turnover studies revealed a 29% increase in hapoA-1 transport rate and a 26% decrease in fractional catabolic rate. These results are similar to a previous study using human volunteers(3Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and further, they imply that dietary fat can increase liver production of apoA-1. This was confirmed by experiments showing increased apoA-1 secretion from primary hepatocytes isolated from animals on the HF/HC compared to the LF/LC diets. The increased hapoA-1 production was not accompanied by any increase in hepatic or intestinal hapoA-1 mRNA. Thus, the mechanism of the diet effect on hapoA-1 production appeared to be post-transcriptional.The current study explores the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) for the post-transcriptional regulation of apoA-1 production by dietary fat and cholesterol. A different line of human apoA-1 transgenic mouse was used, which expressed the human gene in both liver and intestine(4Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K. Marcigliano A. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that primary hepatocytes prepared from these animals on the HF/HC versus the LF/LC diet showed increased hapoA-1 secretion without an increase in hapoA-1 mRNA levels. Experiments using brefeldin A (BFA) suggested that the increase in production preceded the exit of newly synthesized hapoA-1 from the Golgi apparatus. Pulse-chase experiments in HF/HC hepatocytes revealed increased synthesis and no change in hapoA-1 degradation. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of liver S10 supernatants showed a HF/HC-induced increase in polysomal versus non-polysomal associated hapoA-1 mRNA but no change in the average number of ribosomes per hapoA-1 mRNA. Metrizamide equilibrium density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis showed a dietary fat-induced increase in the fraction of hapoA-1 mRNA in the ribosomal versus the non-ribosomal associated peaks, consistent with the sucrose gradient data. Therefore, a HF/HC diet raises hapoA-1 production, and thereby plasma levels, by increasing the fraction of the hapoA-1 mRNA in the translating pool of messenger RNA.MATERIALS AND METHODSTransgenic MiceTwo lines of human apoA-1 transgenic mice, A-14 and 179, were used(1Walsh A.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each line contains the entire human apoA-1 gene but differs in flanking sequences. Line A-14 contains human DNA from 0.3 kb 5′ to 1.7 kb 3′ of the gene plus the −1.4 to −0.2-kb region of the promoter of the adjacent apoCIII gene, which we previously showed (4Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K. Marcigliano A. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) controls apoA-1 intestinal expression. Line 179 contains a continuous 11.5-kb human genomic segment extending from 5.5 kb 5′ to 3.8 kb 3′ of the gene. Both the endogenous mouse apoA-1 gene and the human apoA-1 transgene were found to be expressed in both the liver and intestine of line A-14 mice. In contrast, in line 179 animals, the endogenous mouse apoA-1 gene was found to be expressed in both the liver and intestine, whereas the human apoA-1 transgene was expressed only in the liver(4Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K. Marcigliano A. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DietsMice were fed two contrasting diets. The LF/LC diet was rodent chow (no. 5001; Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO), containing 4.5% fat, 59.8% carbohydrate, 23.4% protein, 5.0% fiber, added minerals and vitamins, and 0.02% cholesterol; fats provided 9% of the calories, equally divided among saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated. The HF/HC diet was TD 88137 (Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets, Madison, WI), a milk fat-based diet containing 21.2% fat, 49.1% carbohydrate, 19.8% protein, 5% fiber, added minerals and vitamins, an antioxidant, and 0.2% cholesterol; fats provided 41% of the calories, with saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated forms contributing 27, 12, and 2%, respectively.Plasma Lipid, Lipoprotein, and Apolipoprotein DeterminationsThe mice were anesthetized with methoxyflurane, and plasma was taken from the retro-orbital plexus and assayed for total cholesterol, HDL-C, and human and mouse apoA-1, as previously described(2Hayek T. Ito Y. Azrolan N. Verdery R.B. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Primary Hepatocyte PreparationsMice were fed either the HF/HC or LF/LC diet for 3 weeks. Hepatocyte cultures were prepared using a modification of a previously reported procedure(2Hayek T. Ito Y. Azrolan N. Verdery R.B. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice (two per experimental condition) were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 5% pentobarbital, and then the portal vein was cannulated and the liver perfused with a CO2-equilibrated, calcium-free MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C for 10 min. MEM containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.075% collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim) was then perfused through the liver for 30 min. The livers were then excised from the animals, minced with a sterile scissors in a Petri plate, and passed through a nylon mesh filter, which was then rinsed with Hanks' buffered saline; this served to separate debris from liver cells. The cells were then centrifuged at 500 × g, resuspended in MEM, and washed twice by centrifugation. Cell viability (range 88-93%) was assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and 1 × 106 live cells were plated on 60-mm Petri dishes pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and incubated in 2 ml of MEM at 37°C in 95% air, 5% CO2.Labeling and Pulse-Chase Experiments4 h after plating, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and again with nonradioactive labeling medium (leucine-free MEM supplemented with a small amount of leucine (40 μM)). For labeling experiments, hepatocytes were then incubated with 2 ml of labeling medium containing 200 μCi/ml [4,5-3H]leucine (141 Ci/mmol, Amersham) for the indicated times at 37°C. After incubation, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min. The attached cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C. For pulse-chase experiments, hepatocytes were labeled for 10 min as described above, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and once with chase medium (MEM containing 400 μM leucine), and then incubated with 2 ml of chase medium for the indicated times. In experiments with BFA, the labeling protocol above was followed except that hepatocytes were exposed to 2 μg/ml BFA (Sigma) for 30 min prior to and during the entire labeling period. Radiolabeled hapoA-1 was quantitatively isolated from conditioned medium and cell lysates by immunoprecipitation using a specific goat anti-human apoA-1 antibody that does not cross-react with mouse apoA-1, as previously described (2Hayek T. Ito Y. Azrolan N. Verdery R.B. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The samples were then solubilized in non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol), placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and then applied to a 15% SDS-PAGE gel containing a 5% stacking gel(6Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Purified nonradioactive hapoA-1 (3 μg/lane) was mixed with each sample prior to electrophoresis for visual identification of bands. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then destained. The bands corresponding to hapoA-1 were excised and placed in 20-ml glass scintillation vials containing 0.5 ml each of water and solvable tissue and gel solubilizer (DuPont NEN). The vials were capped, incubated at 50°C for 18 h, and cooled to room temperature. 10 ml of Readysafe scintillation fluid (Beckman) were added, and the samples were counted.Preparation of Liver S10 ExtractsMice were fed either the HF/HC or LF/LC diet for 3 weeks. To prepare the S10 extracts, mice were sacrificed between 9 and 10 a.m. by cervical dislocation, and livers were quickly isolated and homogenized in 4 volumes of buffer (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1 mg/ml sodium heparin) using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman; Luzern, Switzerland) at setting 7 for 3 10-s bursts at 4°C. The livers from three mice were used for each experimental condition. The homogenate was then centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant (S10) was carefully separated and stored at −70°C.Sedimentation Velocity and Equilibrium Density AnalysesMouse liver S10 extracts were prepared as described above. Aliquots (0.5 ml) were thawed on ice and then overlayered onto linear 15-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients, and sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation analysis was then performed(7Chen X. Sparks J.D. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gradient fractions (850 μl each) were collected by upward displacement using a 75% (w/v) sucrose solution and collected in tubes containing SDS and sodium acetate. For the equilibrium density analyses, aliquots (150 μl) of mouse liver S10 extracts were mixed with 3.85 ml of 40% (w/v) metrizamide (Aldrich) solution containing 500 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The self-forming gradients were resolved by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 72.5 h at 4°C, and 0.5-ml fractions were carefully collected from the top. Fraction densities were determined as previously described(7Chen X. Sparks J.D. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the sucrose and metrizamide gradient fractions using acid phenol/chloroform(8Sparks J.D. Zolfaghari R. Sparks C. Smith H.C. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).mRNA Quantitation and Protein DeterminationmRNA levels were determined by either Northern blot analysis or by solution hybridization/RNase protection as previously described(8Sparks J.D. Zolfaghari R. Sparks C. Smith H.C. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Azrolan N. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes used for mRNA detection and quantification included a riboprobe specific to hapoA-1 mRNA that does not cross-hybridize to the endogenous mouse apoA-1 mRNA (3Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and a riboprobe specific to mouse β-actin prepared from pTri-β-actin/mouse (Ambion). Probes were prepared using the Ribomax T7 RNA transcription system reagents (Promega). Protein was determined using DC protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Statistical AnalysesThe unpaired Student's t test was employed to compare means of values between the different diets. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Where indicated, results are presented as mean ± S.D.RESULTSHuman apoA-1 transgenic mice were fed the HF/HC or the LF/LC chow diet for 3 weeks, and HDL-C and hapoA-1 levels were measured. The mice were males of the A-14 line that were 12-14 weeks old at the start of the experiment. As shown in Table 1, compared to the LF/LC diet, the HF/HC diet elevated HDL-C by 68%, hapoA-1 by 40% and mouse apoA-1 by 52%. Primary hepatocytes were prepared from hapoA-1 transgenic mice on the HF/HC or LF/LC diet, and the rate of secretion of hapoA-1 was assessed by measuring the time course of appearance of radiolabeled immunoprecipitable hapoA-1 in the culture medium. As shown in Fig. 1, hapoA-1 appearance was linear for 2 h, and the secretion rate was 40% greater (p < 0.01) from hepatocytes cultured from mice fed the HF/HC diet compared to the LF/LC diet. In contrast, the incorporation of radiolabel into total cellular and secreted protein, determined by precipitation using trichloroacetic acid and subsequent scintillation counting, was found to be similar between the two diet conditions (data not shown). Human apoA-1 mRNA levels were next quantified by a solution hybridization/RNase protection assay of total RNA isolated from whole liver and primary hepatocytes from mice fed either the HF/HC or LF/LC diets. As shown in Table 2, there was no significant difference between the two diet conditions in hapoA-1 mRNA levels in either whole liver or cultured hepatocytes. Interestingly, the relative abundance of hapoA-1 mRNA was significantly elevated in total RNA prepared from the primary hepatocyte cultures as compared to whole liver. However, this effect was not associated with the different diets used and therefore might be the result of a transcriptional enhancement of hapoA-1 gene expression previously observed when primary cultured hepatocytes were separated from non-parenchymal cells(10Rea T.J. Bisgaier C.L. DeMattos R.B. Pape M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1274-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diet also had no effect on hapoA-1 mRNA levels in the intestine, the only other site of hapoA-1 synthesis. These secretion and mRNA data support the contention that a HF/HC diet increases hapoA-1 levels and hepatic hapoA-1 synthesis at the post-transcriptional level and confirm our previous findings using the hapoA-1 transgenic mouse line 179, which expresses hapoA-1 only in the liver(2Hayek T. Ito Y. Azrolan N. Verdery R.B. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lack of differences in intestinal mRNA and the similar magnitude increase (40%) in hapoA-1 plasma levels and hepatocyte secretory output suggest that hepatic production is the primary determinant of the plasma differences, even in mice with the capacity to express the transgene in the intestine.Table I Open table in a new tab Table II Open table in a new tab To further explore the mechanism of the diet-induced increase in apoA-1 production, primary hepatocytes from hapoA-1 transgenic mice were incubated with 2 μg/ml BFA, which blocks transport of nascent proteins from the Golgi apparatus(11Orci L. Tagya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, after a 2-h incubation with radiolabel, BFA inhibited secretion of hapoA-1 from hepatocytes prepared from mice fed either diet by greater than 95%. Nevertheless, the accumulation of radiolabeled cellular hapoA-1 was 48% greater in hepatocytes from the mice fed the HF/HC diet compared to chow. This experiment localizes the diet-induced increase in liver apoA-1 production to a step prior to the exit of the newly synthesized protein from the Golgi apparatus. Since diet did not change steady-state hapoA-1 mRNA levels, the effect presumably occurs by either increasing translational efficiency (i.e. greater synthesis) or decreasing the degradation of newly synthesized protein.Figure 2:Effect of the high fat-high cholesterol diet on intracellular hapoA-1 accumulation in the presence of BFA. Primary hepatocytes were prepared from hapoA-1 transgenic mice that were fed either the low fat/low cholesterol (LF, openbars) or high fat-high cholesterol (HF, hatchedbars) diet. Cells were pretreated for 30 min and then incubated with [3H]leucine for 2 h in the presence of 2 μg/ml BFA. Secreted (Medium) and intracellular (Cell) hapoA-1 were immunoprecipitated and analyzed via SDS-PAGE/scintillation counting, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results represent the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine these possibilities, a pulse-chase experiment was performed. Primary hepatocytes were pulsed with label for 10 min, washed, and chased. As shown in Fig. 3, the peak incorporation of label into cellular hapoA-1 at the end of the labeling period was 39% greater (p < 0.01) in primary hepatocytes derived from transgenic mice fed the HF/HC diet compared to LF/LC. This was consistent with the increased secretion of newly synthesized hepatocyte hapoA-1 (see Fig. 1) and strongly suggested that increased hapoA-1 synthesis, underlying this enhanced secretion, is not an artifact of reutilization of label induced by diet. The disappearance of cellular hapoA-1 following the synthesis peak was apparently different with the two diet conditions when the slopes of log-transformed cell data were examined (data not shown). This might result from either an up-regulated degradative pathway in the low fat and/or an enhanced secretion in the high fat condition. To explore these possibilities, the recovery of total labeled hapoA-1 was calculated by adding together the radioactivity (dpm) of both cellular and medium immunoprecipitable hapoA-1 protein, as resolved by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3B, the rate of disappearance of total hapoA-1 was similar between the two diet conditions. The calculated half-lives were therefore also of comparable values (117 min for high fat and 128 min for low fat). Thus, there is no apparent difference in the degradative pathway for hapoA-1 between the two diet conditions. Interestingly, the data in Fig. 3B also suggests that about 50% of the hapoA-1 protein is degraded and that this is unaffected by diet. This degradation might occur prior to the secretion of the newly synthesized protein or possibly upon re-uptake of secreted hapoA-1 from the medium. Since the rate of accumulation of labeled hapoA-1 was linear for the entire labeling period (see Fig. 1), this degradation probably occurs prior to secretion. Together, these results clearly show that consumption of a HF/HC diet causes a specific increase in the rate of hepatic hapoA-1 synthesis and secretion, with no effect on its degradation.Figure 3:Pulse-chase analysis of hapoA-1 synthesis and degradation in primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes prepared from hapoA-1 transgenic mice (line A-14) fed either the high fat-high cholesterol (HF) or low fat/low cholesterol (LF) diet. Hepatocytes were incubated 10 min with serum- and leucine-free MEM containing [3H]leucine (200 μCi/ml) and then washed and incubated with MEM containing excess (400 mM) cold leucine. Incorporation of [3H]leucine into cellular hapoA-1 was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The recovery of total (cellular plus medium) labeled hapoA-1 is shown in B (solidline, high fat; dashedline, low fat). The t½ was calculated using the equation t½ = (log 2)/(-slope). The t½ for labeled total hapoA-1 for the high and low fat conditions were not significantly different (p > 0.05; 117 ± 14 and 128 ± 15 min, respectively). Data represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. These experiments were repeated twice, with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increased hapoA-1 synthesis without a change in mRNA levels localizes the diet effect to an increase in the efficiency with which the hapoA-1 message is translated. This could be due to increased fractional entry of hapoA-1 mRNA into the polysome pool and/or an increased rate of translation initiation or elongation of the translated product. The former would be reflected in an increase in the fraction of hapoA-1 mRNA associated with polyribosomes versus ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), and the latter with alteration in the size of the polyribosomal complex reflecting a change in the number of ribosomes per hapoA-1 mRNA. To explore these possibilities, liver S10 extracts prepared from transgenic mice fed HF/HC and LF/LC diets were compared using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. As shown in Fig. 4A, the distribution of total RNA on the sucrose density gradient was similar with extracts from transgenic mice fed both types of diets. Based on previous studies(7Chen X. Sparks J.D. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nelson E.M. Winkler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11501-11506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was inferred that fractions 1-3 contained unassembled ribosomal subunits and non-ribosome-associated mRNA (mRNPs), whereas fractions 4-15 contained the translating polysomal complexes with the lower numbered, less dense, fractions containing fewer ribosomes per mRNA than the higher numbered, more dense fractions. Northern blot analysis, shown in Fig. 4B, revealed similar distributions of hapoA-1 mRNA among the polysomal fractions (fractions 4-15) in liver S10 extracts from mice fed either diet. This showed that diet did not influence the average number of ribosomes per hapoA-1 message. The visual impression of these Northern blots might be misleading, since the hapoA-1 signal in the polysomal fractions of the LF/LC diet-fed mice appears to be markedly lower than the HF/HC, although the RNase protection assays of total RNA indicated that the two diet groups were similar (Table 2). However, it appeared that the relative amount of hapoA-1 mRNA in the polysomal fractions of the gradient compared to mouse β-actin mRNA was increased approximately 31% as a result of consuming the HF/HC diet, as shown in Fig. 4C. This could suggest two sub-pools of hapoA-1 mRNA: (a) one not being translated (i.e. as an mRNP) and (b) one associated with polysomes that undergoes normal rates of initiation and elongation. Dietary fat, though not affecting the total pool size of hapoA-1 mRNA, as shown below, changes the distribution of the hapoA-1 mRNA between these two sub-pools. Sucrose gradients do not well resolve mRNPs from monosomes and ribosome subunits; therefore, liver S10 extracts were also fractionated by metrizamide equilibrium gradient ultracentrifugation, which provides a clearer resolution of non-ribosomal from ribosomal associated forms of mRNA(9Azrolan N. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, solution hybridization/RNase protection quantitation of each fraction revealed hapoA-1 mRNA principally in the non-ribosomal lower density fractions 3 and 4 (densities 1.16 and 1.19 g/ml, respectively) and the ribosomal higher density fractions 6 and 7 (densities 1.21 and 1.29 g/ml, respectively). As predicted from earlier experiments (Table 2), the total amount of hapoA-1 mRNA in all the fractions was not changed by diet. However, on the HF/HC diet the percentage of hapoA-1 mRNA in the ribosomal fractions increased to 89%, and the percentage in the non-ribosomal fractions decreased to 8% compared to 72 and 23%, respectively, on the LF/LC (Fig. 5A and leftpanel in B). To confirm these observations, the same experiment was also performed with the previously studied 179 line that synthesizes hapoA-1 only in the liver. As shown in Fig. 5B (rightpanel), similar results were obtained. In these experiments, to show that the dietary influence on the distribution of hapoA-1 mRNA was relatively specific, the distribution of mouse β-actin mRNA was studied, and no diet"
https://openalex.org/W1997457202,"The recombinant rat branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase has been amplified from rat kidney cDNA, based on the previously reported rat cDNA sequence (Popov, K. M., Zhao, Y., Shimomura, Y., Kuntz, M. J., and Harris, R. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13127-13130). This kinase was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with bacterial maltose-binding protein (MBP). Expression was improved by overexpression of chaperonins GroEL and GroES. The MBP-kinase, when reconstituted with lipoylated recombinant E2 (dihydrolipoyl transacylase), catalyzed phosphorylation of recombinant E1 (branched-chain alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase) with a kcat of 28.5 nmol of phosphate/min/nmol of MBP-kinase at 25 degrees C. Recombinant MBP-kinase alone demonstrated a slow rate of autophosphorylation with a kcat of 3.25 pmol of phosphate/min/nmol of kinase at 25 degrees C. Serine 22 of the kinase was identified as the possible site of autophosphorylation by Edman microsequencing analysis. Autophosphorylated kinase cannot transfer phosphate to E1, indicating that autophosphorylation of kinase is not an intermediate in ATP-dependent phosphorylation of E1. Therefore, despite the reported sequence similarity to prokaryotic histidine protein kinases, the mitochondrial rat branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase apparently does not phosphorylate E1 via a histidine-mediated phosphotransfer reaction. Significant corrections to the published cDNA sequence of rat branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase are included."

https://openalex.org/W2051206485,"We have used the in vitro motility assay to investigate the effect of caldesmon on the movement of actin-tropomyosin filaments over thiophosphorylated smooth muscle myosin and skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin. Using either motor, incorporation of up to 8 nM caldesmon inhibited filament movement by decreasing the proportion of filaments motile from >85% to <30%. There was a minimal effect on filament attachment and a modest decrease in motile filament velocity in this concentration range. The reduction in the proportion of filaments motile could be completely reversed by incorporation of an excess of calmodulin at pCa 4.5. The expressed C-terminal fragment, 606C, which retains caldesmon's inhibitory capacity but does not bind to myosin, decreased the proportion of filaments motile but had no effect on velocity. We conclude that the velocity reduction by whole caldesmon is due to actin-myosin cross-linking. A significant decrease in filament attachment was observed when caldesmon was added to an excess over actin (>10 nM). In the absence of tropomyosin, addition of an excess of caldesmon caused a similar decrease in the filament density, but there was no effect on the proportion of filaments that were motile. Our results demonstrate that caldesmon can switch actin-tropomyosin from motile to non-motile states without controlling velocity of movement or weak binding affinity and show the inhibitory action of caldesmon in the motility assay to be functionally indistinguishable from that reported for troponin.

Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which caldesmon controls the smooth muscle thin filament has been closely studied. Caldesmon can inhibit the actin-activated ATPase by competitive blocking of the myosin•ADP•Pi“weak” interaction with actin, and this has been proposed as a means of regulation(12Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1878-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chalovich J.M. Hemric M.E. Velaz L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This, however, would require a stoichiometry of 1 caldesmon:1 actin, which would be incompatible with the ratio of caldesmon to actin in the contractile domain of the smooth muscle cell and in native thin filaments(14Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16796-16800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol.

In the presence of smooth muscle tropomyosin, caldesmon can inhibit the ATPase activity at much lower caldesmon:actin ratios(7Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16796-16800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12317-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, caldesmon is proposed to act as an allosteric effector, switching the thin filament between “on” and “off” states in much the same way as troponin does in striated muscles(15Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12317-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32104-32109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro motility assay, developed by Kron and Spudich (18Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), provides an ideal method to investigate the regulation of individual thin filaments, and several workers have studied the effect of caldesmon. Okagaki et al.(19Okagaki T. Higahi-Fujime S. Ishikawa R. Takano-Ohmuro H. Kohama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) incorporated caldesmon by pre-mixing with actin and tropomyosin and found that the average velocity of filaments taken over a 20-s period was progressively reduced by increasing caldesmon up to a 5-fold excess over actin. Shirinsky et al.(20Shirinsky V. Biryukov K.G. Hettasch J.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a similar caldesmon:actin ratio, also noted a decrease in filament velocity. They infused caldesmon and tropomyosin into the assay cell after the labeled actin. They also noted that the proportion of stationary filaments was increased and that “apparent” filament velocity could be decreased by erratic “stop-start” movement. Haeberle et al.(21Haeberle J.R. Trybus K.M. Hemric M.E. Warshaw D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23001-23006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), working at a higher ionic strength, infused caldesmon up to a 100-fold excess over actin and noted no effect on the velocity of continuously motile actin filaments. Their selective analysis, however, excluded filaments exhibiting “stop-start” motion, which is likely to have contributed to the velocity reduction observed in the other studies. Recently, we analyzed troponin control of actin-tropomyosin filament motility and found that troponin, in the absence of Ca2+, reduced the proportion of filaments that were motile without changing the velocity or the number of filaments attached to the myosin(22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since the disagreement in the results with caldesmon appears to be due to the various methods of selective analysis, we have investigated the control of thin filament motility by caldesmon using the criteria established in our study of troponin. 1) Data are only collected from experiments where at least 80% of filaments are motile in control assays. 2) Filaments are randomly selected for tracking prior to analysis to avoid any bias in the collection of data. 3) A complete analysis of filament movement is carried out on a frame-to-frame basis. This involves determination of the proportion of non-motile filaments, the velocity of motile filaments, and the average number of filaments attached to the immobilized motor. On this basis, we have carried out a detailed analysis of our assays to determine a mechanism by which caldesmon controls actin-tropomyosin filament movement over thiophosphorylated smooth muscle myosin and skeletal muscle HMM. 1The abbreviations used are: HMMheavy meromyosin×rhodamine-phalloidinATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). In both cases, low concentrations of caldesmon primarily decreased the proportion of filaments that were motile without significantly affecting the filament density. A modest decrease in the filament velocity mediated by whole caldesmon was not observed when using an expressed fragment (606C) comprising the C-terminal 150 amino acids of caldesmon, which does not bind myosin. The reduction in the proportion of filaments motile by caldesmon was fully reversed by an excess of calmodulin at pCa 4.5. heavy meromyosin rhodamine-phalloidin adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin and chicken gizzard smooth muscle tropomyosin, caldesmon, and crude myosin were prepared by published methods(7Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle HMM was prepared from myosin, and skeletal muscle f-actin was labeled with rhodamine phalloidin (×) as described by Kron et al.(24Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The recombinant caldesmon fragment 606C was prepared by expression in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described(25Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin from bovine brain was prepared according to (26Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Crude smooth muscle myosin (3 mg/ml), containing endogenous myosin light chain kinase, was thiophosphorylated by incubation with 0.3 μM calmodulin and 1 mM ATPγS in 60 mM KCl, 25 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol at 25°C for 20 min. Actin•×•tropomyosin and actin•×•tropomyosin•caldesmon complexes were mixed at 10× assay concentration for 30-60 min and diluted immediately prior to infusion into the assay cell as previously described(22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Final assay concentrations for f-actin•× and smooth muscle tropomyosin were 10 and 40 nM, respectively. Thiophosphorylated smooth muscle myosin and skeletal muscle HMM were pre-treated to minimize the presence of “rigor heads” as previously described(22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out using coverslips coated with silicone by soaking in 0.2% dichloromethylsilane in chloroform. A flow cell was prepared from a freshly siliconized coverslip and a microscope slide as described by Kron et al.(24Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Assay components and buffers were infused into the flow cell at 30-60-s intervals. Two 50-μl aliquots of skeletal muscle HMM at 100 μg/ml were infused in buffer A (50 mM KCl, 25 mM imidazole-HCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) to provide a coating of immobilized HMM on the coverslip. This was followed by 2 × 50 μl of buffer B (A + 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) then 2 × 50 μl of 10 nM actin•×± associated tropomyosin-caldesmon in buffer A. 50 μl of buffer C (B + 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.5% methylcellulose ± caldesmon at assay concentration) and 50 μl of buffer D (C + 1 mM ATP) were then infused. Smooth muscle myosin was infused into the assay cell in monomeric form in 300 mM KCl, and this KCl concentration was maintained for the wash with bovine serum albumin containing buffer (buffer B). Otherwise, the assay procedure was as described above for skeletal muscle HMM. The rhodamine fluorescence of actin•× filaments was observed using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (63/1.25 objective) with a DAGE-SIT-68 camera and recorded on video tape. Sequences of video images were digitized through a frame grabber, installed on a Macintosh IIci computer, at 0.65-s (skeletal HMM) or 3.65-s (smooth myosin) intervals. The movement of actin•× filaments was analyzed, and the density of filaments attached to the immobilized substrate was determined as previously described(22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Data were only collected from assay cells in which at least 80% of actin•× or actin•×•tropomyosin filaments were motile. The potentiating effect of smooth muscle tropomyosin on the actin-activated myosin ATPase is well documented(27Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2070-2072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that introducing tropomyosin into the assay at 0.085 ionic strength, 28°C, increased the velocity of actin filaments over skeletal muscle HMM as shown by Umemoto and Sellers(29Umemoto S. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14864-14869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We noted, however, that the method of introduction was important. If tropomyosin was simply infused into the assay cell after the actin filaments, the level of velocity potentiation at increasing tropomyosin concentrations was inconsistent. If, however, we pre-mixed the actin and tropomyosin at 10× assay concentrations and diluted the proteins prior to use, the filament velocity increased in a regular manner with increasing tropomyosin concentration (Fig. 1). We chose 40 nM tropomyosin as a control concentration for subsequent assays, and binding of tropomyosin to actin at this concentration is directly demonstrated by cosedimentation and SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1, inset). Using thiophosphorylated smooth myosin, incorporation of 40 nM tropomyosin at 28°C increased the velocity of actin filaments from 0.54 to 0.71 μm/s. Caldesmon was introduced into the motility assay as described by pre-mixing with actin and tropomyosin. On observation of assays with increasing caldesmon concentration, it was clear that the principal effect of caldesmon was to increase the proportion of stationary actin-tropomyosin filaments. To analyze this quantitatively, we collected sequences of 11 video images at 0.65-s intervals from each assay. To avoid bias in selection of filaments for analysis, we chose 10 filaments at random from a printout of the first image prior to tracking. Fig. 2 shows the tracks of filaments at increasing caldesmon concentrations. It is clear from the tracks that have less than 11 “points” that filaments have an increased tendency to exhibit “stop-start” motion in the presence of caldesmon. This would result in an apparent decrease in velocity for these filaments if we calculated velocity purely from displacement over an 11-frame sequence. To avoid this false interpretation, we measured the 10 individual frame-to-frame velocities for each filament. From these data, it was clear that there were two populations of filaments: one with zero velocity, which we classified as non-motile, and another with velocities of 3.5-5 μm/s, which we classified as motile. Instances where filaments stopped or started between frames of the tracking sequence typically comprised 5-10% of total data points in the presence of caldesmon. This could give an intermediate velocity for that step; however, when we left out these data points, there was no significant difference in the average motile filament velocity. Fig. 3A demonstrates that the proportion of filaments that were motile decreases sharply with increasing caldesmon concentration. We also determined the velocity of motile filaments and the average number of filaments attached to the immobilized HMM. Fig. 3B demonstrates that there is a gradual decrease in velocity from 4.9 to 3.7 μm/s, but filament density shows little change over the range of caldesmon concentrations required to reduce the proportion of filaments motile to 20% (Fig. 3A). Filament density is seen to decline at the higher caldesmon concentrations. Ca2+-calmodulin was introduced into the assay to determine its effect on the actin-tropomyosin-caldesmon filaments. Using 10 nM actin, 40 nM tropomyosin, and 6 nM caldesmon, increasing calmodulin concentrations from 20 to 120 nM were investigated. Fig. 3, C and D, shows the only effect of Ca2+-calmodulin was to increase the proportion of filaments motile from 25.5 to 83.5% with no effect on the number of filaments attached to the HMM or the velocity of motile filaments. Addition of 120 nM calmodulin at low Ca2+ (pCa 9.0) had no effect on the motile proportion, velocity, or density of filaments (Fig. 3C). It has been shown previously that the inhibitory properties of caldesmon are located in the C-terminal region, represented by the 20-kDa fragment (30Szpacenko A. Dabrowska R. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Leszyk J. Mornet D. Audemard E. Collins J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or the expressed recombinant, 606C, comprising the C-terminal 150 amino acids(606-756) of chicken gizzard caldesmon (25Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the motility assay, incorporation of up to 200 nM 606C reduced the proportion of filaments motile from 84.5 to 22.3% with little or no effect on filament density (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the slight velocity reduction seen with whole caldesmon, 606C had no appreciable effect on the velocity of motile filaments (Fig. 4B). Further experiments were carried out using caldesmon pre-mixed with actin in the absence of tropomyosin. The same concentration range of 2-15 nM caldesmon had minimal effect on the proportion of filaments motile or the velocity of motile filaments (Fig. 5, A and B). The filament density, however, was constant with addition of up to 6 nM caldesmon (Fig. 5A) before declining at higher caldesmon concentrations in much the same way as observed in the corresponding experiments where tropomyosin was present. Motility assays were also carried out using smooth muscle myosin as the immobilized motor. The effect of caldesmon on filament motility is shown in Fig. 6, A and B. As observed using skeletal muscle HMM, the primary action of caldesmon was to reduce the proportion of filaments motile from 85.8 to 13.5% with minimal effect on the filament density at the lower caldesmon concentrations (Fig. 6A). Similarly, there was a gradual reduction in the velocity of motile filaments from 0.67 to 0.41 μm/s (Fig. 6B). Incorporating the C-terminal fragment 606C also gave a significant reduction in the proportion of filaments motile but no effect on motile filament velocity (Fig. 6, C and D). Filament density was again constant with addition of up to 200 nM 606C before declining at the highest 606C concentration of 300 nM (Fig. 6C). When tropomyosin was absent, the proportion of filaments motile and the velocity of motile filaments were not significantly reduced by caldesmon. The filament density was constant up to 6 nM caldesmon before declining at the highest caldesmon concentrations (data not shown). We have used the in vitro motility assay to determine how caldesmon may inhibit contractility in the smooth muscle cell. Other studies have addressed the question, but the methods of introduction of caldesmon into the assay have varied, as have the assay conditions and the concentrations of caldesmon used(19Okagaki T. Higahi-Fujime S. Ishikawa R. Takano-Ohmuro H. Kohama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Shirinsky V. Biryukov K.G. Hettasch J.M. Sellers J.R. J.

In a recent study with troponin(22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we found the most consistent method, when incorporating thin filament proteins into the assay, was to pre-mix at 10× assay concentrations and then dilute immediately prior to use. This presumably improves the binding efficiency at the very low concentrations employed in the assay. We also found it was important to analyze filaments chosen at random and to determine velocity over a short “frame-to-frame” time scale, since filaments could stop and start during the assay. We have used the same techniques to study the effect of low concentrations of caldesmon on the motility of actin-tropomyosin filaments. Using either skeletal muscle HMM or thiophosphorylated smooth muscle myosin as the immobilized motor, incorporation of up to 6 nM caldesmon sharply reduced the proportion of actin-tropomyosin filaments motile. As there was no significant effect on the density of filaments attached and only a modest effect on filament velocity in this concentration range, it would appear that caldesmon reduces the proportion of actin-tropomyosin filaments that are motile in much the same way as observed with troponin(22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Examination of the data of Shirinsky et al.(20Shirinsky V. Biryukov K.G. Hettasch J.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Haeberle et al.(21Haeberle J.R. Trybus K.M. Hemric M.E. Warshaw D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23001-23006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Horiuchi and Chacko (32Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Muscle. Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicates that similar effects have been observed before, but their significance has not been recognized. It is widely accepted that the inhibitory effect of caldesmon is reversed by Ca2+-calmodulin in vitro(7Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is therefore significant to note the effect of Ca2+-calmodulin on the motility of actin-tropomyosin-caldesmon filaments in the motility assay. Increasing calmodulin concentrations at pCa 4.5 had no effect on the velocity of motile filaments or the filament density, but a 20-fold excess of calmodulin over caldesmon completely reversed the reduction in the proportion of filaments motile back to the level observed with actin-tropomyosin alone. This indicates that the reduction in % motility was the principal mechanism of the inhibition mediated by caldesmon. Caldesmon was effective at low concentrations, indicating an apparent affinity of >108M−1 in the presence of tropomyosin. This corresponds to the high affinity-low stoichiometry, tropomyosin-dependent component of caldesmon binding to actin-tropomyosin, first demonstrated by Smith et al.(7) (Kd∼108M−1) and subsequently by others(25Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Moody C.J. Marston S.B. Smith C.W. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments carried out with the C-terminal fragment, 606C, provide additional information. This fragment contains residues 606-756 of chicken gizzard caldesmon and is a tropomyosin-dependent, Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated inhibitor of the actomyosin ATPase(25Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike whole caldesmon, 606C does not bind to myosin. In our assays with skeletal HMM and smooth myosin, 606C reduced the proportion of filaments motile without displacing them from the motor until the highest concentrations, in much the same way as whole caldesmon. This demonstrates that the increase in non-motility observed with whole caldesmon is not due to filaments being displaced from myosin and then “tethered” through caldesmon's joint interaction with actin and myosin. The decrease in the velocity of motile filaments seen using whole caldesmon is not observed using 606C. This shows that the velocity reduction is due to the N-terminal myosin binding site of caldesmon imposing a mechanical load on motile filaments, as proposed by Shirinsky et al.(20Shirinsky V. Biryukov K.G. Hettasch J.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and more recently by Horiuchi and Chacko(32Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Muscle. Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is further supported by our assays that show a more significant velocity reduction when using smooth muscle myosin as the immobilized motor, due to its stronger interaction with caldesmon(35Marston S.B. Pinter K. Bennett P.M. J. Musc. Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent to which velocity is reduced by caldesmon would consequently be dependent on ionic strength, as the interaction of caldesmon's N terminus with myosin has been shown to be salt dependent(36Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bogatcheva N.V. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Shirinsky V.P. Gusev N.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is not surprising therefore that the velocity reduction observed by Shirinsky et al.(20Shirinsky V. Biryukov K.G. Hettasch J.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 25 mM KCl is more significant than we observe using 50 mM KCl, where the caldesmon-myosin interaction is weaker, while at 80 mM KCl, Haeberle et al.(21Haeberle J.R. Trybus K.M. Hemric M.E. Warshaw D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23001-23006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observe no significant effect on velocity from added caldesmon. Inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase by low concentrations of caldesmon has been shown to be highly dependent on smooth muscle tropomyosin(7Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12317-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed a similar tropomyosin dependence in our assays in caldesmon's ability to “switch off” motile filaments, where, in the absence of tropomyosin, up to 15 nM caldesmon had little effect on the proportion of filaments motile. The filament density, however, began to gradually decrease at the higher caldesmon concentrations in the presence or absence of tropomyosin. This demonstrates that direct displacement of actin filaments from myosin is a tropomyosin-independent phenomenon, most evident when caldesmon is present in a molar excess over actin. This effect was also reported by Haeberle et al.(21Haeberle J.R. Trybus K.M. Hemric M.E. Warshaw D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23001-23006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when complete filament displacement was observed on addition of a C-terminal fragment of caldesmon to a 240-fold excess over actin. The effect of caldesmon observed in the motility assay can be used to gain insight into how caldesmon may operate to regulate the smooth muscle thin filament in vivo. The “power stroke” in muscle contraction is dependent on the transition from a weak binding complex between actin and myosin to a strong binding complex with subsequent release of ADP and Pi(38Rayment I. Holden H. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 129-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Lehrer S.S. J. Musc. Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Chalovich J.M. Yu L.C. Brenner B. J. Musc. Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As low concentrations of caldesmon can switch off actin-tropomyosin filaments without dissociating them from myosin, it would appear that inhibited filaments remain bound to the immobilized HMM•ADP•Pi via weak interactions. Displacement of the thin filaments from HMM•ADP•Pi is independent of tropomyosin and is observed at higher caldesmon concentrations when there is a sufficient number of caldesmon molecules to bind to every actin monomer(15Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12317-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is unlikely to occur in vivo, as there is only one caldesmon for every 14 actin monomers in the smooth muscle thin filament(11Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12317-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Caldesmon therefore switches off actin filaments by acting on tropomyosin to block the strong binding myosin complexes, as recently proposed from solution experiments(17Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32104-32109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that caldesmon controls actin-tropomyosin filaments as a cooperative unit in smooth muscle.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), demonstrating an analogous control mechanism with troponin, show that the two proteins have important similarities in function and in mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2050241802,"Activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably expressing the human m3 subtype leads to stimulation of both phospholipase C (PLC) and D (PLD). mAChR-stimulated PLD was turned off after 2 min of receptor activation with either the full (carbachol) or partial agonist (pilocarpine) and remained completely suppressed for at least 4 h. Partial recovery was observed 24 h after agonist removal. This rapid arrest of PLD response was not due to a loss of cell surface receptors and was also not caused by negative feedback due to concomitant activation of protein kinase C, tyrosine phosphorylation, increase in cytosolic calcium, or activation of Gi proteins. Furthermore, PLD stimulation by directly activated protein kinase C and GTP-binding proteins was unaltered in carbachol-pretreated cells. Finally, neither prevention of PLD stimulation during carbachol pretreatment by genistein nor inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide, added before or after carbachol challenge, resulted in recovery of mAChR-stimulated PLD. The short term carbachol pretreatment nearly completely abolished agonist-induced binding of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) to membranes or permeabilized adherent cells. Full recovery of this response was achieved after 4 h. Similar to transfected m3 mAChR, PLD stimulation by endogenously expressed purinergic receptors was also fully blunted after 2 min of agonist (ATP) treatment. Preexposure of HEK cells to either receptor agonist partially, but not completely, reduced PLD stimulation by the other agonist. In contrast to desensitization of PLD stimulation, 2 min of carbachol treatment led to a sensitization, by up to 2-fold, of mAChR-stimulated inositol phosphate formation. This supersensitivity was also observed with pilocarpine, which acted as a full agonist on PLC. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the m3 mAChR stimulates PLD and PLC in HEK cells with distinct efficiencies and with very distinct durations of each response. The rapid and long lasting desensitization of the PLD response is apparently not due to a loss of cell surface receptors or PLD activation by GTP-binding proteins, but it may involve, at least initially, an uncoupling of receptors from GTP-binding proteins and most likely a loss of an as yet undefined essential transducing component.

In recent years, activation of PLD has been demonstrated for a variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors, including those that act on receptors that possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity as well as those acting on receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins(3Billah M.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Thompson N.T. Garland L.G. Bonser R.W. Adv.

PLD preferentially hydrolyzes the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, resulting in the formation of phosphatidic acid and choline. Phosphatidic acid may act as an intracellular signaling agent by itself(6Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 135-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 7Fukami K. Takenawa T. J.

Upon deacylation and dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid, respectively, the extra- and/or intracellular signaling molecules, lysophophatidic acid, and diacylglycerol are formed. Lysophosphatidic acid apparently stimulates cells via a distinct cell surface receptor coupled to G proteins(8Van Corven E.J. Van Rijswijk A. Jalink K. Van Der Bend R.L. Blitterswijk W.J.

Receptor coupling mechanisms to PLC enzymes have been recently elucidated in great detail. While tyrosine kinase-linked receptors apparently phosphorylate and thereby activate distinct PLC isozymes (PLCγ), receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins activate PLCβ isozymes by either GTP-activated α subunits (αq/11) or free βγ dimers (for reviews, see Refs. 12Rhee S.G.

Much less clear are the mechanisms that couple receptors to PLD. For the G protein-coupled receptors, it can be hypothesized that G proteins are involved, although direct interaction of PLD with heterotrimeric G proteins or G protein subunits has as yet not been demonstrated. Recently, evidence has been provided that small molecular weight G proteins, ADP-ribosylation factors, and Rho proteins, can stimulate PLD in cell-free preparations(14Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J.

The human m3 mAChR, stably expressed in HEK cells, interacts with both PTX-insensitive Gq/11 and PTX-sensitive Gi proteins in these cells(18Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor activation causes efficient stimulation of both PLC and PLD in a PTX-insensitive manner(18Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sandmann J. Peralta E.G. Wurtman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that PLD can be stimulated in HEK cells by various mechanisms, apparently involving protein kinase C, calcium-dependent events as well as tyrosine phosphorylation, and that the coupling of m3 mAChR to PLD is largely independent of concomitant PLC activation but rather involves a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism(20Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). During these studies, we noted that, in contrast to PLC activation, mAChR-stimulated PLD apparently rapidly decays(20Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that short term agonist treatment persistently desensitizes m3 mAChR-stimulated PLD, whereas the receptor-induced stimulation of PLC is sensitized. The long lasting loss of the PLD response is not due to receptor internalization or loss of PLD activity, but it seems to be due to a loss of an as yet undefined essential transducing component. ATP, GTPγS, staurosporine, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. DMEM/F-12 growth medium, fetal calf serum, and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc. Streptomycin, poly D-lysine, and penicillin G were from Seromed. Digitonin (99% pure) was from E. Merck. Carbachol, pilocarpine, PMA, atropine, benzamidine, leupeptin, cycloheximide, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. BAPTA/AM and genistein were from Calbiochem. PTX was from List Biological Laboratories. [9,10-3H]Oleic acid (10 Ci/mmol), myo-[2-3H]inositol (24.4 Ci/mmol), [3H]NMS (79.5 Ci/mmol), and [35S]GTPγS (1344 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Nitrocellulose filters were from Amersham Corp. HEK cells stably expressing the human m3 mAChR at a density of about 200,000 receptors/cell (21Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown in culture dishes precoated with poly D-lysine (>300 kDa; 0.05-0.1 mg/dish). Stocks of the transfected cells were maintained in the presence of G418 (0.5 mg/ml). For experiments, cells were subcultured in DMEM/F-12 medium lacking G418 and grown to near confluence (175-cm2 culture flasks or 35-mm culture dishes). For measurement of intact cell PLD and PLC activities, cellular phospholipids were labeled by incubating nearly confluent monolayers of cells for 20-24 h with [3H]oleic acid (2-2.5 μCi/ml) and myo-[3H]inositol (1.25 μCi/ml), respectively, in growth medium. In [3H]oleic acid-prelabeled cells, the radioactivity associated with the phospholipids was between 7.5 and 10 × 105 cpm/dish. For PTX treatment, the cells were incubated during the last 16 h of the labeling period with 100 ng/ml PTX. After the labeling period, the cells were equilibrated twice for 10 min at 37°C in HBSS, containing 118 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mMD-glucose, buffered at pH 7.4 with 15 mM HEPES. For desensitization experiments, prelabeled cells were treated for 2 min with agonist in HBSS and then washed twice with HBSS. Then, carbachol or other stimulatory agents were added in the presence of ethanol (400 mM) for the indicated periods of time to measure [3H]PtdEtOH accumulation. LiCl (10 mM) was added 10 min before the stimulatory agents when myo-[3H]inositol phosphate formation was monitored. When effects of protein kinase inhibitors or the calcium chelator BAPTA/AM were studied, they were added 30 min before carbachol. The reactions performed at 37°C were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold methanol to the dishes. The cells were scraped off from the dishes, and the phospholipids and inositol phosphates were extracted and analyzed as described previously(20Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry, with a counting efficiency of about 40%. Protein levels were measured by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) in separate culture dishes. All experiments were performed in triplicate culture dishes and repeated as indicated. Formation of [3H]PtdEtOH is expressed as percentage of total phospholipids. [3H]Inositol phosphate formation is normalized for protein content and is given as cpm/mg of protein. Prior to permeabilization, [3H]oleic acid-prelabeled (2 μCi/ml) cells were treated for 2 min with or without 1 mM carbachol followed by two washing steps with HBSS. Thereafter, the cells were detached from the culture flasks, resuspended in DMEM/F-12 medium without serum, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 6.5 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4). After recentrifugation and resuspension in buffer A, containing 135 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1.5 mM CaCl2 (corresponding to 40 nM free Ca2+), 5.6 mMD-glucose, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, at a cell concentration of about 1 × 107 cells/ml, the assay of PLD activity was carried out for 30 min at 37°C in a total volume of 200 μl, containing 100 μl of the cell suspension (0.5-1 × 106 cells), 8 μM digitonin, and 300 mM ethanol as well as the test agents(20Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 1 ml of H2O. [3H]PtdEtOH formed was analyzed as described above. HEK cells on 35-mm tissue culture dishes were pretreated for 2 min with or without 1 mM carbachol, followed by two washing steps with ice-cold HBSS. Thereafter, cell surface mAChRs were measured by binding of the membrane-impermeant mAChR antagonist, [3H]NMS (2 nM), in HBSS in a total volume of 1 ml for 4 h at 4°C, by which time binding equilibrium was reached(23Van Koppen C.J. Sell A. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Bound and free ligand were separated by rapidly washing the cells in ice-cold HBSS. The cells were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and scraped into scintillation vials to measure radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μM atropine and amounted to 5% of total binding. mAChR binding is expressed as pmol of [3H]NMS bound per culture dish. HEK cells pretreated or not with carbachol were detached from the culture flasks, pelleted, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, recentrifuged, and resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 250 mM sucrose, 3 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The cells were homogenized by nitrogen cavitation and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. Crude membranes were prepared from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation for 60 min at 50,000 × g. The membranes were suspended in buffer B, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −80°C. Binding of GTPγS was performed in a total volume of 100 μl containing 0.2 nM [35S]GTPγS, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, and the indicated additions at 30°C as described before(18Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of membranes (5 μg of protein/tube) to the temperature-equilibrated reaction mixture. The incubation was terminated after 60 min by the addition of 2.5 ml of ice-cold buffer C containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Separation of membrane-bound and free radioactivity was performed by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C). The filters were washed 4 times with 2.5 ml of buffer C and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding not competed for by 10 μM unlabeled GTPγS. The data were normalized for protein content and are presented as pmol of GTPγS bound per mg of protein. Culture dishes with a confluent cell layer (about 750,000 cells/dish) were kept for 10 min at 37°C in DMEM/F-12 growth medium for equilibration. Then, the cells were incubated in medium for 2 min with or without 1 mM carbachol, followed by two washing steps with medium. The medium was then removed and replaced by 1 ml of buffer D containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 10 μM digitonin, and 50 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4. After 15 min, binding of GTPγS to permeabilized adherent HEK cells was initiated by replacing buffer D with fresh buffer D, containing in addition 10 nM [35S]GTPγS (0.1 μCi) with or without 1 mM carbachol, and continued for 10 min at 37°C as described previously(24Wieland T. Liedel K. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Then, the buffer was removed and replaced by 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer C. Cells were scraped off, and the suspension was rapidly filtered through nitrocellulose filters. The dish was additionally washed with 0.5 ml of buffer C, also passed through the filters. The filters were washed 4 times with 2.5 ml of ice-cold buffer C and counted in a liquid spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding not competed for by 10 μM unlabeled GTPγS. The data are presented as fmol of GTPγS bound per mg of protein. In HEK cells stably expressing the human m3 mAChR, the mAChR agonist carbachol causes a marked activation of PLD measured as accumulation of its transphosphatidylation product, PtdEtOH(18Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sandmann J. Peralta E.G. Wurtman R.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, maximal levels of labeled PtdEtOH were obtained already after 2 min of incubation with carbachol (1 mM), followed by a stable plateau up to at least 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1). The very rapid cessation of carbachol-induced PtdEtOH formation was not due to the activation with a supramaximally effective agonist concentration (1 mM). An identical time course of [3H]PtdEtOH formation, although at a lower level, was obtained when the cells were treated with carbachol at a half-maximally effective concentration (3 μM) (Fig. 1). To study whether the observed PLD desensitization is the result of a negative feedback by carbachol-induced increase in cytoplasmic calcium, activation of protein kinase C, or tyrosine phosphorylation, the cells were pretreated with 20 μM BAPTA/AM, a condition completely preventing carbachol-induced increase in cytosolic calcium, 0.1 μM staurosporine, inhibiting PMA (0.1 μM) induced PLD activation by more than 90%, or with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (10 μM), causing about half-maximal inhibition of carbachol-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in HEK cells(20Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2, none of these pretreatments had any effect on the shape of the time course of carbachol-induced PtdEtOH formation, although under all of these conditions mAChR-stimulated PLD was reduced by 50-60%. The BAPTA/AM treatment was performed in calcium-free medium, suggesting that the observed reduction in PLD stimulation is due to the removal of both extra- and intracellular calcium. The staurosporine-induced inhibition of mAChR-stimulated PLD is apparently not due to inhibition of protein kinase C, since it is not mimicked by specific protein kinase C inhibitors(20Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but it may be due to inhibition of tyrosine kinases by this rather unselective inhibitor(4Thompson N.T. Garland L.G. Bonser R.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 199-238Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, at a maximally effective concentration was not possible in this type of experiments, since under this condition genistein completely prevented the carbachol-induced PLD activation(20Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Influence of BAPTA/AM, staurosporine and genistein on the time course of mAChR-induced PtdEtOH formation. [3H]Oleic acid-prelabeled HEK cells were pretreated for 30 min without (Control) and with BAPTA/AM (20 μM), staurosporine (0.1 μM), or genistein (10 μM) as indicated. Thereafter, carbachol (1 mM) induced [3H]PtdEtOH formation was measured in the presence of ethanol (400 mM) for the indicated periods of time. For the BAPTA/AM experiment, extracellular Ca2+ was additionally removed from the incubation medium. Data are from one representative experiment (mean ± S.D., triplicate culture dishes), characteristic of three separate ones.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to exclude ethanol and PtdEtOH, the PLD product, as causative agents for the rapid desensitization, HEK cells were pretreated for 2 min with carbachol (1 mM) in the absence of ethanol and LiCl. After wash-out of carbachol, the cells were immediately restimulated with carbachol in the presence of ethanol and LiCl. As shown in Fig. 3, mAChR-mediated stimulation of PLD was abrogated by prior cell treatment with carbachol. In complete contrast, mAChR-stimulated PLC activity, measured as accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates, was not impaired but was significantly (p < 0.01, n = 12) enhanced (by 70-100%) upon pretreatment of the cells with carbachol. Activation of purinergic receptors endogenously expressed in HEK cells (25Watson P.A. Krupinski J. Kempinski A.M. Frankenfield C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28893-28898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the agonist, ATP (1 mM), stimulated PLD activity to about 30% of the level observed with 1 mM carbachol (Fig. 4); however, with identical time kinetics (data not shown), suggesting that the ATP-stimulated PLD also rapidly desensitizes. Indeed, 2 min of ATP treatment followed by wash-out of the agonist completely prevented subsequent purinergic receptor-mediated PLD stimulation (Fig. 4B). Agonist-induced desensitization can be either homologous or heterologous. Therefore, mutual interactions between activation of mAChRs and purinergic receptors were studied. Carbachol pretreatment (1 mM for 2 min) abolished mAChR-stimulated PLD, while ATP-induced PLD stimulation was still present but significantly (p < 0.01, n = 9) reduced by about 50% (Fig. 4A). Vice versa, after ATP treatment (1 mM for 2 min), carbachol still effectively stimulated PLD, but the response was significantly (p < 0.01, n = 9) reduced by about 25% (Fig. 4B). To study at which level the PLD response to mAChR activation was blunted, several possibilities were examined. First, we investigated whether activation of PLD itself by direct activation of protein kinase C with the phorbol ester PMA and by direct activation of heterotrimeric G proteins with AlF4− was altered in carbachol-pretreated intact cells. In contrast to the abolished mAChR stimulation, pretreatment of the cells for 2 min with carbachol (1 mM) had no effect on the PMA- and AlF4−-induced activation of PLD (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, pretreatment of intact HEK cells with carbachol had no effect on stimulation of PLD by the stable GTP analog GTPγS measured in permeabilized cells (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these data indicated that the rapid desensitization of the mAChR-induced PLD stimulation was not due to an inactivation of the PLD enzyme itself and its activation by protein kinase C and G proteins. Second, the rapid desensitization of the mAChR-stimulated PLD could be due to a loss of cell surface receptors. However, preexposure of the cells to 1 mM carbachol for 2 min had no effect on binding of the hydrophilic mAChR antagonist ligand [3H]NMS, used at a receptor-saturating concentration of 2 nM(26Tobin A.B. Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar), to intact HEK cells (Fig. 6A). These data indicated that the desensitization of the PLD response was not due to m3 mAChR internalization. Third, desensitization of mAChR-induced PLD activation might be due to a receptor-G protein uncoupling. Therefore, agonist-induced binding of GTPγS to membranes of cells pretreated or not for 2 min with carbachol (1 mM) was studied. Pretreatment of intact cells with carbachol caused an almost complete abrogation of agonist-induced GTPγS binding to membranes of these cells (Fig. 6B). Similar data were obtained when we measured GTPγS binding to permeabilized adherent cells pretreated with carbachol (Fig. 7A). These data suggested that the rapid mAChR desensitization of PLD activation may be due to uncoupling of the receptor from the G protein(s) mediating the mAChR action. This hypothesis was further examined by measuring the time courses of recovery of agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding and PLD activation following pretreatment of intact cells with carbachol (1 mM for 2 min). After 4 h of culturing of the cells in agonist-free medium, the carbachol-induced binding of GTPγS measured in permeabilized adherent HEK cells was fully restored (Fig. 7A). However, mAChR-stimulated PLD activity remained completely abolished during this time scale (Fig. 7B). Stimulation of PLD by PMA and AlF4− was not altered (data not shown). After 24 h of culturing of the cells in agonist-free medium, PLD stimulation by carbachol was restored by about 50%, with the carbachol-induced PtdEtOH formation being 0.13 ± 0.02 and 0.23 ± 0.02% of total phospholipids in carbachol-pretreated and untreated control cells, respectively (mean ± S.D., n = 3, from one experiment, representative for two independent ones). mAChR-stimulated PLC was sensitized by prior short term carbachol treatment, up to about 2-fold (Fig. 7C). This supersensitivity to carbachol disappeared after 2 h of cell culturing in agonist-free medium. Fourth, we assessed whether PLD stimulation during short term agonist treatment was a prerequisite for the long lasting loss of the mAChR response. Therefore, HEK cells were pretreated with genistein (100 μM for 30 min) before a 2-min challenge with carbachol, followed by a 4-h recovery in the absence of either agent. The genistein pretreatment completely inhibited acute carbachol"

The possible side chains are Manα1,2- or Manα1,2Manα1,2- or Manα1,3Manα1,2- (Fankhauser, C., Homan, S. W., Thomas Oates, J. E., McConville, M. J., Desponds, C., Conzelmann, A., and Ferguson, M. A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26365-26374). To determine in what subcellular compartment these side chains are made, we metabolically labeled GPI-anchored membrane proteins with myo-[2-3H]inositol in secretion mutants blocked at various stages of the secretory pathway and analyzed the anchor structure of the labeled glycoproteins. When the exit of vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum or entry into the cis-Golgi were blocked in sec12 or sec18 cells, all anchors contained a side chain consisting of a single α1,2-linked mannose. GPI proteins trapped in the cis-Golgi of sec7 contained Manα1,3Manα1,2- but no Manα1,2Manα1,2- side chains. Mutants blocked at later stages of the secretory pathway made increased amounts of side chains containing two mannoses. Manα1,2Manα1,2- and Manα1,3Manα1,2- side chains were preferentially associated with ceramide- and diacylglycerol-containing GPI anchors, respectively. Mnn1, mnn2, mnn3, mnn5, and mnt1(=kre2),i.e. mutants which lack or down-regulate 1,2- and 1,3-mannosyltransferases used in the elongation of N- and O-glycans in the Golgi, add the fifth mannose to GPI anchors normally. The same conclusion was reached through the analysis of deletion mutants in KTR1, KTR2, KTR3, KTR4, and YUR1 which all are open reading frames with high homology to MNT1. Mutants deficient in the Golgi elongation of N-glycans such as anp1, van1, mnn9 are deficient in the maturation of the N-glycans of GPI-anchored glycoproteins, but process the GPI anchor side chain normally. Data are consistent with the idea that the fourth mannose is added to proteins as part of the anchor precursor glycolipid in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the fifth mannose is added by not yet identified α1,3- and α1,2-mannosyltransferases located in the Golgi apparatus.

https://openalex.org/W1485834678,"Bovine arterial endothelial cells were stably transfected with the human wild-type (wt) HSP27 or a mutant gene (mu) encoding a nonphosphorylatable form of the protein. At early passage both cultural and cellular morphology were similar, although the vacuole content in wtHSP27 was much higher than muHSP27 cells. As the cultures aged, wtHSP27 cells became large, polymorphic, highly vacuolated, and reached senescence before muHSP27 transfected cultures, which remained small and polygonal with few detectable vacuoles. Vector control cells showed an intermediate phenotype. Tritiated thymidine incorporation studies were performed with multiple wtHSP27 and muHSP27 clones and the results compared with 11 vector control clones. The results showed an average increase in growth rate for the wtHSP27 cells of 3.0 ± 0.6 times. The growth rate of eight muHSP27 clones showed a slight decrease. Estradiol treatment of endothelial cells resulted in an increase in both bovine and human HSP27, with peak expression at 100 nM. Treatment of the vector-transfected cells with 100 nM estradiol resulted in a 1.44 ± 0.18 fold increase in growth rate, which was blocked by expression of muHSP27.

Uskokovic of Hoffmann-LaRoche. Stock solutions of 0.2 mM VD3 were prepared in absolute ethanol and protected from direct light. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kits were purchased from Amersham Corp. 32P- and 35S-nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Corp. or DuPont NEN. Universolv liquid scintillation mixture was purchased from ICN (Cosa Mesa, CA). All other chemicals were of the highest commercially available purity.Cells and Cell CultureThe human leukemia cell lines RWLeu-4 and JMRD3 were cultured in complete medium (α-modified minimum essential medium supplemented with glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate) plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Cells were inoculated at 0.5-1 × 105 cells/ml and grown exponentially for 3-4 days. Viability of cells was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.Transient Transfection AnalysisClonal lines of RWLeu-4 and JMRD3 cells expressing similar numbers of VDR as judged by ligand binding assays were grown as described above. Triplicate cultures containing five million cells were transfected in a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 960 microfarads, 300 V with 20 μg of the pGL2-(OC-VDRE)2 luciferase reporter construct (kindly provided by Dr. L. Freedman, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and 1 μg of cytomegalovirus promoter/human growth hormone construct in the presence or absence of 50 nM 1,25-VD3. Fourteen hours after transfection, luciferase activity was assayed(27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar), and growth hormone was measured from 100 μl of supernatant by radioimmunoassay (Allegro human growth hormone kit, Nichols Institute Diagnostics (San Juan Capistrano, CA). Promoter activity is expressed as -fold induction of normalized relative light units. Normalized relative light units are derived by dividing luciferase activity by growth hormone to account for transfection efficiency.Extraction of Nuclear ProteinsNuclear extracts from VD3-sensitive and -resistant cells treated with 50 nM VD3 for varying lengths of time as indicated in the text and figures were isolated by a modification of the method described by Dignam et al.(28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 million VD3 treated or control cells were scraped, collected by centrifugation at 400 × g, and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4•7H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4). All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4°C. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer with proteinase inhibitors (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, Pefabloc® SC (Boehringer Mannheim), pepstatin) and immediately centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, allowed to swell for 10 min, and the cells were disrupted by 10-12 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a tight fitting pestle. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated Eppendorf microcentrifuge and the cytosolic fraction removed. The nuclei were resuspended in 0.25 ml of high salt buffer with proteinase inhibitors (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 120 mM NaCl, 300 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, Pefabloc, and pepstatin) and incubated for 30 min. The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a type 50 rotor (Beckman), and the supernatant was removed, dialyzed against 230 ml of storage buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol) for 1-2 h, diluted with storage buffer to a final protein concentration of 5 μg/μl, and stored in small aliquots at −80°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal.

Oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis were annealed and purified by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis using standard techniques(27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dATP, or [γ-32P]ATP by standard filling-in or end-labeling techniques(27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using NucTrap push columns (Stratagene).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AnalysisSamples containing 10-15 μg of protein from nuclear extracts of sensitive or resistant cells were used in DNA binding reactions. Each reaction had a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI•dC), and 10 fmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotides (20,000-40,000 dpm). The sequence CTAGTGCTCGGGTAGGGGTGACTCACCGGGTGAACGGGGGCATCT and its complement were used as the human osteocalcin-VD3-response element; CTAGACGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA and its complement as the consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide; and CTAGTGCTCGGGTAGAGGTCAAGGAGGTCACTCGAC and its complement as the DR3-VDRE. Oligonucleotides containing the NF-κB consensus (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC) sequence purchased from Promega Biotech were used as a negative control. Binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Supershifting experiments using antibodies against Jun and Fos family members were performed by adding 0.1-3 μg of specific antibody after the initial incubation of extracts with radiolabeled probes. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Antibodies against JunB and JunD were also kindly provided by Dr. R. Bravo (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Anti-NFκB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., SC-109X) was used as nonspecific, control antibody. Binding reactions were continued for 30 min after addition of antibodies. The reaction products were separated on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels using the 0.5 × Tris/borate/EDTA buffer system (44.5 mM Tris base, 44.5 mM sodium borate, 1 mM Na2EDTA) (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography.Immunoblot AnalysisNuclear extracts were prepared from RWLeu-4 and JMRD3 or the cloned cells as described above, and 10-μg aliquots of each extract were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then electrotransferred to Hybond™ membranes (Amersham Corp.), and the membrane were blocked with powdered milk and incubated with a 1:1500 dilution of anti-c-Jun, anti-JunB, anti-junD, anti-c-Fos, anti-FosB, or anti-Fra2 obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. or Oncogene Sciences, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibody (Amersham Corp.) was used to visualize the cross-reactive bands by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Corp.). Nonspecific binding was determined by omitting the first antibody or by blocking with a 10-fold excess of antibody-specific peptides purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAlthough no differences were detected between the VDRs expressed in the sensitive and resistant cells, analysis of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) shows that differences in the DNA binding activity are present in nuclear extracts from control (Fig. 1, lanes1-5) or VD3-treated cells (Fig. 1, lanes6-10). The band labeled VDR, identified by competition with unlabeled OC-VDREs (lanes2 and 7), a consensus VDRE (lanes3 and 8), and by blocking with the 9a7 anti-VDR antibody (data not shown), is present in both sensitive and resistant cell extracts. Lanes1 and 6 of both A and B show that the VDR is induced in both cell types although VDR binding in JMRD3 cell extracts is slightly less than that seen in RWLeu-4 extracts. However, in agreement with previous findings(23Lasky S.R. Posner M.R. Iwata K. Santos M.A. Yen A. Samuel V. Clark J. Maizel A.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transient transfection experiments (Fig. 2) using luciferase reporter plasmids containing two copies of the OC-VDRE demonstrate that both cell lines are equally responsive to induction by VD3.Figure 2:Analysis of VD3 responsiveness of RWLeu-4 and JMRD3 cells by transient transfection. Triplicate cultures containing five million RWLeu-4 (solidbars) or JMRD3 (hatchedbars) cells were transfected with 20 μg of pGL2-(OC-VDRE)2 (kindly provided by Dr. L. Freedman, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and 1 μg of cytomegalovirus promoter/human growth hormone construct in the absence or presence of 50 nM VD3. Fourteen hours after transfection luciferase activity was assayed, and growth hormone was measured from 100 μl of supernatant by radioimmunoassay techniques. Promoter activity is expressed as -fold induction of relative light units divided by growth hormone expression (normalized relative light units).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because AP-1 binds to the OC-VDRE(22Lian J.B.

Cell. 1990; 61: 497-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), it was suspected that other bands in the EMSA might contain Jun and Fos proteins. Experiments were undertaken to determine if the activity of AP-1 is modified during VD3-induced inhibition of proliferation using competition binding experiments with excess unlabeled oligonucleotides containing a consensus AP-1 binding site. Fig. 1(lanes4 and 9) shows that AP-1 binding activity is present in nuclear extracts of the sensitive and resistant cells but that AP-1 binding is increased by VD3 treatment of the sensitive cells and is decreased by VD3 treatment of the resistant cells. The slowest migrating band, seen only in VD3-treated RWLeu-4 cell extracts (lane6), is competed by the OC-VDRE (lane7), DR3-VDRE (lane8), AP-1 consensus sequences (lane9), as well as anti-VDR antibodies (data not shown) and therefore appears to contain both VDR and AP-1 associated with the same molecule. Binding specificity is indicated by the failure of oligonucleotides containing NFκB consensus sequences to block the binding of any bands.EMSA supershifting experiments were performed to determine whether differences in AP-1 binding activity are due to the differential activation of specific members of the Jun and Fos families. Antibodies specific for the Jun and Fos family members were added after a preincubation of extracts with radiolabeled OC-VDRE as indicated in the legend for Fig. 3. Both RWLeu-4 (Fig. 3A) and JMRD3 (Fig. 3B) express active JunD (supershifted band in lane4) and c-Fos (supershifted band in lane 5) proteins before treatment with VD3. However, VD3 treatment of the RWLeu-4 cells increases the DNA binding activity of JunD (Fig. 3A, compare lanes4 and 11) but decreases JunD DNA binding activity in JMRD3 cells (Fig. 3B, compare lanes4 and 11). No consistent changes in other members of the Jun and Fos families are detected in extracts from either cell population using this technique. Fig. 4 shows that the increase in JunD DNA binding in the sensitive cells (Fig. 4A) is dependent upon the length of treatment with VD3 but that JunD participation in AP-1 binding complexes in the resistant cells (Fig. 4B) decreases over this period of treatment. Taken together these results indicate that VD3 differentially regulates the DNA binding activity of AP-1 transcription factors, particularly those complexes containing JunD proteins.Figure 3:EMSA supershifting of OC-VDRE binding bands in RWLeu-4 (A) or JMRD3 (B) nuclear extracts. OC-VDRE binding by nuclear extracts from untreated cells (lanes 1-7) or cells treated for 72 h with 50 nM VD3 (lanes 8-14) was performed as described in Fig. 1. Antibodies (0.1-1 μg) against Jun and Fos family members were then added, and the incubations continued for an additional 30 min. Reaction products were separated and visualized as described in Fig. 1. Lanes1 and 8 contain no antibodies; lanes2 and 9 contain anti-c-Jun; lanes3 and 10 contain anti-JunB; lanes4 and 11 contain anti-JunD; lanes5 and 12 contain anti-c-Fos; lanes6 and 13 contain anti-FosB; lanes7 and 14 contain anti-Fra2.

EMSA supershift assays were performed with 15 μg of nuclear extract as described in Fig. 3. Lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10 contain no added antibodies; lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11 contain 1 μg of antibody against JunD proteins; lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12 contain 1 μg of antibody against FosB as an isotype-specific negative control.

Slight increases are seen in JunB, FosB, and Fra1 expression in RWLeu-4 cells, although differences in the participation of these proteins in AP-1 complexes that bind to the OC-VDRE have not been detected. In addition, this figure shows that extended treatment of RWLeu-4 cells with VD3 causes JunD to form a doublet band on immunoblots (lanes3 and 4). This could be due to alterations in the structure of JunD, perhaps through changes in phosphorylation, that could modulate the activity or accumulation of the transcription factor(30Papavassiliou A.G.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from RWLeu-4 (lanes 1-4) and JMRD3 (lanes5-8) cells treated with 50 nM VD3 for 0 h (lanes 1 and 5), 24 h (lanes 2 and 6), 48 h (lanes 3 and 7), and 72 h (lanes 4 and 8). Aliquots containing 10 μg of protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond™ membranes (Amersham Corp.). Membranes were blocked, incubated with antibodies, and visualized by ECL as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nonspecific binding was determined by omitting the first antibody or by blocking with a 10-fold excess of antibody-specific peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results show that both the VD3-sensitive RWLeu-4 and VD3-resistant JMRD3 CML cell lines express active VDRs that are capable of binding to VDREs. The primary difference detected between the sensitive and resistant cell lines lies in the expression or activity of the AP-1 transcription factors. In particular, the DNA binding activity of JunD in AP-1 complexes is increased in the sensitive cells but is decreased in the resistant cells. This observation is particularly salient considering the results of Pfarr et al.(32Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which demonstrate that JunD can decrease the transforming ability of activated Ras proteins. In CML, the fusion of the bcr and abl proto-oncogenes results in the expression of a chimeric p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase that can circumvent the need for extracellular signals to activate the Ras signal transduction pathway, thus leading to uncontrolled proliferation (33Daley G.Q.

Therefore, the increased JunD activity in response to VD3 in the sensitive cells may indirectly inhibit the proliferative signals from p210bcr-abl and lead to a cessation of proliferation and induction of differentiation.The results presented here suggest that the anti-proliferative actions of VD3 in these CML cells are mediated, at least in part, by alterations in the nature of the Jun and Fos family members in AP-1 transcription factors. These changes could differentially regulate the expression of specific subsets of genes that are integral to the process of proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2063782395,"Four variant AE1 anion exchangers with predicted molecular masses of ∼99, ∼102, ∼104, and ∼108 kDa are expressed in chicken erythroid cells. These variant polypeptides differ in sequence only at the N terminus of their cytoplasmic domains. Molecular analyses have shown that transcripts derived from both of the erythroid-specific promoters, P1 and P2, encode all four of these AE1 anion exchanger variants. However, quantitative RNase protection analyses have shown that the transcripts derived from the P1 promoter are much more prevalent than those derived from the P2 promoter. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies have indicated that the extensive diversity in the transcripts derived from the AE1 gene occurs both in primitive and definitive lineage erythroid cells. Transient transfection analyses using human erythroleukemia cells have investigated the functional significance of the alternative sequences at the N terminus of these variant exchangers. These studies have shown that the erythroid AE1 variants are sorted to different membrane compartments in these cells. The ∼99- and ∼102-kDa variants are primarily sorted to the plasma membrane, whereas the ∼108-kDa variant is retained in a perinuclear compartment. These results suggest that the alternative N-terminal cytoplasmic sequences of these polypeptides may serve as signals to direct these variant transporters to different membrane compartments within cells.

INTRODUCTIONThe erythroid AE1 anion exchanger (band 3) possesses dual functions that are segregated into distinct domains. The C-terminal membrane-spanning region of the polypeptide primarily mediates the electroneutral exchange of bicarbonate for chloride(1Knauf P.A. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1979; 12: 249-363Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This electroneutral exchange reaction allows the CO2 generated in respiring tissues to be carried to the lungs in the form of bicarbonate where it is expelled. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the AE1 anion exchanger provides an attachment site for the erythroid membrane cytoskeleton through its interaction with ankyrin(2Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. Nature. 1980; 280: 468-473Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar), protein 4.1(3Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3676-3683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein 4.2(4Korsgren C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10212-10218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recent analyses have indicated that the gene that encodes the erythroid AE1 anion exchanger also encodes the electroneutral anion exchanger that has been characterized in the basolateral membrane of the A-intercalated cell of the kidney collecting duct(5Alper S.L. Natale J. Gluck S. Lodish H.F. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that the AE1 anion exchanger transcripts that accumulate in human(6Kollert-Jons A. Wagner S. Hubner S. Appelhans H. Drenckhahn D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F813-F821PubMed Google Scholar), mouse(7Brosius III, F.C. Alper S.L. Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7784-7787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat(8Kudrycki K.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8185-8192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chicken (9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) kidney differ from the erythroid AE1 transcripts in the sequences present at their 5′ ends, resulting in polypeptides that only differ from their erythroid counterparts in the sequences present at the N terminus of their cytoplasmic domains. This type of N-terminal cytoplasmic diversity has also been shown to exist among the AE1 anion exchangers expressed in chicken erythroid cells. Two variant erythroid AE1 anion exchanger transcripts, AE1-1 and AE1-2, which are derived by alternative transcriptional initiation and differential RNA splicing(10Kim H.-R.C. Yew N.S. Ansorge W. Voss H. Schwager C. Vennstrom B. Zenke M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4416-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Kim H.-R.C. Kennedy B.S. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), encode polypeptides with alternative N-terminal cytoplasmic domains.The studies described here, in conjunction with previous analyses, have indicated that a total of 14 AE1 anion exchanger transcripts accumulate in chicken erythroid cells. Twelve of these transcripts are derived from the two erythroid-specific promoters of the AE1 gene, P1 and P2 (11Kim H.-R.C. Kennedy B.S. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The other two transcripts, AE1-3 and AE1-5, whose expression is regulated by the P3 promoter of the AE1 gene, 1K. H. Cox and J. V. Cox, unpublished observations. accumulate both in erythroid and in kidney cells(9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although 12 AE1 transcripts are derived from the two erythroid-specific promoters, they encode only four different structural variants with predicted molecular masses of ∼99, ∼102, ∼104, and ∼108 kDa. This observed diversity is consistent with immunoblotting studies that have shown that four anion exchanger species of ∼95, ∼99, ∼102, and ∼108 kDa accumulate in chicken erythroid membranes(9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the variant AE1 anion exchangers that have been previously characterized, the polypeptides encoded by these variant AE1 transcripts differ only in the sequences present in their N-terminal cytoplasmic domains. Transfection analyses have indicated that the ∼108-kDa AE1 variant is primarily retained in a perinuclear compartment when transiently expressed in human erythroleukemia (HEL) 2The abbreviations used are: HELhuman erythroleukemiaRTreverse transcriptasePCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplication of cDNA endsPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline. cells. In contrast, the ∼99- and ∼102-kDa AE1 variants primarily accumulate in the plasma membrane of transfected HEL cells. These results suggest that the alternative N-terminal cytoplasmic sequences of these variant transporters may be involved in targeting these polypeptides to different membrane compartments within cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of cDNAs Corresponding to the 5′ Ends of the Variant Chicken Erythroid AE1 TranscriptscDNAs corresponding to the 5′ ends of the variant chicken erythroid AE1 transcripts were cloned using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) protocol(9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 10-day embryonic erythroid cells was reverse transcribed using an oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 1667-1687 of the erythroid AE1-1 transcript(10Kim H.-R.C.

Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This first strand cDNA was tailed with dATP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and used as a template for PCR using an antisense primer corresponding to nucleotides 362-382 of the AE1-1 transcript and a RIdT16 sense primer (the RI sequence at the 5′ end of this primer contained the sequence for a restriction endonuclease site). The products of the first round of PCR were then used as the template for a second round of PCR using an antisense primer corresponding to nucleotides 298-318 of the AE1-1-transcript (this antisense primer contained the restriction endonuclease site found in the RI sequence at its 5′ end) and a sense primer corresponding to RI. The amplification products resulting from this PCR reaction were digested with the restriction endonuclease, subcloned into a pGEM-3 vector (Promega), and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method.Construction and Screening of a Chicken Genomic DNA LibraryChicken genomic DNA was isolated from chicken liver(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Restriction fragments resulting from the BamHI digestion of this genomic DNA were ligated into a BamHI-cut ZAP Express vector (Stratagene). This phage library was screened by plaque filter hybridization using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe of 228 nucleotides that initiated with nucleotide 14 of exon 4 and included all of exons 5 and 6. This resulted in the isolation of two contiguous genomic clones of ∼1.6 and ∼1.2 kilobases pair. pBK-CMV phagemid DNA containing each of these genomic inserts was prepared and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using specific oligonucleotides as primers.Generation of cDNAs Corresponding to the 3′ End of Exon 6 Containing AE1 TranscriptscDNAs corresponding to the 3′ end of exon 6 containing AE1 transcripts were generated by RT-PCR.

The PCR amplification primers contained the sequence for a restriction endonuclease site at their 5′ end. The amplification products resulting from this PCR reaction were digested with the restriction endonuclease and subcloned into a pGEM-3 vector, and the entire sequence of each clone was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method of sequencing using specific oligonucleotides as primers. Multiple cDNAs were sequenced to insure that any sequence differences observed between these exon 6 containing transcripts and the previously characterized AE1 transcripts (9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J.

PCR amplifications were also carried out using each of these sense primers in combination with an antisense primer complementary to nucleotides 54-74 of exon 10 (10AS) of the AE1 gene. Each primer contained 9 additional nucleotides at its 5′ end that included the sequence for a restriction endonuclease site. The resulting PCR amplification products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The amplification products were then transferred to nitrocellulose, and the filters were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding either to nucleotides 11-31 in exon 3, nucleotides 50-70 in exon 3, nucleotides 14-34 in exon 4, or nucleotides 1-21 in exon 6 of the AE1 gene as described previously(9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following washing, hybridizing species were detected by autoradiography using an intensifying screen. Specific hybridizing species were isolated on a low melting point agarose gel, digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease, subcloned into a pGEM-3 vector, and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method.RNA Blotting Analysis200 ng of poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 10-day embryonic erythroid cells(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), electrophoresed on a formaldehyde agarose gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose filter was probed with a 32P-labeled antisense in vitro transcript corresponding to nucleotides 2790-3068 of the erythroid AE1-1 transcript(10Kim H.-R.C. Yew N.S. Ansorge W.

Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This sequence is present at the 3′ end of all the previously characterized AE1 transcripts(9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kim H.-R.C. Yew N.S. Ansorge W. Voss H. Schwager C. Vennstrom B. Zenke M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4416-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an identical blot was probed with a 32P-labeled antisense in vitro transcript corresponding to nucleotides 1-95 of exon 6. 2 × 106 cpm/ml of each of these 32P-labeled probes was incubated with the nitrocellulose filters in 50% formamide, 0.1 M PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 × Denhardt's solution, and 0.2% SDS for 16 h at 68°C. The filters were then incubated for 2 h at 75°C, followed by washing in 0.2 × SSC and 0.01% SDS at 68°C. Hybridizing species were detected by autoradiography using an intensifying screen.RNase Protection Analysis32P-labeled antisense transcripts were synthesized from the cDNA templates illustrated in Fig. 5A and 6C using SP6 RNA polymerase. 300,000 cpm of each 32P-labeled probe was hybridized with 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 10-day embryonic erythroid cells in 80% formamide, 40 mM PIPES, 0.4 M NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA for 16 h at 50°C. Following hybridization, the samples were digested with 0.3 μg of RNase A and 6.6 units of RNase T1 for 1 h at 30°C, deproteinized by treatment with proteinase K, phenol-extracted, and precipitated(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The samples were then resuspended, electrophoresed on a 7 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the protected fragments were visualized by autoradiography using an intensifying screen.Quantitation of the Relative Abundance of the Variant Erythroid AE1 TranscriptsThe autoradiograms resulting from the RNase protection assays were scanned, and the percentage of label in each fragment determined using the ScanAnalysis software from Biosoft. The autoradiographic exposures used for this analysis were those in which individual bands were not yet saturated. The values for the relative abundance of the individual AE1 variants represents the average value obtained from two independent experiments, in which virtually identical results were obtained.Transient Expression of the Variant Erythroid AE1 Anion Exchangers in HEL CellsFull-length cDNAs corresponding to the ∼99-, ∼102-, and ∼108-kDa erythroid AE1 anion exchangers were subcloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) downstream of the constitutive immediate early gene promoter of cytomegalovirus. In each construct, the sequence immediately upstream of the translation initiation codon has been removed and replaced with a Kozak sequence (ACCACC) (14Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar) to enhance translation initiation efficiency. Each construct was transfected into HEL cells by a modification of the calcium phosphate technique(15Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6474) Google Scholar), and after 48 h, the cells were harvested and fixed on coverslips by incubating in 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Following permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, the cells were incubated with a 1:3,000 dilution of an AE1 anion exchanger-specific peptide antibody, pAE1A, in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. This antibody has been generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 185-203 of the erythroid AE1-1 anion exchanger(9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then washed and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to lissamine and following washing immunoreactive polypeptides were visualized using a Bio-Rad confocal laser scanning microscope. The transfection efficiency in these experiments ranged from 0.3-2% of the total cell population. As a control for the specificity of staining, the pAE1A antibodies were incubated with the transfected HEL cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml of the peptide they were generated against or in the presence of 10 μg/ml of a nonspecific peptide.RESULTSIdentification and Characterization of Variant Chicken Erythroid AE1 Anion Exchanger TranscriptsPrevious analyses have indicated that two erythroid transcripts, AE1-1 and AE1-2, are derived from the chicken AE1 anion exchanger gene by alternative transcriptional initiation and differential RNA splicing(11Kim H.-R.C. Kennedy B.S. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These transcripts, which differ only at their 5′ ends, encode anion exchangers that possess alternative N-terminal cytoplasmic domains. Recent studies have further characterized three additional transcripts derived from the chicken AE1 gene, AE1-3, AE1-4, and AE1-5, which accumulate in chicken kidney(9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the erythroid transcripts, the variant kidney AE1 transcripts differ only at their 5′ ends and encode predicted polypeptides with alternative N-terminal cytoplasmic domains. RT-PCR analyses have shown that the AE1-3 and AE1-5 transcripts also accumulate in erythroid cells (9Cox K.H. Cox J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F503-F513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure at the 5′ end of each of these variant transcripts is illustrated in Fig. 1A.Figure 1:Structure of the variant chicken AE1 anion exchangers. The exon organization of the variant chicken AE1 anion exchangers is illustrated diagrammatically in A. The predicted site of translation initiation of each variant, as well as the location of the antisense primer (arrow in AE1-1) used for the RT-PCR RACE analyses are indicated. Boxes containing different patterns at the 5′ ends of the AE1-3, AE1-4, and AE1-5 transcripts correspond to the variant specific exons of these transcripts. The boxes that are shaded are held in common among all of the variant transcripts. The location of the peptide, pAE1A, that was used to generate AE1 anion exchanger-specific antibodies is indicated. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of exons 5 and 6 is illustrated in B. The arrows in B mark the location of splice junctions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether additional diversity exists at the 5′ ends of the chicken erythroid AE1 transcripts, RT-PCR RACE using an antisense primer corresponding to nucleotides 298-318 of the AE1-1 transcript has been used to amplify the 5′ ends of the erythroid AE1 transcripts. The location of the antisense primer used for these analyses is indicated by the arrow in Fig. 1A. The amplification products resulting from this protocol were subcloned into a pGEM-3 vector, and 20 clones were isolated and sequenced. Eight clones were identical to the sequence of the AE1-1 and AE1-2 transcripts, and their 5′ ends corresponded to various sites within exon 4 of the AE1 gene (Fig. 1A). These clones presumably resulted from premature termination during the reverse transcriptase reaction. Six clones were identical to the AE1-1 transcript, and their 5′ ends corresponded to the nucleotide immediately 3′ of the previously defined transcription start site of the erythroid AE1-1 transcript (11Kim H.-R.C. Kennedy B.S. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Four clones extended further 5′ in the AE1 gene than the putative transcription initiation site of the AE1-1 transcript(11Kim H.-R.C. Kennedy B.S. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), with the largest clone extending 21 nucleotides upstream of this site. Whether the erythroid AE1-1 transcripts initiate at a site upstream of that previously determined (11Kim H.-R.C. Kennedy B.S. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) will be addressed in the RNase protection analyses described below.Two additional clones were isolated that contained a novel 153-nucleotide insert between exon 4 and exon 10. Exon 10 is the first exon that is held in common among all of the variant erythroid and kidney AE1 transcripts (Fig. 1). Data base searches have shown that the amino acid sequence encoded by this 153-nucleotide insert (Fig. 1B) is not homologous to the sequence of any of the previously characterized anion exchanger gene members. Sequence analysis of the region of the AE1 gene that contains this 153-nucleotide insert has shown that this sequence is derived from two exons, 5 and 6, that are separated by an intron of 102 nucleotides (Fig. 2A). Exons 5 and 6 lie immediately upstream of the exons at the 5′ ends of the variant kidney AE1 transcripts, AE1-3, AE1-4, and AE1-5.1Figure 2:Analysis of the structure of AE1 transcripts containing exons 5 and 6 by RT-PCR. Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 10-day embryonic erythroid cells was reverse transcribed using a primer complementary to nucleotides 3017-3037 of the erythroid AE1-1 transcript(10Kim H.-R.C. Yew N.S.

Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This first strand cDNA was PCR amplified using an antisense primer complementary to nucleotides 74-95 of exon 6 (B, lanes 1-6) or an antisense primer complementary to nucleotides 54-74 of exon 10 (B, lanes 7-12). Each of these antisense primers was used in combination with three different sense primers; 1S (B, lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8), 1′S (B, lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10), or 2S (B, lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12). The location of the sequences in the AE1 gene corresponding to each primer is illustrated in A. The even-numbered lanes in B correspond to PCR amplifications carried out in the absence of first strand cDNA template. The amplification products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide (B). Alternatively, the amplification products were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding either to nucleotides 11-31 in exon 3 (C), nucleotides 14-34 in exon 4 (D), or nucleotides 1-21 in exon 6 (E). The organization and size of the exons at the 5′ end of the AE1 gene are depicted in A. The filled box at the 5′ end of exon 2 corresponds to the 21 nucleotides 5′ of the previously defined transcription initiation site of the erythroid AE1-1 transcript(11Kim H.-R.C. Kennedy B.S. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Open boxes correspond to introns in the variant erythroid AE1 transcripts and are not drawn to scale. Exons 7, 8, and 9, which are not illustrated in this diagram, are not part of the transcripts derived from the P1 and P2 promoters. The markers in B correspond to pGEM-3 DNA digested with HinfI restriction endonuclease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 5′ termini of both of the cDNAs that contained exons 5 and 6 resided within exon 4 of the AE1 gene (Fig. 1A). Because the AE1-1 and AE1-2 transcripts, which are derived from the P1 and P2 promoters, respectively, each contain exon 4 of the AE1 gene, it was possible that transcripts containing exons 5 and 6 initiated transcription from one or both of these erythroid-specific AE1 promoters. To further investigate the structure of transcripts containing exons 5 and 6, RT-PCR analyses have amplified the sequence at the 5′ end of AE1 transcripts present in RNA isolated from 10-day embryonic erythroid cells. Poly(A)+ erythroid RNA was reverse transcribed using a primer complementary to nucleotides 3017-3037 of the erythroid AE1-1 transcript. This first strand cDNA was PCR amplified using an antisense primer complementary to a sequence in exon 6 (6AS in Fig. 2A) in combination with one of three different sense primers. The first sense primer, 1S, corresponded to nucleotides 11-31 of the erythroid AE1-1 transcript (10Kim H.-R.C. Yew N.S. Ansorge W. Voss H. Schwager C. Vennstrom B. Zenke M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1508565500,"Central to the study of free radical processes is the ability to identify and localize their cellular site of formation. Under the best of experimental conditions, spin trapping/ESR spectroscopy can only characterize intracellular production of specific free radicals and confocal microscopy can only localize the site of their formation. In this article, we report on the development of a fluorophore-containing nitrone, alpha-[4-[5-((2-carboxy)phenyl)-5-hydroxy-4-oxo-3-phenyl)-2-pyrrolin+ -1-yl]phenyl]-N-(tert-butyl)nitrone sodium salt (4). This nitrone (4) reacts with alpha-hydroxyethyl radical with a second order rate constant of 1.7 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 to give a characteristic ESR spectrum. However, we were unable to decrease the fluorescence emission, due in part to the small concentration of nitroxide generated from the reaction of alpha-hydroxyethyl radical with nitrone (4). Using the fluorophore-containing nitroxide (7) as a model, we found that only 12% of the nitroxide needs to be reduced to give an almost 400% increase in the fluorescent emission of (7). Our findings suggest new approaches to the development of various fluorophore-containing nitrones that can both characterize specific free radicals and localize their site of intracellular formation."

To assess the functional relevance of these two putative CaM-binding sites, we have examined three synthetic peptides regarding their effects on CaM's ability to reverse CaD-induced inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity: GS17C (Gly-651 to Ser-667), VG29C (Val-685 to Gly-713), each containing one CaM-binding site, and MG56C (Met-658 to Gly-713), which contains both sites. We found that although VG29C did bind CaM, its affinity was weakened by GS17C, and it failed to compete with CaD for CaM under the conditions where GS17C effectively displaced CaD from CaM.

Mutations of pepsin by site-directed mutagenesis of the Lys-319 residue were generated to study the structure-function relationships. Kinetic parameters, pH activity profiles, along with conformational analysis using circular dichroism (CD), and molecular modelling were examined for the wild-type (non-mutant) and mutant enzymes. The pepsin mutations, Lys-319 → Met and Lys-319 → Glu, resulted in a progressive increase in the Km and similar decrease in k, respectively, as well as being denatured at a lower pH than the wild-type pepsin. CD analysis indicated that mutations at Lys-319 resulted in changes in secondary structure fractions which were reflected in changes in enzymatic activity as compared to the wild-type pepsin, i.e. kinetic data and pH denaturation study. Molecular modelling of mutant enzymes indicated differences in flexibility in the flap loop region of the active site, the region around the entrance of the active site cleft, subsite regions for peptide binding, and in the subdomains of the C-terminal domain when compared to the wild-type enzyme.

INTRODUCTIONThe enzymes belonging to the aspartic proteinases (EC 3.4.23.X) possess remarkable homology in their tertiary structures (Pitts et al., 1992). X-ray crystallographic data reveal that this group of enzymes shares a bilobal symmetry, with the two structural domains separated by a hinged substrate binding cleft. Two active site aspartic residues occupy the cleft to which admittance is restricted by a hinged flexible flap region (Suzuki et al., 1989). Although high in structural homology, these enzymes differ markedly in their catalytic properties, indicating that their activity is a result of subtle differences in protein structure.Porcine pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1), a prominent member of the aspartic proteinases, was one of the first enzymes to be studied and the second to be crystallized (Northrop, 1930). Consequently, pepsin is the best understood of this family of proteinases and has been used as a model to study related enzymes (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1990; Lin et al., 1992). Pepsin is composed of 327 amino acid residues, has a calculated molecular mass of 34 kDa (Cooper et al., 1990), and is characterized by its low milk-clotting/proteolytic activity when compared with the milk-clotting enzyme of choice, chymosin (Suzuki et al., 1990). Previous investigations (Pearl and Blundell, 1984; Lin et al., 1989) into the functional activity of pepsin have been largely restricted to residues of the substrate binding pocket/active site due to their importance. This latter approach, however, assumes that the bulk of the protein structure plays a minor role in the functional activity of the enzyme, although mutations distal from the active site may influence enzymatic activity (Conrad, 1979). It has been suggested, recently, that enzymes behave more like mechanical devices than static biocatalysts implying areas external to the active site are vital to enzymatic activity (Williams, 1993).It was the purpose of this study to observe the effect of Lys-319 mutations on the catalytic (proteolytic activity) and structural properties (changes in secondary structure, molecular modelling) of pepsin. Lys-319 is the sole lysine in the entire mature pepsin molecule. Located near the back side of the active cleft, Lys-319 is believed to have little interaction with prosegment residues during folding and is exposed to solvent in the mature enzyme (Cooper et al., 1990). It was hypothesized that the surface-protruding Lys residue plays a role in the catalysis and conformational stability/flexibility of the molecule.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Mutagenesis ReagentsEscherichia coli SG20252 (lon−100 zba-300::Tn10) used for all protein expression along with the expression plasmid and pGBT-T19-pp containing the cDNA for porcine pepsinogen A were both kindly donated by Dr. Jordan Tang, Laboratory of Protein Studies, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK (Lin et al., 1989). The zymogen and the activated enzyme are subsequently referred to as pepsinogen and pepsin, respectively. The components used for in vitro mutagenesis were purchased from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, ON), and these included: E. coli strains, CJ236 (dut− ung−) and MV1190, bacteriophage M13mp19, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase. Restriction endonucleases, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Canada Ltd. (Laval, PQ). The two mutagenic 21-base oligonucleotide primers directing the glutamic acid, 5′-GCCAACAACGAGGTCGGCCTG-3′, and methionine, 5′-GCCAACAACATGGTCGGCCTG-3′, substitution of Lys-319 were synthesized in the Dept. of Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of Guelph. Primers used in M13 sequencing reactions were obtained from Oligo's Etc. Inc. (Wilsonview, OR).In Vitro MutagenesisSite-directed mutagenesis was based on the method of Zoller and Smith(1982). Increased mutagenic efficiency was obtained using uracil-containing template (Kunkel, 1985). The procedure supplied by Bio-Rad with the in vitro mutagenesis kit was followed. The 1.3-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)FPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. fragment from the EcoRI digestion of pGBT-T19-pp, containing the pepsinogen cDNA, was subcloned into the EcoRI site of bacteriophage M13mp19. Single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA was prepared and used as a template along with the mutagenic primers for the mutagenesis reactions. Putative clones were sequenced, and mutations were confirmed in triplicate using the Core Facility for Protein/DNA Chemistry, Dept. of Biochemistry, Queen's University, Kingston, ON. The entire pepsinogen cDNA (1.3 kb) was sequenced to confirm the absence of any spontaneous mutations. The 1.3-kb EcoRI fragment from a sequenced mutant was subcloned back into pGBT-T19, and its orientation was confirmed by SstI restriction analysis. The novel proteins were expressed following transformation of E. coli SG20252 with the mutant expression plasmid. The resultant mutant proteins are referred to as Lys-319 → Glu and Lys-319 → Met for the glutamic acid and methionine mutations, respectively. The nonmutated protein is designated as wild-type.Protein Purification and RefoldingE. coli SG20252, transformed with plasmid pGBT-T19-pp was cultured using a 2% inoculum in a 2-liter New Brunswick Fermentation vessel Multigen F2000 (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON) containing 1.5 liters of TB medium (Sambrook et al., 1989) with 50 mg/liter ampicillin. The temperature was maintained at 37°C, agitation was set at 200 rpm, and air was bubbled through at a rate of 4 liters/min. Fermentation was terminated when inclusion bodies were prominent (24-36 h), occupying approximately 20% of the cell volume when viewed using phase contrast microscopy. The cells were ruptured, and inclusion bodies were washed and isolated as described previously by Lin et al.(1989) with some exceptions. Following the last 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 10 wash, the inclusion bodies were solubilized in 50 ml of 8 M urea, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol at 31°C for 2 h (Tichy et al., 1993). Residual insolubles were removed by ultracentrifugation at 286,000 × g for 2 h. The clear supernatant was diluted dropwise into a slowly stirred solution of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (4 liters). After standing 2 h at 21°C, the solution was cooled to 4°C and ammonium sulfate was added to 80% saturation (Englared and Seifter, 1990). Following 12 h at 4°C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min, desalted by dialysis, and centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 1 h to remove insoluble material. The clarified protein solution was subsequently purified by Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with an anion exchange Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) as described by Lin et al.(1989).Circular Dichroism (CD)CD spectra of the various enzymes were measured using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) constantly flushed with nitrogen at 25°C. Mature enzymes were prepared by incubating the zymogens at 37°C for 20 min in buffer containing 0.1 M citrate-HCl buffer (pH 2.1). Salts and small peptides were removed by dialysis against 10 mM citrate-HCl, pH 2.1 buffer. For the pH 5.3 samples, the pH 2.1 sample was raised by adding 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.3, and dialyzed against 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.3. The final protein concentration of the dialyzed samples (pH 2.1 and 5.3) was approximately 0.1 mg/ml. Samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm nylon filter and degassed under vacuum prior to analysis. Far-UV CD spectra (190-250 nm) were recorded within 30 min of sample preparation using a 0.1-cm pathlength cuvette and scanned five times. Spectra were corrected for the buffer baseline. Actual protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the following relationship: A280 of 1.0 is equal to 1.3 mg/ml (Lin et al., 1989). Secondary structure fractions for the various enzymes were determined from the far-UV CD spectra using the algorithm of Chang et al.(1978).Kinetic MeasurementsA synthetic octapeptide Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-(p-nitro)Phe-Ala-Leu (Fusek et al. 1990) synthesized at the Central Facility of the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, McMaster University, Hamilton ON, was used for the kinetic studies. Hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored spectrophotometrically at 300 nm in a Shimadzu UV260 recording spectrophotometer (Mandel Scientific, Guelph, ON) with external temperature control of the reaction chamber (Lauda RMT20 circulating water bath, Brinkmann Instruments Canada Limited, Rexdale, ON). The initial slopes of the progress curves were measured to yield ΔA/min. Michaelis-Menton kinetics were observed. Plots of 1/v against 1/[S] (Lineweaver-Burk) as well as [S]/v against [S] (Hanes) permitted the fitting of a straight line by linear regression. At least five substrate concentrations from the appropriate range were used for determining initial rates (v). Vmax and Km were derived from the Hanes plots due to the regularity of errors (Cornish-Bowden, 1979). Pepsinogens were activated by incubation at 37°C for 20 min in buffer containing 0.1 M citrate and HCl (pH 2.1) at 37°C for 20 min. The activated solutions were then placed on ice during the assays. Concentrations of active enzyme were determined by titration of a known volume of enzyme against a solution of pepstatin A (0.0833 mM in methanol). The amount of pepstatin A was taken to be equivalent to the amount of active enzyme in the sample. All kinetic studies were carried out in a 0.1 M citrate-HCl, pH 2.1 buffer except for the pH dependence experiments. Data points were based on two separate trials of duplicate determinations using substrate concentrations from 0.025 mM to 0.165 mM.pH Activity ProfilesThe pH activity profiles, over a pH range of 1.0 to 7.0, for the various enzymes were generated by incubating 0.2 nmol of the enzyme in a 0.07 mM (2 × Km) solution of the synthetic octapeptide Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-(p-nitro)Phe-Ala-Leu in the appropriate buffer and monitoring the change in absorbance at 300 nm over a 5-min period at 37°C. The following buffers were used: 0.05 M KCl-HCl for pH 1.0 through 2.0, 0.05 M glycine-HCl for pH 2.0 through 3.5, 0.05 M sodium citrate-citric acid for pH 3.5 through 5.6, and 0.05 M sodium acetate for pH 5.6 through 7. Data were reported as percent relative activity expressed as a percentage of the highest activity over the pH ranged examined for the enzyme in question. Analyses were done in duplicate.Energy Minimization and Molecular DynamicsEnergy minimizations and molecular dynamics simulations of pepsin were performed using the program Discover 2.9.5 (Biosym Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA) on an IBM Risc System/6000 computer. Crystal structure coordinates for wild-type pepsin were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (entry name 4PEP). Initial models of the mutant enzymes were constructed from the wild-type pepsin model by replacing the Lys-319 residue with the appropriate residue, i.e. Glu or Met. The consistent valence force field (Daube-Osguthorpe et al., 1988) was used for force field potentials throughout the calculation. In the initial minimization calculation, the steepest descents method was used, in which the line search direction is defined along the direction of the local downhill gradient -E(xi, yi) and was performed for 4000 iterations with a maximum derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol. The minimized models were then used for molecular dynamic simulations using the Verlet leapfrog algorithm (Verlet, 1967). The time step used was 1 fs at a temperature of 300 K, and the iteration was 5000. The neighbor list was updated every 50 time steps. After the 5-ps simulation, flexibility indices, which were the distances between appropriate α-carbons in the initial model and in the simulated model, were calculated at each α-carbon from the coordinate at every 50 fs.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe amino acid sequence of porcine pepsinogen, deduced from automated dideoxy terminator sequencing confirmed the sequence as reported by Lin et al.(1989) (data not shown). The molecular mass (34 kDa) and purity of the activated product, i.e. pepsin, were confirmed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (data not shown).Two mutations were introduced into the porcine pepsin gene using M13 in vitro mutagenesis as described by Kunkel(1985). The efficiency of the technique (75%) was such that screening was unnecessary. Confirmation of mutagenesis was accomplished by sequencing several plaques. The confirmed mutagenic 1.3-kb EcoRI fragments from M13 were subcloned back into the original pGBT-T19 vector. Restriction analysis, using SstI, of the newly constructed expression plasmids confirmed correct construction and orientation of the insert.Refolding of expressed proteins followed the protocol of Lin et al.(1989) and elution patterns similar to those described by these authors for the various proteins on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration were observed (data not shown). FPLC anion exchange chromatography of the various proteins indicated that the wild-type pepsinogen eluted at approximately 15 min while Lys-319 → Glu and Lys-319 → Met pepsinogens eluted at approximately 16 min (data not shown). The delay in elution of the two mutant proteins was likely the result of the increase in the net negative charge of the mutants interacting with the anionite resin. The chromatographic data, however, would indicate that the refolded structures of both mutants as well as the wild-type protein were similar.The hydrolytic and autolytic activity of pepsin is reduced at pH 6, and its activity is fully regained upon acidification (Ryle, 1966). However, at pH values above 6.0, the enzyme is rapidly and irreversibly denatured (Cooper et al., 1990). A downward shift in the upper pH limit of activity for Lys-319 → Met and Lys-319 → Glu, using the synthetic peptide, to just below pH 4.0 (from pH 6.0 for the native pepsin) was observed (Fig. 1) and suggests a decrease in the pH of alkaline denaturation. Further investigation into the pH activity of the mutant proteins confirmed that the inactivation pH had been shifted to approximately pH 4.0. Both mutant proteins lost activity following incubation for 4 h at pH 5.3. Alkaline denaturation of pepsin is reported to be a result of irreversible denaturation in the N terminus domain (Lin et al., 1993). Similarly, this decrease in pH activity from pH 6.0 to 4.0 for Lys-319 → Met and Lys-319 → Glu enzymes suggests that the mutations to Lys-319 caused parts of the C-terminal domain to be unstable similar to that observed in the N terminus by Lin et al.(1993). Although there was a substantial decrease in the inactivation pH for the mutants, there was no appreciable shift in the pH optimum (Fig. 1). Wild-type pepsin exhibited a broad range of optimum activity for this synthetic substrate, maintaining greater than 90% of its activity above pH 4.0. Both mutants displayed narrow optimum pH values around pH 2 with the Lys-319 → Glu mutant displaying less than 20% activity at pH 1.4.The peptide, Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-(p-nitro)Phe-Ala-Leu, was chosen as the substrate for the present study due to its high solubility characteristics and excellent sensitivity for pepsin and other aspartic proteinases (Fusek et al., 1990). The Km values for cleavage of the synthetic octapeptide increased in the order of wild-type, Lys-319 → Met, Lys-319 → Glu pepsins (Table 1). As the Km values increased, k values for the mutant enzymes decreased in the same order (wild-type pepsin, Lys-319 → Met, Lys-319 → Glu) suggesting that the mutations have created general conformational changes to the active site area. Furthermore, the ratio of k/Km decreased in the order of wild-type pepsin, Lys-319 → Met pepsin, and finally Lys-319 → Glu pepsin. Taken together, these results would indicate that both the catalytic function and substrate recognition of the pepsin molecule were affected by the mutations, the Lys-319 → Glu mutation having a greater effect than the Lys-319 → Met mutation.Table I Open table in a new tab Supportive data to those observed for the kinetic parameters and pH denaturation study were seen in the analysis of CD spectral data for the various pepsins (Table 2). Comparison of secondary structure fractions of the various pepsins at pH 2.1 and 5.3 indicated changes in α-helix and β-sheet fractions, the magnitude being more substantial for the mutant enzymes as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Secondary structure fractions for the wild-type pepsin were similar to those reported by previous researchers (James and Sielecki, 1986; Yada and Nakai, 1986).Table II Open table in a new tab Differences in catalytic parameters for the various pepsins observed at pH 2.1 (Table 1), may have been a reflection of the proportion of α-helix and β-sheet fractions where the Lys-319 → Glu mutant had a higher α-helix and lower β-sheet content than either the wild-type or Lys-319 → Met pepsins. The β-sheet content of pepsin may be responsible for the structural flexibility (or stability) given that the CD (Yada and Nakai, 1986) and crystallographic (James and Sielecki, 1986; Abad-Zapatero et al., 1990) studies indicate that pepsin is a β-sheet dominant protein. Examination of the β-sheet contents from CD data indicated that the Lys-319 → Glu and Lys-319 → Met mutants exhibited a high degree of structural flexibility which may have resulted in decreased enzymatic activities as compared to the wild-type pepsin, i.e. the β-sheet contents of these mutants, especially Lys-319 → Glu, were much smaller than that of the wild-type as calculated from crystallographic data (approximately 40%). The substantial changes in α-helix and β-sheet fractions seen in the mutant enzymes, as a function of increasing pH, corresponded to the absence of detectable enzymatic activity at pH 5.3 (see Fig. 1). However, upon examination of secondary structure fractions of the mutant proteins and the wild-type pepsin at pH 5.3, only slight differences exist indicating that the loss of enzymatic activity occurs with only minor changes in structure. Although valuable structural information is obtained from the analysis of CD data, no details regarding precise location of structural fraction(s) or identification of areas of structural change are obtained.Recently, computer modelling/simulations have become a valuable tool in yielding information as to the possible effects of mutations on protein structure. The minimized structures of the Lys-319 → Glu and Lys-319 → Met pepsins were almost identical with that of wild-type pepsin except for residues around the mutated lysine residue. The total energies for the initial models of wild-type, Lys-319 → Glu, and Lys-319 → Met pepsins were 10,508.6 kcal/mol, 10,522.0, and 10,492.3 which decreased to 2,960.94, 2,928.81, and 2,954.63 after the energy minimizing calculations, respectively. In the minimized models, root mean square deviations of main chains were 0.008 Å between the wild-type and Lys-319 → Glu mutant and 0.007 Å between the wild-type and Lys-319 → Met mutant. These results suggested that the static structure of pepsin was not affected by the replacement of Lys-319; however, flexibility of the molecules may have been affected. Changes in flexibility may have accounted for the changes seen in the above CD data and the enzyme activity data of the mutant enzymes as compared to the wild-type enzyme. To estimate the flexibility of the molecules, molecular dynamics simulations on the minimized wild-type and mutant pepsin models were applied. Distances of α-carbon at each 50 fs from the initial position were calculated from the neighbor coordinate list yielded from the simulations. The maximum values of the α-carbon deviations were taken as an index of flexibility at each residue. The flexibility indices are shown in Fig. 2. Differences in the flexibility index among wild-type and mutants were plotted in order to determine the effect of the mutation of Lys-319 on the flexibility of the pepsin molecule (Fig. 3, A and B). As suggested from the CD data, substantial effects on the flexibility indices were observed in several sites which are suggested or assigned as essential segments for catalysis. These sites include a flap loop covering the active site, regions near the entrance of the active site cleft, regions which experience large movement upon inhibitor binding (subsite for peptide binding) (Chen et al., 1992), and subdomains of the C-terminal domain. In pepsin, the flap loop is a very flexible part of the enzyme. The indices of wild-type were around 1.5 to 4 Å throughout the loop. However, both mutants showed much larger indices on the loop. In the Lys-319 → Met mutant, the largest index found in the molecule was observed in the loop. These differences suggest that the loops in the mutants are bending in a different manner from the loop in wild-type. Other large differences among the mutants and the wild-type were observed around the two helices in the N-terminal domain and the one loop in the C-terminal domain, all of which are at the entrance of the active cleft. In addition to these changes, larger or smaller values in the mutants than the wild-type were observed in some subsite regions for peptide binding (Chen et al., 1992). For example, Phe-117 in subsite S1 of both mutants showed a smaller index than wild-type by −1.2 Å, and Gly-34 in S1 of Lys-319 → Met showed a larger index by 2.5 Å. The largest differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins, however, were observed at subdomains of the C-terminal domain. Abad-Zapatero et al.(1990) suggested that the flexibility of these subdomains plays a structural role in mediating substrate binding or determining the substrate specificity. Large differences in the indices between the mutants and wild-type were observed in the subdomain regions, i.e. from 3.0 Å at Ile-252 of Lys-319 → Glu mutant to −3.7 Å at Asp-242 of Lys-319 → Met mutant. These differences observed on molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the Lys-319 replacement resulted in large effects on the structural flexibility which is essential for effective catalysis.Figure 2:The maximum movement of α-carbon during the molecular dynamics simulations.

This thought gives rationality to the bulk of an enzyme's structure, which is mostly thought of as incidental when considering merely the active site and subsite binding pockets, as the catalytic machinery. Pepsin has been shown to be extremely flexible in several areas including subdomains in the C-terminal domain (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1990) and the entrance region of the active cleft (Chen et al., 1992). It is proposed that the induced mutations in pepsin at Lys-319 disrupts the enzymatic activity by changing the flexibility of the entire protein molecule and, thereby, altering the catalytic activity of the enzyme. INTRODUCTIONThe enzymes belonging to the aspartic proteinases (EC 3.4.23.X) possess remarkable homology in their tertiary structures (Pitts et al., 1992). X-ray crystallographic data reveal that this group of enzymes shares a bilobal symmetry, with the two structural domains separated by a hinged substrate binding cleft. Two active site aspartic residues occupy the cleft to which admittance is restricted by a hinged flexible flap region (Suzuki et al., 1989). Although high in structural homology, these enzymes differ markedly in their catalytic properties, indicating that their activity is a result of subtle differences in protein structure.Porcine pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1), a prominent member of the aspartic proteinases, was one of the first enzymes to be studied and the second to be crystallized (Northrop, 1930). Consequently, pepsin is the best understood of this family of proteinases and has been used as a model to study related enzymes (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1990; Lin et al., 1992). Pepsin is composed of 327 amino acid residues, has a calculated molecular mass of 34 kDa (Cooper et al., 1990), and is characterized by its low milk-clotting/proteolytic activity when compared with the milk-clotting enzyme of choice, chymosin (Suzuki et al., 1990). Previous investigations (Pearl and Blundell, 1984; Lin et al., 1989) into the functional activity of pepsin have been largely restricted to residues of the substrate binding pocket/active site due to their importance. This latter approach, however, assumes that the bulk of the protein structure plays a minor role in the functional activity of the enzyme, although mutations distal from the active site may influence enzymatic activity (Conrad, 1979). It has been suggested, recently, that enzymes behave more like mechanical devices than static biocatalysts implying areas external to the active site are vital to enzymatic activity (Williams, 1993).It was the purpose of this study to observe the effect of Lys-319 mutations on the catalytic (proteolytic activity) and structural properties (changes in secondary structure, molecular modelling) of pepsin. Lys-319 is the sole lysine in the entire mature pepsin molecule. Located near the back side of the active cleft, Lys-319 is believed to have little interaction with prosegment residues during folding and is exposed to solvent in the mature enzyme (Cooper et al., 1990). It was hypothesized that the surface-protruding Lys residue plays a role in the catalysis and conformational stability/flexibility of the molecule."

The six monoclonal antibodies that displayed greater than 30% inhibition of E. coli PDHc were unable to inhibit porcine heart PDHc nor did they bind porcine heart PDHc according to dot blot analysis. Radiolabeling gave binding constants ranging from 5 to 10 × 108M−1 on these six monoclonal antibodies, with greater than 80% of maximal inhibition achieved in less than 1 min.

In some of these studies, there were reported polyclonal rabbit antibodies being made against various species of PDHc and its subunits. Two studies reported that these rabbit antibodies have the ability to inhibit various species of PDHc activity to some extent(22Sheu K.R. Kim Y.T. J.

Although immunochemical inhibition of PDHc was not the major emphasis of these reports, they do constitute the first reported immununochemical inhibition of PDHc. Interest in another clinical disorder, primary biliary cirrhosis, has resulted in monoclonal antibodies being generated to the human E2 component of PDHc (24Bjoerkland A. Mendel-Hartvig I.

In addition, further biochemical characterization was done on six that displayed high levels of inhibition. A new chromophoric assay has been developed for measuring E1 activity in the PDHc, and its application provides complementary support for the conclusions. These findings 1) represent the first reported MAbs to aerobic K-12 E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase and its E1 subunit, 2) represent the first MAbs to bind and inhibit the E1 subunit, and 3) provide relevant information for future studies that will continue to define the E1 active center and the thiamin diphosphate binding site, since no high resolution x-ray studies have yet been reported for this enzyme.

ELISA plates were purchased from Costar; removable microtiter plate wells were from Dynatech Laboratories Inc.; Falcon T25 flasks, Falcon Petri plates, Falcon Microtest III 96-well plates, and Falcon 6- and 24-well Multiwell plates were from Becton Dickinson Labware. EDTA, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin were from Boehringer Mannheim; MES was from Calbiochem; Paragon high resolution electrophoresis gels were from Beckman. The PDHc was purified from E. coli K-12 cells purchased from Grain Processing Corp. (Muscatine, IA). The PDHc complex was purified (26Reed L. Mukherjee B. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 55-61Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 27Speckhard D. Frey P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 62: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with the modifications outlined below. During the extraction step, a French press was used with an extraction pressure of greater than 20,000 p.s.i. Throughout the entire purification, all buffers had a constant concentration of 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, and 2 mg/liter pepstatin to minimize proteolysis. Finally, Bio-Rad DNA grade hydroxylapatite (28Tsiselius A. Hjerten S. Levin O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1956; 65: 132-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) was substituted for the calcium phosphate gel. Resolution of the E1 subunit from the complex was done according to Angelides et al.(29Angelides K. Akiyawa S. Hammes G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purified complex was dialyzed at pH 9.5 and placed over a Sepharose 6B column monitored at 280 and 450 nm. The two peaks were pooled and dialyzed against pH 7.0. At 4°C, 0.36 g/ml of (NH4)2SO4 was added to the second peak pool, which was then centrifuged. An additional 0.1 mg/ml (NH4)2SO4 (70%) was added to the supernatant and centrifuged. The pellets were redissolved at pH 7.0, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit(30Hupe D. Behrens N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The second pellet was used for all experiments involving E1. According to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar), both the complex and the E1 subunit were more than 95% pure. Female, BALB/c, 4-6-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 100 μg of PDHc or E1 antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant and with incomplete Freund's each month thereafter. Once an orbital test bleed inhibited 1000 units/liter of PDHc activity, greater than 95% fusion took place. The activity of PDHc was assayed (32Maldonado M.E. Oh K.J. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2711-2716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was adapted to the Cobas Bio centrifugal analyzer instrument (Roche Diagnostic Systems). Mouse sera were added to the PDHc enzyme, and after a 1-h incubation, inhibitory activity was measured. This method was also used to determine the type of inhibition caused by monoclonal antibody 18A9.1.3PDHc when generating a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The hybridomas were produced by a modification of the protocol of Kohler and Milstein(33Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12692) Google Scholar). 3 days before the fusion, the selected mouse was boosted intraperitoneally with 100 μg of antigen. The spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma (NSO) cells at a 5:1 ratio (spleen:NSO) using 50% polyethylene glycol (Mr 4000). Fused cells were plated in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 0.4 μM aminopterin, and 16 μM thymidine), supplemented with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% FBS. After 10 days, supernatants from the wells were screened for antibodies specific to the antigen by the described ELISA and the inhibition assay. All hybridoma supernatants from wells that contained 50-60% cell growth were screened for specific binding to PDHc initially, and those positives were then screened for E1 binding by employing an indirect solid-phase microtiter plate ELISA. Microtiter plates were coated with 12 μg/ml PDHc or E1 antigen incubated and washed with a PBS Tween washing buffer. The plates were blocked with 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide and stored at 4°C for use. For assay, the respective hybridoma supernatant was added to the well, incubated at 37°C, and washed. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgA, and IgM mixture was added, incubated, and washed, and then substrate was added. The substrate was a 5-mg tablet of p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt dissolved in 5 ml of diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, containing 0.2 mM MgCl2. Plates were incubated, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 N NaOH, and absorbances were read at 405 nm. Selected hybridomas were switched to Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% FBS and hypoxanthine/thymidine (0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine and 16 μM thymidine). Those cell lines that continued to produce the desired antibodies were cloned by the soft agar technique. The colonies were picked and plated into a 96-well plate, and the procedure was repeated until a 100% clone was obtained. Cells that were 100% cloned were grown up and frozen (−80°C) in 10% Me2SO, 90% FBS at 1 × 106 cells/ml/vial. Antibody subclass was determined using the ELISA described above and using subclass-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated enzymes. Antibody subclasses were determined from culture supernatants prior to injecting cells for ascites production. Balb/c mice, 3 months old, pretreated 7 days earlier with Pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethyl-pentadecane) were injected intraperitoneally with 1 × 106 cells in PBS. The ascites fluid was collected approximately 2 weeks after injection by tapping the mice two to four times at 2-day intervals. All ascites taps were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The ascites from each respective clone were pooled and frozen at −70°C. The activity of PDHc was assayed according to Maldonado et al.(32Maldonado M.E. Oh K.J. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2711-2716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was adapted to the Cobas Bio centrifugal analyzer instrument (Roche Diagnostic Systems). Mouse sera or dialyzed tissue culture supernatants from positive PDHc ELISA-screened clones were first diluted serially with 20 mM potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% BSA. These diluted solutions were then added to an equal volume of the same buffer containing 2000 units/liter of PDHc enzyme. After mixing, the solution was incubated at 4°C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, the enzyme activity was measured. Percent inhibition was calculated by dividing the activity remaining by the total activity placed into the mixture minus 1, and times 100. This method was also used to determine the activity in the presence of MAbs. The method of Ey et al.(34Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar) was adapted to the Waters HPLC to purify the MAbs using the Bio-Rad Affi-Prep protein A MAPS Prep HPLC column. In the reported work, only IgG1 antibodies were purified. The column was first washed with 0.02 M PBS, pH 7.5, and then equilibrated with 1 M glycine, 3 M NaCl buffer, pH 9.0. 3 ml of ascites fluid was diluted 1:2 with the 1 M glycine, 3 M NaCl buffer, filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore membrane, loaded on the column, and eluted until the protein peak appearing at 280 nm was resolved to less than 0.05 absorbance units. Next, 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 6.0, was applied, and the protein peak of interest was eluted. The column was then stripped with 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 3.5. The pH 6.0 fraction pool was dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium phosphate with 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.5, and the concentration of the IgG was determined at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.5 g−1 liter cm−1(35Palmer J.L. Nisonoff A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To assess the purity of the MAbs, non-denaturing electrophoresis was performed on the Beckman Paragon gel electrophoresis system according to the product package insert. Briefly, the sample was diluted in the manufacturer's 0.075 M barbital buffer, pH 8.6, applied to the high resolution electrophoresis gels, and then electrophoresed at 200 V for 55 min. The gel was then stained with the manufacturers Paragon blue stain, destained in acetic acid, and dried in the Beckman Paragon gel dryer. All Western blots were performed according to standard procedures with the following exceptions. In place of the nitrocellulose membrane, polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad), was used. Milk diluent (casein) from Kirkegaard and Perry was used as a blocking buffer. The TMB membrane peroxidase substrate system was used as the substrate, and the wash buffer was PBS Tween. In addition, 0.5-mm mini-gels were used instead of 1.5-mm slab gels (Bio-Rad). 1 mg of purified PDHc or E1 was run on the mini-gel, and the gel was transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper. Each ascites fluid was diluted 1:2000, and the second antibody (Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase) was used at 1:5000 dilution. Radiolabeling the PDHc antigen was performed using the Bio-Rad Enzymobead™ radioiodination reagent according to Morrison and Bayse(36Morrison M. Bayse G. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To 50 μl of enzymobeads, pH 9.5, was added 50 μg of PDHc or E1, 30 μl of 1%β-D-glucose (all in 0.05 M potassium Pi, pH 7.5), and 1 mCi of Na125I. The reaction was incubated for 25 min at room temperature, and then 150 μl of 5% BSA in 0.05 M potassium Pi, pH 7.5, was added. The material was next chromatographed on a 1 × 30-cm Sepharose G-100 column eluting with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.02% NaN3. The first radioactive peak was pooled and 1% BSA was added. Specific activities were determined to range from 2.0 to 3.0 μCi/μg. Concentrated radiolabeled PDHc or E1 stock was diluted in 20 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.0, containing 1% BSA, 0.1% NaN3, to 20,000 cpm per 50 ml of buffer. Each MAb ascites was diluted 1:500 in the same buffer. 50 μl of respective label and 100 μl of a respective MAb were added to each test tube. All tubes were vortexed and allowed to incubate overnight at 4°C. To each tube, 25 μl of a 10% solution of goat anti-mouse Kynar was then added. The tubes were vortexed and allowed to incubate for 15 min at room temperature. 4 ml of 150 mM NaCl was then added, and the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min. The liquid was decanted, and the contents of the tubes were counted. Experiments were conducted to determine if any of the monoclonal antibodies could interfere with the inhibition of PDHc by GTP. Assay conditions were the same as in Schwartz and Reed (10Schwartz E.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1434-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) except 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, was used in place of potassium Pi. All MAb ascites were diluted 1:10 in 0.1% BSA in 20 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.0, and were incubated with 20-30 μg of PDHc enzyme, approximately 600 IU/liter, for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was then assayed in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM GTP. A nonspecific MAb was also included to show the effect of ascites. In addition, the total activity of the enzyme was determined with and without GTP present. The inhibitory effect of GTP was calculated for each MAb. MAbs 21C3 and 18A9 were not included in this study because of the high degree of inhibition they exhibited in the absence of GTP. MAb 15A9 was then purified on a protein A column. Known amounts of purified 15A9 were incubated with 30 μg of PDHc, as described above, beginning with the highest concentration of 6.25 μM and titrated to a final concentration of 0.02 μM 15A9. HPLC-purified MAb 1F2 was coated on microtiter plates at 10 μg/ml in 20 mM NaPi, pH 7.5, with 0.065% sodium azide (50 μl/well). The plates were washed and blocked as previously described. To each separately coated antibody plate well, 50 μl of radiolabeled E1, approximately 10,000 cpm, and 50 μl of one purified MAb (either 7C9 or 13A8) at various stated concentrations was added. Both the label and the purified MAb were diluted in 0.1% BSA, 20 mM sodium Pi, pH 7.5. Competition between the bound and the soluble antibody for the labeled E1 was allowed to proceed overnight at 4°C. The plates were then washed three times with PBS Tween. The contents of each well were removed, placed in a test tube, and counted in a γ counter. A Schleicher and Schuell Minifold 96-well filtration system for dot-blot assays was used. Nitrocellulose (0.45 mm) was soaked in 20 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.0, and placed in the apparatus along with a blotting pad. A vacuum was applied, and 500 μl of 20 mM potassium Pi was added to all 96 wells. Porcine heart (Sigma) and purified E. coli PDHc were used as antigens to be blotted. The specific activity of the porcine heart enzyme was 0.45 IU/mg and of the E. coli PDHc was 30 IU/mg. The porcine heart PDHc was diluted to 1 mg/ml (0.45 IU) and serially diluted in 20 mM potassium Pi to 115 ng/ml total protein. The E. coli PDHc was diluted to 15 μg/ml (0.45 IU) and then serially diluted to 0.92 ng/ml. To each respective Minifold well, 1 ml of the respective protein was added and vacuum applied, and 2 ml of buffer was run through each of the minifold wells. The nitrocellulose paper was removed, blocked with casein blocking diluent overnight at 4°C, and washed three times with PBS Tween. Each blot set was incubated with 1 mg/ml of purified respective MAb diluted in casein diluent overnight at 4°C and washed. The strips were then incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase for 2 h at 25°C, washed, and then added to the TMB substrate described in the Western blotting section. The strips were incubated for 10 min at 25°C and then washed in water to stop the reaction. The E1 assay was developed on the Cobas FARA™ centrifugal analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) with the following final concentrations of substrate reagents: 5.0 mM pyruvate, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ThDP, 1.25 mM 4,4′-dithiodipyridine, and 1.25 mM 4-mercaptopyridine in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.7. To 80 μl of enzyme sample was added 150 μl of substrate reagents and 15 μl of a water flush. A blank was recorded, and the reaction was monitored at 380 nm. A 15-s lag time was used, and 16 readings were taken at 5-s intervals at a reaction temperature of 20°C. An ∊380 = 72,200 was used to monitor the formation of the product of the reaction, N-acetyl-4-thiopyridine(37Annan N. Paris R. Jordan F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8895-8901Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ascites fluid or purified MAbs were diluted in 20 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.0, with 0.1% BSA, added to various concentrations of purified PDHc or E1, and then incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The solutions were then run according to the E1 assay. Fig. 1 illustrates the linearity of the assay under the optimal conditions, while Fig. SI shows the chemistry (see (38McNally, A.

Out of these two fusions, 21 MAbs were selected and cloned to homogeneity. 11 antibody clones resulted from the E1 fusion and were assigned an E1 suffix. The remaining 10 resulted from the PDHc fusion and were assigned the suffix PDHc. Isotyping studies done on tissue culture supernatants showed 20 of the monoclonal antibodies to be IgG1 and 1 to be an IgG3. Experiments were conducted to determine the maximum inhibition produced by each MAb. All 21 ascites fluids were first titered in a microtiter plate with PDHc bound to the wells, and titers were expressed as one-half of the antibodies' maximum binding capacity. Each ascites had to have a titer of at least 2.5 × 103 to be used (one MAb, 12A9PDHc, failed to meet this criterion and was rejected). The remaining 20 ascites fluids were diluted, and the inhibition was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although it is known that the concentration of MAbs in ascites fluid can vary from one ascites to the next, the inhibition and radiolabel data were obtained under saturating conditions, as demonstrated by the stability of the results subsequent to more than one dilution. In addition, six of the MAbs (18A9, 21C3, 15A9, 1F2, 7C9, and 13A8) that exhibited greater than 30% inhibition were purified, and the maximum inhibition data summarized in Table 1 were verified by using greater than 700-fold molar excess of MAb to enzyme. To ensure that the inhibition was specific, ascites fluid from a non-relevant MAb was titered and demonstrated to give no inhibition. The extent of inhibition of PDHc by the remaining 20 MAbs is in the range from 0 to 99% (Table 1). Those monoclonal antibodies, which gave greater than 60% inhibition, were all generated from the PDHc immunogen, whereas those generated from the E1 antigen gave a maximum of 50% inhibition.Table I Open table in a new tab After all of the characterizations of the MAbs summarized in Table 1 were completed, 19 of the 20 monoclonal antibody ascites fluids remained. The remaining 19 antibodies were further evaluated by Western blot analysis. 14 of these MAbs were observed to bind the E1 subunit of the PDHc antigen of E. coli (data not shown). However, five of the MAbs (23H4, 8G10, 7C9, 8C9, and 13A8) did not show binding in Western blot analysis with PDHc or E1 from E. coli. Those five MAbs were reblotted at a higher concentration of ascites fluid and still did not demonstrate binding to E. coli PDHc or E1. Six MAbs (1"
https://openalex.org/W2091831914,"4-aminobutyrate metabolism in Escherichia coli begins with transport across the cytoplasmic membrane via the GabP, which is encoded by gabP. Although GabP is specific and exhibits poor affinity for many cellular constituents such as the alpha-amino acids, the range of compounds recognized with high affinity has yet to be investigated. In order to address this gap in knowledge, we developed a gabP-negative host strain, which permits evaluation of test compounds for inhibitory effects on cloned GabP (expression inducible by isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside). Using this inducible expression system, three structurally distinct categories of high affinity transport inhibitor were identified. The structural dissimilarity of these inhibitors significantly alters our view of ligand recognition by GabP. Any complete model must now account for the observation that inhibition of 4-aminobutyrate transport can be mediated either (i) by open chain analogs of 4-aminobutyrate, (ii) by cyclic amino acid analogs, or (iii) by planar heterocyclic compounds lacking a carboxyl group. Such results do not support a previously sustainable view of GabP that features a restrictive ligand recognition domain, unable to accommodate structures that differ very much from the native substrate, 4-aminobutyrate."

They catalyze the reversible electron transfer between pyridine nucleotides and electron carrier proteins such as ferredoxin or flavodoxin. In chloroplasts and cyanobacteria the reaction is driven toward NADP+ reduction, providing the NADPH necessary for CO2 fixation and other biosynthetic pathways(1Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Barber J.

In addition to this physiological reaction, FNR is able to catalyze in vitro the oxidation of NADPH by suitable electron acceptors like potassium ferricyanide (diaphorase activity) or the ferredoxin-cytochrome c system (cytochrome c reductase). These two activities have been extensively used to study the FNR catalytic mechanism ((1Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Barber J. The Light Reactions: Topics in Photosynthesis. Vol. 8.

From the available evidence it has been proposed that precursor proteins must be kept in a loosely folded state in order to be imported into plastids or mitochondria(9Eilers M. Schatz G.

The degree of defined structure has been determined in some recombinant precursors solubilized from bacterial inclusion bodies by the use of chaotropic agents. The physiological meaning of the resulting conformations is, however, uncertain, and in any event, structural measurements on these solubilized precursors yielded rather conflicting results. For instance, a low content of defined secondary structure could be demonstrated for the small ferredoxin precursor(11Pilon M. de Boer A.D. Knols S.L.

In the case of plastid-targeted flavoproteins, the mechanisms of import and cofactor attachment are still poorly understood, and our goal is to study these processes using chloroplast FNR as a model. A FAD-containing FNR precursor has been synthesized in wheat germ extracts supplemented with FAD, but neither the import competence nor the structure of the precursor holoprotein was determined(24Carrillo N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of a pea pre-FNR gene in Escherichia coli resulted in the accumulation of a nearly mature form of the reductase displaying catalytic and spectral properties that were very similar to those of the plant enzyme(25Ceccarelli E.A. Viale A.M. Krapp A.R. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14283-14287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transit peptide was removed by bacterial proteases in an apparently nonspecific reaction. The use of protease-deficient strains of E. coli largely prevented this processing, but the unprocessed precursor was insoluble (25Ceccarelli E.A. Viale A.M. Krapp A.R. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14283-14287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we describe the preparation and properties of a recombinant pre-FNR that contained bound FAD but was largely devoid of activity. Limited proteolysis of the purified precursor resulted in activation of the reductase in the absence of exogenously added FAD. The purified precursor protein was imported into isolated chloroplasts and processed to mature size. FNR cDNA clones were kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Gray, Cambridge University, United Kingdom. Construction of the expression vector pGF202 is shown in Fig. 1. A PstI-EcoRI cDNA fragment (1.3 kilobase pairs), containing pea pre-FNR coding sequences and part of the 3′-noncoding region(3Newman B.J. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) to generate recombinant plasmid pGF202. Two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (Biodynamics SRL, Buenos Aires) were annealed to provide the BamHI-PstI adaptor. 5′GATC A T C G AAGGCCGTATGGCTGCTGCA3′3′T A GC TTCCGGCATACCGACG5′ LINKER Note that the 5′-end region of the adaptor does not regenerate a BamHI site upon ligation to its cohesive site in pGEX-3X. The 3′-end nucleotides of this linker encode the first four residues of pre-FNR (Met and three Ala residues), that were missing in the 1.3-kilobase pair cDNA fragment(3Newman B.J. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The four codon supstream of the initial ATG encode the recognition sequence for restriction protease Xa(26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), with the cleavage site placed immediately before methionine 1 of pea pre-FNR. After amplification in transformed E. coli cells (strain AD202; (27Nakano H. Yamazaki T. Ikeda M. Masai H. Miyatake S. Saito T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) and isolation of double-stranded plasmid DNA, recombinant clones were selected by the presence of the insert and the disappearance of the BamHI restriction site in the plasmids. The sequence at the adaptor-joining locus was determined by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Recombinant DNA techniques were carried out following established procedures(28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Expression of pre-FNR in E. coli cells harboring plasmid pGF202, preparation of cell lysates, and purification of the GST-pre-FNR fusion were carried out using published methods(25Ceccarelli E.A. Viale A.M. Krapp A.R. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14283-14287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, bacterial crude extracts obtained from 400-800 ml of culture medium were applied to a 1.5 × 15-cm glutathione-agarose column (sulfur linkage; Sigma). With the aid of a peristaltic pump, the lysate was circulated through the agarose bead for 10 h at 6°C in order to ensure maximum binding. The column was then washed with 5 volumes of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, and two volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fusion product was finally eluted by 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and exhaustively dialyzed against TS medium (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl). Following cleavage with restriction factor Xa (Boehringer Mannheim), the digest was passed through glutathione-agarose, applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in TS medium, and washed with the same buffer. The first protein fraction eluting under these conditions contained electrophoretically pure FNR precursor. To obtain 35S-labeled pre-FNR, E. coli cells harboring plasmid pGF202 were cultured (8 h at 37°C, A550 = 0.6-0.8) in 0.25 × LB broth (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) containing 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin, and then supplemented with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1230 Ci/mmol) (DuPont). Following a 120-min incubation period under the same conditions, cells were harvested and disrupted, and the labeled pre-FNR was purified as described above. The specific activity of the purified precursor was estimated using a protein assay (30Sedmak J. Grossberg S. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar) and scintillation counting. Crude lysates, bacterial pellets, and purified samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels according to Laemmli(31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protease digestions were carried out at 25°C in 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml pre-FNR. The reactions were started by the addition of protease to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. At the indicated times, 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn into ice-cold tubes containing 5 μl of the corresponding protease inhibitor: 10 mM EDTA (thermolysin), soybean trypsin inhibitor (trypsin), or 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (chymotrypsin). A 10-μl aliquot was taken using a Hamilton syringe and immediately assayed for FNR activity. The rest of the sample was mixed with 0.25 volumes of 10 mM EDTA, 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) SDS, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 10-14-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum L., cv. Cuarentona Enana) using percoll gradient centrifugation (32Schreier P.H. Reiss B. Kuntz M. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Verma D.P.S. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer, Dordrecht1988: 1-22Google Scholar) and suspended in import buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mM sorbitol) at about 2 mg chlorophyll/ml. Plastid numbers per microliter of suspension were estimated by counting on a modified Neubauer camera. A standard import reaction contained the radiolabeled precursor (∼5 × 105 dpm at a pre-FNR concentration of about 0.4 μM), 5 × 107 chloroplasts, and (unless otherwise stated) 2.2 mM MgATP in import buffer. Pea leaf extracts, prepared according to Waegemann et al.(13Waegemann K. Paulsen H. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 89-92Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), were added at a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. The samples were incubated at 25°C for 30 min. At the end of the import reaction, thermolysin was added to the suspension to 100 μg/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min. The protease treatment was stopped by the addition of EDTA to 10 mM, and chloroplasts were reisolated by centrifugation through silicone oil layers (AR 200) according to Robinson and Walker(33Robinson S.P. Walker D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Aliquots from labeled precursor and import reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE(31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were treated for fluorography using 20% (w/v) diphenyloxazole in dimethyl sulfoxide (34Bar-Nun S. Ohad I. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 363-374Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and exposed to Kodak XAR x-ray films. The radioactive bands were excised using the developed fluorograms as a guide and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Import efficiency (the fraction of added protein imported by the chloroplasts in a 30-min assay) was calculated assuming that all methionine residues in pre-FNR were equally labeled. Thus the precursor contains 12 labeled residues, and the mature protein contains 11(3Newman B.J. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Preparation of stromal processing extracts and in vitro processing of purified pre-FNR were carried out essentially as described by Archer and Keegstra(35Archer K. Keegstra K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Amino terminal sequence analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems 477/A protein sequencer. Total protein was determined by a dye-binding assay(30Sedmak J. Grossberg S. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin or purified FNR as standards. Glutathione S-transferase, FNR diaphorase, and cytochrome c reductase activities were measured spectrophotometrically as described previously(29Serra E.C. Carrillo N. Krapp A.R. Ceccarelli E.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). FAD content of recombinant FNR was determined using high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection(24Carrillo N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded in a Hitachi 150-20 spectrophotometer and in a Jasco FP-770 spectrofluorometer, respectively. Expression vector pGF202 (Fig. 1) contains the entire coding sequence of pre-FNR fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the Schistozoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase gene cloned in plasmid pGEX-3X (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). A target sequence for protease Xa was introduced with the oligonucleotide adaptor (Fig. 1). The new cleavage site is placed immediately prior to methionine 1 of pea pre-FNR. The construct is under the control of the tac promoter(26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), providing high level synthesis of the GST-pre-FNR fusion upon induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The presence of pea FNR polypeptides in E. coli cells was studied by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting(28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). An immunoreactive peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa was detected in the soluble fraction of disrupted bacteria (not shown). This size agrees fairly well with that expected for the fusion protein between GST (27 kDa; (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar)) and pre-FNR (40 kDa; (3Newman B.J. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). As already reported for the GST-FNR fusion expressed in E. coli(29Serra E.C. Carrillo N. Krapp A.R. Ceccarelli E.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), several reactive bands of smaller size were also evident (data not shown, but see below). The appearance of both the full-length and shorter reactive peptides was strictly dependent on isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction. The amount of recombinant protein produced in AD202 cells, estimated in a large number of assays by slot blot and immunoreaction(25Ceccarelli E.A. Viale A.M. Krapp A.R. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14283-14287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ranged between 1 and 3% of the total cell protein (not shown). Following disruption of induced cells and fractionation of their contents, about 70% of the reactive material was recovered in the soluble fraction. The remainder was found aggregated into bacterial pellets and was largely represented by truncated species (not shown). A protocol described for the purification of GST fusions (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar, 29Serra E.C. Carrillo N. Krapp A.R. Ceccarelli E.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used to isolate GST-pre-FNR from transformed bacteria. The fusion protein was first bound to a glutathione-agarose matrix and then eluted with glutathione, together with the truncated immunoreactive products present in the crude lysates (Fig. 2A, lane1). The fraction eluted from the column displayed GST activity but little or no FNR-diaphorase (not shown). Incubation of this extract with factor Xa resulted in the disappearance of the fusion product, with accumulation of a 40-kDa protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-4). However, a peptide with electrophoretic mobility similar to that of mature FNR also accumulated as incubation progressed, indicating that some processing of the transit peptide might have occurred (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-4). Digestion of the prepiece was strictly dependent on the addition of Factor Xa, suggesting that degradation was caused by the coagulation factor itself or by traces of a contaminating protease. Absorption of a 15-min digest on glutathione-agarose removed most GST and undigested fusion protein, leaving a mixture of precursor and mature FNR (Fig. 2B, lane1). The two proteins could be separated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, rendering an electrophoretically homogeneous precursor polypeptide (Fig. 2B, lanes4-6). The final yield is at present about 0.2 mg/precursor/liter of culture medium. Amino acid sequencing of the purified pre-FNR indicated that methionine 1 was the only significant residue at the amino terminus (not shown). The pre-FNR protein isolated from E. coli transformants displayed 1-5% of the specific diaphorase activity of mature reductase, which prompted us to investigate the spectral properties of the precursor. Purified pre-FNR indeed showed a flavoprotein absorption spectrum in the visible region. Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra also indicated the presence of FAD (not shown). Analysis of flavin content indicates that the purified cleaved precursor contains 0.87 ± 0.10 FAD/molecule of apoprotein, compared with 0.91 ± 0.08 in the plant holoenzyme assayed under the same conditions. The 275:456 spectral ratio of pre-FNR was 13.1, compared with 8.1 in mature FNR, and the extinction coefficients at 380 and 456 nm were ∼5-10% lower in the recombinant precursor (not shown). Taken together, the previous results suggest that although pre-FNR is able to bind FAD, the conformation of the flavin moiety may be different from that of the mature holoprotein, resulting in a nonfunctional preholoreductase. The strength of the interaction between FAD and pre-FNR was not determined, but the precursor could be precipitated in 30% saturation ammonium sulfate and redissolved without apparent loss of bound flavin. The FNR precursor was stable at −20°C for several months, but repetitive freezing and thawing resulted in the disappearance of the 40-kDa band, with formation of a mature sized immunoreactive product (not shown). We thus stored the purified pre-FNR in aliquots at −70°C. To evaluate if the precursor holoprotein can be cleaved by the chloroplast processing protease, we exposed pre-FNR to a stromal lysate containing processing activity(35Archer K. Keegstra K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that pre-FNR was processed to mature size upon incubation with the extracts. Over a period of 45 min, the amounts of mature FNR increased as the precursor declined, indicating that binding of FAD did not affect the accessibility of the transit peptidase target site. In order to get an indication of the overall chain packing of the precursor polypeptide, we performed protease sensitivity experiments. Spinach FNR is known to possess a protease-resistant core that begins at lysine 35 (lysine 29 in the pea reductase) and extends far beyond into the carboxyl-terminal domain(36Gadda G. Aliverti A. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11955-11959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the protease-sensitive regions had no effect on diaphorase activity, while cytochrome c reduction was inactivated due to an impairment of ferredoxin binding(36Gadda G. Aliverti A. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11955-11959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protease accessibility assays had not been performed on the pea enzyme, but the sequence conservation between the two species (3Newman B.J. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Karplus P.A. Walsh K.A. Herriott J.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6576-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) predicted a similar behavior. In fact, digestion products obtained after limited proteolysis of mature pea FNR with thermolysin (Fig. 4A), trypsin, or chymotrypsin (not shown) were very similar to those reported for the spinach enzyme(36Gadda G. Aliverti A. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11955-11959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activity measurements confirmed inhibition of cytochrome c reduction and little effect on diaphorase (Fig. 4C). When pre-FNR was assayed under the same conditions, the digestion products did not differ significantly between the mature reductase and the precursor (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the preholoprotein is packed to a certain extent. Fig. 4B shows a time course for thermolysin proteolysis of pre-FNR. Under our experimental conditions there is a rapid degradation to a product of ∼33 kDa in the first 1-3 min. Further digestion occurred at a much lower rate. Interestingly enough, the diaphorase activity of purified pre-FNR increased abruptly upon partial thermolysin digestion. The time course of activation showed a good correlation with the appearance of the 33-kDa product and was followed by a slow inactivation, which paralleled that of the mature reductase under the same conditions of incubation time and protease concentration (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained by using trypsin or chymotrypsin (not shown). Also, incubation of the FNR precursor with stromal extracts (Fig. 3) resulted in small variable increases in diaphorase activity, but the extent of the activation could not be evaluated due to the high endogenous activity of the chloroplast lysates (∼3 diaphorase units/mg of total protein). The previous data suggest that the rapid phase of proteolysis caused cleavage of the transit peptide and probably of a portion of the amino-terminal mature sequence as it occurs in spinach(36Gadda G. Aliverti A. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11955-11959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the transit peptide region appa"
https://openalex.org/W2031596039,"There is a considerable controversy in the literature concerning the effects of higher concentrations of calcium chelators (e.g. BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) or fura-2) on the intracellular Ca2+ transients in muscle. We induced calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the triad preparation by chemical depolarization of the T-tubule in the presence of various concentrations of BAPTA-calcium buffer ([Ca2+] = 0.1 microM) and investigated the effects of the BAPTA concentration on the time courses of conformational changes in the junctional foot protein (JFP) and calcium release from SR. Upon stimulation, the JFP underwent biphasic conformational changes, as determined by stopped-flow fluorometry of the JFP-bound conformational probe. The first phase of protein conformational change, which preceded calcium release from SR, was virtually unaffected by the BAPTA concentration. However, the magnitude of the second phase increased in an inversely proportional fashion to the BAPTA concentration. An abrupt increase in [Ca2+] from 0.1 microM up to 1.0 microM (delta Ca2+), concurrently with T-tubule depolarization, produced biphasic protein conformational changes: a delta Ca(2+)-independent first phase and a delta Ca(2+)-dependent second phase. Similar Ca2+ jump experiments under non-depolarizing conditions produced a slow monophasic conformational change equivalent to the second phase described above. These results suggest that the first phase of protein conformational change represents the activation of JFP by T-tubule depolarization to induce calcium release, and the second phase the secondary activation by the released Ca2+. Activation of the JFP by the released Ca2+ resulted in an acceleration of both (i) the rate of initial calcium release, and (ii) the subsequent attenuation of calcium release. The acceleration of both was suppressed by higher concentrations of BAPTA. These results provide a reasonable explanation for both of the apparently contradictory views in the literature; high concentrations of calcium buffer (a) suppress the initial activation and (b) prevent the subsequent attenuation of calcium release."

Various isomeric 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acids (5,12-diHETEs) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HETE5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acidLTB4leukotriene B4, 5(S),12(R)-6(Z),8(E),10(E),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid6-trans-LTB45(S),12(R)-6(E),8(E),10(E),14(Z)eicosatetraenoic acid6-trans-12-epi-LTB45(S),12(S)-6(E),8(E),10(E),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid5-oxo-ETE5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid12-HETE12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acidGC/MSgas chromatography/mass spectrometryPFB/TMSpentafluorobenzyl ester/trimethylsilyl etherHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyRPreverse phase. can be formed within mammalian cells both by enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes. Several isomers of this family of arachidonic acid metabolites have potent biological activities and are thought to play significant roles as lipid mediators. The first committed step in leukotriene biosynthesis is the formation of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) by 5-lipoxygenase(1Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Gresser M. Young R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 383-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Leukotriene A4 hydrolase enzymatically hydrates this triene epoxide to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (2Samuelsson B. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19469-19472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which is thought to play an important role as a chemotactic factor for the human polymorphonuclear leukocyte(3Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Bray M.A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith J.H. Nature. 1980; 286: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a competitive nonenzymatic hydrolysis of LTA4 leading to the formation of two epimeric dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, 6-trans-LTB4 and 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4. These two leukotrienes are substantially less potent compared to the enzymatic product LTB4, but there is evidence to suggest they retain significant biological activity(4Palmblad J. Malmsten C.L. Uden A.-M. Radmark O. Engstedt L. Samuelsson B. Blood. 1981; 58: 658-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified the formation of a family of free radical-derived 5,12-diHETEs which have substantial biological activity(5Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17273-17278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These compounds, which have been termed B4-isoleukotrienes, are not enzymatic products of arachidonic acid metabolism, but rather are a result of reactive oxygen species attack on arachidonic acid while esterified to phospholipids. 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid leukotriene B4, 5(S),12(R)-6(Z),8(E),10(E),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid 5(S),12(R)-6(E),8(E),10(E),14(Z)eicosatetraenoic acid 5(S),12(S)-6(E),8(E),10(E),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid gas chromatography/mass spectrometry pentafluorobenzyl ester/trimethylsilyl ether high performance liquid chromatography reverse phase. Termination of the biological activity of 5,12-diHETE species is thought to be a result of metabolic inactivation. The most widely studied is LTB4 for which a specific cytochrome P-450LTB4ω(6Sumimoto H. Minakame S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4348-4353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Soberman R.J.

LTB4 is also rapidly taken up by the hepatocyte and metabolized by cytochrome P-450 ω-oxidation and by subsequent β-oxidation in both mitochondria and peroxisomes(9Shirley M.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16288-16295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Diczfalusy U. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 403-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Jedlitschky G. Huber M.

Recently, it was found that for those cells which do not express the high affinity P-450LTB4ω, an alternative pathway of LTB4 metabolism exists. A 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase/Δ10-reductase pathway leads to the conversion of the conjugated triene in LTB4 to a conjugated diene and numerous subsequent β-oxidation metabolites and glutathione conjugates result(12Powell W.S. Gravelle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5364-5369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25439-25448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considerably less is known about the metabolism of 5,12-diHETE isomers that are not substrates for the cytochrome P-450LTBω. Neither 6-trans-LTB4 epimer is efficiently metabolized by the specific cytochrome P-450LTB4ω(14Powell W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation reveals the importance of the double bond geometry at carbon 6 when comparing the metabolic fate of LTB4 with these isomeric 5,12-diHETEs. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the metabolism of prostaglandins proceeds by β-oxidation from the carboxyl terminus(15Diczfalusy U. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 403-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Such C-1 β-oxidation has not been observed as a major pathway for LTB4 metabolism. The only exception was the identification of a β-oxidation intermediate, 3-hydroxy-LTB4, formed when LTB4 was metabolized in rat hepatocytes in the presence of ethanol(16Shirley M.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 3: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 17Shirley M.A. Reidhead C.T. Murphy R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 5,12-diHETEs are hydroxy, unsaturated fatty acids that could be substrates for β-oxidation from the carboxyl terminus. Studies of the metabolism of structurally related monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, 12-HETE and 5-HETE, revealed β-oxidation from the C-1 terminus to be a major pathway of metabolism. Metabolism of 12-HETE by β-oxidation in mouse peritoneal macrophages led to the formation of both 8-hydroxy-hexadecatrienoic acid and 4-hydroxy-dodecenoic acid as major metabolites(18Mathur S.N. Albright E. Field F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21048-21055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a microsomal 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase activity was reported to exist within human polymorphonuclear leukocytes that reversibly converted 5(S)-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE and also converts 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 to a 5-oxo metabolite(19Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 5-oxo metabolite was further converted to dihydro products identified as 5-oxo-6,11-dihydro-LTB4 and 6,11-dihydro-LTB4(19Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, metabolism of 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 and 6-trans-LTB4 was examined in a human-derived hepatoma cell line, HepG2 cells. These cells metabolize LTB4 by a unique β-oxidation process from C-1 with the formation of 10-hydroxy-octadecatetraenoic acid(20Wheelan P. Murphy R.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, the metabolism of the 6-trans epimers of LTB4 was completely different from that previously described for LTB4. The results reported here reveal that β-oxidation for these 5,12-diHETEs is dependent on the geometry of the first double bond (Δ6) in the conjugated triene. Such metabolic processes could play an important role in limiting the activity of free radical-derived B4-isoleukotrienes generated in vivo. 6-trans-12-epi-Leukotriene B4 (6-trans-12-epi-LTB4, 5(S),12(S)-dihydroxy-6E,8E,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid), 6-trans-leukotriene B4 (6-trans-LTB4, 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6E,8E,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid), and leukotriene A4 (LTA4) methyl ester were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). [14,15-3H2]LTA4 methyl ester (42.0 Ci/mmol) and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H8] LTB4 (195 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN (Boston, MA). [14,15-3H2]6-trans-LTB4 and [14,15-3H2]6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 were synthesized from [14,15-3H2]LTA4 methyl ester as follows. LTA4 methyl ester (10 μg) was combined with [14,15-3H2]LTA4 methyl ester (10 μCi) and the solvent removed under a stream of nitrogen. Dilute hydrochloric acid (1%, 200 μl) was added followed by the addition of ethanol (50 μl). After 30 min at room temperature, water (2 ml) was added and the solution extracted three times with ethyl acetate (2 ml). The combined ethyl acetate layers, containing greater than 90% of the radioactivity, were evaporated under nitrogen. The methyl ester was hydrolyzed using the procedure of Carrier et al.(21Carrier D.J. Bogri T. Cosentino G.P. Guse I. Rakhit S. Singh K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1988; 34: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, acetone (1.6 ml) and 0.25 N sodium hydroxide (0.4 ml) were added and the reaction kept at room temperature for 3 h. Acetone was evaporated under nitrogen and water (2 ml) was added and the solution acidified to pH < 3 by the addition of hydrochloric acid. The solution was extracted three times with ethyl acetate (2 ml) and the combined ethyl acetate layers evaporated under nitrogen to near dryness. The sample was reconstituted in the initial reverse phase HPLC solvent and immediately analyzed using the RP HPLC conditions described below. The two radioactive products displaying a UV triene chromophore (λmax = 269 nm) at retention times of 32.8 and 33.5 min corresponding to 6-trans-LTB4 and 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4, respectively, were separately collected. All solvents were HPLC grade purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). HepG2 cells, a line derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks with 15 ml of minimum essential medium (Eagle's) containing Earle's balanced salt solution, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) with added fetal bovine serum (10%). Cells were subcultured every 4-5 days. The substrates, 6-trans-LTB4 or 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 containing radiolabeled substrate (0.5 μCi), were added to cells 4 days after subculture when cells were nearing confluency. Tissue culture medium was removed and the substrate, lyophilized to dryness and reconstituted in 15 ml of medium (0.9 μM) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and without fetal bovine serum, was added. Following incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h, medium was removed, 35 ml of cold ethanol was added to the medium, and the sample stored at −20°C for at least 3 h to precipitate protein. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatants decanted and evaporated to near dryness. Samples were reconstituted in 1 ml of initial reverse phase HPLC solvent and immediately analyzed. For time course studies, cells were grown in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks using 5 ml of medium. Substrates were added in 5 ml of medium (0.9 μM) containing radiolabeled substrate (0.2 μCi) and the cells incubated for 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, and 24 h. Following incubation at these time points, the medium was removed and analyzed as above. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated using a Percoll gradient as described previously(22Lynch J.M. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2653-2661PubMed Google Scholar). 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 and [14,15-3H2]6-trans-LTB4 (0.5 μCi), evaporated under nitrogen and reconstituted in Hank's balanced salt solution (10 ml, Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) to give a substrate concentration of 2.0 μM, was added to pelleted cells (2 × 108 cells) and the cells gently resuspended. Incubation was continued for 50 min at 37°C at which time cells were pelleted and the supernatant removed and combined with 4 volumes of cold ethanol. Supernatants were treated as described above followed by reverse phase HPLC analysis. RP HPLC analysis was performed using an Ultremex column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm C-18; Phenomenex, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA) with a mobile phase of methanol:water, 0.05% acetic acid (pH adjusted to 5.8 with ammonium hydroxide) at an initial composition of 30% methanol. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used and a linear gradient to 70% methanol in 35 min was immediately started followed by a second linear gradient to 100% methanol at 45 min. RP HPLC analysis was monitored by a photodiode array detector or by an on-line radioactivity detector. Collected RP HPLC fractions containing radioactive metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) following derivatization to the pentafluorobenzyl ester/trimethylsilyl ether compounds. Samples were dried under nitrogen and derivatized by the addition of a 10% solution (v/v) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Aldrich) in acetonitrile (50 μl) followed by the addition of a 10% solution (v/v) of pentafluorobenzyl bromide (Aldrich) in acetonitrile (50 μl). Samples were kept at room temperature for 20 min and then taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Samples were further derivatized by the addition of acetonitrile (50 μl) and either bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (50 μl) (Sigma) or bis(trimethyl [2H9] silyl)acetamide (50 μl) (MSD Isotopes, Montreal, Canada) and heated at 60°C for 5 min. Samples were evaporated under nitrogen and acetonitrile added to give a metabolite concentration of 1 ng/μl for analysis by negative ion GC/MS and a concentration of 10-20 ng/μl for analysis by positive ion GC/MS. GC/MS analyses were performed on a Finnigan SSQ 70 (San Jose, CA) using methane as the moderating gas for negative ion GC/MS analyses and an electron energy of 70 eV for positive ion GC/MS analyses. A 10 m × 0.25-mm DB-1 or a 5 m × 0.25-mm DB-1 (0.25 μm film thickness) capillary GC column was used (J & W, Folsom, CA) with an injector temperature of 275°C and a transfer line temperature of 300°C. The initial column temperature was 150°C followed by a linear ramp to 300°C at 15°C/min. Equivalent carbon values (EC value) were obtained by comparison to retention times of standard straight chain fatty acids derivatized as the PFB esters. Catalytic hydrogenation of metabolites was performed as described earlier (23Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) prior to PFB/TMS derivatization. Oxidative ozonolysis of 200-400 ng of sample was performed without solvent as described earlier (13Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25439-25448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prior to PFB/TMS derivatization as described above. Following a 24-h incubation of HepG2 cells with 6-trans-LTB4 (0.9 μM) containing [14,15-3H2]6-trans-LTB4 (0.5 μCi), 94% of the added radioactivity was recovered in the extracellular supernatant. With 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 (0.9 μM) containing [14,15-3H2]6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 (0.5 μCi) as the substrate, 93% of the added radioactivity was recovered in the extracellular supernatant. RP HPLC analysis of the supernatant fractions resulted in recovery of 56 ± 1% (n = 2) of the radioactivity as a single metabolite observed at a retention time of 20.6 min for incubations using 6-trans-LTB4 as the substate. For incubations using 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 as the substrate, 67 ± 7% (n = 2) of the recovered radioactivity was contained in the same RP HPLC peak (Fig. 1A). No UV triene chromophore indicative of the starting substrates (λmax = 269 nm) was observed at the expected retention times of 32.8 min for 6-trans-LTB4 or at 33.5 min for 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4. With shorter incubation times, intermediate radioactive compounds were detected as shown in Fig. 1B for the RP HPLC analysis of the extracellular supernatant from HepG2 cells incubated for 5 h with 6-trans-LTB4 (0.9 μM) containing [14,15-3H2]6-trans-LTB4 (0.2 μCi). No metabolites contained a UV chromophore indicative of a conjugated triene moiety. Radioactive metabolites 3, 4, and 5 (Fig. 1B) displayed a UV absorption with λmax at 230 nm indicative of a conjugated diene chromophore. Metabolites 1 and 2 showed no UV absorption above 205 nm. RP HPLC analysis of a 5-h incubation of HepG2 cells with 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 (0.9 μM) containing [14,15-3H2]6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 (0.2 μCi) showed a similar profile of radioactive products. The time course for the formation of the major metabolite of 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 (Metabolite 1) is shown in Fig. 2A and the time courses for the formation of the remaining intermediate metabolites are shown in Fig. 2B. At all time points, metabolite 1 was the major radioactive metabolite. Metabolites 2, 3, and 4 reached a maximum concentration of approximately 5% of the total radioactivity between 3 and 9 h of incubation and declined to less than 1% by 24 h. Metabolite 5 reached a maximum concentration of approximately 15% of the total radioactivity between 3 and 9 h and thereafter declined and was not detected at 24 h. Similar time courses were obtained when HepG2 cells were incubated with 6-trans-LTB4. Radioactive metabolites were analyzed by GC/MS analysis in both the negative ion mode and positive ion mode following derivatization to the pentafluorobenzyl ester/trimethylsilyl ether (PFB/TMS) compounds. Analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative of metabolite 1 by negative ion GC/MS revealed an abundant [M-PFB]− ion at m/z 285 (data not shown) and a less abundant ion at m/z 195 (loss of TMSOH). The EC value for this derivative was 13.8 and combined with the negative ion GC/MS data was consistent with a 12-carbon structure containing one OTMS substituent and one double bond. Positive ion GC/MS analysis of this derivative resulted in an observed ion at m/z 355 (base peak) consistent with a C-4 OTMS substituent and a double bond at C-6 (Fig. 3A). Such a favorable fragmentation for OTMS substituted unsaturated PFB esters is always observed for derivatized hydroxy fatty acids containing unsaturation two carbons removed from the OTMS carbon and results in loss of a neutral stabilized allylic radical(23Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The above data is consistent with assignment of the metabolite 1 structure as 4-hydroxy-6-dodecenoic acid. Negative ion GC/MS analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative of metabolite 2 showed an abundant [M-PFB]− ion at m/z 311 (data not shown) with a less abundant ion observed at m/z 221 (loss of TMSOH). The gas chromatographic retention data (EC value = 15.9) for this derivative was consistent with the negative ion mass spectral data for a PFB-derivatized 14-carbon fatty acid containing one OTMS substituent and two double bonds. Positive ion GC/MS analysis (Fig. 3B) resulted in a base peak ion observed at m/z 381 which was the expected α-fragmentation ion for a derivative containing a C-6 OTMS substituent with one double bond at C-8 as described for metabolite 1. The second double bond, positioned between C-1 and C-6, is suggested to be at the C-4 position. A C-3 position for this double bond, a position which would place the unsaturation two carbon atoms removed from the OTMS substituted carbon, would be expected to result in facile fragmentation of the C-5,C-6 bond in positive ion GC/MS analysis resulting in an abundant ion observed at m/z 213 with loss of a neutral allylic stabilized radical, •CH2CH = CHCH2CO2PFB. The double bond could be at the C-2 position, however, the likely mechanism leading to the formation of this metabolite by β-oxidation is more consistent with the C-4 position (see below). The structure of metabolite 2 was thereby determined as 6-hydroxy-4,8-tetradecadienoic acid. An abundant [M-PFB]− ion at m/z 337 and a less abundant ion at m/z 247 (loss of TMSOH) observed during negative ion GC/MS analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative of metabolite 3 (data not shown) combined with an EC value of 17.9 suggested that metabolite 3 was a 16-carbon fatty acid containing one hydroxy substituent and three double bonds. Positive ion GC/MS analysis revealed an abundant ion at m/z 407 (Fig. 3C) which suggested a double bond position at C-10 and an OTMS substituent at C-8. The positions of the remaining two double bonds were determined as the C-4 and C-6 positions by observation of a conjugated diene moiety by UV analysis with λmax at 230 nm (insetFig. 3C) which precluded a 2,4 position for the diene in conjugation with the carboxylic acid which would result in an expected λmax at significantly higher wavelength(24Silverstein R.M. Bassler G.C. Morrill T.C. Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compound. 4th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 320Google Scholar). Also, lack of an abundant fragment ion observed at m/z 213 resulting from C-7,C-8 fragmentation precluded a C-3,C-5 position. The structure of metabolite 3 was determined based on the above data as 8-hydroxy-4,6,10-hexadecatrienoic acid. Negative ion GC/MS analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative of metabolite 4 revealed an abundant [M-PFB]− ion at m/z 407 (Fig. 4A) with a less abundant ion observed at m/z 317 (loss of TMSOH). Analysis of this metabolite derivatized as the PFB ester with [2H9]TMS derivatization of hydroxy groups resulted in an abundant observed ion at m/z 416 with a less abundant ion at m/z 317 (loss of [2H9]TMSOH), suggesting the presence of a single hydroxy substituent. Additionally, analysis of hydrogenated metabolite 4 followed by PFB/TMS derivatization revealed an abundant ion at m/z 413 with a less abundant ion observed at m/z 323 (loss of TMSOH) consistent with the presence of three double bonds in metabolite 4. An EC value of 23.0 combined with the above data suggested this metabolite was a 20-carbon fatty acid containing three double bonds, one hydroxy substituent, and one oxo substituent. Positive ion GC/MS analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative revealed an abundant ion at m/z 477 (base peak) with an additional ion at m/z 167 (Fig. 4B). Both of these ions shifted by 9 daltons to m/z 486 and 176 when the PFB/[2H9]TMS derivative was analyzed by positive ion GC/MS. The abundant ion at m/z 477 located the single hydroxy substituent at C-12 with a double bond at C-14 (see above). The oxo group was located at the C-5 position resulting from oxidation of the original 5-hydroxy moiety. The conjugated diene, λmax at 230 nm (Fig. 4A, inset), was determined as the C-8,C-10 position based on the lack of an observed fragmentation of the C-11,C-12 bond, which would be expected for a 7,9 position, and the lack of a UV chromophore consistent with a C-6,C-8 position in conjugation with the 5-oxo substituent. The observed ion at m/z 167 (Fig. 4B) containing the OTMS substituent must arise by internal fragmentation. A possible mechanism leading to the formation of this ion is given in Fig. 5. Rearrangement of the molecular ion, ionized at the OTMS substituent, by 1,6-hydride transfer of the C-12 hydrogen to the C-8 position results in formation of a distonic ion. This ion may rearrange through a six-membered ring intermediate involving transfer of the C-8 hydrogen to the 5-oxo substituent resulting in loss of a neutral enolized ketone fragment (CH2=C(OH)(CH2)3CO2PFB). The resulting distonic ion undergoes rapid rearrangement with loss of a neutral allylic-stabilized radical (CH3(CH2)3CH=CHCH2) and formation of the resonance stabilized ion observed at m/z 167. The above data is consistent with assignment of metabolite 4 structure as 5-oxo-12-hydroxy-8,10,14-eicosatrienoic acid (or 5-oxo-6,7-dihydro-LTB4).Figure 5:Proposed mechanism leading to formation of the ion observed at m/z 167 in the electron ionization mass spectrum of the PFB/TMS derivative of 5-oxo-6,7-dihydro-LTB4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Negative ion GC/MS analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative of metabolite 5 resulted in an abundant [M-PFB]− ion at m/z 481 (data not shown) with less abundant ions observed at m/z 391 (loss of TMSOH), m/z 319 (loss of CH2 = Si(CH3)2 and TMSOH) and at m/z 301 (loss of 2TMSOH) (EC value = 23.2). At two mass units higher than the fragment ions observed for derivatized LTB4, this suggested metabolite 5 was a dihydro analog of LTB4. Analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative of hydrogenated metabolite 5 revealed an abundant [M-PFB]− ion at m/z 487 with less abundant ions observed at m/z 397, 325, and 307 confirming the presence of three double bonds in this metabolite. UV analysis showed the presence of a conjugated diene moiety (λmax = 230 nm, inset, Fig. 6A) which suggested one of the double bonds of the conjugated triene moiety had been reduced. Positive ion GC/MS analysis of the PFB/TMS derivative revealed fragment ions at m/z 551, m/z 461 (loss of TMSOH from m/z 551), and at m/z 371 (loss of 2TMSOH from m/z 551) which located one of the OTMS substituents at C-12 with a double bond at C-14 (Fig. 6A). These fragment ions were observed at m/z 569, 470, and 371 when the PFB/[2H9]TMS derivative was analyzed (Fig. 6B). Location of the second OTMS substituent was confirmed as at the C-5 position by the observed fragment ion at m/z 369 which shifted to m/z 378 when the PFB/[2H9]TMS derivative was analyzed. The position of the conjugated diene may be C-6,C-8, C-7,C-9, or C-8,C-10; however, the positive ion mass spectrum for PFB/TMS derivatized 10,11-dihydro-LTB4 (positions C-6 and C-8 for the conjugated diene) has been previously published and differs markedly from that of the dihydro derivative reported here(13Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25439-25448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The positive ion spectrum of the methyl ester/TMS derivative of a dihydro metabolite reported as 6,11-dihydro-LTB4 (positions C-7 and C-9 for the conjugated diene) has also been reported (19Powell W.S.

The nicked K86A protein, in which the N-fragment (Met1-Lys87) and the C-fragment (Arg88-Val155) remain associated, is enzymatically active. These N- and C-fragments were isolated and examined for reassociation.

In contrast, the C-fragment remains almost fully disordered under these conditions. The N-fragment with this high (native-like) helicity shows the characteristics of a molten globule with respect to the content of the secondary and tertiary structures, the ability to bind a fluorescent probe (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid), and the behavior on the thermal transition. These results suggest that the N-fragment contains an initial folding site, probably the αI-helix, and the completion of the folding in this site provides a surface that facilitates the folding of the C-fragment.

INTRODUCTIONEscherichia coli ribonuclease HI, which endonucleolytically hydrolyzes only the RNA strand of a DNA/RNA hybrid, is composed of a single polypeptide chain with 155 amino acid residues (Kanaya and Crouch, 1983). Crystallographic studies revealed that this protein is of the α+β structure, and is composed of a five-stranded β-sheet and five α-helices (Katayanagi et al., 1990, 1992; Yang et al., 1990). A similar folding topology has been weakly observed in other functionally unrelated proteins, such as hexokinase and glycerol kinase, and it is therefore defined as an RNase H-like fold by Holm and Sander(1994). Recently, the crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 integrase (Dyda et al., 1994) and the Holliday junction resolving enzyme RuvC from E. coli (Ariyoshi et al., 1994) were shown to have this RNase H-like fold. These proteins are functionally unrelated to E. coli RNase HI (EC 3.1.26.4) and have little sequence similarity. Dyda et al.(1994) and Yang and Steitz(1995) have suggested that this folding topology represents the structures of similar types of enzymes that catalyze polynucleotidyl transfers.We have previously introduced Ala-scanning mutagenesis into the basic protrusion of E. coli RNase HI to analyze the role of this region in substrate binding (Kanaya et al., 1991). Of the 16 mutant proteins in which the amino acid residues from His83 to Asn99, except for Ala93, were individually replaced by Ala, only the K86A protein, with the Lys86→ Ala mutation, was purified in two forms. One is the intact protein, and the other is the nicked protein. In the nicked protein, the peptide bond between Lys87 and Arg88, which is located nearly in the middle of the protein molecule, is cleaved, but the resultant N-fragment (Met1-Lys87) and the C-fragment (Arg88-Val155) remain associated (Kanaya et al., 1991). It remains to be determined which protease specifically cleaves this peptide bond, and why the Lys86→Ala mutation makes this peptide bond susceptible to proteolysis. The crystal structure of E. coli RNase HI, in which the N-terminal segment (1-87) is distinguished from the C-terminal segment (88-155), is schematically shown in Fig. 1. The N-terminal segment forms the initial four β-strands (βA-βD) and three α-helices (αI-αIII), and the C-terminal segment forms the remaining β-strand (βE) and two α-helices (αIV, αV). Studies of the dissociation and association (complementation) of the N- and C-fragments, as well as their structural analyses, will be of special interest, because these studies should provide valuable information on the folding process of E. coli RNase HI, which may represent those of proteins with the RNase H-like fold.Generally, a folding intermediate of a protein is very unstable, because of the very rapid completion of the following folding process to the native state. Folding intermediates have been analyzed by NMR measurements of hydrogen exchange (Matouschek et al., 1990; Miranker et al., 1991, 1993; Neri et al., 1992; Jennings and Wright, 1993) or by CD (Shortle and Meeker, 1989; Griko et al., 1994). Fragmentation and complementation experiments are expected to be an alternative strategy to analyze folding intermediates of proteins. If a protein molecule were cut into a few pieces that could be reassembled to form the nicked protein, structural analyses of the individual peptide fragments would provide information on the structure of the folding intermediates of the intact protein molecules. Since it was first reported by Richards and Vithayathil (1959) for RNase A, the complementation of peptide fragments has been reported for various proteins, such as staphylococcal nuclease (Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1971), barnase (Sancho and Fersht, 1992; Kippen et al., 1994), adenylate kinase (Girons et al., 1987), chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 (Gay and Fersht, 1994; Gay et al., 1994a, 1994b), bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Oas and Kim, 1988; Staley and Kim, 1990), E. colitrp repressor (Tasayco and Carey, 1992), and isoleucine-tRNA synthetase (Shiba and Schimmel, 1992). Such peptide fragments were created by chemical synthesis, proteolysis and chemical cleavage of the proteins, or genetic methods. The structures of various peptide fragments (Bierzynski et al., 1982; Osterhout et al., 1989; Fontana, 1990; Beals et al., 1991; Chaffotte et al., 1991; Dyson et al., 1992; Sancho et al., 1992; Waltho et al., 1993;), including a dissected protein molecule (Peng and Kim, 1994), have also been analyzed, assuming that a peptide containing an initiation site for protein folding spontaneously folds into a conformation that is similar to that of a folding intermediate of the intact protein molecule.In this study, we present thermal, chemical, and acid denaturations of the nicked K86A protein, structural analyses of the N- and C-fragments, and reconstitution of the nicked protein from the N- and C-fragments. We propose that the initial folding site in E. coli RNase HI resides in its N-terminal half region and that the formation of an α-helix in this region facilitates the following folding process of the C-terminal half region.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and PlasmidsPlasmids pJAL600 (Kanaya et al., 1993) and pK86A (Kanaya et al., 1991) for the overproduction of the wild-type E. coli RNase HI and the K86A protein, respectively, were previously constructed. Competent cells of E. coli HB101(F−, hsd S20, recA13, ara-14, proA2, lac Y1, gal K2, rps L20(str), xyl-5, mtl-1, sup E44, leuB6, thi-1) were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Miller, 1972) containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin.MaterialsRestriction and modifying enzymes were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Ampholines (pH 8-9.5) and Sephadex G-75 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) 1The abbreviations used are: ANS1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acidGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. was from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Other chemicals were of reagent grade.Overproduction and PurificationPlasmid pJAL86A, in which the transcription of the mutated rnhA gene encoding the K86A protein is controlled by the bacteriophage λ PL and PR promoters, was constructed to improve the production level of this protein, by replacing the rnhA gene in the plasmid pJAL600 with the mutated rnhA gene from the plasmid pK86A. The K86A protein was overproduced in E. coli HB101 cells harboring plasmid pJAL86A by raising the cultivation temperature from 30 to 42°C, as described previously (Kanaya et al., 1989).The K86A protein was purified as a mixture of the intact and nicked forms by the standard purification procedure (Kanaya et al., 1989). The intact and nicked K86A proteins were separated by cation-exchange HPLC on an Asahipak ES502C column (7.5 × 100 mm) from Asahi Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. Elution was performed by a linear gradient of 0.015-0.10 M Na2SO4 in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) over 30 min with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Proteins were detected by a variable wavelength UV detector at 280 nm. The retention times of the intact and nicked K86A proteins were 23 and 26 min, respectively. The cellular production level of the intact K86A protein was 30-50 mg/liter, as judged by the intensity of the band visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the SDS protein gel. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, as described by Laemmli(1970). The intact and nicked K86A proteins were individually purified with yields of 20-40%.The N-fragment (Met1-Lys87) and the C-fragment (Arg88-Val155), which remain associated in the nicked K86A protein, were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column (4.6 × 250 mm) from Brownlee Laboratories. Elution was performed by a linear gradient of 10-60% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1-0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, over 25 min with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The retention times of the N-fragment, the intact K86A protein, and the C-fragment were 18.1, 23.4, and 24.7 min, respectively.Protein ConcentrationThe concentrations of the intact and nicked proteins were determined from UV absorption, with an absorption coefficient (A2800.1%) of 2.02 (Kanaya et al., 1990b), assuming that the A2800.1% values of these proteins are the same as that of the wild-type protein. The concentrations of the N-and C-fragments were determined from UV absorption with the A2800.1% values of 1.54 and 2.58, respectively. These values are 90% of the values that are calculated using 1576 M−1 cm−1 for tyrosine and 5225 M−1 cm−1 for tryptophan at 280 nm (Goodwin and Morton, 1946), because the A2800.1% value determined for the wild-type protein is 90% of the calculated value. The molecular weights of the N- and C-fragments are 9,764 and 7,794, respectively. The N-fragment has four Tyr and two Trp residues, and the C-fragment has one Tyr and four Trp residues.Kinetic Analysis of Enzymatic ActivityThe RNase H activity was determined at 30°C in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 by measuring the radioactivity of the acid-soluble digestion product from the 3H-labeled M13 DNA/RNA hybrid, as described previously (Kanaya et al., 1991). In this condition, the Mg2+ binding sites of the intact and nicked proteins are fully occupied by the catalytically essential Mg2+ ion. For the kinetic analyses, the substrate concentration was varied from 0.1 to 3.0 μM (nucleotide phosphate concentration). The hydrolysis of the substrate with the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plot.Isoelectric FocusingIsoelectric focusing was carried out using a 110-ml column (Pharmacia) according to the method of Vesterberg (1971) by adding the sample (1.0 mg) in the middle of a 0-50% sucrose gradient containing 1% carrier ampholine (pH 8-9.5).Circular Dichroism SpectraThe CD spectra were measured on a J-720 automatic spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.) at the indicated temperature. Proteins were dissolved in 10 mM Gly-HCl buffer (pH 3.0) in the absence or presence of 0.15 M NaCl, or in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) in the absence or presence of 3 M GdnHCl. For the measurement of the far-ultraviolet (UV) CD spectra (200-260 nm), the protein concentration was approximately 0.1 mg/ml, and a cell with an optical pathlength of 2 mm was used. For the measurement of the near-UV CD spectra (250-320 nm), the protein concentration was 0.5-1.0 mg/ml and a cell with an optical pathlength of 10 mm was used. The mean residue ellipticity ([θθ], degrees• cm2•dmol−1) was calculated by using an average amino acid molecular weight of 110.Denaturation ExperimentsThermal, chemical, and acid denaturations of the proteins were analyzed by using CD. Proteins were dissolved to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mM Gly-HCl buffer (pH 3.0) for the thermal denaturation experiments, in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing the appropriate concentration of GdnHCl for the GdnHCl denaturation experiments, and in 10 mM Gly-HCl buffer (pH 1.7-3.2) for the acid denaturation experiments. The GdnHCl and acid denaturation experiments were carried out at 25°C and 10°C, respectively.The reversibility of the denaturation of the nicked protein in GdnHCl was examined by the following procedures. The protein was dissolved to a concentration of 4-5 mg/ml in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 3 M GdnHCl, and then diluted by 20-fold with 10 mM Gly-HCl buffer (pH 3.0), 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), and 10 mM Tris-HCl buffers (pH 7.8 and 9.4). These solutions were further diluted by 10-fold with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and were subjected to cation-exchange HPLC using an ES502C column to determine the amount of the reconstituted protein. This second dilution with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) did not seriously affect the yield of the reconstitution, probably because the concentrations of the N- and C-fragments were too low to permit effective fragment association.Thermal and GdnHCl denaturation curves, as well as the parameters characterizing these denaturations, such as the midpoint of the thermal transition (Tm), the midpoint of the transition in the GdnHCl concentration ([D]), the free energy change in H2O (ΔG[H2O]), and the measurement of the dependence of ΔG on the GdnHCl concentration (m), were determined as described previously (Kimura et al., 1992), by monitoring the change in the CD value at 220 nm.Fragment Association ExperimentsThe N- and C-fragments, which were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and lyophilized, were dissolved in 10 mM Gly-HCl buffer (pH 3.0) to a concentration of 150 μM (1.5 mg/ml for the N-fragment and 1.2 mg/ml for the C-fragment). These solutions were diluted by 10-fold with an appropriate buffer, mixed in a 1:1 ratio in volume, and kept at 20°C for 1 h. The fraction of the reconstituted nicked protein was estimated by subjecting this solution to cation-exchange HPLC, using an ES502C column. Elution of the protein from the ES502C column was performed as described for the separation of the intact and nicked proteins. The fraction of the reconstituted nicked protein could be estimated from far-UV CD spectra as well, because they represent the sum of those of the N-fragment, the C-fragment, and the nicked K86A protein. The CD value at a given wavelength for the nicked K86A protein ([θθ]nick) is available. The sum ([θθ]sum) of those for the N-fragment ([θ]N) and the C- fragment ([θ]C) can be calculated by the equation: [θ]sum = [θ]N× 87/155 + [θ]C× 68/155. If the fraction of the reconstituted nicked protein were f, the CD value of the mixture ([θ]exp) at a given wavelength should be identical with those calculated by the equation: [θ]exp = f × [θ]nick+ (1 - f) × [θ]sum.ANS BindingBinding of ANS to the protein was analyzed by measuring the fluorescence on a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 10 or 55°C. The excitation wavelength was 376 nm, and the emission was monitored from 400 to 600 nm. The spectra obtained in the absence of the protein was used as a blank. The concentration of the protein was 1 μM, and that of the ANS was 50 μM.Gel FiltrationGel filtration was performed at room temperature using a column (0.6 × 50 cm) of Sephadex G-75, which was equilibrated either with 10 mM Gly-HCl buffer (pH 3.0) or with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) in the absence or presence of 3 M GdnHCl. The flow rate was 7 ml/h, and fractions of 300 μl were collected. Elution of the protein was detected by measuring the absorbance of each fraction at 280 nm or by applying an aliquot of each fraction to reverse-phase HPLC.RESULTSProperties of the Nicked K86A ProteinIn the nicked K86A protein molecule, the peptide bond is cleaved in the basic protrusion (Fig. 1), which is important for the substrate binding (Kanaya et al., 1991). Determination of the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the M13 DNA/RNA hybrid indicates that the cleavage of the peptide bond between Lys87 and Arg88 results in a large increase in the Km value, along with a large decrease in the Vmax value (Table 1). This means that the introduction of the nick into the basic protrusion considerably weakened the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. The pI value of the nicked K86A protein is lower than that of the intact molecule by 0.5 pH unit (Table 1). The cleavage of the peptide bond generates both amino and carboxyl groups. However, only the carboxyl group, which may be fully ionized in the region where the positive charges are clustered, contributes to reduce the pI value of the protein. The far-UV CD spectrum of the nicked K86A protein, as well as that of the intact K86A protein, were identical with that of the wild-type protein (data not shown). In contrast, a considerable difference in the near-UV CD spectra was observed between the nicked K86A and wild-type proteins (Fig. 2). The near-UV CD spectrum of the intact K86A protein was similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). Chemical, thermal, and acid denaturations of the nicked K86A protein will be described below.Table I Open table in a new tab Figure 2:CD spectra of the wild-type and K86A proteins. The near-UV CD spectra of the wild-type (thinline), intact K86A (brokenline), and nicked K86A (thickline) proteins are shown. These spectra were measured at pH 5.5 in the absence of GdnHCl, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chemical DenaturationUpon chemical (GdnHCl) denaturation, the CD spectra of the wild-type, intact K86A, and nicked K86A proteins were dramatically changed, so that the broad trough with a minimum [θ] value of −13,000 at 216 nm almost completely disappeared (data not shown). Consequently, the CD value at 220 nm increased from −12,000 to −2,000. This means that the protein in a chemically denatured state is almost fully unfolded. The GdnHCl-denatured state is therefore designated as the U state. The elution profile of the nicked protein in the U state from a column (0.6 × 50 cm) of Sephadex G-75 equilibrated with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 3 M GdnHCl is shown in Fig. 3. Because the N- and C-fragments eluted after the wild-type protein, the N- and C-fragments from the nicked protein were dissociated in the presence of 3 M GdnHCl. When the reversibility of the GdnHCl denaturation of the nicked protein was examined by dilution, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” this protein was refolded with a yield of 35.3% at pH 3.0, 72.7% at pH 5.5, 43.3% at pH 7.8, and 2.6% at pH 9.4. This means that the nicked protein is most effectively reconstituted from the N- and C-fragments at pH 5.5. The far-UV CD spectrum and the enzymatic activity of the reconstituted protein, which was purified by cation-exchange HPLC using an ES502C column, were identical with those of the nicked protein in the native state. The denaturations of the wild-type and intact K86A proteins were fully reversible in GdnHCl at pH 5.5.Figure 3:Elution profile of the nicked protein from a Sephadex G-75 column. The nicked K86A protein was applied to a Sephadex G-75 column (0.6 × 50 cm), which was previously equilibrated with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 3 M GdnHCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 7 ml/h. Fractions (300 μl) were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC to determine the concentrations of the N-fragment (▴) and C-fragment (▵) simultaneously. Arrows indicate the positions at which blue dextran (1), wild-type RNase HI (2), and NaCl (3) eluted from the column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The GdnHCl denaturation curves of the nicked and intact K86A proteins are shown in Fig. 4. The replacement of Lys86→ by Ala does not seriously affect the stability of the protein. However, the introduction of the nick into this mutant protein dramatically destabilizes the protein, by 1.07 M in [D] (Table 2). The fragment dissociation might be the reason for the dramatic decrease in the stability of the nicked protein.Figure 4:GdnHCl-induced denaturation curves of the intact and nicked K86A proteins. The apparent fraction of unfolded protein, which was calculated as described previously (Kimura et al., 1992), is shown as a function of GdnHCl concentration. ○, intact K86A protein; •, nicked K86A protein. GdnHCl denaturation curves were determined at pH 5.5 and 25°C by monitoring the change in the CD value at 220 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table II Open table in a new tab Thermal DenaturationThe thermal denaturation of the nicked protein was analyzed at pH 3.0, instead of pH 5.5, because the thermal denaturation of the intact protein is reversible at pH 5.5 only under the conditions, in which the nicked protein is chemically denatured. The far- and near-UV CD spectra of the nicked protein at 10°C represent those of the nicked protein in the native state (Fig. 5). The far-UV CD spectrum of the nicked protein changed at 55°C, so that it exhibited a trough with a minimum [θ] value of −12,000 at 202 nm, which was accompanied by a shoulder with a [θ] value of −5,500 at 220 nm (Fig. 5a). Likewise, the near-UV CD spectrum of the nicked protein changed at 55°C, so that the positive signals almost completely disappeared (Fig. 5b). These results indicate that the nicked protein in a thermally denatured (DT) state is partially folded, but has little tertiary structure.Figure 5:CD spectra of the thermally denatured nicked protein. The far-UV (a) and near-UV (b) CD spectra of the nicked K86A protein in the native (thinline), DT (thickline), and DT′ (brokenline) states are shown. The CD spectra of the nicked protein in the native and DT′ states were measured at pH 3.0 and 10°C, and that in the DT state was measured at pH 3.0 and 55°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The far- and near-UV CD spectra of the nicked protein in the DT state were identical with those of the wild-type and intact K86A proteins in the DT state. In contrast to the wild-type and intact K86A proteins, however, the thermal denaturation of the nicked protein was not reversible. The far- and near-UV CD spectra of the nicked protein, which was thermally denatured at 55°C and then refolded by lowering the temperature to 10°C, were similar to those of the nicked protein in the DT state (Fig. 5). The conformation of this nicked protein is therefore designated as the DT′ state. The far-UV CD spectrum of the nicked protein in the DT′ state exhibited a trough with a minimum [θ] value of −13,500 at 202 nm, which is accompanied by a shoulder with a [θ] value of −6,500 at 220 nm (Fig. 5a). Gel filtration of the nicked protein in the DT′ state with Sephadex G-75 indicates that the N- and C-fragments are dissociated from each other at pH 3.0 upon thermal denaturation and remained in monomeric forms even when the temperature was lowered to 10°C (data not shown).The thermal denaturation curves of the wild-type, nicked K86A, and intact K86A proteins are shown in Fig. 6. Because the thermal denaturation of the nicked protein is not reversible, only its apparent Tm value is compared with those of the wild-type and intact K86A proteins (Table 2). Consistent with the results obtained in the GdnHCl denaturation experiments, the Lys86→ Ala mutation did not seriously affect the thermal stability of the protein, but the introduction of the nick dramatically reduced it, by 16.4°C in Tm.Figure 6:Thermal denaturation curves of the wild-type and K86A proteins. The apparent fraction of unfolded protein, which was calculated as described previously (Kimura et al., 1992), is shown as a function of temperature. ×, wild-type protein; ○, intact K86A protein; •, nicked K86A protein. Thermal denaturation curves were determined at pH 3.0 by monitoring the change in the CD value at 220 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Acid DenaturationThe pH dependence of the far-UV CD spectrum of the nicked K86A protein indicates that this protein was fully converted to an acid-denatured (DA) state at pH 2.42 (Fig. 7a). In contrast, the intact K86A protein was not fully denatured, even at pH 1.70 (Fig. 7b). The resemblance between the far-UV CD spectrum of the intact protein at pH 1.70 and that of the nicked protein at pH 2.63 suggests that the intact protein molecules exist in both the native and DA states at pH 1.70. The intact protein was not fully denatured at a pH below 1.7. Instead, the CD value at 220 nm increased as the pH decreased below 1.5 (data not shown), suggesting that the secondary structure content in this protein increased as the pH decreased below 1.5. Gel filtration of the nicked protein in the DA state with Sephadex G-75 indicates that the N- and C-fragments are dissociated from each other upon acid denaturation and remain in monomeric forms (data not shown).Figure 7:pH dependence of the CD spectrum of the nicked protein.

ANS effectively bound to the nicked protein in either the DA or DT′ state, whereas it did not bind to the nicked protein in the DT state (data not shown). It bound to the nicked protein in the native state, but to a much lesser extent. Because the CD spectrum of the nicked protein in the DA state (Fig. 7a) is identical with that of the nicked protein in the DT′ state (Fig. 5a), the conformation of the nicked protein in the DA state might be identical with that of the nicked protein in the DT′ state.Conformations of the N- and C-fragmentsThe conformations of the N- and C-fragments, which were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC, were analyzed at 20°C by CD. The far-UV CD spectra of the N- and C-fragments in 10 mM Gly-HCl buffer (pH 3.0) indicate that the N-fragment is partially folded, but the C-fragment is almost fully disordered (Fig. 8). The far-UV CD spectrum of the N-fragment at pH 3.0 exhibited a trough with a minimum [θ] value of −13,000 at 205 nm, which is accompanied by a shoulder with a [θ] value of −7,600 at 220 nm. Upon a pH shift from 3.0 to 5.5, the spectrum of the N-fragment was significantly changed, so that it exhibited a broad trough with two minimum [θ] values of −13,000 at 208 nm and −11,000 at 222 nm (Fig. 8a). A similar spectral change was observed when 0.15 M NaCl was added at pH 3.0. These results indicate that the helical content in the N-fragment increases, either by"

Several of the monoclonal antibodies had been found to inhibit PDHc from 0 to 98%. Of the 10 monoclonal antibodies that showed the greatest inhibition of PDHc, 4 were elicited by PDHc and 6 by E1. Surface plasmon resonance was used for competitive epitope mapping and revealed that these 10 monoclonal antibodies had at least 6 separate binding regions on the PDHc. The three monoclonal antibodies that demonstrated the strongest inhibition appeared to bind the same region on the PDHc. Mapping studies with the E1 antigen using an additional five monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the two strongest inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (18A9 and 21C3) shared the same binding region on E1, whereas the third strongest inhibitor (15A9) displayed an epitope region that overlapped the previous two on the E1 subunit. Antibody 15A9 had been shown to counteract GTP regulation of PDHc. Simultaneous multiple site binding experiments confirmed that the defined epitope regions were indeed independent.

The enzyme complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate in the following overall reaction (1Koike M. Reed L. Carroll W.R. J. Biol.

In a MAb library, the relationship of the individual MAbs to each other is of significance. As a prelude to direct epitope mapping, we initiated competitive epitope mapping studies. Direct studies generally use specific peptide fragments, and immunoreactivity may be detected by one of several methods such as radioimmunoassay, Western blot, and ELISA. Competitive methods, on the other hand, determine region binding areas recognized by two MAbs relative to each other. In this method, binding matrix tables can be set up, exploring binding regions relative to the number of MAbs used within the matrix. As one increases the number of MAbs in the binding matrix, better resolution of specific binding regions or epitopes becomes apparent. The competitive method, given a large binding matrix pattern, can offer a more global look at many MAbs binding to the same antigen. For this reason, competitive mapping experiments were conducted on a total of 15 of the MAbs previously described (10 for PDHc and with 5 additional antibodies from the E1 group). A novel biosensor technique, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), was used to study these MAbs for epitope similarity. Surface plasmon resonance was first put to practical use in 1968 (2Kretschmann E. Raether H. Z. Naturforsch. 1968; 230: 2135-2136Crossref Scopus (2820) Google Scholar, 3Otto A. Z. Physiol. 1968; 216: 398-410Google Scholar) and was later described in detail in 1977 and 1991(4Raether H. Hass G. Francombe M. Hoffmann R. Physics of Thin Films. Vol. 9. Academic Press, New York1977: 145-261Google Scholar, 5Welford K. Opt. Quant. Elect. 1991; 23: 1-27Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The SPR technique creates an optical phenomenon that takes place at the interface of two transparent media of different refractive index. As polarized, monochromatic light is directed at the two media, whose interface has been coated with a defined thin layer of metal, at a critical angle defined by the media; the light is totally reflected back into the transparent media, which possesses the higher refractive index(6Hirschfeld T. Appl. Optics. 1967; 6: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). At angle θ, the incident or resonance light is totally absorbed inside the metal of high dielectric constant (Fig. SI). At angle θ, an electromagnetic field is created and oscillates through the metal conducting media, creating surface plasmons(7Hopfield J.J. Phys. Rev. 1958; 112: 1555-1567Crossref Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). For resonance to occur, the vector component of the incident light momentum in the plane of the surface must match the momentum of the surface plasmons(8Liedberg B. Sensors Actuators. 1983; 4: 299-304Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). The detection unit then views that finite angle as an intensity dip in the reflected light (Fig. SII).Figure SII:Scheme IISurface plasmon resonance vector components. Surface plasmon resonance arises when the vector component of the incident light parallel to the plane of the surface matches the momentum of the surface plasmons. The magnitude of this vector component varies with incident angle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pharmacia has developed an instrument BIAcore™ Pharmacia Biosensor AB (9Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) and a sensor chip, CM5, that is used to perform SPR. A light-emitting diode (wavelength 760 nm), which produces a range of incident angles (66-69°), and a photodetector aligned with 16 pixel rows over the 4° degrees enable changes in the reflection angle to be observed. Given the media chosen for the CM5 chip and the wavelength of light selected, the SPR phenomenon occurs within this 4° angle change, and that angle at which SPR occurs is seen by the detector as a dip in reflected light intensity. SPR is dependent on several factors including the properties of the metal film, the wavelength of the incident light, and the refractive index of the media on both sides of the metal film. The Pharmacia instrument maintains all of these factors constant. The only change occurring during the observation is in the refractive index of the media on the flow cell side of the sensor chip. This is caused by protein binding to the surface of the chip, causing a density change that translates into a change in refractive index at that surface. This will cause the conditions for the resonance to change, resulting in a change in the resonance angle. Stenberg et al.(10Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) has shown a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and protein surface concentration. For proteins low in carbohydrate, the refractive index increment was determined to be constant and independent of molecular size and amino acid composition (11Brandrup J. Immergut E.H. Polymer Handbook. 3rd Ed. John Wiley-Interscience, New York1989: vii-469Google Scholar). Measurements are taken over time as the ligands are reacted with the surface, and the instrument's software transforms the changing resonance angle into resonance units (RU), defined such that 0.1° angle change corresponds to 1 ng/mm2 protein uptake on the sensor chip(10Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The technology has recently been shown to be useful in studying antigen-antibody interactions(12Daniels P. Deacon J. Eddowes M. Pedley D. Sensors Actuators. 1988; 15: 11-18Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Cullen D.C. Brown R. Lowe C. Biosensors. 1988; 3: 211-225Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 14Fagerstam L.G. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Kullman M. Larsson A. Malmqvist M. Butt H. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This technique has advantages over other mapping techniques because it requires no purification of the MAb ascites and no labeling of the antigen. The interactions of the MAbs with their antigens are truly within their native state(15Granzow R. Reed R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fagerstam et al.(14Fagerstam L.G. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Kullman M. Larsson A. Malmqvist M. Butt H. J. Mol.

Here, we show the applicability of the SPR technology on the Pharmacia BIAcore for mapping large multienzyme complexes. Our results reveal that at least 6 different epitopes are recognized by the 10 MAbs prepared to PDHc. Of these, three antibodies that gave rise to maximum inhibition were shown not only to bind the E1 subunit but also to bind in the same region on the E1 molecule with overlapping epitopes. ELISA plates were purchased from Costar. Removable microtiter plate wells were purchased from Dynatech Laboratories Inc. The sensor chip CM5, N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, ethanolamine, affinity-purified rabbit antimouse IgG1 (RAMG1), surfactant P20, and block mouse IgG1 (Sigma) were all generously donated by Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Instrument time on the BIAcore instrument was also donated by Pharmacia. Radiolabeling of the E1 antigen was performed using the Bio-Rad enzymobead radioiodination reagent according to Morrison and Bayse(16Morrison M. Bayse G. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the material was placed on a 1 × 30-cm Sepharose G-100 column, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.02% NaN3. The first radioactive peak was pooled, and 1% bovine serum albumin was added. Specific radioactivities were determined to range from 2.0 to 3.0 mCi/μg. A CM5 sensor chip was inserted into the BIAcore instrument. The sensor chip consisted of three main layers: a flat glass slide, a thin layer of gold (50 nm), and a non-cross-linked carboxymethylated dextran, which was covalently attached to the gold via a linker layer(17Lofas S. Johnson B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 21: 1526-1528Crossref Google Scholar). After calibration of the detector according to the system manual, the system was equilibrated with 20 mM potassium Pi, 150 mM KCl, 0.05% P20, pH 7.0 (running buffer), for 8 minutes. To immobilize the RAMG1 on the CM5 chip, the instrument was first programmed to mix 0.4 MN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 100 mMN-hydroxysuccinimide at a ratio of 1:1 in water and then to immediately inject 35 μl into the instrument at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 7 min. Next, 35 μl of RAMG1 at 30 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 7 min. This was followed by 30 μl of 1 M ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5, to inactivate any remaining activated carboxyl groups. To the final surface, 5 μl of 1 M formic acid was injected to prepare the surface for use, as recommended by the manufacturer(9Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). The formic acid treatment eliminates all secondary MAb that is formic acid sensitive. To generate the PDHc sensorgrams necessary for the epitope map, each ascites fluid was diluted 1:100 in the running buffer. The block IgG1 MAb was diluted to 50 μg/ml in 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, and the PDHc antigen was diluted to 500 μg/ml in 20 mM potassium Pi buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The instrument was programmed to run at 5 μl/min, and then 20 μl of the first MAb was injected. To block the remaining sites on RAMG1, 15 μl of the mouse IgG1 block MAb was injected. The instrument was then programmed to mix PDHc 1:10 with 10 mM MES buffer, pH 5.5, and to also inject 30 μl of the mixed antigen. Since PDHc has multiple, repeating subunits, a 30-μl reinjection of the first MAb was performed. Finally, 30 μl of the second MAb was injected, and the sensorgram was completed. The response of the secondary MAb was measured as the difference between the base line before and after the injection of the secondary MAb. To regenerate the surface for the next run, two 5-μl injections of 100 mM HCl each were followed by 10 μl of 1 M formic acid. The generation of the E1 sensorgrams used ascites fluid at 1:50 dilution, and the mouse monoclonal IgG1 block was the same as described above. The E1 antigen was diluted in running buffer to 60 μg/ml. 10 μl of the first MAb was injected for 2 min, and this was followed by the block antibody as described above. The instrument would then inject 15 μl of E1 antigen for 3 min, followed by a 15-μl injection of the second MAb over 3 min. Once the net SPR signal from the second MAb was measured, the chip surface was regenerated with HCl and formic acid (Fig. SII I). HPLC-purified MAbs were coated onto microtiter plates at 10 μg/ml, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 25°C. The plates were washed and blocked. To each separately coated antibody plate well, 50 μl of radiolabeled E1 (approximately 10,000 cpm) and 50 μl of one purified MAb at various stated concentrations was added. Competition between the bound and the soluble MAb for the labeled E1 was allowed to occur overnight at 4°C. The plates were then washed, each well was removed, and the contents were counted in a γ counter. B/Bo plots were then generated. Since all two-site binding assay cycles used common capture in the SPR technology, the first step in generating a matrix was to covalently link RAMG1 to the CM5 chip surface. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical immobilization sensorgram of RAMG1. The amount of RAMG1 immobilized was readily monitored from chip to chip by observing the total RU uptake after coupling each chip. To ensure good capturing activity of the RAMG1, a single channel on any chip was not used for more than 50 cycles. The RAMG1 uptake at each covalent linkage had an average of 10,200 RU with a coefficient of variation of less than 10%. Figure 2:, Figure 3: illustrate two typical, two-site binding sensorgram cycles. Each sensorgram comprised a potential sandwich assay. Each sensorgram assay used one MAb as a primary antibody, captured by RAMG1, and the other MAb as a secondary antibody, binding the PDHc antigen. Fig. 2 shows binding interference; MAb 2 was not able to bind PDHc antigen because MAb 1 has its epitope in the same binding region. Fig. 3 demonstrates a positive no interference binding pattern, with MAb 2 being able to bind PDHc antigen, thus having a different epitope binding region than MAb 1. The lower resonance signal observed during the IgG1 block injection was due to the lower ionic strength of blocking buffer. Sensorgrams for the E1 map were similar, and only a typical positive, no interference sensorgram is illustrated in Fig. 4. To establish a statistically valid RU cutoff value for positive second MAb binding, each primary MAb was also run as a secondary MAb against itself. The sequence of events then followed was: primary MAb, block MAb, PDHc or E1 antigen, primary MAb, and the same primary MAb previously used as a secondary MAb for the PDHc map. For the E1 map, a second injection of primary MAb was not utilized because only one antigen was present in purified form. The MAb that resulted in the highest secondary mean antibody response was utilized. A cutoff was established by taking four standard deviations above this mean. This number resulted in 290 RU for PDHc and 150 RU for E1 epitope mapping.Figure 3:Typical positive no interference PDHc sensorgram. 1, uptake of first (primary MAb 18A9); 2, uptake of block IgG1 antibody; 3, uptake of PDHc antigen by first MAb 18A9; 4, reinjection of primary MAb 18A9; 5, uptake of secondary MAb 1F2; 6 and 7, surface reactivation with HCl; 8, surface reactivation with formic acid.

The arrowsindicate the completion of the designated step.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Statistical criteria for specific binding of the primary antibody to PDHc and E1 antigen were also established. Nonspecific binding of PDHc and E1 to the matrix was established by using the blocking MAb as a primary antibody and then establishing the mean nonspecific binding of the PDHc and E1 to the matrix over several runs and several chips. To this established mean, four standard deviations were added, and this then resulted in an estimate of 1250 RU for PDHc and 45 RU for E1. All primary MAbs would then require an antigen binding greater than this predetermined number to ensure a specific binding signal. The PDHc uptake by the primary antibodies always had greater than a 3000 RU signal with a cv of less than 11 percent. In addition, the E1 uptake by the primary antibodies was always greater than a 450 RU signal with a cv of less than 4%. The 10 × 10 PDHc binding matrix presented in Fig. 5 was generated as described above. To ensure reproducibility, all experiments were also run in reverse order for each sandwich system. A reverse order was defined as follows: the MAb that was originally used as the capture antibody (MAb 1) became the tag, and MAb 2, previously the tag antibody, became the capture antibody. Both results for each MAb had to read above each specified cutoff to be considered separate binding regions. This principle was applied to the E1 epitope map as well. The strength of the resonance signal obtained for MAb 2, the tag, depended on 1) the antigen binding capacity of the first MAb, 2) the degree of saturation of the first MAb with antigen, 3) the concentration of the second MAb, and 4) the affinity and association rate of the second MAb when reacting with the captured antigen(14Fagerstam L.G. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Kullman M. Larsson A. Malmqvist M. Butt H. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the affinity and association rates of secondary antibody (tag) was limiting (whenever a reverse sensorgram was negative), the antibody was rerun at five times the concentration of the original antibody concentration, and the sensorgram always proved to be positive. This method of “reverse order analysis” ensured that the binding matrix generated was reproducible. Additionally, to confirm the binding matrix generated in Fig. 5 was reproducible, multisite binding studies were also conducted. If the MAbs were indeed to different epitope regions, then injection of several different MAbs in sequence should reveal the independent binding of these MAbs. Fig. 6 depicts a multisite binding sensorgram demonstrating that among those five MAbs selected, all had independent binding sites on the PDHc antigen.Figure 6:Multisite binding of various monoclonal antibodies to PDHc. 1, uptake of MAb 18A9; 2, uptake of block IgG1 antibody; 3, uptake of PDHc antigen; 4, reinjection of MAb 18A9; 5, uptake of MAb 7C9; 6, uptake of MAb 23H4; 7, uptake of MAb 1F2; 8, uptake of MAb 3G1; 9-11, surface reactivation with HCl and formic acid.

In addition, five new MAbs (15E2, 11D9, 1G5, 12A12, and 3F11) were run to increase the resolution of the epitope region shared by the strongest inhibitors (18A9, 21C3, and 15A9). The binding matrix pattern for binding the E1 subunit is illustrated in Fig. 7. For further clarification of the enhanced resolution obtained by using additional MAbs in the E1 map depicting the overlapping regions on the E1 subunit epitope map, an interference map is presented in Fig. 8, A and B. This figure separates the two antigen maps (PDHc and E1) into separate regions defined only by those antibodies that bound their respective antigens. Again, to confirm that the proposed epitope regions on the E1 subunit were independent regions (Fig. 7), a multisite binding sensorgram was generated and is illustrated in Fig. 9. These data confirm the existence of the independent epitopes.Figure 8:A, PDHc subunit relative interference map.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11565-11570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ELISA double antibody binding assays (22Jastreboff M.M. Todd M.B. Malech H.L. Bertino J.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To verify the first PDHc SPR binding matrix (Fig. 5), a limited competitive epitope mapping technique (23Lorenzo F. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Thu Vu Hai M. Brailly S. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used. Limited competitive epitope mapping experiments were also conducted with radiolabeled E1, as described under “Materials and Methods,” to confirm the results obtained from the SPR. Four of the six MAbs that had been previously characterized were used (18A9, 21C3, 15A9, and 1F2). The results (Fig. 10) suggest that MAb 1F2 has a different epitope binding region from MAbs 18A9, 21C3, and 15A9, since MAb 1F2 has a B/Bo value near unity, indicating no competition for the same epitope. The remaining three MAbs, 18A9, 21C3, and 15A9, have lower B/Bo values, suggesting competition for the same binding site or overlapping epitope regions. Epitope mapping methods can be classified into two categories, direct and competitive(24Wilson J.E. Eyzaguirre J. Chemical Modifications of Enzymes. Ellis Horwood, Chichester, U. K.1987: 171-181Google Scholar). In this paper, the competitive binding method, through the use of SPR, was first used to map our 10 MAbs exhibiting the highest enzyme inhibition relative to the entire PDHc complex. Within this map (Fig. 5, 8A) one can identify six distinct epitope binding regions on the PDHc. The term epitope region is used because competitive epitope mapping on intact proteins cannot define a specific epitope. Region Ic (c for PDHc) contained those three MAbs (18A9, 21C3 and 15A9) that gave rise to the highest inhibition. All three were elicited to the PDHc antigen, and as previously discussed (see preceding paper), these three MAbs must be bound at a vitally important region within the enzyme because they mapped to the same region, and they also extensively inhibited the enzyme. Region IIc contained three MAbs: 8C9, 7C9, and 13A8. These three MAbs were elicited to the purified E1 antigen and all inhibited the enzyme to a similar extent (between 40 and 50%). It is interesting to note that the E1 ELISA, Western blot analysis, and E1 mapping data suggest little or no binding of these three MAbs to the purified E1 antigen (data previously described in preceding paper). Regions IIIc-VIc all contain one MAb each, with descending degrees of inhibition. This SPR study also indicated that the degrees of inhibition can be correlated to different binding regions. Those MAbs with the highest degree of inhibition bound in the most critical epitope region of the enzyme vital for activity (Table 1).Table I Open table in a new tab Next, the 10 MAbs used in the PDHc map, plus the 5 additional MAbs known to bind E1 (15E2, 11D9, 1G5, 12A12, and 3F11), were run in an E1 binding matrix so that we could compare the E1 matrix to the PDHc matrix. The five additional MAbs were run to increase the resolution of the matrix and to resolve, even further, the epitope regions for the three strongest inhibitors (18A9, 21C3, and 15A9). 5 of the 10 MAbs that bound PDHc (18A9, 21C3, 15A9, 1F2, and 3G1) bound the E1 antigen, and 5 did not (8C9, 7C9, 13A8, 23H4, and 8G10). The five MAbs that did bind E1, plus the five additional E1 binding MAbs, offered additional epitope regional information. SPR first revealed that the three MAbs that had the highest inhibition bound the E1 subunit as previously shown by ELISA and Western blot analysis. This additional E1 mapping further resolved the epitope region into two overlapping regions: Ie (e for E1) shared by MAbs 18A9 and 21C3 and the IIe overlapping region, which includes MAb 15A9 (Figure 7:, Figure 8:B). As in the PDHc map, MAb 1F2 was again revealed to possess its own independent binding region. The larger binding matrix along with the use of the E1 antigen helped clarify the less definitive results generated in the limited competitive epitope mapping experiments with radiolabeled E1 (Fig. 10). In addition, the E1 binding matrix-associated MAb pairs 1G5/3G1 and 12A12/3F11 were shown to have their own common epitope regions. Finally, MAbs 15E2 and 11D9 bound to the same epitope region, which overlapped the binding region of MAb 15A9. The five MAbs that did not bind E1 in the BIAcore (8C9, 7C9, 13A8, 23H4, and 8G10, denoted by an inscribed octagon in Fig. 8A) also did not bind any of the subunits of PDHc or the purified E1 antigen in Western blot analysis (described in the preceding paper). In addition, three of the five MAbs (8C9, 7C9, and 13A8) did not bind in the E1 ELISA, whereas MAbs 23H4 and 8G10 bound in the E1 ELISA. It can be postulated that for MAbs 8C9, 7C9, and 13A8 the epitopes specific to these respective MAbs were conformational or discontinuous in nature (25Van Regenmortel M.H.V. de Marcillac G.D. Immunol. Lett. 1988; 17: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and were buried in the purified soluble antigen and plate assay, thus not allowing binding. One should recall that resolved E1 exists as a dimeric protein according to size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography, and its conformation could be quite different from that found in holo-PDHc. These epitopes were also totally destroyed by the denaturing conditions of Western blots, which generally allow only segmental or continuous epitopes to be recognized. In contrast, MAbs 23H4 and 8G10 had epitopes that were segmental or continuous and were buried on the soluble E1 antigen but became exposed when the antigen was bound to the plate, thus allowing binding to the plate assay but not the soluble BIAcore assay. Just as for the three MAbs (8C9, 7C9, and 13A8), Western blot conditions destroyed the epitopes for 8G10 and 23H4. The possibility of contamination of the purified E1 with the highly antigenic E2 or E2-E3 subcomplex cannot easily be ruled out. Overall, the epitope mapping data generated with the SPR methodology correlated very well with the data from the inhibition studies and is illustrated in Table I, Table II. Region IVe in the E1 map is the only exception. Even though the two MAbs (1G5 and 3G1) bound to the same region, it was apparent that the specific epitope occupied by MAb 3G1 played a much more important role in inhibition than did MAb 1G5.Table II Open table in a new tab The need for the native enzyme as an antigen to elicit MAbs that inhibit the PDHc most effectively becomes apparent when reviewing the data. All three MAbs (18A9, 21C3, and 15A9) that produce greater than 60% inhibition were generated from the complex. ELISA plate data to the E1 antigen, Western blot analysis, and now epitope mapping to the PDHc and E1 subunit demonstrated that these three MAbs bound the E1 subunit and had overlapping epitope regions. The PDHc and E1 binding matrix clearly demonstrated that the three MAbs with the highest inhibition had the same or overlapping binding regions, whereas those MAbs derived from the E1 antigen had different binding regions, strongly supporting epitope dissimilarity. The value of a large epitope matrix becomes apparent when reviewing the radiolabeling epitope mapping data. Four MAbs were competed against each other (18A9, 21C3, 15A9, and 1F2) in a plate binding assay. Although the radiolabeling method is very tedious, the results obtained confirmed that 1F2 has a different epitope than the other three MAbs. With this method, it was difficult to confirm whether 18A9, 21C3, and 15A9 have the same or overlapping epitope regions. The SPR technique can generate larger epitope matrix binding patterns in shorter, less tedious time. In summary, presented here is the first reported epitope mapping studies for a library of MAbs to PDHc in E. coli. These studies have indicated that the 10 MAbs that exhibit the highest inhibition bound to six separate binding regions within the PDHc, and those three MAbs that display the highest degree of inhibition also bound to two overlapping regions on the E1 subunit. MAbs with such high degree of specificity, particularly 18A9, which provided inhibition of greater than 98%, would be predicted to be directed at a vitally important area within the E1 subunit, very likely at the active center of the enzyme. Several additional epitope regions were defined by these MAbs, and a good correlation was found between the extent of inhibitory efficacy and epitope similarity. Since these MAbs are now shown to have separate, distinct epitope regions that can be related to function, this MAb library offers the ability to probe the PDHc enzyme complex further to reveal more detailed information about its structure and function, specifically about the E1 active center, and the GTP binding site. The successful correlation of the SPR epitope map with the inhibition data demonstrates the utility of SPR in epitope mapping of large multicopy, multisubunit complexes and offers distinct advantages over more conventional techniques such as radioimmunoassay or ELISA. There is no need for labeling the antigen or antibody, no purification of ascites fluid is required, and a universal capturing system is used. These advantages allow the antigens and antibodies to more readily mimic their native structure, whereas bound or labeled antigens or antibodies may have epitope regions destroyed or distorted.

McNally to the technical aspects of the BIAcore, to Jim Richey for allowing use of the instruments, and lastly Russ Granzow for the technical support related to the BIAcore data interpretation."
