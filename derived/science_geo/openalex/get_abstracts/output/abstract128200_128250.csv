In this study, cytotrophoblasts cultured under hypoxic conditions (2 percent oxygen), mimicking the environment near the uterine surface before 10 weeks of gestation, continued proliferating and differentiated poorly. When cultured in 20 percent oxygen, mimicking the environment near uterine arterioles, the cells stopped proliferating and differentiated normally. Thus, oxygen tension determines whether cytotrophoblasts proliferate or invade, thereby regulating placental growth and cellular architecture."

The crystals diffract x-rays isotropically to 2.0 angstroms. The structure of this light-driven proton pump was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms by molecular replacement, using previous results from electron crystallographic studies as a model. The earlier structure was generally confirmed, but several differences were found, including loop conformations and side chain residues. Eight water molecules are now identified experimentally in the proton pathway. These findings reveal the constituents of the proton translocation pathway in the ground state."
https://openalex.org/W1996603253,"In the developing nervous system, glial cells guide axons to their target areas, but it is unknown whether they help neurons to establish functional synaptic connections. The role of glial cells in synapse formation and function was studied in cultures of purified neurons from the rat central nervous system. In glia-free cultures, retinal ganglion cells formed synapses with normal ultrastructure but displayed little spontaneous synaptic activity and high failure rates in evoked synaptic transmission. In cocultures with neuroglia, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents were potentiated by 70-fold and 5-fold, respectively, and fewer transmission failures occurred. Glial cells increased the action potential-independent quantal release by 12-fold without affecting neuronal survival. Thus, developing neurons in culture form inefficient synapses that require glial signals to become fully functional."

These include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane. We recently purified and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (Jones, L. R., Zhang, L., Sanborn, K., Jorgensen, A. O., and Kelley, J. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30787–30796). In the present study, we have examined the binding interactions between the cardiac forms of these four proteins with emphasis placed on the role of junctin. By a combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor. This binding interaction is localized to the lumenal domain of junctin, which is highly enriched in charged amino acids organized into “KEKE” motifs. KEKE repeats are also found in the common lumenal domain of triadin, which likewise is capable of binding to calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (Guo, W., and Campbell, K. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 9027–9030). It appears that junctin and triadin interact directly in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and stabilize a complex that anchors calsequestrin to the ryanodine receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that junctin, calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor form a quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of Ca2+ release.

Calsequestrin is seen by electron microscopy as an electron-dense matrix in the SR lumen, where the protein appears to be physically connected to ryanodine receptors by “anchoring strands” (13Franzini-Armstrong C.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence suggests that calsequestrin actively participates in muscle contraction by regulating the amount of Ca2+released by the ryanodine receptor (15Ikemoto N. Ronjat M. Meszaros L.G.

Junctin was first identified as a 26-kDa calsequestrin-binding protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle junctional SR membranes with use of an125I-calsequestrin filter overlay assay, where it was the main calsequestrin-binding protein detected (8Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this result, it was proposed that junctin was one of the proteins anchoring calsequestrin to the SR membrane. Subsequently, junctin was purified and cloned and shown to be identically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Triadin was first identified as a 95-kDa protein in skeletal muscle junctional SR vesicles (9Caswell A.H. Brandt N.R. Brunschwig J.-P. Purkerson S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7507-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Jorgenson A.O. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and three cardiac (20Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) triadin isoforms were cloned. The cardiac triadin isoforms exhibit apparent molecular weights of 92,000 (triadin 3), 40,000 (triadin 2), and 35,000 (triadin 1) on SDS-PAGE. All triadin isoforms share identical sequences from residues 1–264. Although junctin and triadin are the products of different genes, they exhibit intriguing similarities. Both proteins have single membrane spanning domains that are 62% identical, short N-terminal segments located in the cytoplasm, and long C-terminal tails, which project intralumenally and are highly charged and basic (11Knudson C.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Notable in the lumenal domains of both proteins is the frequent occurrence of long runs of alternating positively and negatively charged residues, which are especially enriched in lysine and glutamic acid. Recurring sequences of this type have been described by others as “KEKE” association motifs and are thought to be involved in the promotion of several types of protein-protein binding interactions (21Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Realini C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

A GST fusion protein containing the common lumenal domain of triadin, composed of residues 69–264, and incorporating the KEKE regions was recently shown to interact directly with calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor in detergent extracts prepared from skeletal muscle homogenates (19Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and cardiac microsomes (20Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results provided evidence for an anchoring role for triadin, in which it connects calsequestrin to the ryanodine receptor at the junctional SR membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscle (19Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The close structural similarities between junctin and triadin suggest that both proteins have related functions. However, to date little is known about the biological role of junctin and whether, in particular, junctin, like triadin, is capable of interacting directly with the ryanodine receptor, as well as with calsequestrin (8Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, for triadin itself, formation of a complex between the ryanodine receptor and calsequestrin has been demonstrated solely by use of fusion protein binding assays but not for native triadin or with use of purified proteins. In the work presented here, we have tested for the ability of junctin to bind to junctional SR proteins important for Ca2+ release, with focus on analysis of cardiac membrane proteins. Using several different approaches, we demonstrate that junctin binds to both calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor and, remarkably, also interacts directly with triadin. Our results provide strong support for a model in which a quaternary protein complex exists between junctin, triadin, calsequestrin, and the ryanodine receptor at the junctional SR membrane. This complex may be important for operation of Ca2+ release during excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Subfraction D microsomes enriched in junctional SR vesicles were isolated from canine left ventricles by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (24Rardon D.P. Cefali D.C. Mitchell R.D. Seiler S.M. Jones L.R. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5 mg of canine cardiac calsequestrin purified by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (26Cala S.E. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11932-11936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were covalently coupled to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For calsequestrin-affinity chromatography, 15 mg of canine cardiac junctional SR vesicles were solubilized for 20 min at room temperature in 2 ml of medium containing 23 mm histidine, 0.19 m sucrose, 0.5m NaCl, and 2% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2). The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TL-100.3 rotor. The supernatant was diluted 1:5 in 20 mm MOPS, 1 mmEGTA, and passed through 1 ml of the calsequestrin-affinity matrix. The column was then eluted with four 1-ml washes of 20 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, l mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2), followed by four 1-ml washes with the same buffer with 20 mm CaCl2 replacing EGTA, and finally with three 1-ml washes of the Ca2+-containing buffer with the NaCl concentration increased to 0.5 m. The column fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to junctin and triadin. For protein staining with Coomassie Blue, the calsequestrin-binding proteins eluting with CaCl2 in fractions 6–8 were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon-30 prior to SDS-PAGE in 8% polyacrylamide (27Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA encoding canine cardiac junctin (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was excised from pBluescript by digestion with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392. The protein was then expressed in Sf21 cells using the BaculoGoldTM System (Pharmingen) as recently described for phospholamban (28Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells expressing junctin were extracted with sodium carbonate (pH 11.4) to obtain a carbonate pellet highly enriched in the protein (29Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For partial purification of junctin, the protein was solubilized from the carbonate pellet using 0.5 m NaCl and 2% Triton X-100 and purified by phosphocellulose chromatography (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein eluted from the phosphocellulose column in 0.6–0.8 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, as described recently for native junctin (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and was found to be approximately 85% pure by use of this method. For purification of junctin to homogeneity we employed monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. Mouse monoclonal antibody 5D8 to junctin was produced by injecting a BALB/c mouse with recombinant junctin partially purified by phosphocellulose chromatography as described above. Ascites fluid was obtained and the antibody covalently coupled to protein A-agarose using dimethylpimelimidate (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 521-523Google Scholar). Recombinant junctin solubilized in Triton X-100 from the Sf21 cell carbonate pellet was then purified to homogeneity in one step by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography as recently described for purification of recombinant phospholamban (29Reddy L.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 5.5 mg of recombinant junctin were purified from 288 mg of carbonate pellet material. The identity of the protein was confirmed by immunoblotting and by amino acid sequencing (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recombinant junctin was found to be missing the N-terminal methionine residue as recently reported for native junctin (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and also for triadin (11Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw G.R. Slaughter C.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A filter overlay assay was used to detect 125I-junctin binding proteins, patterned after a similar assay developed for detection of125I-calsequestrin-binding proteins (8Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). 300 μg of purified recombinant junctin were iodinated with 2 mCi of125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For detection of125I-junctin binding proteins, 50 μg of canine cardiac junctional SR vesicles were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (27Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blot was blocked for 1 h with 1% horse hemoglobin dissolved in 20 mm MOPS, 150 mm KCl (pH 7.2), followed by washing three times for 5 min with the same buffer except in the absence of hemoglobin. Then 4 μg of 125I-junctin in a volume of 5 μl was added to the blot in 20 ml of buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, 150 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and the incubation continued for 90 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, blots were washed three times for 15 min with the same buffer, and 125I-junctin binding proteins were identified by autoradiography. Canine cardiac junctional SR vesicles were solubilized for 1 h on ice at a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml in buffer containing 3% CHAPS, 1.0m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitors (10 μmleupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 10 μmPefabloc). Solubilized proteins were obtained by centrifugation with a Beckman TL-100 rotor at 100,000 rpm for 5 min. CHAPS-solubilized cardiac junctional SR proteins, prepared as above, were diluted 10-fold in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors to reduce the high salt and detergent concentrations. The dilution buffer also contained 1 mm EGTA or the CaCl2 concentrations indicated in the figure legends. 700 μl of diluted supernatant was preincubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotary shaking and then sedimented to eliminate nonspecific binding. Antibodies were added to 700-μl aliquots of the precleared supernatants, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by further incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15m NaCl, and 0.3% CHAPS including EGTA or CaCl2as indicated. The proteins were eluted from the affinity beads by boiling in SDS-sample buffer containing 10% SDS and subjected to immunoblotting (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol.

Three GST fusion proteins were used in this work. N-junctin is the GST fusing protein containing the N-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of junctin (residues 1–23); C-junctin is the GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal, lumenal domain of junctin (residues 46–210); and H-triadin (20Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) is the GST fusion protein containing the homologous lumenal domain of triadin (residues 69–264). The pGEX vector with the insert for H-triadin was generously supplied by K. Campbell (20Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For preparation of N-junctin, DNA encoding residues 1–23 of junctin was generated by polymerase chain reaction from the canine cardiac clone (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and inserted into theEcoRI site of pGEX-4T. H-triadin and N-junctin fusion proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coliBL-21 using glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). We observed that C-junctin expressed poorly in Escherichia coli, necessitating its purification from Sf21 cells. For preparation of C-junctin, DNA encoding residues 46–210 of canine junctin (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted in frame into the EcoRI site of pAcGHLT-A, a baculovirus transfer vector containing a 6xHis tag and a GST tag upstream of the multiple cloning sites. C-junctin was expressed in Sf21 insect cells and purified with use of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. All amplified fragments were confirmed by sequencing (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). Affinity matrices were prepared by immobilizing 30–150 μg of GST fusion proteins on 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C (Pharmacia). Diluted extracts containing CHAPS-solubilized junctional SR proteins (see above) were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C to eliminate nonspecific binding. Precleared supernatants were then incubated with the affinity matrices for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed in the same buffer used for immunoprecipitation assay, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. [3H]Ryanodine binding to proteins absorbed to affinity beads was measured as described below. 15 mg of canine cardiac junctional SR vesicles were suspended on ice in 3 ml of medium containing 3% CHAPS, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 50 μg/ml Pefabloc, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The sample was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor, and the supernatant was loaded on the top of a 35-ml, 10–25% linear sucrose gradient in a Beckman VC53 rotor. The sucrose gradient contained the same buffer above with the CHAPS concentration reduced to 0.3% and the phosphatidylcholine concentration reduced to 1 mg/ml. Centrifugation was for 2 h at 50,000 rpm. Gradient fractions of 2 ml were collected, and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed for [3H]ryanodine binding (24Rardon D.P. Cefali D.C. Mitchell R.D. Seiler S.M. Jones L.R. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When the purified ryanodine receptor was used in the fusion protein binding assay, the sample from the sucrose gradient was diluted 1:10 in 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.3% CHAPS to reduce the NaCl concentration to 0.1m. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the solubilized ryanodine receptor or to receptors adsorbed to affinity beads was assayed in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, and 15 nm[3H]ryanodine. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm non-radioactive ryanodine. Solubilized receptors were precipitated with polyethylene glycol prior to filtration over glass-fiber filters (24Rardon D.P. Cefali D.C. Mitchell R.D. Seiler S.M. Jones L.R. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Affinity beads containing bound receptors were filtered directly. SDS-PAGE was conducted according to Porzio and Pearson (27Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) or Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). For detection of ryanodine receptors, 5% polyacrylamide was used, and for detection of all other proteins, 8% polyacrylamide was used. Immunoblotting with different antibodies was performed as described previously using 125I-protein A to detect antibody-binding proteins (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Triadin polyclonal antibody (GP58) used in this study was a generous gift from K. Campbell. This antibody recognizes all triadin isoforms (20Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the unique C terminus of canine cardiac triadin 1 as well as to the purified recombinant protein were also raised in rabbits and affinity purified. Polyclonal antibodies to junctin (12Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol.

The Rad6-Rad18 complex provides the first example wherein a ubiquitin conjugating activity is physically associated with DNA binding and ATPase activities provided by an associated protein factor.

Exposure of cells to ultraviolet (UV) light and to many other agents causes the formation of lesions in the DNA. During DNA replication, such lesions located in the template strand block the DNA replication machinery, resulting in a gap in the newly synthesized strand across from the damage site. A variety of postreplicational repair mechanisms have evolved to restore the continuity of the newly synthesized DNA strand (reviewed in Ref. 1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been instrumental in identifying the genes involved in postreplicational repair. RAD6 and RAD18, members of the RAD6 epistasis group, play a prominent role in this repair process. Mutations in RAD6 cause extreme sensitivity to UV light and to other DNA damaging agents; rad6 mutants are highly deficient in postreplicational repair of UV-damaged DNA (2Prakash L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and they exhibit no mutation induction in response to UV (3Lawrence C.W. Adv. Genet. 1982; 21: 173-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).RAD6 encodes an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of 172 residues (4Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 5Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The first 149 amino acids of Rad6 form a globular domain, while the distal 23 residues, which are predominantly acidic, constitute a freely extending tail domain (6Morrison A. Miller E.J. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mutational inactivation of the active site cysteine 88 residue in Rad6 has indicated that the ubiquitin conjugating activity is essential for all the biological functions of Rad6 (7Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2695-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutants of RAD18 resemble those of RAD6in their high degree of sensitivity to UV, defects in postreplicational repair of UV-damaged DNA (2Prakash L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and defects in UV mutagenesis (8Cassier-Chauvat C. Fabre F. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Armstrong J.D. Chadee D.N. Kunz B.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, unlike RAD6, which is indispensable for sporulation, mutations in RAD18 do not affect sporulation (10Jones J.S. Weber S. Prakash L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7119-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Other genes that belong to the RAD6 epistasis group includeREV1, REV3, REV7, and RAD5. Although mutants of the REV genes show only a marginal increase in UV sensitivity, like rad6 and rad18 mutants, they are defective in UV mutagenesis (3Lawrence C.W. Adv. Genet. 1982; 21: 173-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Lemontt J.F. Genetics. 1970; 68: 21-33Crossref Google Scholar, 12Lawrence C.W. Nisson P.E. Christensen R.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rev3 and Rev7 together form a DNA polymerase activity (polζ) that can bypass a thymine-thymine cis-syn-cyclobutane dimer (13Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Mutations inRAD5 enhance UV sensitivity to a greater degree than those in the REV genes; however, the incidence of UV mutagenesis at most loci is not affected (14Johnson R.E. Henderson S.T. Petes T.D. Prakash S. Bankmann M. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3807-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). From these and other genetic observations, it has been suggested that REV genes andRAD5 function, respectively, in the mutagenic and nonmutagenic modes of RAD6, RAD18-dependent postreplicational repair. Rad18 can be co-immunoprecipitated with Rad6, indicating physical interaction of the two proteins (15Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For delineating the molecular functions of the Rad6-Rad18 complex in postreplicative repair processes, it is essential to purify this complex and to define its biochemical properties. Here, the Rad6-Rad18 complex is purified to near homogeneity from yeast cells genetically tailored to co-overproduce the two proteins. We show that the Rad6-Rad18 complex is heterodimeric and that the Rad6-Rad18 complex has ubiquitin conjugating activity, as well as single-stranded (ss) 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). DNA binding and ssDNA-dependent ATPase activities. The DNA fragment with the ADC1 promoter and the RAD6 gene from pSCW242 (5Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was cloned in a derivative of a 2-μm multicopy vector, which contains the GAL1 promoter and the URA3 gene. A DNA fragment containing theRAD18 gene from the ATG initiation codon to nucleotide 342 after the termination codon was cloned under the GAL1promoter in the vector containing the ADC1-RAD6 insert. The plasmid obtained, pR18.36, is shown in Fig. 1 A. Yeast strain LY2 (MATα leu2–3, leu2–112 gal1 reg1–501 pep4–3 ura3–52 trp1Δ prb112), harboring the Rad6-Rad18 overexpressing plasmid pR18.36 (2 μm, ADC1::RAD6 GAL1::RAD18), was grown at 30 °C to midlogarithmic phase (1 × 107 cells/ml) in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and diluted with 10 volumes of YPD (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) supplemented with 1% galactose. The culture was incubated in 10-liter batches in fermentors until a cell density of ∼2 × 108 cells/ml was reached (∼12 h). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. To prepare cell extract, frozen yeast cells (60 gm) were thawed by stirring in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and aprotinin (3 ml of buffer/g of cells) and lysed by passage through a French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 30 min was brought to 30% saturation with ammonium sulfate. A second ammonium sulfate precipitation was carried out by bringing the supernatant recovered by high speed centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 1 h) to 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The pellet was kept on ice overnight and then dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, NaCl buffer containing protease inhibitors to give an ionic strength equivalent to that of 0.2 m NaCl in water. The protein solution was applied onto a Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (60 ml) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl (buffer A: 50 mmTris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5) and washed with 180 ml of buffer A containing 0.25 m NaCl. The Rad6-Rad18 complex was eluted with buffer A containing 0.4m NaCl. The sample (30 ml) was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) column (20 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.4 m NaCl and washed after sample application with the same buffer. The flow-through and first 20 ml of the wash were pooled (50 ml), and proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. The pellet was dissolved in buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the sample was applied onto a Mono S column (HR5/5; Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.15 mNaCl (buffer B: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5). The column was developed with a 20-ml NaCl gradient from 0.2 m to 0.4 m, and fractions containing the Rad6-Rad18 complex, which elutes at about 0.3m NaCl, were pooled, diluted twice with buffer C (buffer B containing 10% glycerol), and applied onto a Mono Q column equilibrated with buffer C containing 0.15 m NaCl. Rad6-Rad18 complex was eluted with a 20-ml NaCl gradient from 0.2m to 0.5 m, and the peak fractions, at about ∼0.38 m NaCl, were pooled. The concentration of Rad6-Rad18 in the final sample was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 56800m−1 cm−1, calculated according to the formula (number of tryptophan residues × 5700) + (number of tyrosine residues × 1300). Rad6-Rad18 complex obtained from this purification scheme (∼5 mg) was stored in small portions at −70 °C. A 200-μl portion of the Mono Q pool (450 μg of Rad6-Rad18) was concentrated to 20 μl with a microcon 30 (Amicon), diluted to 100 μl with 25 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and loaded onto a 11.7-ml glycerol gradient (3.5–27.5%) made in the same buffer. Molecular weight standards (catalase, aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsin) were loaded on a parallel, identical gradient. After centrifugation (24 h at 40,000 rpm and 4 °C in a SW 41 rotor), 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The EcoRI fragment from YCpUBA1 (16McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which contains the UBA1 gene in theCEN URA3 plasmid YCp50, was cloned into a yeast 2-μm multicopy vector, yielding plasmid pPM196. Three chromatographic steps, consisting of Q-Sepharose, ubiquitin-Sepharose, and Mono Q, adapted from (5Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), were used for purification of Uba1 to apparent homogeneity from yeast strain LY2 carrying plasmid pPM196. Rad6 was purified from yeast strain CMY135 carrying plasmid pSCW242 (ADC1::RAD6), as described previously (7Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2695-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). GST-ubiquitin (17Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar) was prepared and radiolabeled as described (18Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F.

GST-32P-ubiquitin (1 μg) was incubated with Uba1 (0.5 μg), Rad6 (0.25 μg), or Rad6-Rad18 (0.75 μg) in 10 μl of 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm DTT. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 8 m urea). Half of each sample was mixed with 1 μl of 1 m DTT and boiled for 3 min, whereas the aliquots without DTT were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. 125I-Labeled ubiquitin was prepared as described (19Ciechanover A. Heller H. Elias S. Haas A.L. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Histone H2B (Sigma; 0.5 μg) was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 125I-ubiquitin (2.5 μg), Uba1 (0.2 μg), Rad6 (0.5 μg), or Rad6-Rad18 (0.5 μg) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The samples were run on a 11% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. DNA binding was examined using the nitrocellulose filter binding method. Nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, HAWP) were pretreated in 0.4 m KOH for 40 min, washed extensively in distilled water, and stored in filter buffer (FB) (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 15 mm KCl). Filters prepared in this manner could be used over a period of at least 1 month. The buffer for DNA binding assays consisted of FB + 50 μg ml−1 bovine serum albumin and 0.5 mm DTT. Poly(dT) (Pharmacia) was dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) and used as a concentrated stock; the average length of the poly(dT) was 221 nucleotides. The DNA was labeled with 32P by first treating with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and then with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. 32P-Labeled DNA was used at a concentration of 2 μm (nucleotides); unless otherwise indicated, MgCl2 was added to 4 mm when present, and ATP was added to 1 mm when present. Reaction mixtures containing the 32P-labeled DNA and the Rad6-Rad18 complex were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and two aliquots (40 μl) from each sample were filtered separately on different filters, which were washed with 2 ml of FB, dried, and the associated radioactivity quantitated by scintillation counting. Routinely, the two values for each point varied by <10%. All experiments were repeated at least twice, but representative data sets obtained on the same day are presented. ATP hydrolysis by the Rad6-Rad18 complex was measured using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on polyethyleneimine-coated plates. The buffer used for the assay consisted of 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mmKOAc, 4 mm MgOAc, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm DTT. Unlabeled ATP was added to a concentration of 200 μm unless otherwise indicated; 5 μCi of γ-32P-labeled ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) were added to each reaction (10 μl). DNA and protein concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. Assays were initiated by the addition of protein; aliquots (2 μl) were removed at different times and the reaction stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS. A portion of each sample (1 μl) was spotted onto a TLC plate that had been prerun in 0.5 mLiCl, 1 m formic acid, dried, and run again in distilled water and dried again. The plate was developed in the above LiCl/formic acid buffer, dried, and the amount of phosphate released quantified in a phosphorImager. These values were converted to μmATP hydrolyzed, plotted, and the resulting rates calculated by linear regression. The reported rates represent the average of at least two independent experiments. To obtain co-overexpression of Rad6 and Rad18 proteins in yeast, we constructed plasmid pR18.36 in which the RAD6 gene is fused to theADC1 promoter and the RAD18 gene is fused to theGAL1 promoter (Fig. 1 A). Plasmid pR18.36 results in 10- and 50-fold overproduction of Rad6 and Rad18 proteins, respectively. Rad6 and Rad18 exist in a complex and were co-purified as such to near homogeneity by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and four column chromatographic steps of Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Mono S, and Mono Q (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1 B). The Rad6 and Rad18 proteins remain associated through all these purification steps (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating a high degree of stability of the complex. Densitometric scanning of a Coomassie Blue-stained sample of purified Rad6-Rad18 complex suggested that the proteins were present in equimolar amounts. To further confirm the stoichiometry of the complex, a sample of the Mono Q fraction was subjected to reverse phase chromatography on a C-4 column to separate Rad6 and Rad18 proteins, followed by determination of the absorbance of each protein peak at 214 and 280 nm. The ratios of the absorbance of Rad18 to the absorbance of Rad6 at both wavelengths were compared with the predicted values for a 1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 complex (Table I). The experimental values were closest to the values predicted for a 1:1 complex, again indicating that Rad6 and Rad18 are equimolar in the complex. To determine the size of the Rad6-Rad18 complex, a fraction of the Mono Q sample was analyzed by sedimentation in a glycerol gradient; we observed that Rad6-Rad18 sedimented with an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa. Taken together, the results indicate that Rad6 and Rad18 combine to form a highly stable heterodimer.Table IPurified Rad6-Rad18 complex has a 1:1 stoichiometryStoichiometry Rad18:Rad6Ratio of Rad18:Rad6 absorbance280 nm214 nmPredicted: 1:11.42.81:20.71.42:12.85.7Observed:1.52.7Rad6-Rad18 protein complex was separated on a Vydac C4reverse phase column; the elution of the two proteins was monitored by measuring UV absorbance at 214 and 280 nm and by analyzing an aliquot by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; the area under the peaks corresponding to Rad6 and Rad18 and the ratios were calculated (observed); the number of amino acids in each protein was used to calculate the expected ratio at 214 nm.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we have not yet succeeded in purifying Rad18 protein by itself because little or no enrichment of Rad18 could be obtained when yeast extract containing overproduced Rad18 protein was subjected to fractionation in various chromatographic matrices, including DEAE-Sephacel, Q-Sepharose, Bio-Rex 70, and single-stranded DNA agarose (data not shown). The poor chromatographic behavior of free Rad18 protein suggests that proper folding of the protein may be effected via its association with Rad6 protein. Rad6 protein has ubiquitin conjugating (E2) activity (4Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar,5Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We examined if the Rad6 ubiquitin conjugating activity was affected because of the association with Rad18 by testing the ability of Rad18-bound Rad6 protein to form a thioester conjugate with ubiquitin (Fig. 2 A) and to transfer the conjugated ubiquitin to a protein substrate (Fig. 2 B). Since a thioester linkage can be easily disrupted by treatment with a thiol reducing agent such as dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol, to detect formation of a thioester adduct between ubiquitin and Rad6, the results of two electrophoreses without and with prior boiling in the presence of dithiothreitol were compared (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 1–3 to lanes 4–6). In this assay, GST-ubiquitin was used because it could be easily radiolabeled with32P (18Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP and the ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzyme Uba1, Rad6 forms a thioester adduct with GST-32P-ubiquitin (compare lanes 2 and5, Fig. 2 A). Rad18-associated Rad6 also forms a thioester with GST-32P-ubiquitin in presence of Uba1 and ATP, and the reaction occurs to the same extent seen with free Rad6 (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 3 and 6). Thus, the binding of Rad18 to Rad6 does not prevent the latter from interacting with Uba1 and forming a thioester conjugate with ubiquitin. Histone H2B (5Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was used as the test substrate to examine the ability of Rad18-associated Rad6 to catalyze the formation of ubiquitin conjugates with protein substrates. The results in Fig. 2 Bshow that H2B is a substrate for Rad18-associated Rad6, thus indicating that the Rad6-Rad18 complex retains ubiquitin conjugating activity. We used nitrocellulose filter binding to examine the interaction between the Rad6-Rad18 heterodimer and 32P-labeled DNA. In this assay, protein bound DNA molecules are retained on the nitrocellulose filters, whereas free DNA flows through the filters, thus allowing determination of the amount of radiolabeled DNA bound by Rad6-Rad18 complex by measuring the radioactivity associated with the filters. The data presented in Fig. 3 show that the Rad6-Rad18 complex binds the single-stranded polynucleotide substrate poly(dT) in a protein concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). Binding of the polynucleotide reaches the maximal level at 0.25 μm Rad6-Rad18 complex. We also determined the relative affinities of the Rad6-Rad18 complex for poly d(T) and double-stranded DNA. This was carried out by examining the ability of unlabeled linear double-stranded DNA to compete with radiolabeled poly(dT) for binding to the Rad6-Rad18 complex. The data presented in Fig. 3 B were obtained from experiments wherein 0.1 μm Rad6-Rad18 complex was first incubated with 2.0 μm32P-labeled poly(dT) for 10 min, and subsequently, varying amounts of unlabeled linear dsDNA or unlabeled poly(dT) were added as competitor. After a further 10-min incubation, the reaction mixtures were applied to nitrocellulose filters, and the amount of radiolabeled poly(dT) remaining complexed with Rad6-Rad18 complex quantitated. While the inclusion of 5 μm unlabeled poly(dT) reduced binding to the radiolabeled poly(dT) by 70%, as much as 40 μm double-stranded DNA did not inhibit binding of the radiolabeled poly(dT) appreciably. These observations indicate that Rad6-Rad18 complex binds poly(dT), but binds dsDNA only weakly. Similar nitrocellulose filter binding studies employing ss and ds M13 DNAs also indicate that Rad6-Rad18 has much higher affinity for ssDNA (data not shown). When the competition is carried out in the reverse manner, beginning with the Rad6-Rad18 complex bound to 32P-labeled dsDNA, the addition of poly(dT) competes the binding to dsDNA (Fig. 3 C). The amount of dsDNA retained is much less (∼10%) than that observed for poly(dT) (data not shown), consistent with the apparently lower affinity for dsDNA displayed by the Rad6-Rad18 complex. Thus, we conclude that the Rad6-Rad18 complex has a strong preference for binding to poly(dT), and to ssDNA in general, as the same behavior is observed when ss M13 DNA is used in place of poly dT (data not shown). Since the Rad6-Rad18 complex exhibits a ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity (see results below), it was of considerable interest to determine whether ATP affects the DNA binding properties of the Rad6-Rad18 complex. However, ATP, ADP, or ATPγS have no effect on the binding of poly(dT) (data not shown). We also tested the effect of ATP in two other assays which were designed to reveal minor differences in DNA binding affinity. Using radiolabeled poly(dT) as DNA substrate, we first looked for differences in the sensitivity to displacement by increasing concentrations of NaCl, and secondly, at the kinetics of dissociation from a radioactively labeled substrate. The presence of ATP has no effect on either the sensitivity to salt (Fig. 4 A) or on the rate of dissociation from poly(dT) (Fig. 4 B). Thus, we conclude that the DNA binding behavior of the Rad6-Rad18 complex is not modulated significantly by ATP. The Rad18 protein sequence contains a Walker type A nucleotide binding motif GKS found in a variety of proteins that bind and hydrolyze ATP (10Jones J.S. Weber S. Prakash L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7119-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, it was important to determine whether the Rad6-Rad18 complex has ATPase activity. We found that purified Rad6-Rad18 complex hydrolyzes ATP with a dependence on a DNA cofactor, with single-stranded DNA being much more effective than double-stranded DNA in stimulating ATPase activity. For example, Rad6-Rad18 ATPase activity was stimulated 20-fold by M13 ssDNA but only ∼2-fold by M13 ds DNA. When the fractions from the last chromatographic purification step in Mono Q were assayed for their ATPase activity, co-elution of the ATPase activity with the Rad6-Rad18 complex was observed (Fig. 5). We also subjected a sample of the Mono Q-purified Rad6-Rad18 complex to molecular sizing in a Superose 12 column and once again found the precise co-elution of this ATPase activity with the Rad6-Rad18 protein (data not shown). The co-elution observed and the high degree of purity of the Rad6-Rad18 complex indicate that the ATPase activity is an intrinsic property of this protein complex. The ATP concentration dependence of the ATP hydrolysis activity (Fig. 6 A) shows Michaelis-Menten behavior. Since in this assay, the amount of poly(dT) is in excess over the Rad6-Rad18 complex, the V max is also equal to the k cat of 0.18 min−1. The rates of ATP hydrolysis are linear over a 1 h time period, where the concentration of accumulated ADP reaches 50–60 μm(∼25% of the total nucleotide concentration), suggesting there is no significant inhibition by ADP. Finally, there is no trace of pyrophosphate released, suggesting that the Rad6-Rad18 complex catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. We carried out a protein titration in the presence of a constant amount of ssDNA while monitoring the ATP hydrolysis rate. The data in Fig. 6 B show that the rate of ATP hydrolysis increases linearly with added protein until an inflection point is reached where all of the available binding sites are occupied. Assuming that all of the available sites on the DNA co-factor are occupied, the site size (n) calculated for the Rad6-Rad18 complex (reflecting the binding site size) is four nucleotides/Rad6-Rad18 molecule. Thek cat calculated from these data (the maximum rate divided by the protein concentration at the inflection point) is in good agreement with the value calculated previously, where the amount of DNA is well in excess of what was needed to allow all the protein to bind. The pH dependence of the ATP hydrolysis activity shows that between pH 6.0 and pH 8.8 there is no significant difference in the observed rate of hydrolysis (data not shown). In this study, we show that Rad18 exists in a stable complex with Rad6. The two proteins co-purify through sequential chromatographic fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Mono S, and Mono Q. As judged by Coomassie Blue staining, reverse phase chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation, the purified complex contains an equimolar ratio of Rad6 and Rad18. The Rad6-Rad18 complex represents the first example wherein a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme is physically associated with a DNA-binding protein. This association provides an explanation for the very similar roles ofRAD6 and RAD18 in DNA repair and damage-induced mutagenesis. The Rad6-Rad18 complex forms a thioester adduct with ubiquitin and conjugates ubiquitin to histone H2B. Thus, the complex retains the ubiquitin conjugating activity of Rad6. In addition, we demonstrate that the Rad6-Rad18 complex binds preferentially to ssDNA. Since Rad6 contains no DNA binding motifs and displays no DNA binding ability, the ssDNA binding ability of the Rad6-Rad18 complex very likely derives from Rad18. Consistent with this, Rad18 contains a C3HC4 sequence motif (10Jones J.S. Weber S. Prakash L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7119-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), also known as the RING finger motif (20Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), as well as a CX 2CX 12HX 3C (C2HC) motif (10Jones J.S. Weber S. Prakash L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7119-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), either or both of which could be utilized in DNA binding. The Rad6-Rad18 complex exhibits an ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity with a k cat of 0.18 min−1. The high degree of purity of the complex and the precise co-elution of the ATPase activity with the Rad6-Rad18 complex suggest that this activity is intrinsic to this complex. The presence of the “GKS” Walker type A nucleotide binding motif in Rad18 (10Jones J.S. Weber S. Prakash L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7119-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the absence of any nucleotide binding motif or of any NTPase activity in Rad6 implies that the ATPase activity of the complex resides in Rad18. The fact that the ATPase activity is relatively weak may indicate that the observed activity is a basal rate and only in the presence of an as yet unidentified partner is the rate increased, in a manner analogous to that seen with the stimulation of RF-C ATPase activity by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (21Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). How might the DNA binding, ATPase, and ubiquitin conjugating activities of the Rad6-Rad18 complex function in the postreplicative bypass of damaged DNA? The DNA binding activity could target the complex to sites of ssDNA where the DNA replication machinery has been blocked by DNA lesions. As the ATPase activity seems to have no significant effect on the DNA binding activity of the Rad6-Rad18 complex, it is possible that this activity is utilized in Rad18's role as a molecular matchmaker (22Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), wherein Rad18 recognizes the protein substrates for ubiquitination by Rad6, and ATP binding and hydrolysis modulate these protein-protein interactions. The availability of the purified Rad6-Rad18 complex, and the identification of biochemical activities contained within it, now presents the opportunity to identify the components of the replication machinery that are ubiquitinated by the complex and to determine if ubiquitin-dependent degradation of some of the replicative proteins is required for the assembly of the postreplicative bypass DNA repair machinery.

This paper documents the response of this pathway to oxidative stress in lens cells. A brief exposure of lens epithelial cells to physiologically relevant levels of H2O2 induces a transient increase in activity of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Ubiquitin conjugation activity was maximal and increased 3.5–9.2-fold over the activity noted in untreated cells by 4 h after removal of H2O2. By 24 h after removal of H2O2, ubiquitin conjugation activity returned to the level noted in untreated cells. In parallel to the changes in ubiquitin conjugation activity, the activity of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), as determined by thiol ester formation, increased 2–6.7-fold during recovery from oxidation. Addition of exogenous E1 resulted in an increase in ubiquitin conjugation activity and in the levels of ubiquitin carrier protein (E2)-ubiquitin thiol esters in both the untreated cells and the H2O2-treated cells. These data suggest that E1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the ubiquitin conjugation process and that the increases in ubiquitin conjugation activity which are induced upon recovery from oxidation are primarily due to increased E1 activity. The oxidation- and recovery-induced up-regulation of E1 activity is primarily due to post-synthetic events. Substrate availability and up-regulation of E2 activities also appear to be related to the enhancement in ubiquitinylation upon recovery from oxidative stress. The oxidation-induced increases in ubiquitin conjugation activity were associated with an increase in intracellular proteolysis, suggesting that the transient increase in ubiquitinylation noted upon recovery from oxidative stress may play a role in removal of damaged proteins from the cells.

In the lens, epithelial cells are the first line of defense against stress and play crucial roles in maintenance of the entire organ. Oxidation is a major stress to the lens due to its constant exposure to light and oxidants (1Varma S.D. Chand D. Sharma Y.R. Kuck Jr., J.F. Richards R.D. Curr.

The ubiquitin-dependent pathway is one of the putative repair mechanisms. It participates in DNA repair and selective removal of damaged or obsolete proteins (15Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A.

The hallmark of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins to form ubiquitin-protein conjugates in a process termed ubiquitinylation. The best known role of ubiquitinylation is selectively targeting proteins for degradation, but ubiquitinylation of some proteins such as calmodulin, histones H2A and H2B, actin, and some membrane receptors serves a regulatory function without targeting them for cytosolic degradation (34Jennissen H.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the activity of ubiquitinylation in lens epithelial cells in culture was inhibited upon exposure to 1 mm H2O2 and that the activity of ubiquitinylation increased during recovery from oxidative stress (19Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recent work in this laboratory indicated that mild oxidative stress enhanced ubiquitinylation in cultured lenses (35Shang F. Gong X. Palmer H.J. Nowell T.R. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 21-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, no information regarding the steps that control the response of the ubiquitinylation to oxidation was available. Multiple enzymes are involved in the process of ubiquitinylation. In this process, ubiquitin is first activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin ligase; BLEC, bovine lens epithelial cells; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HMW, high molecular weight; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. via formation of a thiol ester bond with E1. The activated ubiquitin is then passed to a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2), to which ubiquitin is also linked via a thiol ester bond. The activated ubiquitin is then either directly linked to substrates or is linked to substrates via a ubiquitin ligase (E3). Several E2s and E3s have been identified. The diversity of E2s and E3s is responsible for the substrate specificity of ubiquitinylation. In this work, we determined the effect of a physiologically relevant level of H2O2 on ubiquitinylation and studied changes in the activities of E1 and E2s in response to oxidative stress. We also investigated mechanisms of the increased E1 activity during recovery from oxidative stress. Trizma (Tris-base), dithiothreitol, creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, ATP, 2-deoxyglucose, Coomassie Blue R-250, and chloramine T were obtained from Sigma. Acrylamide,N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylenediamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, glycine, and protein molecular mass standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Hexokinase was from Worthington, and magnesium chloride was from Fisher. Na125I and 125I-protein A were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-ubiquitin antibody and anti-E1 antibody were produced in this laboratory in New Zealand White rabbits by injection of SDS-denatured ubiquitin conjugated to γ-globulin or synthetic peptides of E1 conjugated to ovalbumin. Bovine lens epithelial cells (BLEC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (250 ng/ml). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Exposure to oxidative stress was performed in a serum- and phenol red-free medium containing 0.1 mmH2O2 for 30 min. The cells were collected immediately or were cultured in H2O2-free medium to allow them to recover from oxidative stress. Control cells were treated exactly as the exposed cells except that H2O2 was not included in the medium. The viability of the cells after exposure to H2O2was monitored by exclusion of trypan blue and 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide staining. The levels of reduced glutathione were determined as described previously (19Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The levels of ATP in the cells were monitored using the bioluminescent somatic cell assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BLEC were harvested immediately after 30 min exposure to 0.1 mmH2O2 or at 1, 2, and 4 h after removal of H2O2 and homogenized in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing a mixture of inhibitors of proteinase and isopeptidase (5 mm EDTA, 10 μm hemin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm E-64, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mmiodoacetamide). Following SDS-PAGE separation and transfer to nitrocellulose, the blots were probed with an affinity purified polyclonal antibody to ubiquitin or antibody to E1, followed by incubation with 125I-protein A. The ubiquitin, ubiquitin conjugates, and E1 were detected by autoradiography and quantified by image analysis. BLEC were harvested and homogenized in 50 mm Tris, 1 mmDTT, pH 7.6. Ubiquitin conjugation activity in the BLEC supernatant was quantified as the ability to catalyze the formation of conjugates between endogenous protein substrates and exogenous125I-labeled ubiquitin. This assay was done in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm AMP-PNP (36Johnston N.L. Cohen R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7514-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 2 μg of 125I-ubiquitin (≈106 cpm), 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, and 30 μl of BLEC supernatant (10 mg of protein/ml). The reaction was started with addition of 30 μl of BLEC supernatant. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer. After boiling at 100 °C for 10 min, proteins in 20 μl of the mixture were separated by a 15% SDS-PAGE. For a negative control, a parallel experiment was done in which AMP-PNP was replaced with 4.5 units of hexokinase and 12 mm 2-deoxyglucose. After drying the gel, it was exposed to film for 2–4 days. The level of ubiquitin conjugates was quantified by densitometry of the autoradiogram. BLEC were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.6. The activities of ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) and ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s) were determined using their property to form thiol esters with ubiquitin (37Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol.

This assay was done in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm AMP-PNP, 1 μg of125I-ubiquitin (≈106 cpm), and 30 μl of supernatant of lens cells (10 mg of protein/ml). The reaction was started with addition of 30 μl of BLEC supernatant. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer or thiol ester assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 8 m urea, pH 6.8). After standing at room temperature for 20 min, proteins in 20 μl of the mixture were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels. The gels were exposed to film after drying. The activities of E1 and E2s were quantified by determining the density of the bands that disappeared on the autoradiogram after reduction with β-mercaptoethanol. The mass of the ubiquitin thiol ester of E1 is about 120 kDa (the mass of a subunit of E1 is about 110 kDa, and the mass of ubiquitin is 8.5 kDa). The masses of E2-ubiquitin thiol esters are ∼8.5 kDa higher than the masses of the corresponding E2s (38Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of125I-ubiquitin in both the thiol ester and conjugation assays were saturating and were 15–30-fold higher than the concentrations of endogenous unlabeled ubiquitin (40Jahngen J.H. Haas A.L. Ciechanover A. Blondin J. Eisenhauer D. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13760-13767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, competition between the endogenous unlabeled ubiquitin and the125I-ubiquitin to form thiol esters or conjugates was negligible. Total RNA was isolated from BLEC with Trizol reagent (41Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-535PubMed Google Scholar). The RNAs were electrophoretically separated on 1% agarose gels containing 2% formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N+ (Amersham Corp.). cDNA for human E1 was32P-labeled with Megaprime DNA labeling systems (Amersham Corp.). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in 5 × SSC (150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. The nonspecifically bound radiolabels were removed by two washes with 0.2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at 60 °C. The levels of mRNA for E1 were quantified by scanning the autoradiogram and normalized with the level of 28 S rRNA. In contrast with prior work (19Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), BLEC in this study were exposed to a physiological level (0.1 mm) of peroxide. To assess the effect of this level of H2O2 on cultured BLEC, the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), an indicator of cellular redox status (42Giblin F.J. Reddan J.R. Schrimscher L. Dziedzic D.C. Reddy V.N. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were determined during and after H2O2 treatment. The level of GSH decreased 46% after 5 min of treatment with 0.1 mm H2O2, but by 15 min of treatment, the levels of GSH returned to the pretreatment level and remained constant thereafter. The rapid restitution of GSH confirms that BLEC have an active system to restore intracellular redox status (42Giblin F.J. Reddan J.R. Schrimscher L. Dziedzic D.C. Reddy V.N. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and that this protective apparatus is not permanently altered by the H2O2 exposure. These data also indicate that cells treated with 0.1 mm H2O2need less time to restore the intracellular level of GSH than the cells treated with 1 mm H2O2, since the level of intracellular GSH in the cells treated with 1 mmH2O2 was still 50% lower after 15 min of treatment (19Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Levels of ATP, another indicator of oxidative stress (43Schraufstatter I.U. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Spragg R.G.

Med. 1995; 19: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), were determined after exposure to 0.1 mmH2O2 (Table I). After 30 min of stress, the level of ATP in the cells decreased ∼50%. One hour after recovery, the level of ATP in the H2O2-treated cells was still ∼30% lower than the levels observed in control cells. But by 4 h of recovery, the level of ATP in the H2O2-treated cells returned to the level found in untreated cells. The total restitution of GSH and ATP levels together with trypan blue staining and 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide staining data, which indicate that more than 95% of the cells survived 24 h after treatment, indicate that the BLEC can withstand this level of H2O2.Table ILevels of ATP in BLEC during 0.1 mm H2O2exposure and upon recoveryTreatmentsATP nmol/106 cells (mean ± S.E.,n= 4)Control10.53 ± 1.1530 min H2O2 exposure5.64 ± 1.531-h recovery7.58 ± 1.144-h recovery11.04 ± 2.2324-h recovery11.89 ± 2.09 Open table in a new tab The molecular masses of endogenous ubiquitin conjugates in BLEC varied from 16 to >200 kDa (Fig. 1). More than 50% of the conjugates had high molecular masses (>200 kDa). When BLEC were treated with 0.1 mm H2O2 for 30 min, the level of high molecular weight (HMW) endogenous ubiquitin conjugates decreased 20–40% as compared with the untreated cells. By 1 h of recovery, the level of endogenous HMW-ubiquitin conjugates returned to the level found in untreated cells. Upon 2–4 h of recovery, the levels of HMW-ubiquitin conjugates in the H2O2-treated cells were 10–20% higher than the levels in untreated cells (Fig. 1,lanes 3–5). A low molecular mass ubiquitin conjugate (45 kDa) also increased in a time-dependent manner during recovery from oxidative damage (Fig. 1). These data indicate that oxidative stress transiently decreases the levels of endogenous ubiquitin conjugates and that recovery from oxidative stress is associated with increased levels of ubiquitin conjugates. It was possible that the changes in levels of endogenous HMW-ubiquitin conjugates in oxidatively challenged BLEC were due to an alteration in ubiquitin conjugation activity. To test this possibility we determined ubiquitin conjugation activity in the BLEC by incubating BLEC supernatant with exogenous 125I-labeled ubiquitin and 2 mm AMP-PNP (an ATP analog that supports ubiquitinylation but does not support protein degradation). As shown in Fig. 2, the BLEC supernatant has the ability to form ubiquitin conjugates (in an ATP-dependent fashion, data not shown) using endogenous substrates and exogenous ubiquitin. The sizes of the de novo formed conjugates varied from 15 to >112 kDa. In contrast with decreases in 1) de novoubiquitinylation previously noted when lens cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 (19Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and 2) the level of endogenous ubiquitin conjugates at this time point (Fig. 1, lane 2), ubiquitin conjugation activity in BLEC which were treated with 0.1 mm H2O2 increased 30–280% as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2, lane 2). The extent of the increase varies from experiment to experiment, but the trend is constant. Accordingly, we report the range of the increases of three independent experiments hereafter (Table II). Reasons for the discrepancy between decreased levels of endogenous ubiquitin conjugates and the increasedde novo ubiquitin conjugation activity upon H2O2 exposure are not clear at this time. Although it appeared that even in the stressed cells ATP concentrations (≈50 μm) vastly exceed the K m (0.5 μm) for reticulocyte E1 (46Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the oxidation-induced decrease in endogenous ubiquitin conjugates may involve a temporary decrease in the level of ATP in the cells (Table I). It is also possible that damage to ubiquitin is related to the oxidation-induced decrease in the level of endogenous ubiquitin conjugates. Both ATP and ubiquitin are supplied in the de novo ubiquitin conjugation assay.Table IIRanges of ubiquitin conjugates, thiol esters of E1 and E2 in various experiments using BLEC with/without H2O2 treatment and with/without 4 h of recoveryNo additional E1With additional E1No H2O2H2O22-aCells were treated with 0.1 mmH2O2 for 30 min.H2O2and Rec2-bCells were exposed to 0.1 mmH2O2 for 30 min and were allowed to recover for 4 h.No H2O2H2O22-aCells were treated with 0.1 mmH2O2 for 30 min.H2O2and Rec2-bCells were exposed to 0.1 mmH2O2 for 30 min and were allowed to recover for 4 h.Ubiquitin conjugates11.3–3.83.5–9.23.8–7.53.8–9.26.1–17E111.4–3.12–6.710–1810–1810–18E210.8–1.92.1–6.46.4–173.9–148.8–23The levels of de novo formed ubiquitin conjugates and levels of thiol esters of E1 and E2s were determined by the density of autograms.

The data in this table are summarized from five (no additional E1) or three (with additional E1) experiments. As with the increases in levels of endogenous ubiquitin conjugates during recovery from H2O2 exposure, there were further increases in ubiquitin conjugation activity (Fig. 2,lanes 3–5). The ubiquitin conjugation activity was maximal (250–820% increase as compared with the untreated cells) by 4 h of recovery (Fig. 2, lane 5). By 24 h of recovery, the ubiquitin conjugation activity returned to the level of untreated cells (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that the ubiquitin conjugation activity in BLEC is transiently up-regulated during, and upon recovery from, this mild oxidative stress. To determine if the H2O2-induced changes in ubiquitin conjugation activity are associated with changes in the activities of E1 or E2s, these activities in the cell extracts were determined using a thiol ester assay (37Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is based on the known formation of thiol esters between ubiquitin and E1 and E2s in the ubiquitin conjugation process; thus, the levels of thiol ester reflect the activities of E1 and E2s (39Haas A.R. Baboshina O. Williams B. Schwartz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9407-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with the H2O2-induced 30–280% increases in de novo ubiquitin conjugation activity (Fig. 2, compare lane 2 with lane 1, Table II), E1 activity increased 40–210% after 30 min of exposure to H2O2(Fig. 3, A–C, compare lane 2 with lane 1). In addition, there were significant further increases in E1 activities during recovery (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 3–5 with lane 1). By 4 h of recovery, the E1 activity in H2O2-treated cells was maximal and increased 100–570% as compared with untreated cells. Consistent with the changes in ubiquitin conjugation activity, the E1 activity returned to the level noted in untreated cells by 24 h of recovery (Fig. 3 B, compare lane 6 with lane 1). Unlike E1 activity which increased upon oxidation, the levels of E2-ubiquitin thiol esters appeared to remain unchanged during oxidation (Fig. 3, A–C, compare lane 2 with lane 1). However, like E1 activity, the levels of two E2-ubiquitin thiol esters increased 110–540% during recovery from oxidative damage and were also maximal at 4 h of recovery (Fig. 3, A andB). The masses of these two E2s are 16 and 22 kDa, and their thiol esters with ubiquitin are 24.5 and 30.5 kDa, respectively. Since the formation of E2-ubiquitin thiol esters requires E1 activity and the changes in the levels of these two E2-ubiquitin thiol esters paralleled the changes in E1 activity during recovery, it appeared plausible that the oxidation/recovery-induced increases in levels of E2 thiol esters were primarily caused by the increased E1 activity. To examine this possibility, saturating levels of purified E1 were added to the thiol ester assay. Addition of exogenous E1 to the assay resulted in 540–1600% increases in the levels of E2-ubiquitin thiol esters in the unstressed cells (Fig. 3 C, compare lane 4 versus lane 1; Table II). Addition of E1 to preparations from oxidatively stressed cells or to cells that were stressed and allowed to recover also resulted in substantial increases in levels of E2-ubiquitin thiol esters (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 2 and lane 3; Table II).

Virtually all of its biochemical actions are mediated through a single class of cell-surface receptors called AT1. These receptors contain the structural features of the seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Angiotensin II, acting through the AT1 receptor, also stimulates the Jak/STAT pathway by inducing ligand-dependent Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation.

The Jak kinases phosphorylate the cytokine receptors, leading to the binding and eventual activation of intermediate signaling molecules referred to as STAT (signal transducers andactivators of transcription). The STAT proteins are a family of transcription factors that migrate to the nucleus and induce gene transcription (4Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The Jak/STAT pathway was first elucidated through the study of interferon signaling, but it is now known that this pathway participates in the signaling initiated by a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors. Recently, the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II was also found to activate the Jak/STAT pathway (5Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).Angiotensin II is the effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system.

Whereas humans have a single AT1 receptor gene, rodents possess two genes encoding highly homologous receptor isoforms termed AT1A and AT1B.

Angiotensin II also induces the physical association of Jak2 with the AT1 receptor. The AT1 receptor contains no intrinsic kinase activity. However, it is now known that ligand occupancy of this receptor stimulates several different intracellular signaling cascades in which tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role (11Bernstein K.E. Marrero M.B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At present, the structural features of the AT1 receptor necessary for intracellular tyrosine kinase activation are not understood. In this study, we show that the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids of the rat AT1A receptor physically bind to Jak2 in an angiotensin II-dependent manner. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses show that this association is dependent on the AT1A receptor motif YIPP (amino acids 319–322). The binding of the AT1A receptor to the intracellular tyrosine kinase Jak2 supports the concept that the seven-transmembrane superfamily of receptors can physically associate with enzymatically active intracellular proteins, creating a signaling complex mechanistically similar to that observed with growth factor and cytokine receptors.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA GST fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids of the rat AT1A receptor was purified to homogeneity. As a control, equally pure GST protein was made. Cultured RASM cells were treated with 100 nm angiotensin II for time points of 0.5–10 min. A cell lysate was prepared, and 1 mg of cell protein was mixed with 5 μg of the GST-AT1A fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads. After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed, and any remaining bound proteins were eluted by boiling. Jak2 was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-Jak2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, there was both a ligand- and a time-dependent binding of Jak2 to the GST-AT1A fusion protein. In the absence of angiotensin II (lane 1), Jak2 did not bind to the fusion protein, an observation that was confirmed in >10 separate experiments. Maximal Jak2 binding was observed 3 min after the addition of angiotensin II (lane 4). Treating RASM cells with angiotensin II for longer periods of time (lanes 5 and6) resulted in less Jak2 binding to the GST-AT1Afusion protein. An equivalent experiment was performed using GST (lanes 7 and 8); no Jak2 binding to GST was detected.We have also used an identical protocol to investigate the binding of Jak1 and Tyk2. In contrast to Jak2, angiotensin II induced no detectable complex formation of Jak1 or Tyk2 with the GST-AT1A fusion protein (data not shown).To investigate the specificity of the binding assay, we covalently linked the GST-AT1A fusion protein to an agarose matrix. This preparation allowed us to compete for the binding of Jak2 to the GST fusion protein matrix with increasing concentrations of free GST-AT1A fusion protein, GST, or an irrelevant protein such as albumin (Fig. 1 B). Lane 1 shows that in the absence of a competitor, there was abundant binding of Jak2 to the GST-AT1A fusion protein matrix. Increasing concentrations of free GST-AT1A fusion protein competed with this binding (lanes 2–4). In contrast, free GST or bovine serum albumin showed no competition with the binding of Jak2 to the fusion protein matrix (lanes 5–8).To identify specific regions within the AT1A receptor carboxyl tail important for the association with Jak2, we created a series of GST fusion proteins containing overlapping portions of the AT1A receptor tail (Fig. 2,upper panel). Each of these proteins was purified and individually tested for the ability to bind to Jak2 kinase. As before, Jak2 association was quantitated by Western blot analysis. We observed that fusion proteins containing the motif YIPP (Tyr-Ile-Pro-Pro, amino acids 319–322) bound Jak2 in a fashion similar to the full-length construct (Fig. 2, lower panel, lanes 1–4,7, and 10). Receptor fusion proteins lacking this motif showed either markedly reduced or no binding of Jak2 (lanes 5, 6, 8, 9, and11).The carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids of the AT1A receptor contain tyrosine residues at positions 319 and 339. While Jak2 association with cytokine receptors is not thought to be dependent on tyrosines, the presence of a tyrosine in the 319YIPP motif convinced us to make GST-AT1A fusion proteins in which these individual tyrosine residues were converted to phenylalanine. When the conversion at position 319 was made, the GST fusion protein bound less Jak2 than the parent protein (Fig. 3, lower panel, lane 2). This was consistently observed in five separate experiments. In contrast, the Y339F change had no effect on Jak2 binding (lane 3).To further investigate the specificity of the YIPP motif, we created an 8-amino acid peptide (KYIPPKAK) corresponding to positions 318–325 of the AT1A receptor. As controls, we also synthesized this peptide in a scrambled configuration (IKKPAPYK) and a peptide corresponding to positions 311–318 of the AT1A receptor (KYFLQLLK). Increasing amounts of the synthetic peptides were used to compete for the angiotensin II-dependent binding of Jak2 to a GST-AT1A fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids of the receptor (Fig. 4 A). Peptide P1 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of Jak2 binding to the AT1A receptor fusion protein (lanes 2–4). No inhibition was observed using either the scrambled peptide (P2) or the peptide encompassing amino acids 311–318 (P3) (lanes 5–10). Even when 50 μg of competitor peptide P2 or P3 was used, no competition was observed (data not shown). On a molar basis, peptide P1 is a less effective inhibitor than the entire GST-AT1Afusion protein (Fig. 1 B), a finding probably related to the small size of the peptide.Figure 4Importance of the YIPP motif. A,lane 1 shows the binding of Jak2 to a GST-AT1Areceptor fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids of the receptor. The addition of 1, 5, or 10 μg of peptide P1 (KYIPPKAK), encoding amino acids 318–325 of the AT1Areceptor (lanes 2–4), inhibited the binding of Jak2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Peptide P2 (IKKPAPYK) contains the same amino acids as peptide P1, but in a scrambled configuration. This peptide showed no inhibition of Jak2 binding (lanes 5–7). Peptide P3 (KYFLQLLK), containing amino acids 311–318 of the AT1A receptor, also did not inhibit the binding of Jak2 (lanes 8–10). All experiments were performed with a RASM cell lysate prepared from cells treated with angiotensin II for 3 min.B, inhibition studies similar to those described inA were performed with 10 μg of peptides P1 and P4–P8. Peptides P4–P6 contain single alanine substitutions for the sequence IPP (amino acids 320–322), but were unable to inhibit the binding of Jak2 to the GST-AT1A receptor fusion protein. Peptide P8, containing phenylalanine in place of tyrosine 319, has a reduced capacity to inhibit the binding of Jak2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The specificity of individual amino acids within the YIPP motif was tested by synthesizing peptides P4–P8 and testing the ability of each peptide to inhibit Jak2 binding to the GST-AT1A fusion protein (Fig. 4 B). Competition assays were performed using 10 μg of competitor peptide. These data demonstrate that peptides containing a single change in the IPP portion of peptide P1 were no longer able to compete (Peptides P4–P6). Peptide P7, containing a 3-amino acid substitution, was also unable to compete. Peptide P8, containing FIPP in place of YIPP, showed a partial ability to inhibit Jak2 binding to the GST-AT1A fusion protein. These results are consistent with data in Fig. 3, showing that a GST-AT1Afusion protein with a Y319F mutation bound Jak2, but with reduced efficiency.To investigate the behavior of the AT1A receptor carboxyl tail in vivo, RASM cells were electroporated with the GST-AT1A fusion protein; deletion construct D-35, D-55, or D-85; or GST (Fig. 5). We have previously shown that electroporation is an effective method of inserting proteins into RASM cells (15Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Schieffer E. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15734-15738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After electroporation, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed extensively. Angiotensin II was added for 3 min, and the cells were lysed and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer containing 1 m NaCl and eluted with SDS sample buffer. Jak2 was then assessed by Western blot analysis. In the absence of angiotensin II, no Jak2 associated with the GST-AT1Afusion protein (data not shown). However, after angiotensin II addition, both the GST-AT1A fusion protein and deletion construct D-35 bound Jak2 (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and2). In contrast, deletion constructs D-55 and D-85, both of which lack the YIPP motif, bound very much less Jak2 (lanes 3and 4). No binding of Jak2 was observed with GST (lane 5). These data recapitulate the in vitrostudies and indicate the importance of the YIPP sequence.Figure 5Insertion of fusion proteins into cells.RASM cells were electroporated with the indicated GST fusion proteins (defined in Fig. 2) using a protocol that has previously been shown to be effective in inserting proteins into these adherent cells (15Marrero M.B.

The cells were then cultured for 30 min and washed. Angiotensin II was added for 3 min, and the cells were lysed. Fusion proteins were collected by affinity for glutathione and washed with buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Associated Jak2 was determined by Western blot analysis. Fusion proteins containing the AT1A receptor YIPP motif bound Jak2 (lanes 1 and 2), whereas proteins lacking this motif bound very little or no Jak2 (lanes 3–5). WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have also used a cell transfection approach to evaluate the importance of the YIPP motif. These experiments used the mammalian expression vector pZeo containing either a full-length, wild-type AT1A receptor (called pZeo/WT) or a construct in which the YIPP motif was converted to FAAA (called pZeo/FAAA). Transient transfection was performed using COS-7 cells, which contain little endogenous AT1 receptor or Jak2 (data not shown). Initial experiments used standard procedures to measure the binding of [125I-Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II to the wild-type receptor or the FAAA mutant expressed in these cells. Scatchard analysis indicated K d values of 0.172 nm for the wild-type receptor and 0.225 nm for the FAAA mutant. Thus, the conversion of the YIPP motif to FAAA does not markedly affect ligand affinity.To measure the physical association of the AT1A receptor with Jak2, constructs encoding both these proteins were transfected into COS-7 cells (Fig. 6). Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with angiotensin II for 0, 3, 6, or 15 min. Cells were lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal anti-rat AT1A receptor antibody and Protein A/G. The precipitated proteins were washed, and associated Jak2 was measured by Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-Jak2 antibody. Controls for this protocol included transfection of the vector pZeo lacking any angiotensin II receptor insert (lanes 1–4). When pZeo/WT was cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Jak2 (lanes 5–8), treatment of cells with angiotensin II for 3 min induced the physical association of the AT1A receptor with Jak2 (lane 6). This experiment was performed four times, and association was typically strongest after 3 min of ligand treatment. However, other repetitions of the experiment indicated association above the background levels at the 6-min point (data not shown). Equivalent cotransfection experiments were also performed with pZeo/FAAA (lanes 9–12). In contrast to the wild type, an AT1A receptor bearing FAAA in place of the YIPP motif never showed ligand-dependent association of the receptor with Jak2.Figure 6Cotransfection of the AT1Areceptor and Jak2. Using Lipofectin, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with plasmid pBOSwtJk2 encoding murine Jak2 (16Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol.

Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with angiotensin II for 0, 3, 6, or 15 min. Cells were lysed, and proteins were precipitated with polyclonal anti-AT1A antisera. Associated Jak2 was measured by Western blot analysis. In response to angiotensin II, the wild-type AT1A receptor formed a complex with Jak2 that peaked at 3 min (lane 6) and often remained above background levels at 6 min. In four separate experiments, no such ligand-dependent complex was observed with the pZeo/FAAA construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 (5Marrero M.B.

We have analyzed this using cotransfection of the AT1A receptor and Jak2 into COS-7 cells. Two days after transfection, cells were treated with angiotensin II, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Jak2 antibody. Proteins were collected, washed, and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 7 A). The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-Jak2 antibody to verify equivalent loading of protein (Fig. 7 B). In the absence of ligand, there was a basal level of Jak2 phosphorylation. In response to ligand, the wild-type receptor induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 (Fig. 7 A, lanes 5–8). In contrast, no such increase was ever seen with the AT1A receptor containing the FAAA mutation (lanes 9–12). In the absence of transfected Jak2 (lane 13), no endogenous Jak2 was identified with this protocol.Figure 7Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. A, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid pBOSwtJk2 encoding murine Jak2 (16Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol.

After the addition of angiotensin II, the level of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation was measured by immunoprecipitating cellular proteins with anti-Jak2 antibody, followed by Western blot analysis of the precipitated proteins with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The wild-type AT1A receptor induced increased Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II (lanes 5–8). No such increase was observed with the AT1A receptor lacking the YIPP motif (lanes 9–12). In the absence of transfected Jak2 (lane 13), no Jak2 was identified using this protocol. B, the Western blots from A were stripped and reprobed with anti-Jak2 antibody to verify equivalent loading of protein within each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The major observation in this study is the binding of Jak2 to a GST fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the rat AT1A receptor. This association appears to be dependent on the receptor motif YIPP and is stable to washing in 1.5 mNaCl (Fig. 2, lower panel, lane 10). Transient cellular expression of either the wild-type AT1A receptor or the receptor containing a mutation of the YIPP motif confirmed the importance of this sequence in the association of Jak2 with the seven-transmembrane AT1A receptor. The YIPP motif also appears to be important in angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. These data are consistent with previously published observations showing the coprecipitation of the AT1A receptor and Jak2 from RASM cells (5Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In that study, the association of Jak2 with the AT1A receptor was dependent on the addition of angiotensin II to the RASM cells. This dependence on ligand for binding Jak2 was recapitulated in both thein vitro and in vivo studies reported here. At present, the precise changes induced by angiotensin II are not known. Presumably, ligand binding to the AT1A receptors within cells changes the chemistry of these cells such that the Jak2 present in a cell lysate now binds to the GST-receptor fusion proteins. Whether our protocol is stripping activated Jak2 from endogenous receptors or whether activated Jak2 is naturally shuttling onto and off of AT1 receptors is not known. Indeed, it is not known whether the association of Jak2 with the GST-AT1A fusion protein is a bimolecular event or whether additional linker molecules participate. Finally, we are not certain if the Jak2-AT1A association that occurs within cells is a precedent or a consequence of Jak2 activation.We have considered the possibility that the interaction of Jak2 with the GST-AT1A fusion protein is the result of the YIPP sequence acting as a substrate-binding site for Jak2. This seems unlikely given that Jak2 still shows affinity for a receptor fusion protein lacking Tyr319 (Fig. 3). A peptide lacking this same tyrosine also showed some ability to inhibit the interaction of Jak2 with the GST-AT1A fusion protein (Fig. 4 B). To directly address this issue, we measured Jak2 binding to the GST-AT1A fusion protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of AG-490, a selective inhibitor of Jak2 kinase activity (Fig. 8) (17Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1995; 379: 645-648Crossref Scopus (847) Google Scholar). This compound was added to a RASM cell lysate before the addition of the GST-AT1Afusion protein. Even in the presence of 50 μm AG-490, no reduction in Jak2 binding to the GST-AT1A fusion protein was observed.Figure 8Effect of the Jak2 inhibitor AG-490.RASM cells were treated with angiotensin II for 3 min, and a cell lysate was prepared. AG-490 was added to a final concentration of 0, 10, or 50 μm, with all samples receiving an equivalent amount of the vehicle Me2SO. The lysate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and Jak2 binding to the GST-AT1A fusion protein was then measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” AG-490 had no effect on the association of Jak2 with the GST-AT1A fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies of Jak2 binding to cytokine receptors have demonstrated the importance of the “box 1” motif (18Murakami M.

This is a region of 8–11 amino acids containing the consensus sequence PXXPXP, but such a sequence is not found in the AT1A receptor. To our knowledge, the YIPP motif has not been associated with Jak2 binding to cytokine or other receptor types. Whether this sequence acts alone to define the Jak2-binding site or acts in combination with other regions of the AT1 receptor awaits further analysis. In a sense, it is not surprising that the319YIPP motif is functionally important. It is the only region of the AT1A receptor in which 2 prolines are adjacent or separated by 1 amino acid. Previously, we (23Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and others (24Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have noted that this region is analogous to the motif YIIP found within the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the motif YLPP found within the epidermal growth factor receptor. In these growth factor receptors, the sequences have been shown to be SH2 target sequences when the tyrosine is phosphorylated (25Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Gish G. Yamazaki T. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Forman K.-J.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For instance, phospholipase C-γ1 contains an SH2 domain that interacts with the indicated SH2 target sequences of the platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors (26Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In contrast to phospholipase C, the study of cytokine receptors has suggested that Jak2 binding is not dependent on tyrosines and is consistent with the lack of an SH2 domain in these kinases (2Briscoe J.

In hematopoietic differentiation, the role of the ERK/MAPK pathway has not yet been fully characterized. Previous studies have shown that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by the phorbol ester TPA induces megakaryocytic differentiation of the multipotent human cell line K562 (12Tabilio A. Pelicci P.G. Vinci G. Mannoni P. Civin C.I. Vainchenker W. Testa U. Lipinski M. Rochant H. Breton-Gorius J. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4569-4574PubMed Google Scholar, 13Alitalo R. Leuk.

Interestingly, activation of PKC by the macrocyclic lactone bryostatin not only fails to induce megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells but actively blocks the differentiative effects of TPA (14Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M.

The ERK/MAP kinase pathway, known to be activated by PKC and to be involved in some models of cellular differentiation, represents an appealing target for the opposing effects of TPA and bryostatin on K562 cells. Therefore, we examined whether TPA and bryostatin had differential effects on the activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. Using two independent assay systems, the kinetics of ERK activation in response to TPA alone, bryostatin alone, and TPA plus bryostatin were characterized. TPA alone induced a sustained activation of ERK for >24 h. Bryostatin alone induced a transient activation of ERK lasting approximately 6 h. In combination, bryostatin attenuated the activation of ERK by TPA, with inactivation of ERK at 10–14 h post-initiation of stimulation. These data suggested a model similar to that in PC12 cells, namely that sustained activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway is necessary for megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells (4Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar, 7Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem.

As independent confirmation of this model, we employed a selective inhibitor of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway, the synthetic compound PD098059, which prevents activation of the MAP kinase kinase MEK1 by upstream kinases (17Dudley D.T.

Both MEK1 and MEK2 may activate the ERKs, but MEK1 appears to be the primary MAP kinase kinase element involved in signaling via p21ras (19Jelinek T. Catling A.D. Reuter C.W. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Treatment of K562 cells with PD098059 completely abrogated TPA induction of the megakaryocytic surface marker CD41. Strikingly, delayed addition of PD098059 up to 18 h post-initiation of TPA still abrogated cellular differentiation efficiently. As confirmation that PD098059 exerted its effects via the ERK/MAP kinase pathway, expression in K562 cells of a constitutively active mutant of MEK2 overrode inhibition by PD098059. These data therefore confirmed that sustained activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway for >18 h is required for megakaryocytic differentiation. Whereas PD098059 effectively blocked TPA induction of megakaryocytic differentiation, conditioned media from TPA-induced K562 cells induced megakaryocytic differentiation resistant to PD098059 inhibition. The effects of PD098059 appeared to be on the actual media conditioning process, in that conditioned media from cells treated with TPA plus PD098059 failed to induce differentiation. Therefore we conclude that the sustained activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway appears to participate in the establishment of an autocrine signaling loop that is required for megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. Immunoblots of whole cell extracts with antibodies specific for activated ERK used the anti-ActiveTM MAPK pAb (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), which recognizes the dual phosphorylated forms of p42 ERK2 and p44 ERK1. Whole cell extracts for immunoblots were obtained by agitating 1 × 107 cells for 20 min in 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer 150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm sodium metavanadate). 100 μg of protein/sample (as determined by the Bradford assay) were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (20Goldfarb A.N. Goueli S. Mickelson D. Greenberg J.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, anti-ActiveTM MAPK pAb was used at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. Three independent immunoblot time course experiments were performed. Densitometry was performed by scanning developed membranes with a MicroTek flat bed scanner and applying the NIH Image software on a Macintosh platform for signal quantitation. All signals were normalized to those obtained with uninduced K562 cells. For immunoprecipitation kinase (IP-kinase) assays, 5 × 106 cells/time point were extracted for 20 min with 2 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer 150/IPK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as in radioimmune precipitation buffer 150). To 1 ml of extract (2.5 × 106 cellular equivalents), 1 μg of rabbit anti-ERK (C-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added followed by 1 h of rotation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads preblocked with bovine serum albumin. After four washes in 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer 150/IPK buffer, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 300 mg/ml myelin basic protein, 50 μm cold ATP, 100 μCi/ml [γ32P]ATP, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting and autoradiography. Two independent IP-kinase time course experiments were performed. For direct signal quantitation, electroblotted gels were scanned with a Packard InstantimagerTM electronic autoradiography system. K562 cells grown in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal bovine serum were induced to differentiate with the indicated concentrations of TPA. Staining of cells for surface CD41 expression employed the direct fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody PLT1-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( Coulter Corp., Hialeah FL) at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. Isotype-matched control antibody MsIgM-fluorescein isothiocyanate was also employed at 25 μg/ml. Flow cytometry utilized a FACScan system with Lysys II software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The MEK1 inhibitor, PDO98059, was kindly provided by the Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division and is now sold by New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA. The MEK2 expression plasmids pCMV-ΔN-MEK2-S222/226D and pCMV-MEK2-A were generously provided by Dr. Michael J.

Transfections were performed with the liposomal formulation Dotap, following the guidelines of the manufacturer (Boehringer-Mannheim). K562 cells treated with TPA recapitulate several of the events of early megakaryocytic differentiation including acquisition of megakaryocytic surface markers, production of megakaryocytic cytokines, cell cycle arrest, cellular enlargement, and development of polyploid nuclei (12Tabilio A. Pelicci P.G. Vinci G. Mannoni P. Civin C.I. Vainchenker W. Testa U. Lipinski M. Rochant H. Breton-Gorius J. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4569-4574PubMed Google Scholar, 13Alitalo R. Leuk.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19696-19704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A broad range of TPA concentrations (1 nm–1 μm) may induce differentiation, as judged by up-regulation of the platelet surface glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (CD41 antigen), an early marker of megakaryocytic differentiation. The onset of CD41 expression occurs approximately 24 h after continuous cellular stimulation with TPA, indicating a lag between initiation of stimulus and commencement of differentiation. By contrast, bryostatin does not induce any aspect of megakaryocytic differentiation in K562 cells and, in fact, effectively blocks TPA induction of differentiation (14Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Fields A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 671-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The opposing effects of bryostatin and TPA on megakaryocytic differentiation are paradoxical, given that both compounds potently activate PKC. To study the effects on the ERK/MAP kinase pathway of TPA and bryostatin alone and in combination, K562 cells were analyzed by two independent techniques, immunoblotting with an antibody specific for activated ERK kinases and IP-kinase assays with an anti-ERK antibody. Fig. 1 A shows representative time course immunoblots of K562 cellular extracts with an antibody specific for dual phosphorylated ERK kinases. Fig. 1 Bgraphically depicts the pooled immunoblot data from three independent time course experiments. All three stimuli (TPA, bryostatin, and TPA + bryostatin) caused an initial activation of the ERK kinases of 5–10-fold over uninduced cells. However, between 6 and 10 h of stimulation, cells treated with bryostatin alone or TPA + bryostatin showed an irreversible decline in ERK activation back to or below base-line levels. By contrast, cells treated with TPA alone showed a sustained 5-fold activation of ERK evident even at 24 h of stimulation. The IP-kinase assays shown in Figs. 2, A and B, confirmed the immunoblot data; treatment of K562 cells with TPA caused a sustained, ∼5-fold increase in ERK kinase activity over 24 h, whereas bryostatin alone or in combination with TPA caused a transient activation of ERK with decline toward base-line levels at 6–10 h of stimulation. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 therefore demonstrate that in K562 cells, bryostatin only transiently activates ERK kinase and acts in a dominant fashion to attenuate the sustained ERK activation induced by TPA.Figure 2A and B, immunoprecipitation kinase assay for ERK activity in K562 cells treated with either TPA alone (25 nm), bryostatin (BRYO) alone (100 nm), or TPA (25 nm) plus bryostatin (100 nm). Whole cell extracts from the indicated time points were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-ERK antibody (C-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by an in vitro myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphorylation assay. Kinase reactions were then subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting, followed by autoradiography. Panel A shows representative autoradiograms from one of two independent time course experiments. Similar data were obtained in second IP-kinase time course experiment.

Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). Extensive testing both in vitro and in vivo has shown no inhibition by PD098059 of any other known kinases or kinase pathways (18Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). The biological efficacy of this compound has previously been demonstrated by its ability to block NGF-induced differentiation in PC12 cells without any cytotoxicity (11Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The in vitro IC50 for MEK1 inhibition by PD098059 is 2–7 μm; the in vitro IC50 for MEK2 inhibition is 50 μm. As shown in Figs. 3, A andB, PD098059, when present at 25 μm during induction, completely abrogates TPA induction of megakaryocytic differentiation, as assessed by CD41 expression. In addition to blocking CD41 expression, PD098059 also blocks cellular enlargement and partially reverses cell cycle arrest (data not shown). Furthermore, the inhibition was not due to nonspecific cytotoxicity, as the compound actually enhanced cell viability during TPA treatment (data not shown). Nor were the observed effects due to the presence of 0.25% Me2SO carrier because 0.25% Me2SO alone did not block megakaryocytic differentiation (Fig. 3 A). To confirm that the effects of PD098059 were mediated via the ERK/MAP kinase pathway, we performed a reversal experiment, taking advantage of the relatively high IC50 for MEK2. In particular, transient transfection of a constitutive active MEK2 mutant ΔN-MEK2-S222/226D reversed the inhibitory effect of PD098059 on CD41 expression, whereas transfection of a kinase-dead MEK2mutant MEK2-KA failed to reverse the blockade of CD41 expression (Figs. 3, C and D, respectively). In Fig. 4, independent evidence for the involvement of the ERK/MAPK pathway in megakaryocytic differentiation is provided; transient transfection of K562 cells with the kinase-dead mutant MEK2-KA partially inhibited TPA induction of CD41 expression (Fig. 4 C), whereas transfection with the parent vector and with the constitutive active mutant ΔN-MEK2-S222/226D had no inhibitory effects on CD41 induction (Figs. 4, A andB, respectively).Figure 4A, B, and C, an inactive MEK mutant partially blocks TPA induction of CD41 expression. K562 cells were transiently transfected with either a parent vector pCMV5 (A); the vector pCMV-ΔN-MEK2-S222/226D (B), which encodes a constitutively active mutant of MEK2; or pCMV-MEK2-KA, which encodes a kinase-dead mutant of MEK2 (C). 24 h after transfection, the cells were induced with 100 nm TPA for 24 h and then analyzed by FACS for CD41 expression. Indicated in the figure are the percentages of CD41-negative cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data obtained with TPA and bryostatin treatment of K562 cells (Figs. 1 and 2) suggested that sustained activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway might be required for megakaryocytic differentiation. To address this issue directly, PD098059 was added to cells at various time points during the course of differentiation induction. All samples were analyzed for expression of CD41 after a total of 48 h of TPA induction. Fig. 5 shows that addition of PD098059 as late as 18 h after initiating induction still almost completely blocked megakaryocytic differentiation. However, addition of PD098059 at 24 h of induction failed to block megakaryocytic differentiation. The requirement for sustained ERK activation for >18 h raised the possibility that the ERK/MAP kinase pathway might participate in establishment of an autocrine signaling loop. To examine this possibility, conditioned supernatants from K562 cells treated with TPA were applied to fresh cells. To ensure that carry-over of TPA in the conditioned media did not directly induce cellular differentiation, 25 μm PD098059 was added to the conditioned media at the time of application to fresh cells. Surprisingly, PD098059 failed to block differentiation induction by conditioned media (Fig. 6 A). However, if 25 μm PD098059 was included during the initial TPA treatment step, the resultant conditioned media failed to induce differentiation (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained with extensively dialyzed, serum-free conditioned media, ruling out possible effects of cellular metabolite accumulation or simple nutrient depletion (data not shown). The ERK/MAP kinase pathway regulates two mutually antagonistic processes, cellular proliferation and cellular differentiation. Two explanations may resolve this apparent paradox. First, the effects of ERK activation may be cell-type specific as suggested by the different effects of ERK activation in NIH-3T3 cells versus PC12 cells, the former undergoing transformation and the latter undergoing differentiation (6Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Second, the duration and subcellular localization of ERK activation may influence the cellular response (4Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar). In particular, epidermal growth factor, which causes a transient cytoplasmic activation of ERK, fails to induce differentiation of PC12 cells, whereas NGF, which causes a sustained nuclear activation of ERK, successfully induces differentiation of PC12 cells (7Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The antagonistic effects of TPA and bryostatin on K562 cell differentiation show some parallels with the effects of NGF and epidermal growth factor on PC12 cell differentiation. In particular, both TPA and bryostatin cause the activation of ERK in K562 cells, presumably through their activation of PKC; importantly, the two agents show markedly different kinetics in their activation of ERK, with TPA causing sustained activation beyond 24 h and bryostatin causing transient ERK activation with a return to near base line at approximately 10 h. In contrast to observations in the PC12 system, the subcellular localization of activated ERK does not differ between TPA and bryostatin-treated K562 cells: both treatments are associated with a pancellular (nuclear and cytoplasmic) distribution of activated ERK. 2K. Lewandowska and A. N. Goldfarb, unpublished data. The ability of bryostatin to actively suppress megakaryocytic induction by TPA, previously unexplained, correlates well with the ability of bryostatin to alter the kinetics of ERK activation by TPA. In particular, bryostatin causes a delayed down-regulation in the ERK activation by TPA, beginning at 6–10 h of induction. By approximately 14 h of induction with bryostatin + TPA, ERK activation returned to base-line levels. Our experiments with the MEK1 inhibitor, PD098059, confirm that down-regulation of ERK activation as late as 18 h into induction suffices to block megakaryocytic differentiation. The exact mechanism by which bryostatin causes delayed down-regulation of TPA-induced ERK activation remains unknown but might relate to differential effects of TPA and bryostatin on phosphatase activation. The requirement of sustained ERK activation for megakaryocytic differentiation appears to represent an interesting threshold effect. Studies on Swiss 3T3 cells show that 50 μm PD098059 only partially inhibits the TPA activation of ERK by approximately 70% or ∼3-fold (18Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). The 25 μm levels of PD098059 successfully employed in our experiments are therefore predicted to diminish ERK activation by even less, only ∼2-fold. It is therefore likely that TPA stimulation of K562 cells achieves an activation of ERK only slightly above the threshold required for induction of megakaryocytic differentiation. If TPA stimulated ERK activation far above the threshold required for differentiation, PD098059 would most likely prove ineffective as an inhibitor. An autocrine model for the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells explains many of the properties of this experimental system: 1) the ability of conditioned media to induce differentiation even in the presence of PD098059, 2) the 24-h lag phase between initiation of TPA treatment and the onset of CD41 expression, 3) the absence of classic TPA response elements in the promoters for the genes constituting CD41, promoters that nevertheless display TPA inducibility (21Fong A.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18441-18447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Villa-Garcia M. Li L. Riely G. Bray P.F. Blood. 1994; 83: 668-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 4) the appearance on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of multiple new bands at 24 h of TPA stimulation,2 and 5) the requirement for sustained activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway for >18 h. The requirement of sustained activation of ERK above a critical threshold suggests a cumulative phenomenon in which ERK signaling contributes to the accumulation of a mediator, in this case secreted factors, which eventually achieves levels sufficient to trigger megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. We therefore propose a two-step model to describe the early phases of megakaryocytic differentiation. In the earliest lineage commitment phase, sustained ERK activation contributes to the secretion of autocrine factors. In a secondary phase, the cells respond to these factors by initiating a program of terminal differentiation. We thank Drs. Michael Weber and Mark Tykocinski for generously supplying plasmids, Dr. Alan Saltiel and the Parke-Davis Department of Signal Transduction for kindly providing PD098059, and Dr. Dennis Templeton for thoughtful discussions and reagents for IP-kinase assays."

The requirement for the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in cellular signaling is based upon observations that receptors in which Lys-721 within the ATP binding site has been mutated and, hence, lack detectable kinase activity, do not display the full range of biochemical responses (13Chen S.W.

This apparent requirement for kinase activity has focused attention on the development of drugs capable of blocking kinase activity specifically. Quinazoline inhibitors of the EGFR kinase are competitive with ATP; in the 1–10 nmrange, they block EGFR phosphorylation and Src kinase activity in vivo but do not inhibit the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, p210Bcr-Abl, insulin receptor, CSF-1 receptor, and bFGF receptor tyrosine kinases (16Levitzki A.

In studying the ability of the EGFR kinase quinazoline inhibitors AG-1478 and AG-1517 to block TGFα-induced signaling, their effect on receptor dimerization was measured. These studies demonstrated that quinazoline inhibitorsper se induce inactive EGFR homodimers in EGFR-overexpressing cells or EGFR/ErbB-2 heterodimers in cells overexpressing ErbB-2 and containing lower levels of EGFR. The ability of the quinazolines to inhibit kinase function by sequestering receptors into inactive dimers appears related to their interaction with the receptor ATP binding site. These data suggest a novel biochemical mechanism of (inactive) receptor dimerization in which the initial monomer interactions are mediated via the EGFR IC domain and point to the variety of mechanisms by which the activities of ErbB receptor kinases can be inhibited by such compounds.

These cell lines were maintained in minimum essential medium α medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS (Sigma). Genistein, ATP, and AMP-PNP were purchased from Sigma. AG-1478 and AG-1517 are quinazolines that display an IC50 for inhibition of EGFR kinase activityin vitro of 3 nm and 0.9 nm, respectively (16Levitzki A. Gazit A.

K. Shawver, unpublished results. Recombinant heregulin-β was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Sliwkowski (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Subconfluent A431 cells in IMEM, 10% FCS were treated with TGF-α at 37 °C, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice, and solubilized in TGP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After removing Triton-insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, lysates were precipitated at 4 °C using the 986 polyclonal EGFR antiserum (Ref. 22Stoscheck C.M. Carpenter G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 227: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; a generous gift from Dr. Graham Carpenter, Vanderbilt University) or the 528 monoclonal IgG2a raised against the EC domain of the EGFR (Ref. 23Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27595-27602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. John Mendelsohn, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) followed by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma). After four washes with TGP buffer, the EGFR immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analyses of EGFR or Tyr(P) employed an anti-EGFR monoclonal IgG raised against a cytoplasmic receptor sequence (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA) or an anti-Tyr(P) IgG2(Upstate Biotechnology, Inc, Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse Ig followed by ECL (Amersham Corp.). For the former, cell lysates were incubated with the Tab 250 IgG1raised against the EC domain of ErbB-2 (Ref. 24Langton B.C. Crenshaw M.C. Chao L.A. Stuart S.G. Akita R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2593-2598PubMed Google Scholar; Berlex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). For immunoblotting, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against amino acid residues 1222–1236 at the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-2 (NeoMarkers, Freemont, CA) was utilized. Chemical cross-linking in intact cells was performed as described by Sorkin and Carpenter (25Sorkin A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23453-23460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment with ligand or kinase inhibitors, cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS on ice and solubilized for 20 min at 4 °C with TGP buffer containing freshly prepared 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce) (26Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3950-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To terminate the cross-linking reaction, a final concentration of 250 mm glycine was added for an additional 5 min prior to centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove Triton-insoluble material. This procedure would cross-link both cell surface and internalized EGFR dimers (25Sorkin A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23453-23460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to detect EGFR dimers present at the surface, cells were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 1 mmBS3 dissolved in PBS. Glycine (250 mm) was added for 5 min at 4 °C followed by washes with PBS on ice and subsequent lysis with TGP buffer. Protein concentration in cross-linked lysates was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of protein were then resolved by 5–7% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by EGFR immunoblot analysis. For experiments with soluble EGFR, A431 cells were solubilized with TGP buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2 for 20 min at 4 °C. After removing detergent-insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, equivalent aliquots of lysate (approximately 100 μg in 100 μl) were treated at room temperature with TGF-α for 5 min or with AG-1296, AG-1478, or AG-1517 for 30 min. Freshly prepared 10–20 mm BS3 was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and samples were rocked for 20 min at 4 °C. Cross-linking reactions were terminated by the addition of 2.5 m glycine to a final concentration of 250 mm for an additional 5 min. Samples were then subjected to 5–7% gradient SDS-PAGE and EGFR immunoblot analysis. A431 cell membrane vesicles were prepared by published procedures (27Cohen S. Ushiro H. Stoscheck C. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1523-1531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To covalently modify the EGFR ATP binding site, vesicles were incubated with 50 μm FSBA inN,N-dimethylformamide for 60 min at room temperature as described previously (28Buhrow S.A. Cohen S. Staros J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4019-4022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vesicles were subsequently solubilized in TGP buffer and subjected to quinazoline-mediated dimerization as described above. Aliquots of the recombinant TKD61 (provided by John Koland, University of Iowa), which corresponds to the entire cytoplasmic portion of the EGFR (residues 645–1186) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 10–50 μm ATP (Sigma) as described previously (29Cheng K. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Equal volumes from each sample were then resolved by 5–10% gradient SDS-PAGE and subjected to EGFR and Tyr(P) immunoblot procedures. For testing the growth effects of quinazolines, a 1-ml top layer containing a single-cell suspension of 3 × 104 cells, 0.8% agarose (Sea-Plaque, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME), IMEM, 10% FCS, and 10 mm Hepes, with or without different concentrations of inhibitors, was added to a 1-ml bottom layer of 0.8% agarose, 10% FCS in triplicate 35-mm dishes. In some cases, heregulin-β was added the following day in a 100-μl volume to the top layer. Dishes were incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, and colonies measuring >50 μm were counted after 7 days using an Omnicon Stem model II image analyzer (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY). Blockade of EGFR Phosphorylation—We initially studied the inhibitory potency of AG-1478 on basal and ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation in intact A431 cells. A 30-min preincubation with ≥100 nm AG-1478 inhibited the basal and TGF-α-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor without a detectable change in immunoprecipitable EGFR (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with AG-1517 (not shown). These compounds reversibly inhibit the growth of cultured EGFR-overexpressing human tumor cells in the submicromolar range without altering EGF binding (Refs. 16Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar and 19Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Google Scholar and data below). The effect of various inhibitors on EGFR dimerization in vivo was assessed by chemical cross-linking. TGF-α, AG-1478, and AG-1517 induced EGFR homodimers in A431 cells, whereas AG-1296, a quinoxaline inhibitor of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, SU-4231, a quinazoline inhibitor of the HER2/ErbB-2 kinase, or genistein, a nonspecific competitive ATP inhibitor (30Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on dimer formation (Fig. 2 A). These cross-linking conditions would be expected to trap both internalized and cell surface EGFR dimers, since BS3 was added to cells simultaneously with detergent (25Sorkin A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23453-23460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis indicated that TGF-α induced the formation of active dimers as evidenced by the high levels of phosphorylation in the dimer band, whereas receptors treated with AG-1478 or AG-1517 exhibited no Tyr(P) signal (Fig. 2 B), confirming that AG-1478 and AG-1517 specifically inhibit kinase activity. Genistein at 100 μg/ml blocked phosphorylation of the EGFR. EGFR dimerization by AG-1478 was dose-dependent and detectable at concentrations as low as 100 nm, occurred as early as 5 min after quinazoline treatment, and was reversible upon removal of the kinase inhibitor (not shown). To distinguish internalized from cell surface EGFR dimers and confirm that the quinazolines were inducing receptor dimerization in intact cells, we performed experiments in which BS3 was added in the absence of detergent to A431 cells pretreated with TGF-α, AG-1478, or AG-1517. Although at a lower level than when the cross-linking was performed in TGP buffer, EGFR dimers were induced by TGF-α and both kinase inhibitors in intact A431 cells (Fig. 2 C). The increased amount of dimers detected after solubilization in BS3-containing TGP buffer could be due to availability of the EGFR cytoplasmic domain to the cross-linking agent in detergent-permeabilized/solubilized cell lysates. We next studied the biochemical mechanisms of quinazoline-induced dimerization using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either wild-type EGFR or one of two kinase-negative receptors: D813A, in which Asp-813, the catalytic base in phosphoryl transfer, is mutated to Ala (20Coker K.J. Staros J.V. Guyer C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6967-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), or K721R, in which Lys-721 within the ATP binding site is mutated to Arg (21Selva E. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2250-2254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like TGF-α, which induced dimers of wild type and each EGFR mutant in intact cells, the treatment of cells expressing wild-type receptor or D813A with AG-1478 and AG-1517 also resulted in receptor dimerization. However, no detectable dimers were observed upon treatment of cells expressing K721R (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the direct interaction of quinazolines with residues within the ATP binding site, including Lys-721, is critical for the observed dimerization. Alternatively, the binding of the quinazolines at another site within the kinase domain allosterically induces a conformational change of the ATP binding site that precludes kinase activation but facilitates dimerization. To test whether a quinazoline-ATP site interaction was necessary for dimer formation, we examined the competitive effect of the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, on EGFR dimerization induced by AG-1478. Initial experiments showed that like TGF-α, AG-1478 and AG-1517 can dimerize Triton-solubilized EGFR at room temperature or at 37 °C, indicating that results in vitro paralleled those obtained with intact cells (data not shown). To facilitate binding of AMP-PNP to the ATP site, the divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ were added to soluble EGFR preparations prior to quinazoline treatment. As shown in Fig. 4 A, preincubation of soluble EGFR with 1 mm AMP-PNP drastically reduced EGFR dimerization induced by 0.1–10 μm AG-1478. Similar results were obtained using 200 μm ATP (data not shown). Further mechanistic evidence linking quinazoline binding to the ATP site and EGFR dimerization was obtained using A431 membrane vesicles modified with the ATP analog FSBA, which covalently reacts with Lys-721 within the ATP binding site of the EGFR, thus inhibiting kinase activity (28Buhrow S.A. Cohen S. Staros J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4019-4022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Buhrow S.A. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Staros J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7824-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Russo M.W. Lukas T.J. Cohen S. Staros J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5205-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Minimal dimerization of FSBA-modified EGFR occurred in the presence of 1–10 μm AG-1478, whereas AG-1478-mediated dimerization of unmodified EGFR was prominent at concentrations ≥0.1 μm (Fig. 4 B). Under the conditions utilized, FSBA treatment results in the modification of approximately 80% of the EGFR present as assessed by inhibition of receptor kinase activity (28Buhrow S.A. Cohen S. Staros J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4019-4022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the residual dimeric signal probably corresponds to AG-1478-mediated dimerization of the remaining unmodified EGFR. A number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the tyrphostin class display competition with both ATP and the protein substrate (16Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar); however, the ability of the quinazolines to compete with an EGFR protein substrate is unknown. To investigate whether a peptide substrate would impair quinazoline-induced EGFR dimer formation, we used a previously characterized high affinity tyrosine-containing substrate (Glu-Glu-Leu-Glu-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Glu-Asp-Asp-Nle-Glu-Glu; tyrsub), which exhibits a K m(app) of 32 μm for phosphorylation by the EGFR (33Guyer C.A. Woltjer R.L. Coker K.J. Staros J.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Preincubation with 200 μm peptide substrate did not alter EGFR dimerization, nor did it enhance the inhibition of AG-1478-mediated dimerization by AMP-PNP (Fig. 5), suggesting that EGFR dimerization does not result from quinazoline interaction with the peptide substrate binding site but rather results predominantly from their effect on altering the conformation of the ATP binding site, either directly or allosterically. We examined whether quinazoline-mediated EGFR dimerization required the EC and TM receptor domains by utilizing recombinant TKD61 protein, which corresponds to the entire cytoplasmic portion of the EGFR (29Cheng K. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, soluble holoreceptors from A431 cells but not TKD61 form dimers in the presence of AG-1478, suggesting that the EC and/or TM domains are required for stabilization of homodimer formation by the quinazoline. The functional integrity of the ATP site was tested by an in vitro kinase reaction in the presence of divalent cations (12Mohammadi M. Honegger A. Sorokin A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hurwitz D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8742-8748Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Cheng K. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 mmMnCl2 and 10–50 μm ATP, TKD61 underwent phosphorylation on tyrosine and exhibited slower migration on SDS-PAGE as determined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). The effect of quinazolines on dimerization of the homologous receptor ErbB-2 (HER2/neu) was examined in SKBR-3 human breast cancer cells. These cells exhibit gene amplification for ErbB-2 (34Kraus M.H. Popescu N.C. Amsbaugh S.C. King C.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), approximately 105 EGF binding sites/cell (35Imai Y. Leung C.K.H. Friesen H.G. Shiu R.P.C. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4394-4398PubMed Google Scholar,36Arteaga C.L. Hurd S.D. Dugger T.C. Winnier A.R. Robertson B.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4703-4709PubMed Google Scholar), and constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and association of both ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 (37Alimandi M. Romano A. Curia M.C. Muraro R. Fedi P. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1813-1820PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-α treatment had little effect on the appearance of ErbB-2 on the region corresponding to dimeric receptors. The Tyr(P) signal in the dimer band resulting from TGF-α stimulation probably corresponds to cross-linked EGFR and/or EGFR/ErbB-2 heterodimers. However, AG-1517 effectively induced ErbB-2 dimers in SKBR-3 cells; these as well as the ErbB-2 monomers were not detected by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 7,left and middle panels). These results suggest that in the presence of AG-1517, the elevated basal activity of the ErbB-2 kinase is inhibited, leading to a reduction in Tyr(P) content perhaps due to the action of cellular phosphatases. To investigate the composition of the dimers induced by TGF-α versus AG-1517, cross-linked lysates were precipitated using either anti-EGFR or anti-ErbB-2 monoclonal antibodies that recognize each respective receptor's EC domain. ErbB-2 immunoblot analysis revealed that the dimers induced by AG-1517 are a combination of EGFR/ErbB-2 heterodimers and ErbB-2 homodimers (Fig. 7, right panel). Similar results were obtained with 10 μm AG-1478. Of note, the Tyr(P) dimeric band enhanced by TGF-α treatment (Fig. 7, middle panel) was not precipitated at a detectable level by anti-EGFR antibodies (Fig. 7, right panel) suggesting that, given the relative amounts of each receptor present in SKBR-3 cells (ErbB-2[tmt]EGFR), TGF-α may not be as effective as EGF in inducing EGFR/ErbB-2 heterodimerization (38Stern D.F. Kamps M.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 39King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and/or that quinazolines are more effective in mediating stable association, albeit inactive, of the co-receptor tyrosine kinases. We next examined the effect of incubation with quinazolines on anchorage-independent growth of A431 and SKBR-3 cells. These cell lines exhibit an EGFR- and ErbB-2-dependent phenotype in culture, respectively, as supported by studies with specific antibodies that block each respective receptor's EC domain and markedly inhibit tumor cell proliferation (40Fan Z. Masui H. Altas I. Mendelsohn J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4322-4328PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kumar R. Shepard H.M. Mendelsohn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both lines were growth-inhibited by AG-1517 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8 A). The IC50 for growth in A431 cells was <0.1 μm, consistent with the concentration of quinazoline required for inhibition of basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1) and induction of inactive receptor homodimerization in vivo (Fig. 4) as well as with the published (nanomolar) concentrations required for inhibition of"
https://openalex.org/W2053544423,"Hypoxia is a pathophysiological condition that occurs during injury, ischemia, and stroke. It is characterized by a decrease of reactive oxygen intermediates and a change of the intracellular redox level. In tumors hypoxia is regarded as a trigger for enhanced growth and metastasis. Here we report that in HeLa cells, hypoxic conditions induce the transcriptional activation of c-fos transcription via the serum response element. Mutations in the binding site for the ternary complex factor Elk-1 and the serum response factor abolished this induction, indicating that a ternary complex at the serum response element is necessary for the induction of the c-fos gene under hypoxia. The transcription factor Elk-1 was covalently modified by phosphorylation in response to hypoxia. Furthermore this hyperphosphorylation of Elk-1, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the induction of c-fos transcripts were blocked by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase 1. Anin vitro kinase assay with Elk-1 as substrate showed that MAPK is activated under hypoxia. The activation of MAPK corresponds temporally with the phosphorylation and activation of Elk-1. Thus, a decrease of the intracellular reactive oxygen intermediate level by hypoxia induces c-fos via the MAPK pathway. These results suggest that the intracellular redox levels may be directly coupled to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis via Elk-1-dependent induction of c-Fos controlled genes.

These results suggest that the intracellular redox levels may be directly coupled to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis via Elk-1-dependent induction of c-Fos controlled genes. The activation of c-fos by mitogens and changes of the intracellular redox level is mainly mediated by the serum response element (SRE). 1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum response element; AP-1, activator protein 1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; SRF, serum response factor; TCF, ternary complex factor; SAP, stress-activated protein. The SRE is a regulatory element found in many growth factor-regulated promotors that directs the rapid induction of gene expression (for review see Ref. 1Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). The best studied SRE is that of the c-fos gene. Two kinds of transcription factors are required for SRE activity: the ubiquitous transcription serum response factor (SRF) (2Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) and the ternary complex factors (TCFs), which form a ternary complex with the SRF. The human TCFs include Elk-1, SAP-1, and SAP-2 and constitute a subfamily within the Ets family of transcription factors (for review see Ref. 3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These proteins need SRF to bind tightly to the SRE (4Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of Elk-1 and SAP-1 mediate DNA contact and ternary complex formation. The transactivation domain at the C terminus contains several conserved MAPK phosphorylation sites. Growth factor-stimulated activation of the MAPK pathway results in phosphorylation of the Elk-1 C terminus (5Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), which then cooperates with the SRF C-terminal activation domain to activate transcription (6Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 7Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The transcription factor AP-1 is composed of members of the Fos family (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2) and the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) that form restricted homo- or heterodimers (for review see Ref.8Angel P.E. Herrlich P.A. The FOS and JUN Families of Transcription Factors. CRC Press, Boca Raton1994Google Scholar). With the exception of c-Jun homodimers, AP-1 is predominantly induced at a transcriptional level by novel synthesis of its subunits. This induction is controlled by cis-acting SRE elements and AP-1 binding sites in the promotors of several AP-1 genes. A large number of mitogenic and proinflammatory signals lead to activation of AP-1. Likewise, changes in the cellular redox status were reported to activate AP-1 (9Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 10Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). Changes of the cellular redox status are directly coupled to the intracellular level of ROIs. For example, hypoxia and antioxidants reduce the intracellular level of ROIs. A pathophysiological role for reduced levels of ROIs is evident in tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. We have previously reported that treatment of cells with antioxidants such as pyrolidinedithiocarbamate or N-acetyl-l-cysteine (11Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), as well as overexpression of thioredoxin (12Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), strongly activates AP-1. Recently we and others could show that hypoxia, a physiological correlate to antioxidants, also activates AP-1 (13Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and that this depends on novel gene transcription. The activation of AP-1 by hypoxia prompted us to investigate the transcription factors responsible for AP-1 gene induction. The c-Fos protein is a component of the hypoxia-induced AP-1 complex (14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The major cis-acting element responsible for the induction of c-fos transcription in response to a variety of mitogens is the SRE (15Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 16Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we show that hypoxia induces c-fostranscription via the SRE. Both the binding site for the ternary complex factor as well as the binding site for SRF are required for this induction. Hypoxia rapidly induces a hyperphosphorylated ternary complex at the c-fos SRE, which contains the ternary complex factor Elk-1. Furthermore, the activation of MAPK ERK2 but not JNK/SAPK parallels the activation of Elk-1. We therefore conclude that the activation of Elk-1 by the MAPK pathway represents an important link between hypoxia-induced cellular redox imbalance and the activation of the transcription factor AP-1 via c-fos transcription. The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (ATCC, CCL2) was cultured as described in Ref. 14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar. Hypoxic conditions and PMA stimulation were applied as described in Ref. 14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar. Preparation of cell extracts cells were cultivated in the absence of serum. For transfections cells were kept in 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) 14 h before stimulation. In the experiments using PD98059 [2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one] (New England Biolabs Inc.), cells were incubated with 10 μmPD98059 for 1 h prior to hypoxia. 3 × 105 cells/60-mm dish were serum-deprived overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with hypoxic medium for the indicated time as described in Ref. 14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar. The hypoxic medium was aspirated after the treatment, and the culture dish with the adherent cells was immediately frozen on liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed in whole cell extract buffer during thawing (17Baccarini M. Sabatini D.M. App H. Rapp U.R. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3649-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). EMSA binding reactions were performed as described in Refs. 18Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 19Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For Fig. 3, 6 μl of Elk-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or a control antibody (α-glutathione S-transferase, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was added to 0.5 μg of cell extract and incubated for 40 min on ice. Phosphatase inhibitors present in the extracts used in Fig. 3 B were removed. To achieve this whole cell extracts were microdialyzed on VS filters (0.025 μm; Millipore) against phosphatase buffer (18Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Phosphatase assays were performed as described (18Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 films at −80 °C for 12–48 h. HeLa cells (2 × 106 cells) were treated as described (14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 56 μg of total cellular extract were immunoprecipitated with a phospho-MAPK antibody, washed, and incubated with a glutathione S-transferase-Elk-1 fusion protein as substrate. The reaction was separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, blotted, and incubated with an antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser383 of Elk-1 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs Inc.). HeLa cells (1 × 106/100 mm dish) were treated with hypoxic medium for 15–90 min. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described in Ref. 20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar. Separation of 10 μg total RNA/lane on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotting, hybridization, and washing steps were performed as described (21Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), except that hybridization was performed in Rapidhyb buffer (Amersham Corp.) with a 32P-labeled c-foscDNA probe. RNA integrity and equal amount were confirmed using UV shadowing and methylene blue staining of the membrane (not shown). Transient transfections were performed essentially as described (19Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids pSRE2-tk80-luc (22Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), pEL2-tk80 (ΔTCF), and pm2-tk80 (ΔSRE) were gifts of A. Nordheim. pEL2-tk80 and pm2-tk80 were identical to pSRE2-tk80-luc except they contained mutations in the SRE that drastically reduce the DNA binding of TCF/Elk-1 and SRF, respectively (4Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly 105 HeLa cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected after changing the medium the next day using the calcium phosphate method. 16 h later the cells were supplied with fresh medium. The medium was aspirated after 16 h, and the cells were supplied with hypoxic medium and incubated in the hypoxic chamber. Control cells were transfected in parallel and cultivated under normal oxygen pressure. After 6 h cells were harvested and luciferase assays were performed as described (19Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Luciferase-generated light units were normalized to protein contents and are shown as relative luciferase activation versusuntreated cells. The means of four experiments performed in duplicate are shown. PMA stimulation was used as a control in the experiments and gave approximately double the stimulation of the hypoxia treatment (not shown). To test c-fos gene activation under hypoxia, HeLa cells were subjected to hypoxia. A rapid and transient increase of c-fos transcripts was observed (Fig. 1 A). c-fos mRNA became detectable as early as 15 min following hypoxia (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Maximal induction was observed after 30 min of stimulation (lane 3). No c-fos mRNA was detected after 90 min of stimulation (lane 5). Similar kinetics have been observed for the induction of the c-fosgene by treatment with mitogens (15Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 16Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the c-fos SRE is responsible for the induction under hypoxia. Transient transfection experiments using a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by two c-fos SRE binding elements showed an 8.4-fold induction upon hypoxic stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Using mutations in the binding sites for the ternary complex factor (ΔTCF) or the serum responsive factor (ΔSRF), we analyzed the requirement of the different binding sites for this induction. These mutations abolish binding of the TCF and SRF, respectively (4Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). No significant induction could be detected using the ΔTCF and ΔSRF constructs (Fig. 1 B, columns 2 and 3). These data show that the intact binding site for the ternary complex factor as well as the binding site for the serum response factor are required for the induction of the c-fos gene during hypoxia. We subsequently studied the effect of reduced oxygen pressure on the phosphorylation status of TCF in HeLa cells. Signal-induced TCF hyperphosphorylation can be assayed in native gels by a phosphatase-sensitive retarded migration of the TCF-DNA complexes (18Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 23Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with hypoxia between 15 min and 6 h (Fig. 2 A). Stimulation of cells with the phorbolester PMA was used as a positive control (Fig. 2 A, lane 12). Extreme care was taken to avoid reoxygenation of the cells. Hypoxia rapidly induced a more slowly migrating TCF-DNA complex on the c-fos SRE as seen by EMSA (complex 2, Fig. 2 A). This complex was indistinguishable in its mobility from that induced upon stimulation with PMA, which is known to lead to hyperphosphorylated TCFs (16Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2–5 with lane 12). The retarded ternary complex was observed within 5 min (see Fig. 4 B, lane 2,upper panel), reached a peak at 15 min, and decreased after 40 min (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2–5). Fig. 2 B clearly shows that the observed retarded complex is a ternary complex that depends on the presence of the SRE binding site, the SRF core, and extracts containing TCFs (4Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Neither SRF core alone (lane 14) nor extract without the SRF core (lane 17) can form this ternary complex with the c-fos SRE. Formation of the modified protein-DNA complexes induced under hypoxia in HeLa cells was inhibited by the addition of a specific antibody against Elk-1 to the DNA binding reaction (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–4). We conclude that these complexes contain either bona fide Elk-1 or antigenically closely related TCFs. Consistent with our previous data it has been previously reported that Elk-1 constitutes the majority of HeLa cell TCF activity (24Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To show that hyperphosphorylation of the TCFs is the cause of the altered mobility, a phosphatase treatment was performed. Incubation of the cell extracts with potato acid phosphatase prior to EMSAs abolished complex 2 formation (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5–10), indicating that the retardation of the band upon hypoxia was caused by hyperphosphorylation of the TCFs TCF/Elk-1. In contrast to the activation of Elk-1 by hypoxic conditions, no activation was observed in gel shifts upon re-exposure of cells to atmospheric oxygen (data not shown). We next explored if the phosphorylation of TCF/Elk-1 under hypoxic conditions was due to activation of MAPK. Preincubation of cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, resulted in a complete loss of complex 2 formation (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 5 and 6,lower panel). This shows that MEK1 activity is necessary for the phosphorylation of TCF/Elk-1 during hypoxia. In Western blots a transiently hyperphosphorylated form of ERK2 could be detected after 5–15 min, whereas JNK/SAPK was not altered (data not shown). To investigate whether this hyperphosphorylated ERK2 correlated with activation of MAPK, an in vitro MAP-kinase assay was performed. After immunoprecipitation of active MAPK, recombinant Elk-1 was used as substrate, blotted, and detected by a specific phospho-specific anti-Elk-1 antibody. Phosphorylated Elk-1 can be detected after 5 min of hypoxia (Fig. 4 B, lane 2,upper panel), indicating MEK activity. This already decreased after 15 min of hypoxia (Fig. 4 B, lane 3, upper panel). The active form of MAPK temporally corresponds to the appearance of the hyperphosphorylated complex in EMSA (Fig. 4 B, compare upper and lower panels). Furthermore, the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 blocked activation of MAPK (Fig. 4 B, lane 5, upper panel) and appearance of the phosphorylated complex 2 (lane 5, lower panel). To test whether the induction of c-fos transcripts was also inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, a Northern analysis was performed. The induction of c-fos transcripts was blocked as well as the appearance of the phosphorylated complex 2 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5and 6, compare upper and lower panels). These results show that the MAPK pathway is responsible for the activation of TCF/Elk-1 and the induction of c-fosunder hypoxic conditions. The molecular response of tissue to hypoxia is a complex and poorly understood process. Hypoxic cells in tumors show a reduced sensitivity toward radiation and chemotherapy (25Coleman C.N. Bump E.A. Kramer R.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 6: 709-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Kennedy K.A. Teicher B.A. Rockwell S. Sartolrelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Sakata K. Kwok T.T. Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Gordon G.R. Sutherland R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Tannock I. Guttman P. Br. J. Cancer. 1981; 42: 245-248Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Teicher B.A. Holden S.A. Al-Achi A. Herman T.S. Cancer Res. 1990; 52: 4372-4378Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that hypoxia activates the transcription factor AP-1 in HeLa cells (13Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This activation is dependent on novel AP-1 protein synthesis. However, the regulation of AP-1 transcription upon hypoxic conditions remained to be clarified. Different modes of redox regulation have been described for a variety of mammalian transcription factors including steroid receptors (30Silva C.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6638-6647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), c-Myb protein (31Guehmann S. Vorbrueggen G. Kalkbrenner F. Moelling K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the transcriptional activators NF-κB (10Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar, 11Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) and AP-1 (32Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J.I. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 33Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). At the post-translational level, Ref-1, a redox-factor and a DNA repair enzyme (33Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 34Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 635-665Google Scholar), facilitates Fos-Jun DNA interaction when cells are treated with thioredoxin. Ref-1 is activated under hypoxic conditions as well (13Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the pathways leading to the transcriptional activation of the AP-1 subunits under hypoxic conditions are still not understood. The recently described protein kinases N-terminal c-Jun kinase and stress-activated protein kinase, a subfamily of the ERKs that can phosphorylate c-Jun, are not activated by hypoxia (35Pombo C.M. Bonventres J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26546-26551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have analyzed the regulation of c-fos gene upon hypoxia. Here we show that the ternary complex factor TCF/Elk-1 is activated via the MAPK pathway under hypoxia. In addition to our previous results, where we have shown that treatment of HeLa cells with the oxidant H2O2 or with different antioxidants activated Elk-1 (19Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), these data underline the relevance of Elk-1 as a physiological sensor for the intracellular redox status. With anin vitro kinase assay we could show that MAPK is activated under hypoxia and is able to phosphorylate Elk-1. Preincubation of the cells with PD98059 as specific inhibitor of MEK1 (36Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) blocked the activation of MAPK in the in vitro kinase assay, the induction of c-fos transcripts in Northern analysis, and the retardation of the Elk-1 complex in EMSA. Therefore, hypoxia activates Elk-1 by the MAPK signal-transduction pathway. The same pathway is used when the c-fos gene is activated by antioxidants (19Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This study indicates the molecular mechanism by which the c-fosgene is transcriptionally up-regulated upon hypoxia. Why does reoxygenation not activate Elk-1? In our previous study we observed a phosphorylation of Elk-1 after treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2 (19Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However we could not observe any activation of Elk-1 by reoxygenating the cells following treatment with hypoxia (data not shown). Although reoxygenation increases the intracellular level of ROIs (37González-Flecha B. Cutrin J.C. Boverin A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), the increase of H2O2 seems to be neither high nor fast enough to activate Elk-1 under reoxygenation. It is possible that other ROIs than H2O2 are predominantly generated under reoxygenation. Superoxide anions, which are generated under reoxygenation as well (37González-Flecha B. Cutrin J.C. Boverin A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), are not able to activate Elk-1 (19Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be excluded that other forms of oxidative stress occurring under physiological conditions can activate Elk-1. The activation of c-fos transcription in response to both oxidant and antioxidant conditions leads to the formation of active AP-1. The maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis may be an important biological function of AP-1 conserved from yeast to mammals. Many genes induced by redox stress contain AP-1 binding sites that confer this responsiveness (38Daniel V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 173-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 39Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar, 40Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 42Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowely W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another transcription factor that was identified and cloned as a hypoxia inducible factor is HIF-1 (for review see Ref. 43Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Redox Report. 1996; 2: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HIF itself is redox-regulated (44Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There is no evidence so far that the MAPK pathway or Elk-1 play a role in the induction of the HIF-1 gene. In the enhancer of the glucose transporter-1, a serum reponse element seems to cooperate with HIF-1 binding sequences (45Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the serum response factor and adjacent ternary complex factors such as Elk-1 can cooperate with HIF-1 to activate hypoxia-inducible genes. Protein-DNA interactions of AP-1 and HIF-1 have been described for the enhancer of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene that is dependent on functional AP-1 binding sites for activation under hypoxia (46Norris M.L. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper provide an explanation for the appearance of c-Fos proteins in AP-1 under hypoxia (14Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Firstly, c-fos gene expression is turned on by hypoxia-activated TCF/Elk-1 via the MAPK pathway. Then the newly synthesized c-Fos in the AP-1 complex can lead to activation of other genes. What are the target genes of c-Fos activated by hypoxia in tumor cells? It is well established that c-Fos controls the expression of a variety of genes that are up-regulated during malignant progression, including those encoding the tumor metalloproteases stromelysin and type I collagenase (47Kerr L.D. Holt J.D. Matrisian L.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 48Schönthal A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Cell. 1988; 54: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 49Hennigan R.F. Hwaker K.L. Ozanne B.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3591-3600PubMed Google Scholar). Metalloproteases are a group of secreted enzymes that can degrade the extracellular matrix, thereby facilitating tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (reviewed by Ref. 50Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). Increased metalloprotease expression has been associated with malignant progression in many models of in vivo cancer development (reviewed by Ref. 51McDonnell S. Matrisian L.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A variety of human and rodent tumors are known to overexpress c-fos (e.g. Refs. 52Honoki K. Tsutsumi M. Tsujiuchi T. Kondoh S. Shiraiwa K. Miyauchi Y. Mii Y. Tamai S. Konishi Y. Bowden G.T. Mol. Carcinogen. 1992; 6: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and 53Urabe A. Nakayama J. Taniguchi S. Terao H. Hori Y. J. Pathol. 1992; 168: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). C-Fos overexpression in transgenic mice induces bone tumors (54Rüther U. Komitowski D. Schubert F.R. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 861-865PubMed Google Scholar). In human breast cancer, c-fos overexpression is associated with malignant progression (55Biunno I. Pozzi M.R. Pierotti M.A. Pilotti S. Cattoretti G. Della P.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 57: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 56Walker R.A. Cowl J. J. Pathol. 1991; 163: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hypoxia on the other hand is a known inducer of metastasis (57Young S.D. Marshall R.S. Hill R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9533-9537Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore the activation pathway shown in this study provides a mechanism how c-fos activated by hypoxia leads to tumor growth and metastasis. In conclusion our results demonstrate how hypoxia as a physiological stimulus is linked to the activation of c-fos. The data presented here provide evidence that a nuclear transcription factor, TCF/Elk-1, is phosphorylated and thereby activated in response to reduced oxygen pressure. TCF/Elk-1 is in turn activated by the MAPK ERK2. Future studies will need to address the pathway(s) by which hypoxia activates MEK1 and MAPK such as ERK2. We thank Dr. Alfred Nordheim and Dr. Michael Cahill for supplying us with the luciferase-plamids and the c-fos probes. We are extremely grateful to Dr. Heike L.

Accumulating data show that it inhibits multiple cellular processes, as a consequence of its ability to repress the enzymatic activity of Src family tyrosine protein kinases. We previously demonstrated that, via its Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, Csk is tightly bound to PEP, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) exclusively expressed in hemopoietic cells. In this report, we have tested the possibility that Csk also interacts with PTP-PEST, a ubiquitous PTP sharing structural homology with PEP. Our studies revealed that Csk was associated with PTP-PEST in a variety of cell types, including non-hemopoietic cells. This interaction involved the SH3 region of p50csk and a proline-rich region (PPPLPERTPESFVLADM) outside the catalytic region of PTP-PEST. Even though both PTP-PEST and PEP were associated with Csk, significant differences were noted between these two PTPs. PTP-PEST, but not PEP, was also complexed with Shc, an adaptor molecule implicated in the Ras pathway. Moreover, PTP-PEST and PEP were found to accumulate primarily in distinct intracellular compartments in cell fractionation studies. In combination, these findings indicated that, like PEP, PTP-PEST is probably involved in Csk-mediated functions in mammalian cells. Moreover, they suggested that the roles of Csk-PTP-PEST and Csk-PEP are likely to be different. p50csk is a cytosolic tyrosine protein kinase expressed in all cell types.

Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It contains, from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus, a Src homology (SH) 3 region, an SH2 domain, and a catalytic domain. Significant interest in Csk stems from its unique ability to phosphorylate the inhibitory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Src family TPKs. This phosphorylation provokes an intramolecular association between the carboxyl terminus and the SH2 domain of Src-related enzymes, thereby repressing their enzymatic activity (reviewed in Ref. 3Cooper J.A.

As a corollary to the widespread involvement of Src-related TPKs in cell signaling, p50csk has the ability to inhibit several cellular responses. We previously showed that it is a potent negative regulator of antigen receptor-mediated T-cell activation, by inactivating the Src family kinases p56lck and p59fynT(6Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, Csk can suppress the Na+/H+antiporter in kidney epithelial cells (7Yamaji Y. Amemiya M. Cano A. Preisig P.A. Miller R.T. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Finally, analyses of mice engineered to lack p50csk as a result of homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells have illustrated its requirement for normal central nervous system development and embryonic viability (10Nada S.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Little is known of the regulation of p50csk. As it is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, it is postulated to be regulated by recruitment to cellular membranes, where Src-related kinases are residing. In keeping with this idea, FcγRIIA-mediated activation of human erythroleukemia cells was suggested to provoke an increase in the extent of membrane association of Csk (12Ford C.E. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30378-30385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we reported that constitutive membrane targeting of Csk, via addition of a myristoylation signal from Src or farnesylation/palmitylation sequences from Ras, enhanced its ability to inhibit antigen receptor-mediated signals in T-cells (6Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which Csk is physiologically recruited to cellular membranes remains to be elucidated, studies in fibroblasts have indicated that its SH3 and SH2 sequences are crucial for colocalization with activated Src molecules at focal adhesions (13Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is presumed that the SH3 and SH2 domains allow the association of Csk with docking proteins located in focal adhesions. Because constitutive membrane targeting failed to rescue the ability of SH3 or SH2 domain-deletion mutants of Csk to repress T-cell activation (14Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), these two regions are also likely to provide additional functions that are crucial for the biological activity of Csk. Presumably, these modules also interact with effectors and/or regulators of p50csk. While these proteins are mostly unidentified, the SH2 domain of Csk was found to bind tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin and p125fak in fibroblasts (15Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It can also associate with the docking molecules IRS-1 (16Tobe K. Sabe H. Yamamoto T. Yamauchi T. Asai S. Kaburagi Y. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kimura H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Hanafusa H. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and others (14Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Oetken C. Couture C. Bergman M. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Williams S. Alitalo K. Burn P. Mustelin T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1625-1631PubMed Google Scholar) reported that it recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from activated T-cells. Recently, we identified the first known ligand for the Csk SH3 domain (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we observed that Csk could interact with PEP, a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) exclusively expressed in hemopoietic cells (Fig. 1) (20Matthews R.J. Bowne D.B. Flores E. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Flores E. Roy G. Patel D. Shaw A. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4938-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We found that 20–50% of PEP molecules was associated with p50csk in a variety of hemopoietic cells, including T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Structure-function analyses showed that this complex was mediated by the Csk SH3 region and by a proline-rich region (PPPLPERTPESFIVVEE; PEP P1) located in the non-catalytic carboxyl-terminal portion of PEP (Fig. 1). The high degree of specificity of this interaction was highlighted by the fact that a related proline-rich sequence in PEP (PPPLPERTLESFFLADE; PEP P2) was unable to negotiate binding to p50csk. Moreover, no other SH3 domain-containing molecule, including the Csk-related enzyme Chk, was capable of associating with PEP. PTP-PEST is a ubiquitously expressed PTP that bears structural homology with PEP (Fig. 1) (22Yang Q. Co D. Sommercorn J. Tonks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6622-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It contains an amino-terminal phosphatase domain, sharing ∼60% sequence identity with PEP. Additionally, the last 20 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of PTP-PEST and PEP are nearly identical. Both PTPs also possess a long non-catalytic carboxyl-terminal region, which contains several PEST-like sequences. However, the sequence conservation in this domain is otherwise limited (less than 10% sequence identity). One notable exception is the motif PPPLPERT, which is present both in PEP (PEP P1 and P2) and in PTP-PEST (PEST P2) (Fig. 1). On the basis of these similarities, PTP-PEST and PEP are postulated to belong to the same PTP family. The association of PEP with Csk is likely to be physiologically relevant. However, it is noteworthy that PEP is not expressed in non-hemopoietic cells, where Csk has important roles. Hence, it is plausible that a PEP-related PTP existing in non-hemopoietic cells is also capable of interacting with p50csk. In this paper, we have examined the possibility that Csk interacts with PTP-PEST. We found that PTP-PEST could be co-immunoprecipitated with p50csk in a variety of cell types, including hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cells. This association involved the SH3 domain of Csk and the P2 sequence in PTP-PEST. Despite their shared ability to bind Csk, only PTP-PEST was also associated with the Shc adaptor molecule. Moreover, PTP-PEST was found to be primarily located in the cytosolic fraction, whereas PEP mostly accumulated in the particulate fraction of a T-cell line. Tissues were obtained from 3 to 6 week-old Balb/c mice. BI-141 is an antigen-specific mouse T-cell line (24Reske-Kunz A.B. Rüde E. Eur. J.

Cos-1 cells were propagated in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Polyclonal rabbit anti-PTP-PEST antibodies were produced using a trpE fusion containing part of the non-catalytic portion of PTP-PEST (amino acids 286–471) as immunogen. These antibodies did not cross-react with PEP. 2D. Davidson, J.-F. Cloutier, A. Gregorieff, and A. Veillette, unpublished data. Rabbit antisera reacting with PEP were reported previously (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). They did not recognize PTP-PEST.2 Antibodies against Csk, Chk, FynT, Lck, Zap-70, Syk, and the ζ chain of the T-cell receptor complex were described elsewhere (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A.

Anti-lamin B antibodies were obtained from Dr. Yves Raymond, Institut du Cancer, Montréal. In some experiments, affinity purified antibodies against p50csk, Shc, Fyn, Chk, PEP, or PTP-PEST were used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-TrpE monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were purchased from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). Mouse anti-Myc mAb 9E10 and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb 12CA5 were previously described (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A mouse ptp-pest cDNA was generated by PCR, using RNA from NIH 3T3 cells as template. Amyc epitope-tagged version of this cDNA, in which the sequence MASMEQKLISEEDLNNGNS was added to the amino terminus of PTP-PEST, was created by overlap extension PCR. A variant lacking the nucleotides coding for the sequence PPPLPERT in PEST P2 (Fig. 1) was also produced by PCR. All cDNAs were fully sequenced to ensure that no unwanted mutations had been introduced during PCR (data not shown). cDNAs coding for the HA-tagged Csk mutants and Myc-tagged PEP were reported previously (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells or tissues were lysed in 1 × TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) supplemented with 10 μg per ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone,N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). Proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation using the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with either Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Baie d'Urfé, Québec) or formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureusProtein A (Pansorbin; Calbiochem-Novabiochem Int., San Diego), coupled, if indicated, to rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in TNE buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Proteins were subsequently eluted in sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, and transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for immunoblotting. Immunoblots were performed according to a previously described protocol (32Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), using either 125I-Protein A (Amersham Canada, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), 125I-goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd., Montréal, Québec, Canada), or enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Canada, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Immunoreactive products were detected by autoradiography. All quantitations were done with a PhosphorImager (BAS 2000; Fuji), using125I-Protein A- or 125I-goat anti-mouse IgG-labeled immunoblots. To identify the proline-rich motif of PTP-PEST involved in binding to the SH3 region of Csk, the necessary DNA fragments from ptp-pestwere amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame in the pATH vector. The resulting TrpE fusion proteins encompassed amino acids 324–348 (IDSEKQDSPPPKPPRTRSCLVEGDA; PEST P1) or 669–690 (DADVSEESPPPLPERTPESFVLADM; PEST P2) of PTP-PEST. All plasmids were verified by sequencing (data not shown). TrpE fusion proteins containing the P1 or P2 region of PEP were described elsewhere (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins were reported previously (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Production and purification of GST fusion proteins were as described elsewhere (33Peri K.G. Gervais F. Weil R. Davidson D. Gish G.D. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2765-2772PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays were conducted as detailed in an earlier publication (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Transient transfections in Cos-1 cells were performed as described previously (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For cell fractionation, BI-141 T-cells were incubated for 15 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA pH 8.0) supplemented with the protease and phosphatase inhibitors outlined above. Then, membranes were mechanically broken with a Dounce homogenizer. In all cases, staining with trypan blue confirmed that over 95% of cells had been lysed (data not shown). After adjusting the homogenates to 0.15m NaCl, nuclei and large membrane sheets (P1) were recovered by two successive centrifugations at 480 × gfor 5 min. Supernatants were then separated into soluble (S100) and particulate (P100) fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The various fractions were solubilized in boiling sample buffer, and lysates corresponding to equivalent cell numbers were subjected to immunoblots. To avoid overloading of the gels, however, lysates from 5.5 times lower cell numbers were used for the S100 fraction. This factor was taken into consideration in the subsequent assessment of relative protein distribution. The validity of the cell fractionation was confirmed by studying the distribution of the ζ chain of the T-cell antigen receptor complex and lamin B. These two polypeptides are expected to localize primarily to the P100 and P1 fractions, respectively. To examine whether Csk interacts with PTP-PEST, the patterns of expression of these two enzymes were first compared. Equivalent amounts of cell lysates from various mouse tissues were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antisera directed against either PTP-PEST (Fig. 2, top panel) or Csk (middle panel). In addition, parallel lysates were immunoblotted with anti-PEP antibodies (bottom panel). Importantly, the anti-PTP-PEST (hereafter named anti-PEST) serum did not cross-react with PEP, and vice versa.2 This experiment showed that the PTP-PEST protein, which migrated at ∼120 kDa in these gels, was present in all the tissues tested (top panel), with the exception of kidney (lane 4). Greater quantities of PTP-PEST were detected in the lymphoid organs thymus (lane 1) and spleen (lane 2), as well as in liver (lane 5). In an analogous manner, p50csk was most abundant in thymus (middle panel, lane 1) and spleen (lane 2). Lower amounts were noted in the other tissues (lanes 3–6; data not shown). By contrast, PEP, which exhibited an apparent molecular mass of ∼110 kDa, was readily detected only in thymus (bottom panel, lane 1). Small amounts of PEP could also be seen in spleen and kidney in longer exposures (data not shown). To determine whether p50csk was physically associated with PTP-PEST, lysates from these various tissues were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of p50csk. Following several washes, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with anti-PEST antibodies (Fig. 3 A). This study revealed that significant quantities of PTP-PEST were present in p50cskimmunoprecipitates from thymus (lane 1), spleen (lane 2), and liver (lane 5). Small quantities of PTP-PEST were also associated with Csk in brain (lane 3), although their detection required longer autoradiographic exposures (data not shown). No Csk-PTP-PEST complexes were detected in kidney (lane 4) and heart (lane 6). In general, the amounts of Csk-PTP-PEST detected in these various tissues were proportional to the combined levels of expression of Csk and PTP-PEST (see Fig. 2). PTP-PEST was also co-immunoprecipitated with p50csk in various cell lines, including fibroblasts, T-cells, and B-cells (data not shown). As the anti-PEST antibodies used precipitated over 90% of PTP-PEST from cell lysates,2 we could estimate the total amounts of PTP-PEST present in these tissues and cell lines (see Fig. 3 B for an example). On this basis, we calculated that 5–10% of PTP-PEST molecules were co-immunoprecipitated with Csk (data not shown). To verify the specificity of this co-immunoprecipitation, thymocyte lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against other signaling molecules, and the presence of PTP-PEST in these immunoprecipitates was assessed by anti-PEST immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B). Although PTP-PEST was easily detected in p50cskimmunoprecipitates (lane 2), it was not present in immunoprecipitates of Chk, a Csk-related enzyme (lane 3), FynT (lane 4), Lck (lane 5), Zap-70 (lane 6), and Syk (lane 7). Similarly, no PTP-PEST was observed in immunoprecipitates obtained with normal rabbit serum (lane 9). In keeping with earlier reports (34Habib T. Herrera R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25243-25246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), significant quantities of PTP-PEST (15–20%) were immunoprecipitated with Shc (lane 8), an adaptor molecule possessing an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain, a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain, and sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. The interaction between PTP-PEST and Shc is mediated by an NPLH sequence located in the carboxyl-terminal portion of PTP-PEST (Fig. 1) and by the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of Shc (35Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To appraise the relative abundance of Csk-PTP-PEST and Csk-PEP in cells, PTP-PEST and PEP were individually immunoprecipitated from thymocyte lysates, and their association with Csk was quantitated by immunoblotting with an anti-Csk serum (Fig. 4). Importantly, the anti-PEST and anti-PEP antibodies utilized in our experiments were able to recover >90% of either PTP-PEST or PEP from cell lysates, with a single round of immunoprecipitation2 (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that roughly equal amounts of p50csk were associated with either PTP-PEST (lane 2) or PEP (lane 3). In contrast, no Csk was present in anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates (lane 4) or in immunoprecipitates generated with normal rabbit serum (lane 5). Taking into account the levels of p50csk expressed in thymus (lane 1), it was determined that ∼5% of Csk was bound to PTP-PEST and PEP in thymus-derived cells. Hence, in a cell type where both PTP-PEST and PEP are expressed, the levels of Csk-PTP-PEST and Csk-PEP complexes appeared comparable. To determine the structural basis for the interaction between Csk and PTP-PEST, attempts were made to reconstitute this association in a heterologous mammalian cell system. Cos-1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding various HA-tagged versions of Csk (Csk-HA), in the presence or absence of cDNAs coding for a Myc-tagged version of PTP-PEST (Myc-PEST). Sixty hours after transfection, HA-tagged Csk polypeptides were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb 12CA5, and their association with PTP-PEST was ascertained by immunoblotting with anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (Fig. 5, top panel). The abundance of Myc-PEST and Csk-HA was verified by immunoblotting of total cell lysates with anti-Myc (middle panel) or anti-HA antibodies (bottom panel). In cells expressing wild-type Csk-HA (lane 7), we observed that significant amounts of Myc-PEST were recovered in anti-HA immunoprecipitates. In comparison, no Myc-tagged protein was detected when these immunoprecipitates were generated from cells lacking Myc-PEST (lane 2) or Csk-HA (lane 6). Myc-PEST was also associated with the SH2 domain-deleted (lane 9) and kinase-inactive (lane 10) versions of HA-tagged Csk. However, it failed to co-immunoprecipitate with the SH3 domain-deleted variant of Csk-HA (lane 8). These differences were not caused by variations in the levels of expression of the transfected cDNAs, as reflected by the immunoblots of cell lysates with anti-Myc (middle panel) and anti-HA (bottom panel) antibodies. Since the SH3 region of Csk was needed for the association with PTP-PEST, special attention was given to proline-rich sequences in PTP-PEST that could mediate this interaction. As mentioned above, PEP interacts with Csk via its proline-rich region P1, located outside the phosphatase domain (Fig. 1) (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Another proline-rich sequence in PEP, P2, is inefficient at mediating binding to p50csk. Although the non-catalytic domain of PTP-PEST is generally divergent from that of PEP (22Yang Q. Co D. Sommercorn J. Tonks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6622-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), its second proline-rich region (P2) shares homology with PEP P1 and P2 (Fig. 1). Another polyproline motif (PPPKPPRTRSCLVEFDA; PEST P1) also exhibits homology with the two PEP sequences. To determine whether these PTP-PEST sequences were able to bind the Csk SH3 domain, they were individually expressed as TrpE fusion proteins in bacteria. Their ability to associate with a GST fusion protein encompassing the SH3 region of Csk was evaluated in in vitrobinding assays, as detailed under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 6 A). As is the case for the P1 region of PEP (top panel, lane 2), the P2 sequence of PTP-PEST (lane 4) was able to associate with the Csk SH3 domain in vitro. In contrast, PEST P1 (lane 5) and TrpE alone (lane 1) did not bind the Csk SH3 domain. In agreement with our previous report (19Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), PEP P2 (lane 3) was also inefficient at binding the Csk SH3 domain, although longer exposures of this immunoblot revealed that a small amount of binding did occur (data not shown). Immunoblotting of bacterial lysates with anti-TrpE antibodies documented that all fusion proteins were expressed comparably (bottom panel). To gain a better idea of the relative affinities of PEST P2 and PEP P1 for the Csk SH3 domain, serial dilutions of bacterial lysates were used in the binding assays (Fig. 6 B). This experiment indicated that TrpE-PEST P2 (lanes 6–9) bound the Csk SH3 domain with ∼10 × lower efficiency than TrpE-PEP P1 (lanes 1–4). (This is best exemplified by comparing lane 2with lane 6 and lane 3 with lane 7.) In another assay, we examined the specificity of the interaction of PEST P2 with the Csk SH3 domain (Fig. 6 C). GST fusions bearing the SH3 domain of other signaling molecules were tested for their ability to bind PEST P2 in vitro. Contrary to the SH3 domain of Csk (lane 2), the SH3 regions of Chk (lane 3), Abl (lane 4), Fyn (lane 5), Grb2 (lane 6), and phospholipase C-γ1 (lane 7) failed to associate with the second proline-rich region of PTP-PEST. Collectively, these studies suggested that P2, but not P1, of PTP-PEST was mediating the association with p50csk in vivo. To rigorously address this possibility, a cDNA construct coding for a PTP-PEST variant lacking the sequence PPPLPERT in the P2 region (PTP-PESTΔP2) was created by PCR. A myc-tagged version of this cDNA was transiently transfected in C"

In this study a new extraction and purification approach was successfully applied to isolate ManLAMs (lipoarabinomannans with mannosyl extensions) from bacillus Calmette Guérin leading to the obtention of two types of ManLAMs namely parietal and cellular. Structurally, they were found to differ by the percentage of mannooligosaccharide caps, 76 and 48%, respectively, and also, thanks to a new analytical method, by the structure of the phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor lipid moiety. A novel fatty acid in the mycobacterium genus assigned to a 12-O-(methoxypropanoyl)-12-hydroxystearic acid was the only fatty acid esterifying C-1 of the glycerol residue of the parietal ManLAMs, while the phosphatidyl unit of the cellular ManLAMs showed a large heterogeneity due to a combination of palmitic and tuberculostearic acid. Finally, parietal and cellular ManLAMs were found to differentially affect interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α secretion from human dendritic cells. We show that parietal but not cellular ManLAMs were able to stimulate tumor necrosis factor-α secretion from dendritic cells. From these studies we propose that the 1-[12-O-(methoxypropanoyl)-12-hydroxystearoyl]-sn-glycerol part is the major cytokine-regulating component of the ManLAMs. It seems likely that modification of the ManLAM lipid part, which may occur in hostile environments, could regulate macrophagic mycobacterial survival by altering cytokine stimulation.

Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of human death among the infectious diseases with over 3 million deaths each year (1Bloom B.R. Murray G.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). The decline in tuberculosis in the developed countries has been reversed by the tuberculosis cases arising in AIDS patients, among the homeless, and by the emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to the first-line drugs, which are isoniazid and ethambutol. Also, from different trials, the efficiency of BCG 1The abbreviations used are: BCG, bacillus Calmette Guérin; AMs, arabinomannans; APTS, 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate; CI, chemical ionization; C15, pentadecanoic acid; C16, palmitic acid; C18, stearic acid; C19, tuberculostearic acid; DCs, dendritic cells; LAMs, lipoarabinomannans; ManLAMs, LAMs with mannosyl extensions; dManLAMs, deacylated ManLAMs; EI, electron impact; GC, gas chromatography; GC/MS, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry; GM-CSF, granulocytes/macrophages-colony stimulating factor; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy; HOHAHA, homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy; IL, interleukin; ManAMs, arabinomannans with mannosyl extensions; LMs, lipomannans; PI anchor, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor; PI-GAMs, phosphoinositol-glyceroarabinomannans; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TMS, trimethylsilyl; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. vaccine to prevent tuberculosis was found to range from 0 to 80% (2Fine P.E.M. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1989; 11: S353-S359Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Roche P.W. Triccas J.A. Winter N. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 397-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Virulent mycobacteria survive and multiply within phagosomes of mononuclear phagocytes. Despite conflicting results, there is a consensus that phagosomes containing M. tuberculosis do not fuse with lysosomes and resist acidification (4Britton W.J. Roche P.W. Winter N. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 284-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This survival can also be correlated with the macrophage bactericide activity, which appears to be modulated by mycobacterial cell wall components (5Roach T.I.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar,6Chan J. Fan X. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From a molecular point of view, cell wall lipoarabinomannans (LAMs) are clearly demonstrated to be pivotal mycobacterial antigens. They regulate TNF-α production by phagocyte (5Roach T.I.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar) and block the transcriptional activation of INF-γ (6Chan J. Fan X. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby influencing the intramacrophagic survival of mycobacteria. For instance, LAMs (PI-GAMs) from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast growing mycobacterium that does not survive inside the macrophages, were found to stimulate phagocyte TNF-α production (7Gilleron M. Himoudi N. Adam O. Constant P. Venisse A. Rivière M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 117-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas LAMs (ManLAMs) from the pathogenic M. tuberculosis Erdman strain, which survives in the macrophages, have much a lower stimulatory activity (5Roach T.I.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar). ManLAMs were found to be endowed with other immunological activities. They selectively bind murine and human phagocytes via the mannose receptor and mediate the adhesion of pathogenic M. tuberculosisstrains to this receptor (8Venisse A. Fournié J.J. Puzo G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufmann T.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ManLAMs fromMycobacterium leprae and M. tuberculosisErdman strains were found to be presented in the context of CD1 molecules and stimulate CD4/CD8 double negative αβT cells (10Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brenan P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). There is a general consensus that the ManLAMs isolated from BCG (11Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),M. tuberculosis (12Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and M. leprae (14Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar) share the same basic structure characterized by the following features: a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor, a mannan core, an arabinan domain, and mannooligosaccharide caps. Nevertheless, ManLAMs from M. leprae and M. tuberculosis were found to stimulate T cell clones with different fine specificities (10Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brenan P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This phenomenon remains unclear, even if it was claimed that it arises from the mannooligosaccharide caps frequency (10Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brenan P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This paradoxical situation can be tentatively explained by the fact that structural and functional ManLAMs studies were conducted on complex mixtures. This was revealed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry studies establishing an average ManLAM molecular mass of 17 kDa and giving a molecular heterogeneity estimated at 6 kDa (11Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover the structural analysis of the ManLAMs fromMycobacterium bovis BCG revealed that around 50% of the mannan cores were devoid of the expected phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor, suggesting that the analyzed fraction, containing arabinose and mannose, was a mixture of lipoglycans and glycans (15Venisse A. Rivière M. Vercauteren J. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We report here a new strategy to extract ManLAMs from M. bovis BCG, which can be extended to the LAMs from other mycobacterial strains. The protocol enables the isolation of two types of ManLAMs, namely parietal and cellular (16Delmas, C., Gilleron, M., Brando, T., Vercellone, A., Gheorgiu, M., Rivière, M., and Puzo, G. (1997) Glycobiology , 7,in press.Google Scholar). In addition, a new purification method was successfully developed allowing the separation of glycans from lipoglycans. We demonstrate that cellular and parietal ManLAMs differ by their PI anchor structure and by the frequency of the mannooligosaccharide caps. Drastic differences were also observed in their capacity to stimulate cytokine secretion from human dendritic cells (DCs). As explained in Fig. 1,M. bovis BCG Pasteur strain cells were delipidated using CHCl3/CH3OH, 1:1, v/v. The delipidated mycobacteria were extracted six times by refluxing in 50% ethanol at 65 °C for 8 h. The resulting cells were washed and disintegrated in ice by sonication (20 kHz, 600 watts, 15 min) and using a French pressure cell (one step of lysis at a pressure maintained above 200 megapascals). The ethanol/water extracts (parietal fraction) were dried, incubated in 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and dialyzed against it to eliminate most of the hydrophobic molecules such as phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides. Triton X-100 was removed by a partition CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O, 2:1:1, v/v/v. The water-soluble fraction containing lipoglycans, glycans, and proteins was treated with both enzymes, trypsin (from bovine pancreas, Sigma) and α-amylase (from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH), and dialyzed against water. Most of the proteins of the cellular fraction were removed by a hot 80% (w/w) aqueous phenol biphasic wash at 70 °C for 1 h. After enzymatic treatments by trypsin, α-amylase, RNase A (from bovine pancreas, Sigma), and DNase I (from bovine pancreas, Fluka), a step of dialysis removed the amino acids, glucose, nucleotides, and phenol from the cellular glycans and lipoglycans. Triton X-114 phase separation technique was applied on glycan and lipoglycan mixtures (see below). ManLAMs and LMs were then separated by gel filtration. Sample (60 mg) was dissolved in 0.2m NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1 mmEDTA and 10 mm Tris, pH = 8, to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml, incubated 2 days at room temperature, and loaded on a gel permeation Bio-Gel P-100 column (52 × 3 cm) eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Venisse et al. (11Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described by Bordier (17Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three precondensations of commercial Triton X-114 (Sigma) were performed leading to a concentration of Triton X-114 in the detergent-rich phase of 13.2% (w/v), corresponding to the stock solution. The ManLAM containing fractions were dissolved in water (1 mg/ml final volume), and Triton X-114 stock solution was added to a final concentration of Triton X-114 of 2% (w/v). The mixture was homogenized at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated at 37 °C to allow separation into the detergent-rich and the detergent-depleted phases, the latter being collected. To optimize the fractionation between the glycans and the lipoglycans, these two phases were again homogenized by adding either water or Triton X-114 stock solution to a final Triton concentration of 2% and again separated. This process was repeated twice leading to four detergent-rich and four detergent-depleted phases, which were respectively pooled. From both phases, the Triton X-114 was mainly removed by extraction with CHCl3 (controlled by UV (17Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the resulting aqueous phases were dried and addition of absolute ethanol led to the precipitation of lipoglycans and glycans. Carbohydrates and inositol were analyzed as their trimethylsilyl glycosides dissolved in cyclohexane after hydrolysis with 0.6 n HCl, 110 °C, 1 h. Glycosyl linkage composition was analyzed after methylation of polysaccharides according to the modified procedure from Ciucanu and Kerek (18Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The methylated polysaccharides were hydrolyzed with 2n trifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 2 h, reduced with NaBD4 10 mg/ml in NH4OH 1m/C2H5OH, 1:1, v/v, freshly prepared and peracetylated with acetic anhydride 1 h at 110 °C. The alditol acetates were solubilized in cyclohexane before injection in gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Fatty acids were analyzed as their methyl esters. ManLAMs were deacylated in 1 n NaOH, 37 °C, 2 h, and then neutralized with HCl. Fatty acids were extracted using cyclohexane/water, 1:1, v/v, and after drying under N2, were methylated with 10% (w/w) BF3 in methanol (Fluka) at 60 °C for 5 min. Reaction was stopped by addition of water, and fatty acid methyl esters were extracted as described above before injection in GC and GC/MS. Pentadecanoic acid was used as internal standard. Phosphorus was measured for the determination of the molar ratio of fatty acids to phosphorus by the procedure described by Schnitger et al. (19Schnitger H. Papenberg K. Ganse E. Czok R. Bücher T. Adam H. Biochem. Z. 1959; 332: 167-185PubMed Google Scholar). 3 mg of ManLAMs were treated with 400 μl of anhydrous acetic acid/acetic anhydride, 3:2, v/v, at 110 °C for 12 h (20Ferguson M.A.J. Haldar K. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4963-4968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was dried and vortexed with 400 μl of cyclohexane/water, 1:1, v/v. The cyclohexane phase was analyzed by GC/MS. GC was performed on a Girdel series 30 equipped with an OV1 capillary column (0.22 mm × 25 m) using helium gas with a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with a flame ionization detector at 310 °C. The injector temperature was 260 °C, and the temperature separation program was from 100 to 290 °C at a speed of 3 °C/min. GC/MS analysis were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5889 X mass spectrometer (electron energy, 70 eV) working on both electron impact (EI) and chemical ionization modes using NH3 as reagent gas (CI/NH3), coupled with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph series II fitted with a similar OV1 column (0.30 mm × 12 m). Acetolysis products were analyzed on a 0.35-m length column using a temperature separation program from 160 to 300 °C at a speed of 8 °C/min. The injector and interface temperatures were 290 °C. Analyses were performed on a P/ACE capillary electrophoresis system (Beckman Instruments, Inc.) with the cathode on the injection side and the anode on the detection side. The electropherograms were acquired and stored on a Dell XPS P60 computer using the System Gold software package (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). 2 μg of dried mild hydrolyzed (0.1 n HCl at 110 °C for 30 min) ManLAMs were mixed with 0.5 μl of 0.2 m1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate (APTS) (eCAP N-Linked oligosaccharides profiling kit, Beckman Instruments, Inc.) in 15% acetic acid and 0.5 μl of a 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride solution dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (Aldrich) (21Guttman A. Chen F.T.A. Evangelista R.A. Cooke N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed 90 min at 55 °C, and the samples were then diluted in 9 μl of water before injection. APTS derivatives were loaded by applying 0.5 p.s.i. (3.45 kPa) vacuum for 5 s. Separations were performed using a coated capillary column (eCAP N-CHO coated capillary from eCAP N-Linked oligosaccharides profiling kit, Beckman Instruments, Inc.) of 50 μm internal diameter with 40 cm effective length (47 cm total length). Analyses were carried out at a temperature of 20 °C with an applied voltage of 24 kV and using degassed carbohydrate separation gel buffer (eCAP N-Linked oligosaccharides profiling kit, Beckman Instruments, Inc.) as running electrolyte. Detection system consisted in a Beckman laser-induced fluorescence equipped with a 4-milliwatt argon-ion laser with the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength filter of 520 nm. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer equipped with an Aspect X32 computer. Samples were exchanged in D2O (Spin et Techniques, Paris, 99.9% purity) with intermediate lyophilization, then dissolved in 99.96 atom % D2O and analyzed in 200 × 5-mm 535-PP NMR tubes. The concentration of the NMR samples were 40 mg/ml for parietal ManLAMs and 120 mg/ml for cellular ManLAMs. Spectra were recorded at 313 K. The1H NMR chemical shifts were referenced relative to internal acetone signal at 2.225 ppm. The one-dimensional phosphorus (31P) spectra were measured at 202.46 MHz by employing a spectral width of 25 kHz, and phosphoric acid (85%) was used as the external standard (δP 0.0). The data were collected in 32,768 complex data sets, and an exponential transformation (LB = 5 Hz) was applied prior the processing to 65,536 real points in the frequency domain. The spectrum was recorded with 64 scans for parietal ManLAMs and 512 scans for cellular ManLAMs. The two-dimensional 1H-31P HMQC-HOHAHA spectra were recorded without sample spinning in the proton-detected mode with a Bruker 5-mm 1H broad band tunable probe with reversal geometry using the Lerner and Bax pulse sequence (22Lerner L. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1986; 69: 375-380Google Scholar). The GARP sequence (23Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) at the carbon frequency was used as a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. Data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase increment method (24Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). For parietal ManLAMs, spectral widths of 607.38 Hz in31P and 5005 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 4096 × 42 (time-proportional phase increment) point data matrix with 108 scans/t 1 value expanded to 4096 × 1024 by zero filling. The mixing time was 34 ms. For parietal deacylated ManLAMs, spectral widths of 10 123 Hz in31P and 4003 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 4096 × 128 (time-proportional phase increment) point data matrix with 96 scans/t 1 value expanded to 4096 × 1024 by zero filling. The mixing time was 63 ms. In both case, the relaxation delay was 1 s, and a sine bell window shifted by π/2 was applied in both dimensions. The medium used in this study was RPMI 1640 with 1% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) pooled human AB serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm pyruvate, and 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol (all from Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts, Vienna, Austria). Human albumin (for intravenous use; Octopharma, Vienna, Austria) was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml (=complete medium). Recombinant GM-CSF (Leucomax; 1.11 × 107units/mg) was from Sandoz (Basel, Switzerland). Recombinant human IL-4 (2 × 107 units/mg) was kindly supplied by the Schering-Plough Research Institute (Kenilworth, NJ). Cultures of human DCs were established as described (25Thurnher M. Ramoner R. Gastl G. Radmayr C. Böck G. Herold M. Klocker H. Bartsch G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, mononuclear cells were obtained by standard density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The adherent fraction (45 min, 37 °C) was cultured in complete medium containing 1000 units/ml each GM-CSF and IL-4. Every other day, one-third of the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing GM-CSF/IL-4. DCs were routinely used at day 6. After extensive washing, the cells were recultured at 105 cells/ml with or without ManLAMs at the indicated concentrations. Supernatants were harvested for IL-8 and TNF-α assays after 6 h. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was carried out with a commercially available kit from CLB (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) specific for IL-8 and TNF-α. Cytokines were quantitated using a microtiter plate reader. The presence of ManLAMs, namely parietal ManLAMs, in ethanol/water extracts from delipidated BCG Pasteur strain cells was unambiguously established by routine carbohydrate analysis revealing the occurrence of arabinose and mannose. This assumption was also supported by SDS-PAGE analysis showing a characteristic broad band at 30 kDa. As outlined in the purification scheme (Fig. 1), the resulting cells were disrupted and extracted again by an ethanol/water mixture. This extract, analyzed as mentioned above for the parietal extract, was found again to contain ManLAMs: namely cellular ManLAMs (16Delmas, C., Gilleron, M., Brando, T., Vercellone, A., Gheorgiu, M., Rivière, M., and Puzo, G. (1997) Glycobiology , 7,in press.Google Scholar). The fraction containing parietal ManLAMs was submitted to the following process: i) incubation in 2% Triton X-100 and dialysis against it to remove the phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides, ii) elimination of the Triton X-100 by partition, iii) enzymatic hydrolysis by trypsin and α-amylase to remove the protein and glucan contaminants. At the end of this process, the parietal ManLAM fraction was still contaminated by amphipathic glycoconjugates like LMs and the expected glycans such as arabinomannans (AMs) and mannans. Besides the different contaminants (proteins, glucans) described above for the parietal ManLAM fraction, DNA and RNA were also present in the cellular ManLAM fraction. All these contaminants were enzymatically removed. To eliminate the glycans from the parietal and cellular ManLAM fractions, the Triton X-114 phase separation method, which is summarized below, was successfully applied. Triton X-114 forms a clear micellar solution at 4 °C and two phases at 22 °C, a hydrophilic detergent-depleted phase and an amphipathic detergent-rich phase. The ManLAM fractions were dissolved in water (1 mg/ml final volume) and then preconditioned Triton X-114 stock solution (17Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to a final concentration of 2% Triton X-114 (w/v). The mixture was homogenized at 4 °C for 1 h, then incubated at 37 °C giving two phases, i.e. the detergent-rich and the detergent-depleted phases, the latter being collected. To optimize fractionation between the glycans and the lipoglycans, the two phases were both treated again twice. From SDS-PAGE analysis, using ManLAM and LM standards, it was deduced that the parietal and cellular mannoglycoconjugates which are soluble in the detergent-rich phase correspond to a mixture of ManLAMs and LMs. The parietal and cellular detergent-depleted phases were analyzed in the same way and from the absence of migration on the gel, the compounds were assigned to glycans. They were definitively identified, after Bio-Gel P-100 gel filtration, by routine carbohydrate analysis (Ara/Man = 1.2 and 1.7 for the parietal and cellular glycans respectively) as AMs. Thus, by means of the Triton X-114 method, the detergent-depleted phase was found to contain AMs, while the detergent-rich phase included lipoglycans identified as ManLAMs and LMs. To remove the LMs from the ManLAMs, the corresponding cellular and parietal fractions were purified by Bio-Gel P-100 gel filtration in the presence of sodium deoxycholate buffer. Both fractions gave a similar chromatographic profile (Fig. 2) characterized by two peaks, I and II. From SDS-PAGE analysis, peak I was assigned to the ManLAMs, while peak II corresponded to LMs. Moreover, whatever their parietal or cellular origin, ManLAMs and LMs showed the same electrophoretic behavior on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). These assignments are in agreement with routine carbohydrate analysis, which showed that parietal and cellular ManLAMs contained, besides inositol, arabinose and mannose in a ratio of 1.4 and 1.6, respectively. Likewise, mannose and inositol were both found in the cellular and parietal LMs fractions.Figure 3SDS-PAGE analysis of parietal and cellular ManLAMs and related mannoconjugates from M. bovis BCG Pasteur strain. 20 μg of parietal ManLAMs (lane a), 20 μg of parietal LMs (lane b), 20 μg of parietal ManAMs (lane c), 200 μg of parietal ManAMs (lane d), 20 μg of cellular ManLAMs (lane e), 20 μg of cellular LMs (lane f), 200 μg of cellular ManAMs (lane g).

It can be observed that the total amount of cellular material obtained (492 mg) was much higher than for parietal material (93 mg). Moreover, it must be underlined that the cellular ManLAMs were twice as abundant as the cellular ManAMs, whereas the parietal ManLAMs were only half as abundant as the parietal ManAMs. As indicated in the literature, fatty acid residues (5Roach T.I.A.

We therefore investigated the presence and structure of the fatty acids and mannooligosaccharide caps in parietal and cellular ManLAMs. To characterize the expected mannooligosaccharide caps, parietal and cellular ManLAMs were analyzed by 1H-13C HMQC experiments (data not shown) as described previously by Venisse et al. (11Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parietal ManLAM C-1 resonances at δ 104.7 and δ 100.8 were respectively assigned to 2-O-linked α-Manps and t-α-Manps. Each of these resonances correlate with two different proton resonances at δ 5.14, δ 5.12 and δ 5.06, δ 5.04, respectively, in agreement with the presence of (1→2)-α-d-mannooligosaccharide caps. Likewise, these mannooligosaccharide caps were found in the cellular ManLAMs. These cap structures were also supported by the identification of 2-O-linked Manps from the alditol acetate analysis of the parietal and cellular ManLAMs (Table I). From these data, the capping percentage was determined from the (3,5-di-O-linked Araf − t-Araf) to (3,5-di-O-linked Araf) ratio. It was found that the capping frequency of the parietal ManLAMs (76%) was higher compared with that of the cellular ManLAMs (48%). The structures of these mannooligosaccharide caps were then investigated by capillary electrophoresis analysis. Both par"
https://openalex.org/W2031637211,"We describe a three-hybrid system that involves three polypeptides that allow or prevent the formation of the transcriptional activator. Beside the two-hybrid fusion proteins, the third partner is under the control of the Met25 promoter, which is positively regulated in medium lacking methionine. We document a situation where such a third partner promotes interaction between two proteins, one fused to a DNA-binding domain and the other fused to an activator domain. This is demonstrated for cdk7-MAT1 interaction stabilized by the presence of cyclin H; these three polypeptides are found either free or associated with the transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH. We also document the capacity of our system to conditionally inhibit the interaction between two polypeptides that otherwise elicit a positive two-hybrid response. This is demonstrated for Ras-Raf interaction precluded by an excess of Raf. The presence of a methionine-regulated promoter provides an “on” or “off” switch for the formation of the transcriptional activator, thus also providing an excellent control to evaluate the activation or inhibition properties of the third partner."

The carboxyl terminus of Glut4, which projects into the cytoplasm of the cell, appears to be a critical region involved in this process. When chimeric transporters of Glut1 and Glut4 were examined, substitution of the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of Glut1 with the corresponding Glut4 sequence results in sequestration of the chimera in an intracellular compartment (5Czech M.P.

IRAP has also been called gp160 and vp165. The distribution of IRAP within adipocytes is very similar to that of Glut4. In the basal state the majority of IRAP is sequestered in an intracellular compartment, and following stimulation with insulin both Glut4 and IRAP are translocated to the cell surface (14Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the amino terminus of IRAP contains two dileucine motifs and several acidic regions similar to those that occur in Glut4. The similarity between the carboxyl terminus of Glut4 and the amino terminus of IRAP suggests that these two molecules are sorted within the cell by a common mechanism.To test the hypothesis that an intracellular sorting mechanism exists which recognizes both Glut4 and IRAP, we used microinjection to introduce the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP into 3T3-L1 adipocytes and examined its effect on the cellular distribution of Glut4. We found that introduction of this region of IRAP into 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in rapid and sustained translocation of Glut4 from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. In contrast to the action of insulin, Glut4 translocation following microinjection of IRAP was independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, suggesting that it acts downstream of this signaling element. By deletion analysis, we identified a 28-amino acid region of IRAP, which was sufficient to cause Glut4 translocation.RESULTSIncubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin results in translocation of Glut4 from an intracellular vesicular compartment to the plasma membrane. Translocation of Glut4 can be determined in single cells (17Haruta T. Morris A.J. Rose D.W. Nelson J.G. Mueckler M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Average values from nine experiments for unstimulated adipocytes were 6.8% ± 1.0% (mean ± S.E.) and 44.2% ± 3.2% following insulin stimulation.Images of cells microinjected with GST fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 1. Adipocytes were immunostained with an anti-GST antibody and an anti-rabbit-AMCA conjugate to mark injected cells (A and C) or anti-Glut4 and an anti-mouse-fluorescein conjugate to determine Glut4 distribution (B and D). Injection of adipocytes with GST alone did not result in Glut4 translocation to the cell surface (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, injection of a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1–109 of IRAP (GST-IRAP-(1–109)) led to translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, C andD). Quantification of this effect is shown in Fig. 2. Only 8% of cells were positive for plasma membrane staining of Glut4 after microinjection of GST alone, whereas GST-IRAP-(1–109) resulted in a significant increase to 27% of the cells (p ≤ 0.01).Figure 2Effect of microinjecting GST-IRAP fusion proteins on Glut4 translocation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in serum-free medium for 2 h and microinjected with either 15 mg/ml GST or a GST fusion protein consisting of different portions of the amino terminus of IRAP. Two hours after microinjection, cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-GST and anti-Glut4 (1F8) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage of microinjected adipocytes with substantial plasma membrane staining for Glut4 was determined. Between 100 and 900 injected cells were used in the analysis of each fusion protein. Fusion proteins that significantly increased Glut4 translocation versus injection of GST alone are indicated with an asterisk (p ≤ 0.01). The mean ± S.E. from four independent experiments is shown.

A series of deletion constructs were prepared and microinjected into adipocytes to determine their activity (Fig. 2). IRAP-(35–59) and IRAP-(78–109) had no effect on the subcellular distribution of Glut4. In contrast, IRAP-(1–52) and IRAP-(55–82) caused translocation of Glut4 to the cell surface. IRAP-(55–82) had the highest activity, which was comparable with that following stimulation with 100 nm insulin. We have also found that injection of a synthetic peptide corresponding to IRAP-(55–82) is effective in inducing Glut4 translocation (data not shown).In addition to Glut4 translocation, insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes also causes rearrangement of actin resulting in plasma membrane ruffling (18Martin S.S.

This can be observed in cells by staining F-actin with phalloidin. We injected GST-IRAP-(1–109) and GST-IRAP-(55–82) to see if they caused plasma membrane ruffling (Fig. 3). Treatment with insulin increased the percentage of cells with plasma membrane ruffling from 10% in unstimulated cells to 55% following a 10-min incubation with 100 nm insulin. However, injection of GST-IRAP-(1–109) or GST-IRAP-(55–82) had no effect on plasma membrane ruffling.Figure 3Effect of insulin and GST-IRAP fusion proteins on membrane ruffling. Prior to microinjection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in serum-free medium for 12–16 h. Individual cells were microinjected with 10 mg/ml sheep IgG (Controland Insulin) or with 10 mg/ml sheep IgG and either 15 mg/ml GST-IRAP-(1–109) or 20 mg/ml GST-IRAP-(55–82). Thirty minutes following injection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in medium alone (Control, IRAP-injected cells) or with 100 nminsulin for 10 min. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and immunostained with anti-sheep IgG conjugated to fluorescein to detect injected cells and phalloidin conjugated to rhodamine to stain polymerized actin. The percentage of injected adipocytes with actin membrane ruffles was determined. Between 200 and 500 injected cells were used in the analysis. The mean ± S.D. from three experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are several possible mechanisms by which injection of IRAP into 3T3-L1 adipocytes might cause an increase in Glut4 content at the cell surface. Since Glut4 continuously recycles between an intracellular compartment and the cell surface, inhibiting internalization would lead to an increase in plasma membrane Glut4 content. Alternatively, injection of Glut4 might saturate an intracellular retention mechanism which would release Glut4 to the cell surface. These two mechanisms would be expected to have very different kinetics. It's estimated that a 20-fold increase in cell surface Glut4 is achieved with at½ of 138 min following a 40-fold decrease in the rate of endocytosis as compared with a t½ of 3.5 min for 40-fold increase in the rate of Glut4 exocytosis (19Holman G.D. Leggio L.L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To assess changes occurring over relatively short time periods, we plated the adipocytes on coverslips with grids such that the time of injection and the location could be recorded. Microinjection of 20 mg/ml GST-IRAP-(55–82) caused an increase in cell surface Glut4 within 5–9 min after injection (Table I). The effect of GST-IRAP-(55–82) on Glut4 translocation was maximal within 5 min and persisted for 4 h. Injection of 20 mg/ml GST had no effect at any of these times (data not shown). The effect of the GST-IRAP concentration on Glut4 translocation is shown in Table II. A progressive increase in Glut4 translocation was observed from 1–10 mg/ml GST-IRAP-(55–82) with a maximal effect at 10 mg/ml, suggesting that the response is dependent on concentration. Based on the estimated volume of injection and the concentration, we estimate that this effect occurs with 2–20 million molecules/cell. As the estimated number of Glut4 molecules per 3T3-L1 cell is 280,000 (20Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI3K activity with wortmannin or interfering with PI3K activation by microinjecting cells with the n-SH2 domain from the regulatory subunit of PI3K blocks Glut4 translocation in response to insulin (22Jhun B.H.

We used these two methods to determine if PI3K activation was required for Glut4 translocation following injection of IRAP. Pretreatment of adipocytes with 100 nm wortmannin for 20 min completely blocked the insulin-stimulated increase in Glut4 translocation; however, wortmannin pretreatment did not inhibit the increase in Glut4 translocation caused by injection of IRAP-(55–82) (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained in experiments in which cells were injected with the p85 n-SH2 domain (Fig. 4 B). Thus, microinjection of the p85 n-SH2 domain blocked insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation, but had no effect on Glut4 translocation stimulated by injection of IRAP-(55–82). These results indicate that the effect of microinjected IRAP is independent of PI3K activation.Figure 4Effect of wortmannin and microinjection of GST-p85 n-SH2 fusion protein on IRAP-stimulated Glut4 translocation.

Since we did not inject the catalytic domain of IRAP, the redistribution of Glut4 was not the result of introducing aminopeptidase activity into the cytoplasm of 3T3-L1 cells. Instead, this effect was mediated by the intracellular portion of the protein. We propose a model whereby the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP competes for binding with an intracellular protein that is responsible for the sorting or retention of both Glut4 and IRAP within a specialized compartment. The effect on Glut4 translocation was extremely rapid, occurring within 5–10 min following injection (Table I). The rapidity of this response was roughly comparable with that following stimulation with insulin and suggests an effect of IRAP-(55–82) on Glut4 exocytosis. Analysis of kinetic constants indicates that inhibition of Glut4 internalization is unlikely to cause maximal Glut4 surface expression in this time frame (19Holman G.D. Leggio L.L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yeh J.I. Verhey K.J. Birnbaum M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15523-15531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus the rapid increase in cell surface Glut4 must be the result of an increase in the rate of exocytosis. Although injected IRAP-(55–82) could also affect the rate of Glut4 internalization, kinetic studies examining the individual rate constants will be needed to definitively answer this question.Unlike insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation, the translocation of Glut4 caused by injection of IRAP was independent of PI3K activation. Neither wortmannin pretreatment or co-injection of the n-SH2 domain from the PI3K regulatory subunit blocked the effect of IRAP. Both of these manipulations block insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation (21Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7466-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, injection of IRAP did not cause plasma membrane ruffling, a process that is stimulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by activated PI3K (18Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17605-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus the mechanism by which IRAP stimulates Glut4 translocation appears to be distal to PI3K activation and is consistent with our hypothesis that injection of IRAP may cause translocation by saturating a retention receptor.Deletion analysis of IRAP indicates that there are multiple regions within the amino terminus that affect the intracellular distribution of Glut4. GST fusion proteins containing residues 1–52 or 55–82 of IRAP were both active in promoting Glut4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It is not readily apparent why both of these regions were active in this assay. IRAP-(55–82) contains one dileucine motif (amino acids 76–77), which may have a role in the intracellular sequestration of Glut4, but IRAP-(1–52) does not. There is, however, a divaline motif (amino acids 27–28) present in the 1–52 region. Could this motif substitute for the dileucine motif present in the other effective regions of IRAP and the carboxyl-terminal tail of Glut4? Interestingly, the dileucine motif itself does not appear to be sufficient, since the dileucine motif (amino acids 53 and 54) in IRAP-(35–59) was not effective in stimulating translocation. This is consistent with experiments in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in which the dileucines functioned only as an internalization motif (10Verhey K.J. Yeh J.I. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Other residues surrounding the dileucines may be important as has been suggested previously from Glut1/Glut4 chimera studies in L6 cells (7Haney P.M. Levy M.A. Strube M.S. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both the 1–52 and 55–82 regions contain acidic residues, and it is possible that these charged residues may also be important. Alternatively, IRAP-(1–52) and IRAP-(55–82) may stimulate Glut4 exocytosis by two different mechanisms, each mediated by independent interactions.A potential model for Glut4 recognition by the hypothesized retention receptor is the tyrosine-based motifs recognized by the adaptin complexes of AP-1 and AP-2 which mediate binding to clathrin (24Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These large multisubunit protein complexes recognize tyrosines within the context of NPXY or YXXφ, where Xis any amino acid and φ is any amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic group (e.g. Phe, Leu, Ile, Val, Lys). AP-1 and AP-2 cross-link cell surface proteins containing these motifs with clathrin complexes, thereby concentrating these proteins for internalization into early endosomes. In a similar manner, the retention receptor may recognize and bind a trafficking motif within Glut4 and IRAP, which results in enrichment of these proteins within a vesicular compartment. One interesting question is how these complexes might be regulated by insulin. As PI3K has been implicated in insulin stimulation of glucose transport, the phosphoinositides generated by insulin action might interact with this complex to release Glut4 and IRAP.We think that the data from our experiments are consistent with the following hypothesis: the amino terminus of IRAP and the carboxyl terminus of Glut4 share a common trafficking motif that interacts with an intracellular protein (retention receptor/sorting protein), resulting in sequestration of both IRAP and Glut4 within a specialized intracellular compartment. Injection of the amino terminus of IRAP competes with endogenous IRAP and Glut4 for retention receptor binding sites and results in exocytosis of Glut4. It will be very interesting to pinpoint the requirements for retention and to identify cellular proteins that interact with this region, since they may be critical in controlling intracellular trafficking of the Glut4 vesicle. Translocation of intracellular vesicles containing the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut4 to the cell surface is one of the most important effects of insulin in adipose and skeletal muscle tissues (1Cushman S.W.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C443-C452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of insulin, approximately 95% of cellular Glut4 is sequestered in an intracellular compartment. The carboxyl terminus of Glut4, which projects into the cytoplasm of the cell, appears to be a critical region involved in this process. When chimeric transporters of Glut1 and Glut4 were examined, substitution of the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of Glut1 with the corresponding Glut4 sequence results in sequestration of the chimera in an intracellular compartment (5Czech M.P.

Several studies have suggested that a dileucine motif in the carboxyl terminus of Glut4 has a significant role in this process (8Verhey K.J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Their function is terminated by acquisition of susceptibility to CD95-triggered apoptosis. Here we show that the regulation of this process depends on the activity of the endothelial NO synthase expressed by γδ T lymphocytes, which is modulated in an activation-dependent way. The effects of nitric oxide thus generated, mediated via cGMP generation, are exerted at at least two sites along the CD95 signaling cascade: one at, or upstream, and the other downstream of ceramide generation. At either site, nitric oxide/cGMP action is sufficient for protection from apoptosis. The effect of NO is selective for apoptosis induced by CD95 cross-linking, since it does not affect apoptotic program triggered by other stimuli.

In T lymphocytes the CD95 signaling cascade can be triggered either via activation of the TcR, with ensuing expression and secretion of the CD95 physiological ligand, or via direct cross-linking of the CD95 receptor with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (7Alderson M.R.

Despite the fact that γδ T cells express constant levels of CD95 in vitro, their susceptibility to CD95-triggered apoptosis is known to change as a function of their state of activation (5Nagata S.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying T cell switch in sensitivity to CD95-triggered apoptosis are still unknown. We have investigated this problem taking advantage of normal human lymphocyte clones bearing the Vγ9/Vδ2 TcR, already characterized for their sensitivity to CD95-induced apoptosis in our laboratory (4Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Toninelli E. Sabbadini M.G. Pellicciari C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3704-3712PubMed Google Scholar,6Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C. Sabbadini M.G. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained demonstrate that these cells express the constitutive, endothelial NO synthase (ecNOS) and that NO generated by this enzyme regulates their susceptibility to apoptosis modulating the CD95-triggered signal transduction cascade.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNormal human lymphocyte clones bearing the Vγ9/Vδ2 TcR were propagated by cyclic in vitro restimulation (4Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Toninelli E. Sabbadini M.G. Pellicciari C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3704-3712PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are susceptible to apoptosis triggered by various stimuli(4Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Toninelli E. Sabbadini M.G. Pellicciari C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3704-3712PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C. Sabbadini M.G. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated the apoptotic effects of cross-linking of the CD95 membrane receptor, of the treatment with the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, and of increased intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was obtained with thapsigargin, a drug that blocks the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (15Inesi G. Sagara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells were treated for 5 h with either drug, and then analyzed by flow cytometry after DNA staining with propidium iodide (6Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C. Sabbadini M.G. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). All of the treatments were capable to induce apoptosis, as demonstrated by the appearance of the hypodiploid DNA peak at the left of the G1 peak (Fig. 1, A; data not shown). Etoposide and thapsigargin were able to induce apoptosis of γδ T cell clones throughout the entire culture period (data not shown); by contrast, sensitivity to CD95-induced cell death is acquired progressively (4Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Toninelli E. Sabbadini M.G. Pellicciari C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3704-3712PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C. Sabbadini M.G. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). The death signals of CD95 are mediated via activation of members of the caspase family of proteases (16Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effects of a tetrapeptide, ac-YVAD-CMK, a well characterized inhibitor of caspases involved in CD95-triggered apoptosis, i.e. caspases 1 and 3 (16Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2 h with 200 μm ac-YVAD-CMK before addition of either anti-CD95 mAb or anti-TcR mAb. Early apoptotic cells were identified based on the annexin V staining of exposed phosphatidylserine residues, a method that allows the quantitative analysis of the results obtained. Ac-YVAD-CMK treatment resulted in inhibition of both CD95- and TcR-induced apoptosis (65.3 ± 4.2 and 58 ± 3.4%, respectively; n = 5; Fig. 1 B).It has been recently demonstrated that T cells express the endothelial NOS isoform (17Reiling N. Kroncke R. Ulmer A.J. Gerdes J. Flad H.D. Hauschildt S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We wondered whether endogenous production of NO, with ensuing generation of cGMP (1Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 2Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), was responsible for the activation-dependent shift in susceptibility to CD95-mediated apoptosis. To investigate the problem, experiments were carried out first with NO donors, SNAP and isosorbide dinitrate, or with the membrane-permeant cGMP analogue, 8-Br-cGMP. In addition, since high levels of cGMP may cross-activate protein kinase A in certain cell systems (18Forte L.R. Thorne P.K. Eber S.L. Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C607-C615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of the membrane-permeant cAMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP, was also evaluated. Both NO donors and 8-Br-cGMP were found to inhibit substantially CD95- and TcR-triggered apoptosis, while cell treatment with 8-Br-cAMP did not result in appreciable inhibition. Neither NO donors nor 8-Br-cGMP had any detectable effect on γδ cell death induced by different stimuli, including etoposide and thapsigargin (Table I; data not shown).Table IEffects of NO on apoptosis of γδ T lymphocytesTreatmentApoptosis inhibition (%)+ SNAP+ 8-Br-cGMP+ 8-Br-cAMPAnti-CD95 mAb64 ± 2.941 ± 2.13 ± 04Anti-TcR mAb55 ± 2.635 ± 1.32.7 ± 0.2Etoposide00NDThapsigargin00NDResults are expressed as % of inhibition of annexin V staining (mean ± S.E.; n = 5) with respect to cells treated with the corresponding relevant mAb, etoposide (20 μm) or thapsigargin (250 nm).

ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The effect of endogenous NO on CD95-mediated apoptosis was next investigated. Expression of the NOS enzymes, cGMP generation, or the effect of removing endogenous NO were analyzed at different times afterin vitro restimulation of γδ T cells. Fig. 2 shows the analysis of the expression of the NOS isoenzymes at different times (14, 21, and 28 days) after restimulation, both by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Neither the brain nor the inducible isoforms were ever detected, whereas ecNOS was highly expressed after restimulation and decreased thereafter duringin vitro propagation.The activity of ecNOS was next investigated, as measured by cGMP generation. Activation of the TcR and the ensuing increases in [Ca2+]i (whose amplitude remains unchanged during γδ T cell propagation in vitro; see Ref. 6Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C.

As shown in Fig. 3 A, high levels of cGMP were found upon TcR activation 14 days after in vitrorestimulation, with progressive reduction at 21 and 28 days. This effect was exclusively mediated via NO, since pretreatment with two NOS inhibitors, l-NIO and l-NAME (1Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), completely prevented any increased cGMP generation at all times considered (Fig. 3 A; data not shown).Figure 3ecNOS activity determines γδ cell susceptibility to CD95-mediated cell death.

To investigate a causal relationship between the two processes, the effects of NO removal by a scavenger, hemoglobin, and of the inhibition of NOS activity byl-NIO were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3 B, both the blockade of NO generation via inhibition of NOS activity and the removal of NO conferred sensitivity to CD95-induced apoptosis even during the early phases after in vitro restimulation,i.e. when the cells in normal culture conditions are resistant. Similar results were obtained using the guanylyl cyclase specific inhibitor ODQ (Ref. 19Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously-generated NO/cGMP protects against CD95-triggered apoptosis. Whether the reduction in ecNOS protein levels fully accounts for reduced NOS activity, or whether biochemical modifications of the enzyme (20Garcı̀a-Cardeña G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J.

Among the signals induced by CD95 cross-linking is the hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin with ensuing generation of ceramide (21Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A.

The kinetics of ceramide accumulation after CD95 ligation in the presence of either SNAP or 8-Br-cGMP were therefore evaluated by thin layer chromatography. As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, either treatment resulted in an important reduction of CD95-induced ceramide accumulation at all time points considered (70 and 85% reduction of the 10-min peak of activity, respectively; see Fig. 4 B).Figure 4NO inhibits CD95-triggered ceramide generation and Ca2+ release and protects from ceramide-induced cell death. A, ceramide levels were assessed by thin layer chromatography at the indicated times after CD95 cross-linking, in the absence or in the presence of either the cell permeant cGMP analogue 8-Br-cGMP (500 μm) or the NO donor SNAP (100 μm). Results shown are mean ± S.E. of five experiments run in triplicate. B, autoradiography of the 10-min incubation point sample is shown together with the 250-pmol authentic ceramide standard.

We have recently demonstrated in γδ T cells that, following CD95 cross-linking, Ca2+ release occurs and is critical for apoptosis induction (6Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C. Sabbadini M.G. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). This process appears to take place as a consequence of ceramide accumulation since inhibition by the competitive inhibitor,dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (26Choi O.H. Kim J.H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 27Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3154-3159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of sphingosine kinase, the enzyme that converts ceramides into sphingosine 1-phosphate, completely prevented Ca2+ release induced by CD95-ligation (data not shown). Whether the NO/cGMP effects on ceramide generation resulted in reduced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores was thus investigated. Fluorimetric analysis of γδ cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-2, revealed a consistent increase in [Ca2+]i upon both CD95 cross-linking and administration of 10 μmmembrane-permeant ceramide (+58.3 ± 4.2% and +95 ± 5.8%, respectively, n = 8) (Fig. 4 C). When the cells were incubated with either SNAP (100 μm) or 8-Br-cGMP (500 μm), CD95-triggered Ca2+release was dramatically reduced (−52.3 ± 4.7% and −46.5 ± 4.3%, respectively; n = 8) (Fig. 4 C, upper traces). The effects of NO/cGMP on Ca2+ release were entirely due to the inhibition of ceramide accumulation, since neither SNAP nor 8-Br-cGMP had any appreciable effect when the experiments were performed using membrane-permeant ceramide as Ca2+ releasing agent (Fig. 4 C, lower traces).Taken together, these results demonstrate that NO protects from apoptosis interfering with ceramide accumulation. To investigate whether this is the only site of action of NO, γδ cells were treated with membrane-permeant ceramide and the NO/cGMP effects on ceramide-induced apoptosis were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4 D, apoptosis protection was still detected, indicating that a second site of NO action exists downstream of sphingomyelin hydrolysis.The results we have obtained demonstrate the existence of regulated, endogenous generation of NO in γδ T lymphocytes and implicate NO in cell protection from the CD95-triggered apoptosis. The effect of NO is specific for this signaling pathway, since the messenger has no effect on programmed death induced by stimuli working via different intracellular pathways. The molecular levels at which NO exerts its actions appear multiple, located upstream and downstream of ceramide generation. Of importance, the protective effect induced by SNAP against CD95-induced apoptosis is almost 2-fold with respect to that observed with 8-Br-cGMP (see Table I). This observation may underlie the existence in T lymphocytes of molecular targets regulated by NO in a cGMP-independent way. Recently, suppression of apoptosis by NO in endothelial cells was demonstrated to be mediated viaS-nitrosylation of caspases (28Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Whether this, or other, as yet unidentified mechanisms, are operating also in T lymphocytes remains to be established. A model illustrating the multiple sites of NO action along the CD95-activated signal transduction pathways in γδ T lymphocytes is proposed in Fig. 5.Figure 5Schematic representation of the NO-mediated modulation of the CD95 apoptotic pathways. CD95 cross-linking results in the switch on of various, possibly related signaling pathways converging to apoptosis (16Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). NO, generated by ecNOS activation, exerts a protective effect interfering with these pathways at different levels. NO can act either via cGMP-dependent pathways, located upstream and downstream of ceramide generation, and via cGMP-independent pathways yet to be defined. An additional consequence of the reduced accumulation of ceramides,i.e. inhibition of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, contributes to the protective effect of NO on apoptosis (6Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C. Sabbadini M.G. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. J.

Expression of CD95 ligand by T lymphocytes is among the physiological responses triggered by TcR activation. This event, however, does not immediately result in CD95-dependent apoptosis, but allows multiple rounds of activation and the clonal expansion of stimulated lymphocytes (29Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Science. 1996; 274: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To account for this paradox, it was proposed that signaling pathways exist that dynamically regulate the susceptibility of activated lymphocytes to die in response to CD95 activation (29Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Science. 1996; 274: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our data identify autocrine generation of NO as the early signaling event in the pathway that regulates γδ T lymphocyte apoptosis. Various cell populations act coordinately in immune responses, under the control of intra- and extracellular messengers. One of these, nitric oxide (NO), is believed to play important roles as yet not completely clarified (1Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 2Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar).

In T lymphocytes the CD95 signaling cascade can be triggered either via activation of the TcR, with ensuing expression and secretion of the CD95 physiological ligand, or via direct cross-linking of the CD95 receptor with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (7Alderson M.R.

Despite the fact that γδ T cells express constant levels of CD95 in vitro, their susceptibility to CD95-triggered apoptosis is known to change as a function of their state of activation (5Nagata S.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying T cell switch in sensitivity to CD95-triggered apoptosis are still unknown. We have investigated this problem taking advantage of normal human lymphocyte clones bearing the Vγ9/Vδ2 TcR, already characterized for their sensitivity to CD95-induced apoptosis in our laboratory (4Ferrarini M.

The results obtained demonstrate that these cells express the constitutive, endothelial NO synthase (ecNOS) and that NO generated by this enzyme regulates their susceptibility to apoptosis modulating the CD95-triggered signal transduction cascade.

The cDNA encodes a protein of 208 amino acids with high sequence homology (95.6%) to rat FGF-10, indicating that the protein is human FGF-10. Human FGF-10 as well as rat FGF-10 has a hydrophobic amino terminus ( approximately 40 amino acids), which may serve as a signal sequence. The apparent evolutionary relationships of human FGFs indicate that FGF-10 is closest to FGF-7. Chromosomal localization of the human FGF-10 gene was examined by in situ hybridization. The gene was found to map to the 5p12-p13 region. Human FGF-10 (amino acids 40 to 208 with a methionine residue at the amino terminus) was produced in Escherichia coli and purified from the cell lysate. Recombinant human FGF-10 (approximately 19 kDa) showed mitogenic activity for fetal rat keratinizing epidermal cells, but essentially no activity for NIH/3T3 cells, fibroblasts. The specificity of mitogenic activity of FGF-10 is similar to that of FGF-7 but distinct from that of bFGF. In structure and biological activity, FGF-10 is similar to FGF-7."
https://openalex.org/W2007675575,"The stimulation of nonmyeloid cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mediated by the serum protein, soluble CD14 (sCD14).

Specific binding of sCD14 to nonmyeloid cells is detected only when it is first incubated with both LPS and the serum LPS-binding protein (LBP). Through the use of an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody, we demonstrate that sCD14 must interact with LPS in order for cellular binding to occur.

Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). LPS-initiated inflammatory responses are strongly enhanced by a 60-kDa serum protein called LBP (2Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp.

Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). LPS in conjunction with LBP has been shown to activate cells of myeloid lineage through interaction with a 55-kDa GPI membrane-anchored glycoprotein called membrane CD14 (mCD14) (4Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar). A soluble form of the CD14 molecule (sCD14) is also found in serum (5Bazil V. Horejsi V. Baudys M. Kristofova H. Strominger J.L. Kostka W. Hilgert I. Eur. J Immunol. 1986; 16: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and is capable of activating myeloid cells independent of mCD14 (6Golenbock D.T. Bach R.R. Lichenstein H. Juan T.S.-C.

At least one other cell surface effector molecule is believed to exist, since neither soluble nor GPI-anchored CD14 traverses the cellular membrane. In addition to macrophages and neutrophils, a variety of nonmyeloid cells have been shown to be responsive to the presence of LPS. Specifically, epithelial, endothelial, astrocytoma, dendritic, and smooth muscle cells become stimulated by LPS in a serum-dependent fashion. The serum component responsible for the activation of these cells has subsequently been shown to be sCD14 (8Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J.

Thus, the apparent function of sCD14 is that it enables certain cells that do not possess mCD14 to respond to low doses of LPS. sCD14 can bind LPS directly to form sCD14·LPS complexes; however, the kinetics of this reaction are slow. In this regard, LBP has been shown to catalyze the transfer of LPS to sCD14 (11Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp.

In addition to the proinflammatory responses mediated by LPS, a number of pathways have been identified by which cells clear and neutralize LPS, thereby removing it as a toxin and dampening these responses (13Kitchens R.L.

Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that LBP participates in the binding and uptake of LPS in a mCD14-dependent manner that is distinct and separate from events leading to signal transduction (13Kitchens R.L.

Furthermore, it has been recently shown that whole bacteria opsonized with LBP bind to cell surface mCD14, leading to phagocytosis (17Grunwald U. Fan X. Jack R.S. Workalemahu G. Kallies A. Stelter F. Schütt C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4119-4125PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we examine LPS-dependent binding events on the surface of nonmyeloid cells utilizing a biologically active radiolabeled sCD14 molecule. Through this approach we have characterized a novel sCD14 binding phenomenon, exhibited by a variety of non-mCD14-bearing cells, that is dependent on both LPS and LBP. We also demonstrate that the observed binding does not directly lead to cellular activation and that it exhibits similar characteristics to the binding of LBP·LPS complexes to mCD14-bearing cells (16Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The LPS- and LBP-dependent binding of sCD14 results in cellular internalization. Taken together, these results suggest that this binding phenomenon represents a general cellular mechanism for the clearance of LPS. The XbaI fragment of full-length human CD14 was subcloned from pRC/RSV (18Lee J.-D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide, encoding a protein kinase A site and a six-histidine tag, 5′-TG CGT CGT GCT AGC GTG GCT GGC GCC GGA CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC TAA-3′ (coding strand) and 5′-G GCC TTA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG TCC GGC GCC AGC CAC GCT AGC ACG ACG CAA GCC-3′ (noncoding strand), was prepared. This oligonucleotide, which possesses a BanII and a NotI overhang, was included in a ligation reaction containing the 790-base pair SacII to BanII fragment of hCD14 and the large fragment of pUC19 hCD14 digested withSacII and NotI. This resulted in pUC19hCD14AH, which encodes the human CD14 protein with the last 33 amino acids and the putative GPI-anchoring site, being replaced by the amino acid sequence LRRSVAGAGHHHHHH. The hCD14AH sequence was subsequently subcloned from pUC19hCD14AH as an NcoI/BamHI fragment into the multiple cloning site of the baculovirus vector pACSG2 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The final construct was sequenced at the Core Facility of The Scripps Research Institute. SF-9 insect cells derived from Spodoptera frugiperda were grown in SF-900II media (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal calf serum. Recombinant baculovirus was created by cotransfecting the pACSG2-hCD14AH vector with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) into SF-9 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). After 3 days, the medium was removed, centrifuged to remove loose cells, and subsequently used to infect a new flask of SF-9 cells. The procedure was repeated to amplify the recombinant virus. The viral titer was determined using the end point dilution assay (19Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 14-16Google Scholar). sCD14AH protein was produced by infecting BTI-TN-5B1–4 (high five) cells derived from Trichoplusia ni(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with the amplified recombinant virus. High five cells were grown in spinner flasks using SF-900II medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 3 days, the cells were removed by centrifugation. The expression of sCD14AH in SF-9 and high five cells was confirmed by Western blot of infected culture supernatants using polyclonal anti-goat hCD14 as the primary antibody. Culture supernatant from infected high five cells was dialyzed against buffer A (100 mmsodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, pH 8.0) and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. After adding nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) the filtrate was gently mixed for 3 h. A column was prepared and washed sequentially with 5 column volumes of buffer A, then buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and finally buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole. The sCD14AH protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The final protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and was quantified by protein assay and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Typically, this system yielded approximately 5 mg of sCD14AH protein per liter of medium. Purified sCD14AH was radiolabeled at the protein kinase A site as described (20Fung H.-F. Bekesi E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of purified sCD14AH was added to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mCi of [γ-33P]ATP (2000 Ci/mmol) and 10 units of bovine heart muscle kinase (Sigma) in a final volume of 150 μl. The phosphorylation reaction was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, after which 15 μl of low endotoxin bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) was added as a carrier protein. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 500 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for several hours and then against 500 ml of fresh phosphate-buffered saline overnight to remove free ATP. The final protein typically incorporated over 40% of the total ATP, resulting in a specific activity of at least 800 Ci/mmol using [γ-33P]ATP and 2400 Ci/mmol using [γ-32P]ATP. The final product was checked by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. SW620, U373, Eahy926, HeLa, COS-7, Jurkat, CHO, and THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. HUVECs were obtained from Clonetics Corporation (San Diego, CA) and grown in endothelial cell growth medium, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, following the suppliers' guidelines. SW620 epithelial cells were grown to confluence in 96-well plates and washed four times in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml human serum albumin. To each well was added 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing Re595 LPS and sCD14 as indicated in the figures. After incubating the cells for 6 h at 37 °C, the medium from each well was removed and assayed for interleukin-8 by a standard sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method using rabbit anti-human interleukin-8 antibodies. The labeled sCD14AH was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with an equimolar amount of LBP and a 2-fold molar excess of Salmonella minnesota Re595 LPS. The average molecular mass of Re595 LPS was taken as 2300 Da. Thus, a typical preincubation reaction contained 160 ng of sCD14AH, 240 ng of LBP, and 20 ng of Re595 LPS in phosphate-buffered saline plus 2 mmEDTA in a final volume of 20 μl. The preincubation reaction was then diluted to 400 μl with ice-cold binding buffer (21Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin), and 100 μl was aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes kept on ice (binding reactions). Adherent SW620 epithelial cells were detached using cell dissociation buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cell pellet was washed twice with several volumes of binding buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold binding buffer at 4 × 107cells/ml, and 100 μl was added to each of the above binding reactions. Whole cell binding was allowed to proceed for 20 min on ice, after which the cells were pelleted for 60 s at 6,000 ×g. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were quickly resuspended in 150 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. The cell suspension was then layered on 200 μl of mineral oil composed of 80% 550 fluid and 20% 200 fluid (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g. The tubes were frozen on dry ice, and the cell pellet was clipped into a scintillation vial, resuspended in 200 μl of 1 n sodium hydroxide and assayed for bound counts in Ecoscint scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). sCD14 has been shown to facilitate the activation of a variety of nonmyeloid cells in response to LPS (8Frey E.A.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 1500-1507PubMed Google Scholar). To detect cell surface interactions of sCD14 with these cells, we required a labeled sCD14 molecule as a ligand. Initially, this was attempted through iodination using chloramine T or iodogen; however, these procedures rendered sCD14 biologically inactive. In addition, treatment of sCD14 with N-hydroxysuccinimide derivatives of biotin or fluorescein isothiocyanate has also been reported to destroy the biological activity of this protein (22Jack R.S. Grunwald U. Stelter F. Workalemahu G. Schütt C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To overcome the inactivation of sCD14, we have utilized a technique that involves radiolabeling the protein at an artificially introduced protein kinase A site, a method that has been successfully carried out to label a variety of intracellular proteins and soluble ligands (Ref. 23Blaner M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar and references therein). Thus, a sCD14 molecule was engineered that replaced the carboxyl end and the putative GPI anchoring site with a protein kinase A site and a six-histidine tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). This protein, hereafter named sCD14AH, was expressed in a baculovirus system and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 A). sCD14AH was at least 95% pure and consisted of three discernible bands on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. The purified protein was radiolabeled to high specific activity at the protein kinase A site (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the final product displayed the same SDS-PAGE profile as the purified protein when visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis has confirmed that the three bands are CD14 (data not shown) and full-length CD14 expressed in baculovirus displays a similar SDS-PAGE profile, which has been attributed to heterogeneity in protein glycosylation (24Haziot A. Rong G.W. Bazil V. Silver J. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5868-5876PubMed Google Scholar). Structure function analysis of sCD14 has demonstrated that the ability of the protein to stimulate nonmyeloid cells in the presence of LPS resides in the amino-terminal half of the molecule (25Juan T.S.-C. Kelley M.J. Johnson D.A. Busse L.A. Hailman E. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1382-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this regard, all of the modifications made in the construction of sCD14AH have been made at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Nevertheless, to ensure that sCD14AH retains biological activity, we tested the ability of the final radiolabeled protein to stimulate SW620 epithelial cells with low doses of LPS. Labeled sCD14AH activated interleukin-8 expression of SW620 epithelial cells in an LPS-dependent fashion at concentrations as low as 100 pg/ml and showed maximal activity at 10 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 2 A). In addition, the LPS sensitivity and level of stimulation were identical to previously published results from our lab using sCD14 purified from CHO cell supernatants (9Pugin J. Schurer-Maly C.-C. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2744-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). To confirm that labeled sCD14AH retains full biological activity, we compared the sCD14 dose dependence on cellular responses at a single LPS concentration. CHO-expressed sCD14, unlabeled sCD14AH, and labeled sCD14AH each increased cellular interleukin-8 expression in dose-dependent fashions, and all three sCD14 preparations exhibited indistinguishable cell-stimulatory activities (Fig. 2 B). In addition, we have confirmed that labeled sCD14AH binds LPS, since an increase in fluorescence was observed upon adding it to a mixture of LBP and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS (12Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results demonstrate that affinity-purified and radiolabeled sCD14AH protein retains the LPS binding and cell stimulatory activity of native sCD14. We have utilized labeled sCD14AH as a ligand in whole cell binding assays in an effort to study cellular interactions of sCD14. Since the activation of epithelial and endothelial cells by LPS requires sCD14, and sCD14 is an LPS-binding protein, we reasoned that cell surface binding of sCD14AH may be LPS-dependent. Since LBP has been shown to transfer LPS to sCD14 (11Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 12Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), it was used to facilitate the formation of sCD14·LPS complexes. Therefore, we preincubated sCD14AH and LBP, at concentrations comparable with those found in serum (26Leturcq, D., VanHook, P., Smith, R., Tobias, P. S., Ulevitch, R. J., and Moriaty, A. (1992) J. Cell Biol. , 16,Suppl. C, 161.Google Scholar,27Grunwald U. Krüger C. Westermann J. Lukowsky A. Ehlers M. Schütt C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 155: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), in the presence of a small molar excess of LPS. After the preincubation, the resulting complexes were diluted with ice-cold binding buffer, and whole cell binding assays were performed with SW620 epithelial cells on ice to prevent internalization (see “Experimental Procedures”). When labeled sCD14AH was preincubated by itself, with LBP alone, or with LPS alone, no specific binding to SW620 epithelial cells could be measured (Fig. 3). In fact, we have been unable to detect any specific binding of sCD14AH to SW620 epithelial cells in the absence of LBP even after preincubating the sCD14AH with excess molar amounts of LPS for several hours, a condition that allows sCD14·LPS complex formation (11Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, when preincubated at 37 °C with both LBP and LPS, sCD14AH displayed significant binding to these cells (Fig. 3). This binding was specific, since it was abrogated by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled sCD14AH in the preincubation but not by an equivalent amount of human serum albumin. Furthermore, no specific binding of sCD14 can be detected when it is added to LBP and LPS on ice without a 37 °C preincubation (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that sCD14 must interact with both LBP and LPS at 37 °C to bind specifically to SW620 epithelial cells. We have found that the binding is dependent on the length of the preincubation time but is maximal within 5 min at 37 °C (data not shown). The simplest interpretation of these results is that sCD14, LBP, and LPS form a ternary complex at 37 °C that can subsequently bind to epithelial cells. To examine more closely the dependence of LBP and LPS on the cell surface binding of sCD14, we tested the effects of varying the amounts of these components in the preincubation with respect to sCD14AH. Fig. 4 A shows the LPS dependence of the binding at three different LBP concentrations. The binding of sCD14AH initially increased with the amount of LPS present but was inhibited at high molar ratios of LPS to sCD14AH. sCD14AH binding also increased with the amount of LBP present; however, the binding was maximal not at any particular ratio of LPS to sCD14AH but when the LPS:LBP ratio was approximately 3:1. These results were confirmed and extended when the LBP dependence of the binding was examined at four different LPS concentrations (Fig. 4 B). In all cases, the binding increased with the amount of LBP added. When the molar ratio of LPS with respect to LBP is low, the binding rises steeply with increasing amounts of LBP and eventually saturates. Conversely, when the molar amount of LPS is high with respect to LBP, the binding is initially inhibited until the LBP to LPS molar ratio is sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of excess LPS. The binding of sCD14AH still increases at high stoichiometric levels of LBP, further indicating that LBP is not acting catalytically in this system to deliver LPS to sCD14. We observe no inhibition of binding even at exceptionally high molar ratios of LBP to sCD14AH or LBP to LPS (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). We next examined the effect of cell number on sCD14AH binding (Fig. 4 C). The level of sCD14AH bound increased with increasing cell number; however, sCD14AH binding at different cell concentrations exhibited the same LPS dependence and was maximal when the LPS:LBP ratio was approximately 3:1. These results show that while the amount of sCD14AH bound is dependent on cell number, the maximal binding stoichiometry with respect to LPS and LBP is independent of cell number. The saturability of sCD14 binding to epithelial cells was investigated by determining the binding of a series of dilutions made from a single preincubation of sCD14AH, LBP, and LPS. Surprisingly, the binding was directly proportional to the total amount of the preincubated mixture added to the cells and was linear over at least 4 logs of sCD14AH concentration, from 10−11 to 10−7m (Fig. 5). These results confirm the idea that once formed complexes of sCD14·LBP·LPS are relatively stable and are refractory to dilution. Moreover, the inability to saturate the binding of sCD14 under these conditions is reminiscent of the inability to saturate the binding of LBP·LPS complexes to cells bearing mCD14. This phenomenon was attributed to the ability of these complexes to self-aggregate on the cell surface (16Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast to the requirement of both LPS and LBP for binding of sCD14AH to cells (Figs. 3 and 4), the sCD14-mediated stimulation of nonmyeloid cells by LPS does not require LBP (Fig. 2 and Ref. 9Pugin J. Schurer-Maly C.-C. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2744-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Thus, the LBP- and LPS-dependent binding of sCD14 does not appear to be directly involved in events leading to cellular activation. To confirm this, we tested the effects of a panel of monoclonal anti-CD14 and anti-LBP antibodies. These antibodies were added to the preincubation reaction containing sCD14AH, LBP, and LPS, and the resulting complexes were tested for the ability to bind and stimulate interleukin-8 production using SW620 epithelial cells (Fig. 6). The anti-CD14 antibody 63D3 had no effect on sCD14AH binding or cellular stimulation. In contrast, the anti-CD14 antibody 28C5 blocked both binding and activation of SW620 cells. However, while activation was inhibited by the anti-CD14 antibody 18E12, there was no effect on the binding of sCD14AH. Conversely, although binding was abrogated by two anti-LBP antibodies, 18G4 and 2B5, these antibodies had no effect on cellular activation. These results clearly demonstrate that the LPS- and LBP-dependent binding of sCD14 is not directly involved in interactions leading to cellular activation. The anti-CD14 antibody 28C5 blocks the activation of myeloid cells by preventing the binding of LPS to mCD14 (16Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 3011-3021PubMed Google Scholar). 28C5 also blocks the binding of LPS to sCD14, and we have observed that the ability of sCD14AH to bind fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS, as measured by an increase in fluorescence (12Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), is completely abrogated by this anti-CD14 antibody (data not shown). The fact that the binding of sCD14AH to cells requires a preincubation of this protein with LBP and LPS (Fig. 3), coupled with the ability of 28C5 to completely abrogate the cellular binding of sCD14AH, strongly suggests that the observed binding requires a prior interaction between sCD14AH and LPS. Membrane-anchored CD14 has been shown to be a receptor for LBP·LPS complexes in a binding phenomenon that does not saturate (16Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, to address this and ascertain the generality of our results, we tested a variety of cells for binding of sCD14AH that was dependent on the presence of both LBP and LPS and could be blocked by the antibodies 28C5 and 18G4 in the preincubation (Table I). Following these criteria, sCD14AH displayed binding to a variety of cells that respond to LPS in a sCD14-dependent fashion. These cells included the astrocytoma cell line U373, the endothelial cell line Eahy926, and primary HUVECs. In addition, the LBP- and LPS-dependent binding of sCD14AH was detected using HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, CHO cells, and the myeloid cell line THP-1. Binding of sCD14AH to Jurkat cells, a T-cell line, was barely detectable in our assay. We also examined the effects of the anti-CD14 and anti-LBP antibodies when added to cells after the preincubation (Table I). In this situation, the 28C5 antibody no longer inhibited binding, confirming that the effects of this antibody are on the interaction between sCD14AH and LPS. Conversely, 18G4 blocked sCD14AH binding even when added after the preincubati"

To understand this step further, SecA topology was investigated.

Considerable progress has been made during the past decade in our understanding of the basic pathways of protein trafficking within cells. In microorganisms a combination of genetic and biochemical strategies have allowed identification of the components of the secretion apparatus and a detailed study of their mechanism of action (1Schatz P. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Wickner W. Leonard M. J. Biol.

In Escherichia coli, the ease of genetic analysis combined with the ability to reconstitute in vitro protein translocation solely from purified components has made this one of the premier systems for conducting a detailed analysis of the protein translocation mechanism. Current views indicate that protein translocation can be divided into a number of distinct stages. Initially preproteins or nascent chains of preproteins associate with chaperones such as SecB protein that maintains them in an export-competent configuration (4Kumamoto C. Mol.

They are then targeted to the plasma membrane where they are associated with the translocase complex that consists of the membrane-dissociatable SecA protein, which is the translocation ATPase, and the heterotrimeric SecYEG protein, which appears to constitute the preprotein channel based on recent phylogenetic evidence (6Lill R.

The presence of multiple binding sites on SecA allows it to promote the formation of protein translocation complexes at the correct topological site in the membrane. SecA possesses a second function, which is to catalyze the insertion of the preprotein into the membrane and promote its translocation utilizing its translocation ATPase activity (17Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This latter function depends on the ability of SecA to itself insert into the membrane, a reversible process that is regulated by the amino-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of SecA (18Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte-Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Ulbrandt N. London E. Oliver D. J. Biol.

Two distinct models for SecA-dependent protein translocation can be envisioned as follows: SecA could act as a molecular gate to control channel opening and closing and preprotein entry by utilizing its preprotein binding activity and membrane insertion and de-insertion cycle, or alternatively, SecA could act as a molecular ratchet to power preprotein translocation by undergoing ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and de-insertion that are coupled to processive chain movement. Evidence favoring each of these models has been obtained recently (23Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Chen X. Xu H. Tai P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additional studies including a detailed kinetic analysis of nucleotide utilization coupled to protein translocation are needed to distinguish between these two models and elucidate the SecA-dependent step(s) in protein translocation. In addition to endogenous regulation of SecA's membrane cycling behavior by one of its nucleotide-binding domains, it has been found that physiological levels of SecD and SecF proteins are required to stabilize the membrane-inserted form of SecA protein (21Economou A. Pogliano J. Beckwith J. Oliver D. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been proposed that the topology inversion of SecG protein that was observed during protein translocation may enhance the membrane cycling behavior of SecA protein (25Nishiyama K.-I. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because the state of SecA in the membrane and its membrane cycling behavior are crucial to an understanding of the function of this complex protein and its role in protein secretion, we have undertaken a detailed study of the topology of the integral-membrane form of SecA protein. Previous studies have shown that SecA is periplasmically accessible to proteolysis or labeling by a membrane-impermeable reagent and that the carboxyl terminus of SecA is one region of exposure (20Kim Y.J.

In this study we have utilized a combination of site-directed sulfhydryl labeling, proteolysis, or truncation of SecA to develop a map of the membrane topology of this protein.

A plasmid for production of SecA devoid of any Cys residues, pT7secAC4, was made by subcloning an 800-base pairBstXI-SacI DNA fragment containing Ser substitutions at amino acid residues 885, 887, and 896 ofsecA from pT7secAC3 into the appropriate sites of pT7secAC98S (31Rajapandi T.

RSO were prepared by the procedure of Kaback (35Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar) utilizing the protocol of Kim et al. (20Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T.

RSO were purified using a two-step sucrose gradient and resuspended in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The concentration of total membrane protein in IMV and RSO was determined by the Bio-Rad method as described by the manufacturer after solubilization of membranes in 0.1% SDS. RSO (200 μg of membrane protein per sample) were sedimented at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, and Cys residues were reduced by resuspension of RSO in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT followed by incubation for 30 min at 0 °C. RSO were collected by sedimentation and resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA. MPB dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (50 mg ml−1) was added to RSO to a final concentration of 0.05 mm, followed by incubation at 0 °C for 3 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 1 m DTT to 100 mm or by addition of 1m N-ethylmaleimide to 10 mm and incubation at 0 °C for 10 min. RSO were collected by sedimentation and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA), followed by immunoprecipitation with either 2 μl of anti-SecA antisera or 2 μl of anti-FrD-A antisera as described previously (36Oliver D.B.

Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Visualization of biotinylated proteins employed streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and ECL, and visualization of other proteins utilized primary rabbit antisera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and ECL as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp). The construction of strains over-producing various MBP-SecA fusions and the purification of the protein chimeras has been described previously (16Snyders S. Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11302-11306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MBP-SecA1, MBP-SecA2, MBP-SecA3, MBP-SecA4, MBP-SecA5, and MBP-SecA6 containing SecA amino acid residues 1–209, 211–350, 351–509, 519–664, 665–820, and 822–901, respectively, fused to MBP were used to make region-specific SecA antisera. For this purpose 1 mg of each protein in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected intradermally and intermuscularly into New Zealand White rabbits, who were boosted at 2-week intervals with 1 mg of each protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant until high titer antisera were obtained. Region-specific SecA antibody was isolated by affinity purification utilizing chemically cross-linked SecA protein as described previously (34Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). SecA proteins were purified from S300 extracts of over-producing strains by affinity chromatography on Cibacron Blue-agarose as described previously (27Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). SecA and its cysteine derivatives (5 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA were reduced by the addition of 5 mmTCEP followed by incubation on ice for 2 h. MPB dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (50 mg ml−1) was added to the proteins to a final concentration of 0.05 mm, followed by incubation for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 m N-ethylmaleimide to 10 mm, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting followed by ECL as described above. Assays for SecA-dependent endogenous, membrane, and translocation ATPase activities utilizing the colorimetric reagent malachite green were performed as described previously (27Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). SecA, a 901-amino acid residue protein, has Cys residues located at position 98, 885, 887, and 896. A strain producing a form of SecA protein lacking any Cys residues, BL21.19 (pT7secAC4), was constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”) and tested forsecA function. It was found that this strain could grow on LB ampicillin plates at 42 °C and gave rise to colonies of normal size, indicating that secAC4 would allow complementation of the unsuppressed secA13(Am) allele under conditions of modest over-expression (approximately 5-fold). Cell fractionation experiments utilizing sodium carbonate revealed that the distribution of SecAC4 between cytosolic, peripheral, and integral membrane fractions was similar to that found for wild-type SecA ((20) data not shown). Similar to SecAC3 containing Ser substitutions at positions 885, 887, and 896 of SecA, SecAC4 showed normal SecA-dependent endogenous and membrane ATPase activities and approximately 50% higher translocation ATPase activity (31Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1477-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Having satisfied ourselves that SecAC4 was biologically active and similar to wild-type SecA protein in its subcellular distribution, we constructed a series of strains that each produced a monocysteine derivative of SecA protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The positions of the Cys residues were chosen with regard to maintaining conservative amino acid substitutions as well as achieving an even distribution of Cys residues across the entire SecA protein. We tested the biological function of each secA allele by complementation and the subcellular localization behavior of each SecA variant by cell fractionation studies. All monocysteine SecA derivatives used in this study showed normal biological function as assessed by these two criteria (results not shown). Previous studies have shown that integral membrane SecA protein is periplasmically accessible to trypsin or labeling by NHS-X-biotin and that at least one of the carboxyl-terminal Cys residues can be labeled with MPB (20Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26van der Does C. den Blaauwen T. de Wit J. Manting E. Groot N. Fekkes P. Driessen A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In an effort to develop a map of the topology of integral-membrane SecA protein we prepared RSO from strains under conditions where only a monocysteine variant of SecA was produced in moderate amounts (i.e. growth at 41 °C without isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction), and we probed the accessibility of a given Cys residue of SecA to labeling by MPB. Previous studies have shown that at low concentrations MPB is membrane-impermeable so that it can be used to map the external portions of membrane proteins ((37, 38) also shown below). The result of these studies is shown in Fig. 1. Whereas wild-type SecA was strongly labeled by this procedure, SecAC4 was not labeled (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating both the specificity of MPB for sulfhydryl labeling as well as the depletion of chromosomally derived SecA protein under our experimental conditions. Western analysis indicated that the SecA content of the different RSO preparations did not differ substantially (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the pattern of MPB labeling could be viewed directly as a specific activity measurement. SecAC858 and SecAC896 were labeled by this procedure indicating that at least the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acid residues of SecA are periplasmically accessible. In addition, we found strong labeling of SecAC530, moderate labeling of SecAC300 and SecAC350, and weak labeling of SecAC47. All of the other monocysteine derivatives were not labeled in RSO by this procedure. It's possible that some of the Cys residues that were not labeled may be buried within the interior of SecA or some other Sec protein rather than being shielded from labeling by the membrane. To investigate this point further, MPB labeling was carried out in the presence of 0.1% Triton, where MPB can cross the membrane (see below for verification of this point). All of the SecA proteins that were previously labeled (SecAC896, SecAC858, SecAC530, SecAC350, and SecAC300) were labeled more strongly by this condition, and in addition, SecAC470 was also labeled (Fig. 1 B). All of the other monocysteine variants of SecA showed very little labeling under this condition, suggesting that their Cys residues are located within the interior of SecA or some other Sec protein. These results suggest that the topology of integral membrane SecA protein is complex and that at least three different regions of SecA span the membrane or are located within a channel that is periplasmically accessible to molecules the size of MPB. To demonstrate the quality and specificity of our results, we performed several control experiments that are shown in Fig. 2. We first monitored MPB labeling of FrD-A as a control for the integrity and homogeneity of our RSO preparations. FrD-A is a 602 amino acid residue protein containing 10 Cys residues located throughout the protein that resides on the inner face of the inner membrane (39Cole S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and thus it should not be labeled by our procedure. In accordance with this prediction none of the RSO preparations examined (Fig. 2 A, SecAC300, SecAC530, SecAC858, SecAC896, and wild-type) showed MPB labeling of FrD-A unless the integrity of the membrane was compromised by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100. This indicates that the observed MPB labeling of SecA in these cases was not due to contamination with IMV or to the loss of integrity of the inner membrane of RSO. Next, to ensure that the different pattern of MPB labeling of SecA was not due to different rates or extents of MPB penetration in the various RSO preparations, we first blocked surface-exposed Cys residues in RSO with the highly water-soluble, membrane-impermeant maleimide, AMS (38Loo T. Clarke D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 40Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), followed by labeling with MPB. The results demonstrate that MPB labeling of SecA can be blocked by prior treatment with AMS (Fig. 2, compareB with C), strongly suggesting that such labeling does not occur within the membrane bilayer. To study the exposure of Cys residues on soluble SecA protein, monocysteine derivatives of SecA were purified, reduced with the non-thiol reagent TCEP, and subjected to MPB labeling under different conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 3. SecAC530, SecAC858, and SecAC896 as well as wild-type SecA were labeled at both 0 and 37 °C under these conditions (Fig. 3, A andB). The inability to label SecAC4 here demonstrates the purity of our SecA mutant protein preparations as well as the specificity of labeling. Interestingly, when labeling was done at 37 °C in the presence of ATP, SecAC300 was moderately labeled and SecAC350 was weakly labeled (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that temperature and ATP binding may promote a conformational change in SecA that allows exposure of this particular region of SecA and that this alteration may promote SecA membrane insertion and periplasmic exposure of this region of SecA in RSO. Unfolding reactions of SecA in response to nucleotide and membrane binding have been described previously (19Ulbrandt N. London E. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41den Blaauwen T. Fekkes P. de Wit J. Kuiper W. Driessen A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11994-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To locate regions of SecA protein that are peripherally or integrally associated with the membrane, we conducted limited trypsinolysis of SecA in IMV and determined the resistance of any tryptic fragments of SecA to extraction by urea. These results are shown in Fig. 4. Under conditions of mild trypsinolysis, 95-, 80-, 64-, 47-, 41-, and 38-kDa fragments of SecA were obtained as well as lower levels of 30- and 28-kDa SecA fragments (Fig. 4 A; also see Fig. 5). A number of these proteolytic fragments of SecA in IMV have been noted previously (24Chen X. Xu H. Tai P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41den Blaauwen T. Fekkes P. de Wit J. Kuiper W. Driessen A.

Trypsin did not penetrate into IMV under these conditions, since TolA, an inner membrane protein with a large periplasmic domain (43Levengood S. Beyer W. Webster R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was resistant to even the highest concentrations of trypsin utilized here (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, TolA in RSO was readily degraded at even the lowest concentration of trypsin employed here (results not shown), similar to results with EDTA-permeabilized whole cells (43Levengood S. Beyer W. Webster R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This result further verifies the correct topology and homogeneity of our membrane preparations. Following digestion with trypsin, IMV were extracted with urea and isolated to distinguish peripheral versus integral portions of the SecA substructure. The 95-, 80-, 64-, 41-. and 38-kDa tryptic fragments of SecA were found to be urea-resistant (Fig. 3 A), indicating that they were associated with the"

During transcription initiation, TFIIH is thought to be recruited to a promoter, after the formation of the preinitiation complex containing TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, and RNA polymerase II on the TATA box consensus sequence (8Zavel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Once associated with this complex, TFIIH is likely to function through its ATP-dependent helicase subunits, which may facilitate the opening of the promoter region (9Holstege F.C.P. van der Vliet P.C.

We found that the binding of XPA to damaged DNA is a prerequisite for the efficient recruitment of the TFIIH complex.

The mutation consists in a C to T transition at nucleotide 682 altering the Arg228 codon (CGA) to a non-sense codon (TGA) (31Satokata I. Tanaka K. Miura N. Narita M. Mimaki T. Satoh Y. Kondo S.

Whole cell-free extracts were prepared from HeLa cells according to Manley et al. (33Manley J. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P. Gefter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Partial filling of recessed 3′-ends was carried out using [α-33P]dATP and the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Aliquots were irradiated on ice with a germicidal lamp with peak output at 254 nm at doses up to 20 KJ/m2. A 48-mer double strand DNA containing an internal stretch of 8 thymines was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and irradiated as described for pUC19 DNA. A 879-base pair DNA fragment was obtained by BamHI/SspI restriction of pUC309 (derivated from pUC19) plasmid DNA. Aliquots were irradiated at 1 KJ/m2. Damaged and undamaged DNA fragments were32P-labeled by extension with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. 1 ng of the 32P-labeled 879-base pair DNA probe (approximately 5,000 cpm) was incubated with various quantities of GST-XPA recombinant protein or of highly purified TFIIH (the hydroxyapatite-eluted fraction, which is the last step of our purification procedure (see Ref. 3Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Molina Gomez D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M.

The reaction mixtures were then loaded on a nitrocellulose membrane by using a hybridot device. After washing with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 50 mm KCl, the labeled probe retained on the membrane was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The interaction of TFIIH with wild type or mutant GST-XPA fusion proteins was analyzed by pull-down experiments. GST-XPA fusion proteins (500 ng) were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl) directly or after incubation with untreated or UV-irradiated linearized pUC19 DNA for 1 h at 4 °C in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After washing, the beads were incubated with aliquots of HeLa whole cell extract (equivalent to 5 × 105 cells/assay) or with purified preparations of TFIIH for at least 2 h at 4 °C with mild agitation in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The beads were then extensively washed with the same buffer. The bound proteins were extracted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 0.1m dithiothreitol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using the Aurora ™ Western blot chemiluminescent detection system (ICN). The presence of some zinc finger motifs, including a TFIIA-like motif, as well as some CX2C cystein-rich motifs in p44, one of the subunits which forms the core of TFIIH (34Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), strongly suggested that TFIIH directly binds DNA. We tested this possibility using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay, supposing that TFIIH, because of its involvement in both transcription and DNA repair, might interact with undamaged and damaged DNA, respectively. Highly purified TFIIH (the hydroxyapatite-eluted fraction from our purification procedure) was thus incubated with an UV-irradiated or untreated 32P-labeled pUC309 DNA fragment as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the interaction was estimated by the ability of TFIIH to retain labeled DNA on a nitrocellulose filter. As shown on Fig. 1 A, TFIIH interacted equally with damaged and undamaged DNA, which demonstrates that TFIIH per se has no specificity for damaged DNA. This binding is likely to occur through the zinc finger motif, since mutations in this sequence completely abolish the binding of the recombinant p44 subunit on any DNA. 3V. Moncollin, S. Humbert, and J.-M. Egly, unpublished results. On the contrary, when the same experiment was performed with the XPA recombinant protein, we observed that the retention of UV-damaged DNA was higher than the retention of undamaged DNA (Fig. 1 B), a point that was previously established using gel shift retention and filter binding assays (16Robins P. Jones C.J. Biggerstaff M. Lindhal T. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Jones C.J. Wood R.D.

At the present stage of our investigations, it is difficult to compare the affinity constants of both factors toward any kind of DNA, since the exact stoichiometry of TFIIH has not yet been established. Since TFIIH was demonstrated to participate in the early steps of NER, as do several damage recognition factors, including the XPA protein (12Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it was of interest to test how its recruitment to sites of lesions could be selectively promoted. Therefore, we designed experiments in which a fixed amount of GST-tagged XPA was preincubated in the presence or absence of increasing amounts of EcoRI-linearized pUC19 DNA, either untreated or previously UV-irradiated at different doses (5, 10, and 20 KJ/m2), before being adsorbed onto affinity glutathione-Sepharose beads. DNA concentrations were chosen so that UV-irradiated DNA, as well as undamaged DNA, were in limited amounts with regard to the binding capacities of the XPA protein in the assay. Consequently, and as verified using end-labeled pUC19 DNA, almost all of a given quantity of unirradiated or UV-irradiated DNA was found complexed to the GST-XPA protein immobilized on the beads (Fig. 2). We also checked that the amount of GST-XPA protein bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads was the same irrespective of the preincubation with either UV-irradiated or unirradiated DNA (data not shown). This implies that the only variable between the different XPA·DNA complexes (formed with 25 ng of DNA, for example) was the number of UV lesions on the DNA. The various samples were subsequently incubated with aliquots of HeLa whole cell extract. After extensive washing with the same buffer containing 100 mm KCl and 0.4% Nonidet P-40, the polypeptides retained on the affinity support were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using antibodies directed toward the p62 and cyclin H subunits of TFIIH (Fig. 3 A). Several observations can be drawn from these experiments. First, TFIIH present in HeLa whole cell extracts is significantly retained on the affinity support only when GST-XPA has bound pUC19 DNA; in fact, GST-XPA alone is only able to retain a very low amount of TFIIH (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 2 and lanes 3–5). Second, the amount of TFIIH retained depends upon the presence of DNA and the number of lesions induced by UV irradiation. Indeed, increasing concentrations of damaged DNA, as well as increasing UV doses to DNA, resulted in a corresponding increase in the capacity of preformed GST-XPA·DNA complexes to retain TFIIH (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 3–5 and 6–14). Assayed as a control, TFIIFα, a transcription factor that is known to associate with RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation, as well as for elongation, was observed not to bind with GST-XPA whether or not the latter was associated with DNA (Fig. 3 A). Taken together, these data indicate that TFIIH present in HeLa whole cell extracts interacts with XPA·DNA complexes as a function of the number of lesions on the DNA. To establish whether the binding of TFIIH on GST-XPA·(UV-damaged) DNA complexes is direct or mediated by other polypeptides present in HeLa cell crude extracts, we incubated highly purified TFIIH (Fig. 3 C) with GST-XPA, which had previously been incubated with either UV-irradiated (at a dose of 20 KJ/m2) or nonirradiated 48-mer DNA fragments (containing a stretch of 8 thymines). The detection of increased amounts of the XPB, p62, p44, and cyclin H subunits of TFIIH associated with complexes of GST-XPA and UV-irradiated DNA (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 6 and7) suggests that purified TFIIH preferentially binds to these complexes. This association is specific, since TFIIH was not retained by the GST tag (lanes 2–4). Also, we can observe again that TFIIH binds weakly to GST-XPA in the absence of DNA (lane 5). This experiment thus indicates that the interaction of TFIIH with XPA·DNA complexes is direct and not mediated by other factors. Since TFIIH has some affinity for DNA (Fig. 1 A), the question may be raised whether the binding of TFIIH to XPA·DNA complexes involves a direct protein-protein interaction with XPA or results from TFIIH binding to the DNA. To answer this issue, we have compared the binding of TFIIH to protein·DNA complexes formed using the wild type GST-XPA protein or a mutant GST-XPA.CΔ46 protein. The CΔ46 deletion (32Miura N. Miyamoto I. Asahina H. Satokata I. Tanaka K. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19786-19789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which results from the mutation altering the Arg228 codon (CGA) to a non-sense codon (TGA) (31Satokata I. Tanaka K. Miura N. Narita M. Mimaki T. Satoh Y. Kondo S. Okada Y. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), does not affect the DNA binding domain of the protein (35Kuraoka I. Morita E.H. Saijo M. Matsuda T. Morikawa K. Shirakawa M. Tanaka K. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but is crucial for NER, because the patient homozygous for this mutation showed an XP phenotype (31Satokata I. Tanaka K. Miura N. Narita M. Mimaki T. Satoh Y. Kondo S. Okada Y. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Miura N. Miyamoto I. Asahina H. Satokata I. Tanaka K. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19786-19789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Either GST-XPA or GST-XPA.CΔ46 fused proteins were incubated in two steps as described above: first with damaged or undamaged DNA and second with HeLa whole cell extract, and the presence of TFIIH on the affinity support was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. In these experimental conditions and using end-labeled pUC19 DNA, we first observed that the mutant GST-XPA.CΔ46 protein still possesses the capacity to bind DNA, with an efficiency close to that of wild type GST-XPA protein (Fig. 2). We also verified that the binding of GST-XPA.CΔ46 alone or of GST-XPA.CΔ46 complexed with damaged or with undamaged DNA to glutathione-Sepharose beads was the same. However, as observed on the immunoblots using anti-p62 and anti-cyclin H antibodies (Fig. 4, compare GST-XPA.CΔ46 curve to GST-XPA curves), TFIIH was retained to a much lower extent on GST-XPA.CΔ46·DNA complexes than on GST-XPA·DNA complexes, independent of the level of DNA damage. Furthermore, another truncated XPA protein MF122, composed of 122 amino acid residues spanning from position 98 to 219 and which still possesses DNA binding activity (35Kuraoka I. Morita E.H. Saijo M. Matsuda T. Morikawa K. Shirakawa M. Tanaka K. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), did not significantly interact with TFIIH in the presence of undamaged or damaged DNA (data not shown). These results indicate that TFIIH binds directly to XPA engaged in a protein·DNA complex and that the carboxyl-terminal domain of XPA is important for this interaction. The latter finding is consistent with a previous report (25Park C.-H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Active processing of DNA damage by NER is dependent on the ability to recognize DNA modifications in the genome and on the efficiency with which repair factors are recruited to the site of DNA damage. Evidence is accumulating that selectivity in DNA damage recognition is achieved through the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes at the sites of lesions. A first level of specificity probably arises through the DNA damage binding properties of XPA in tight association with RPA.In vitro experiments have shown that XPA (Refs. 16Robins P. Jones C.J. Biggerstaff M. Lindhal T. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Jones C.J. Wood R.D.

Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) have a moderately higher affinity for damaged DNA over undamaged DNA in isolation and a considerably enhanced preferential binding of both proteins when the two proteins are present (22Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 23He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). More specificity in damage recognition may be gained by interaction of XPA with ERCCI (36Park C.-H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Li L. Elledge S.J. Peterson C.A. Bales E.S. Legerski R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1993-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which was also shown to increase the affinity of XPA for damaged DNA (39Nagai A. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Matsuda T. Kodo N. Nakatsu Y. Mimaki T. Mino M. Biggerstaff M. Wood R.D. Sijbers A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These cooperative protein-protein-DNA interactions, possibly stabilized by other factors, are likely to result in the accumulation of XPA in “closed” preincision complexes at sites of lesions. TFIIH is thought to enter the assembly at this point of the repair process. The experiments presented here provide insight into the mechanism by which TFIIH is recruited to DNA damage. We have observed that TFIIH binds much more efficiently to GST-XPA·UV-damaged DNA complexes than to GST-XPA·undamaged DNA or GST-XPA.CΔ46·UV-damaged DNA complexes. Thus, taken together, these data indicate that TFIIH has no marked preference for binding to damaged DNA by itself and is instead recruited to XPA·DNA complexes mainly via an interaction with the COOH terminus of XPA whose affinity for TFIIH appears to be damage recognition-dependent. This finding that UV damage to DNA potentiates the affinity of XPA for TFIIH has interesting implications for the functions of TFIIH in vivo. The discovery that some components of the NER system participate in other important metabolic processes, i.e. transcription for TFIIH and replication for RPA, suggests that there might be mechanisms for shifting from one pathway to another. A possible molecular strategy could be based on changes of affinity between the different interacting proteins. Our results suggest that XPA in binding to UV-damaged DNA undergoes conformational changes enabling a much more efficient interaction with TFIIH. The XPA-RPA and, possibly, XPA-ERCC1 cooperativities in the recognition of damaged DNA, together with the resulting increase of XPA affinity for TFIIH, may confer the specificity and the efficiency necessary to sequester TFIIH away from actively transcribed promoters to NER preincision complexes and, in particular, may direct TFIIH to damage sites in nontranscribed regions of the genome. Once recruited to the lesion by XPA, TFIIH may also bind to the DNA by its p44 or p34 subunits (34Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and lead to open complex formation via its ATP-dependent helicase activities (30Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) prior to endonucleolytic cleavage of the damaged DNA strand by structure-specific nucleases XPG (40O'Donovan A. Davies A.A.

Although many studies have demonstrated that the NER system can recognize and repair a wide range of chemically and structurally distinct lesions, the efficiency of their removal varies greatly. Further development of our work will try to establish if the affinity of XPA for TFIIH is influenced by different types of DNA lesions and if this may be correlated with the rates of their repair.

https://openalex.org/W2043187556,"Hematopoietic cytokines transduce cell survival signals, which are distinct from the signals necessary for the stimulation of DNA synthesis. Recently, the Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways have been shown to play important roles in preventing apoptosis in various cell types,e.g. hematopoietic cells and neuronal cells. Withdrawal of cytokine(s), in turn, results in rapid inactivation of these survival pathways and eventually leads to cell death accompanied by the hallmarks of apoptosis. However, the mechanism of cell death caused by cytokine deprivation has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that caspase-3/CPP32, a member of the caspase/interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family, is activated upon interleukin (IL)-3 deprivation in IL-3-dependent cells as well as IL-2 deprivation in IL-2-dependent cells. In addition, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a cellular substrate for the caspase family proteases, was degraded into apoptotic fragments in both cell lines after cytokine removal. Furthermore, inhibition of a caspase family protease by synthetic peptides suppressed apoptotic death. These results indicate that the activation of a caspase-like protease(s) is required for the progression of apoptosis following cytokine deprivation. However, readdition of IL-3 did not restore the proliferative potential of the cells that survived in the presence of the peptide inhibitor after IL-3 depletion. Therefore, cellular commitment to apoptosis appears to precede the activation of a caspase-like protease(s).

Therefore, cellular commitment to apoptosis appears to precede the activation of a caspase-like protease(s). Hematopoietic cells require an appropriate cytokine(s) for their survival; in the absence of cytokines, these cells not only cease proliferation, but also undergo rapid apoptotic death (1Allen P.D. Bustin S.A. Newland A.C. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The strict dependence of hematopoietic cells on cytokines is the key to hematopoietic homeostasis. Hematopoietic cells expanded by cytokines produced from activated T cells rapidly return to a normal level upon removal of inflammatory stimulation (2Arai K. Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Cytokines also regulate steady-state hematopoiesis to preserve an adequate population of peripheral hematopoietic cells (2Arai K. Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the strict cytokine dependence for survival is an important mechanism that inhibits hematopoietic hyperplasia, and alterations of the dependence often result in malignant transformation (3Hunter T.

We previously reported by using truncated mutants of the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor and kinase inhibitors that the Ras signaling pathway is important for hematopoietic cell survival (5Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that the antiapoptotic effect of the Ras pathway is mediated not only by the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but also by a rapamycin/wortmannin-sensitive pathway in which phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is involved (6Andrea K. Pablo R. Eugen U. Christopher G. Paul C. Julian D. Gerard E. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 7Kinoshita, T., Shirouzu, M., Kamiya, A., Hashimoto, K., Yokoyama, S., and Miyajima, A. (1997) Oncogene , 14, in press.Google Scholar). Furthermore, several lines of evidence clearly demonstrated that the signaling pathway involving PKB/Akt protein kinase is important for survival of various types of cells (8Yao R. Cooper G.M.

Thus, cytokines regulate survival of hematopoietic cells through the activation of multiple signaling pathways. In contrast, the removal of cytokines rapidly inactivates these cell survival signals and results in massive apoptotic cell death (1Allen P.D. Bustin S.A. Newland A.C. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition to cytokine withdrawal, a number of apoptotic signals lead to the commitment of death through several distinct mechanisms (14Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). For example, ligands for the Fas/tumor necrosis factor-α receptor family (for a review, see Ref. 15Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar) provoke the cellular suicide program, which does not require novel mRNA/protein synthesis. In contrast, γ-radiation-induced apoptosis is likely to involve transcriptional regulation through p53-dependent (16Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T.

However, after the commitment, there appears to be a general cell killing mechanism that is involved in most types of apoptosis (1Allen P.D. Bustin S.A. Newland A.C.

To date, at least nine different caspase-related proteases have been identified, and their potential roles in apoptosis have been examined in various systems (19Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 20Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). However, apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation has been considered to occur simply due to the inactivation of signaling pathways responsible for cell survival, and its mechanism has not been explored. Moreover, it was suggested that in an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T cell line, a caspase-like protease is not required for apoptosis caused by IL-2 deprivation (26Vasilakos J.P. Ghayur T. Carroll R.T. Giegel D.A. Saunders J.M. Quintal L. Keane K.M. Shivers B.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3433-3442PubMed Google Scholar). We show in this study that the removal of cytokines (IL-3 and IL-2) leads to the activation of a caspase-like protease that cleaves the specific target sequence of a caspase-3/CPP32-class cysteine protease. We also found that the degradation of the endogenous apoptotic substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) occurred following caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, the addition of peptide inhibitors for caspase-like proteases blocked the activation of caspase-3, PARP breakdown, DNA fragmentation, and subsequent cell death, suggesting that the activation of caspase-3 plays an essential role in the process of apoptosis following cytokine deprivation. However, the cells were no longer able to restore their growth potential despite the blockade of all signs of apoptotic death by the inhibitor. Therefore, the commitment to apoptosis following cytokine deprivation appears to precede activation of the caspase-like protease cascade. Synthetic peptide-based substrates for caspase-3/CPP32 (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; DEVD-MCA) and caspase-1/ICE (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; YVAD-MCA) were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Inhibitors for caspase/ICE family proteases (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-VAD) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp)) were synthesized as described previously (25Mashima T. Naito M. Kataoka S. Kawai H. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) or purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. The agonistic antibody (CH11) raised against human Fas was a kind gift from Dr. S. Yonehara (27Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum against recombinant human PARP was established by immunizing guinea pigs with the C-terminal 99-kDa fragment of the human PARP protein (28Ikejima M. Noguchi S. Yamashita R. Suzuki H. Sugimura T. Miwa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and it recognizes both the full-length (110 kDa) and the two apoptotic fragments (89 and 24 kDa) of both human and mouse PARP proteins. Murine IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 and 32D cell lines and IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells were used. The human T cell line Jurkat was used as a positive control in most experiments. IL-3-dependent lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 2 ng/ml of mouse IL-3 produced in silkworm cells (29Miyajima A. Schreurs J. Otsu K. Kondo A. Arai K. Maeda S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 58: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CTLL-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, recombinant mouse IL-2, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. To deplete cytokines, cells were washed twice with cytokine-free medium, and in several experiments appropriate concentrations of caspase-family inhibitors were added to the culture media. Proliferative potential and cell survival were determined by the MTT assay (30Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar) and the trypan blue dye exclusion assay (31Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2207-2212PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously. Growing or cytokine-depleted cells (1 × 106) were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (40,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C), and each cell lysate was then incubated with a 20 μm concentration of the fluorogenic substrate (YVAD-MCA or DEVD-MCA) in ICE buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 60 min at 37 °C. The 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released from the fluoropeptides was measured with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model F2000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Degradation of the endogenous apoptotic substrate (32Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar) PARP after cytokine withdrawal was analyzed by Western blotting. Control or cytokine-depleted cells (6 × 105) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 20 μl of 1 × Laemmli's sample buffer. Equal amounts of each sample were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham Corp.). PARP protein was then probed with anti-human PARP antiserum. The immune complex was visualized using ECL solution (Amersham). Low molecular weight chromosomal DNA was purified according to the protocol described elsewhere (5Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 105 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the nucleic acid fraction was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalchohol (25:24:1) twice followed by ethanol precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 μl of TE/RNase (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 μg/ml RNase A) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Equal amounts (10 μl) of each sample were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Ba/F3 cells were deprived of IL-3 in the presence of Z-VAD for 24 h. Then one half of the cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, and the other half were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and IL-3 was added. After a 16-h incubation with IL-3, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol. As a positive control, IL-3 was added to the cells deprived of IL-3 for 6 h and incubated for 16 h. As a negative control, Ba/F3 cells deprived of IL-3 for 24 h were fixed. All fixed cells were stained with PI/RNase solution (3.2 mm sodium citrate, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 500 ng/ml RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. After staining, cells were resuspended and analyzed by a FACScan. To examine whether caspase-like activity increases following cytokine deprivation in IL-3- and IL-2-dependent cell lines, we analyzed enzymatic activities of the caspase family proteases using fluorescent peptide substrates (YVAD-MCA and DEVD-MCA). Cell lysates from growing or cytokine-depleted cells were incubated with substrates, and increases in fluorescence due to enzymatic cleavage of the peptides were measured with a fluorometer. As a positive control, anti-Fas antibody-stimulated Jurkat cells were used, since Fas-induced apoptosis is known to require activation of caspase-family proteases (22Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 23Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In IL-3-dependent (Ba/F3 and 32D) and IL-2-dependent (CTLL-2) cells, withdrawal of the cytokine resulted in increases in 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin fluorescence, indicative of the activation of caspase-3/CPP32 (Fig. 1). Up-regulation of the caspase-3 activity was detected as soon as 5 h postdepletion and kept increasing up to 18–24 h in both cell lines. The caspase-3 activation in CTLL-2 cells was somehow slower than that in IL-3-dependent cell lines, consistent with the slower kinetics of cell death in CTLL-2 cells upon IL-2 deprivation (data not shown). The pattern of the caspase-3 activation was similar to that observed in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas antibody, CH11 (500 ng/ml). These results suggest that caspase-3 is activated in cytokine-dependent cells after cytokine withdrawal. We also tested caspase-1 activity in these cell lines using another substrate (YVAD-MCA). However, we did not detect any activity that reproducibly cleaved this substrate (see “Discussion”). The activation of caspase-3 during the apoptotic process after cytokine depletion might result in the proteolytic degradation of a cellular substrate for caspase-3. Since PARP is an endogenous caspase-3 substrate (32Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar), we examined PARP degradation in Ba/F3 cells by Western blotting analysis using anti-PARP polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2). In control Jurkat cells, stimulation with anti-Fas antibody yielded two apoptotic fragments (89 and 24 kDa), and the original 110-kDa protein decreased during the apoptotic process. Similarly, in IL-3-depleted Ba/F3 cells, the 110-kDa PARP gradually disappeared during the process of apoptosis, and levels of 89- and 24-kDa fragments increased. PARP breakdown was detectable from 6∼9 h post-depletion, and most of the 110-kDa PARP had disappeared at 24 h, suggesting that degradation of PARP follows the caspase-3 activation. To verify the generality of these observations, PARP degradation was examined in IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells, and we found that IL-2 deprivation also resulted in massive degradation of the PARP protein. The above results clearly indicated that caspase-3 is activated in response to cytokine deprivation. We next examined whether the activation of caspase-3 is required for the apoptotic process following cytokine depletion or if the proteolytic activity found in dying cell lysates is solely a consequence of dynamic changes in cellular conditions due to cell death. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cytokine-dependent cells were treated with several caspase family inhibitors (Z-VAD, Z-Asp, and YVAD) after cytokine removal. Upon IL-3 deprivation, most of the control Ba/F3 cells died; viability of the cells declined to less than 10% at 24 h after IL-3 deprivation. In contrast, the Z-VAD-treated cells were resistant to IL-3 deprivation, and the apparent viability of the cells was more than 80% at the same time point (Fig. 3), and nearly 50% of cells were still alive even after 3 days incubation without IL-3. The effect of Z-VAD was dose-dependent, and the effective concentration for death suppression was similar to that necessary to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in Fas-transfected Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 4 A). Another inhibitor, Z-Asp (25Mashima T. Naito M. Kataoka S. Kawai H. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), also suppressed apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, although to a lesser degree. To exclude the possibility that the effects of inhibitors observed in Ba/F3 cells were specific for this cell line, we repeated the same experiment using IL-3-dependent 32D cells as well as IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells (Fig. 4 B). Although the levels of inhibition in these cells were variable from cell to cell, results were fundamentally reproducible in both cell types. One inhibitor (YVAD) was less effective in inhibiting apoptosis than Z-VAD or Z-Asp in all cell lines tested. However, since YVAD inhibited the caspase-3 activity in vitro at high concentrations (data not shown), the inability of this inhibitor to suppress apoptosis was probably due to inefficient permeability through the cell membrane.Figure 4Dose dependence and the effects of various inhibitors of caspase/ICE-like proteases on apoptosis in cytokine-dependent cells. A, Ba/F3 cells were deprived of IL-3, and Z-VAD or Z-Asp at the indicated concentration was added. After 24 h, the viability was examined by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. B, cells were deprived of the required cytokine and incubated for 24 or 48 h in the presence of the peptide inhibitors (Z-VAD, 400 μg/ml; Z-Asp, 200 μg/ml; YVAD, 400 μg/ml). Viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The viability of control cells was ∼10% at 24 h and 0% at 48 h in both cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further characterized Ba/F3 cells of which survival is maintained by Z-VAD in the absence of IL-3. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Z-VAD blocked the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA, which is an early event of apoptosis, while YVAD did not. We also noted that condensation and fragmentation of nuclei were prevented by Z-VAD (data not shown). Furthermore, Z-VAD inhibited the activation of caspase-3 as well as the subsequent PARP breakdown (Fig. 5, B and C). Z-Asp also blocked PARP degradation to a lesser extent, correlated with its weak anti-apoptotic potential in Ba/F3 cells. These results indicate that inhibitors are able to block apoptosis at an early stage in the process. Since the morphology of surviving cells was apparently the same as that of normal cells, we examined whether the surviving cells are able to proliferate in response to readministration of IL-3. After appropriate incubation periods with Z-VAD (6, 12, and 24 h) in the absence of IL-3, Z-VAD was removed, and IL-3 was added back to the culture media. Thereafter, the proliferative potential of the cells was monitored by the MTT assay (Fig. 6). When the cells were treated with Z-VAD for 6 h, most cells proliferated in response to IL-3 in a manner similar to the control, while some cells lost the ability to grow after 12 h of incubation without IL-3 in the presence of Z-VAD. After 24 h, when 80% of the cells were still able to exclude trypan blue (Fig. 3), the cells were no longer able to respond to IL-3 readdition and eventually underwent apoptotic death. This indicated that although Z-VAD blocks all of the features of apoptotic death tested, including DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, PARP breakdown, and disintegration of the cell membrane, the cells undergo commitment to death if deprived of the appropriate cytokine for 24 h. Next, we analyzed cell cycle status to see whether cells are arrested in a particular cell cycle stage. As shown in Fig. 7, surviving cells after 24 h of depletion in the presence of Z-VAD are arrested in G1 (74.4%) as well as G2/M (16.7%), and few cells are found to be at S phase (8.9%). Readdition of IL-3 hardly promoted cells to enter S phase, indicating that cells surviving in the presence of Z-VAD for 24 h without IL-3 are no longer progressing to S phase by IL-3 readdition. Consistent with this result, IL-3 failed to induce c-Myc expression in these cells (data not shown).Figure 7Cell cycle analysis after IL-3 readdition. Ba/F3 cells were deprived of IL-3 in the presence of Z-VAD for 24 h (C), and then IL-3 was added back. Sixteen hours after the IL-3 addition, cells were stained with PI and analyzed by FACScan (D). As a positive control (A), Ba/F3 was depleted of IL-3 for 6 h, and the cell cycle was analyzed at 16 h after IL-3 readdition. Dshows the cells after 24 h of IL-3 deprivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then attempted to determine the time when cells irreversibly commit to die after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 8). In this experiment, the cells were first deprived of IL-3 for several hours as indicated in the Fig. 8, and then IL-3 or inhibitors (Z-VAD and Z-Asp) were added to the culture media. The cell viability after 24 h of incubation was then measured by the dye exclusion assay. The addition of both IL-3 and inhibitors before first ∼5 h of IL-3 deprivation effectively rescued the cells from apoptosis; while the recovery rate markedly declined from 8 through 12 h, suggesting that the cellular commitment to apoptosis occurs around this time. Growth-promoting or survival cytokines activate the signal transduction pathways responsible for cell survival (5Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In turn, withdrawal of these cytokines results in rapid inactivation of these pathways. Apoptosis following cytokine deprivation usually includes chromosomal DNA breakdown and fragmentation of the nucleus (1Allen P.D. Bustin S.A. Newland A.C. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Such characteristics are commonly observed in most other types of apoptosis in which various death proteins are involved (19Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 33Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A.

Nature. 1995; 373: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, apoptosis induced by cytokine depletion has been thought to take place simply by shutting down the survival signaling pathways upon cytokine removal, and its molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that cytokine withdrawal induces the activation of a death protease cascade. Determination of enzymatic activity of caspase-3/CPP32 using a fluorescent peptide substrate (DEVD-MCA) showed that caspase-3 was activated by cytokine depletion in both IL-3- and IL-2-dependent cell lines. In cells cultured with caspase family inhibitors (Z-VAD or Z-Asp), no activation or very little activation of caspase-3 was detected. In contrast, YVAD, which was not anti-apoptotic in Ba/F3 cells, was unable to block the activation of caspase-3 in this cell line. Furthermore, we found that PARP was degraded during the apoptotic process induced by cytokine deprivation (Fig. 2). We therefore conclude that the common death protease cascade is activated after cytokine deprivation. Enariet al. (22Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) reported that caspase-1/ICE-like activity (which cleaves YVAD-MCA) increased prior to the activation of caspase-3 upon Fas stimulation. We tested whether the caspase-1-like activity was up-regulated before caspase-3 activation. However, its activity in cytokine-dependent cells used in this study was hardly detectable or fluctuated markedly from assay to assay. 2T. Ohta, unpublished observations. Probably, other members of the caspase family proteases, such as TX/ICH-2 (caspase-4) (36Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan A.W. Blanchet A.M. Miossec C. Herve F. Collard-Dutilleul V. Gu Y. Aldape R.A.

It would be important to identify such protease that is activated before caspase-3 activation. Vasilakos et al. (26Vasilakos J.P. Ghayur T. Carroll R.T. Giegel D.A. Saunders J.M. Quintal L. Keane K.M. Shivers B.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3433-3442PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that the caspase-like protease is not involved in IL-2-deprivation-induced cell death. However, we observed caspase-3 activation and PARP degradation in CTLL-2 cells following IL-2 deprivation (Figs. 1 C and 2). In addition, treatment of CTLL-2 with the peptide inhibitors after IL-2 removal significantly inhibited apoptosis, extending our conclusion about IL-3-dependent cells to IL-2-dependent cells. The activation of caspase-3 appears to be indispensable for the apoptotic process, since the addition of membrane-permeable caspase family inhibitors to IL-3-deprived Ba/F3 cells markedly inhibited apoptosis. Moreover, other cell lines, IL-3-dependent 32D cells and IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells, were also rescued from apoptosis by the same inhibitors after cytokine deprivation, although the level of inhibition was less than that in Ba/F3 cells. These results indicate that caspase family proteases are critically involved in the process of apoptosis following cytokine deprivation. Kinetic analyses shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate that the activation of caspase-3 occurs after irreversible commitment to cell death. Even when the apparent viability of cells was maintained >80% (24 h postdepletion) by Z-VAD, readministration of IL-3 (simultaneous removal of Z-VAD) did not restore the proliferative capability and did not allow the progression from G1 to S phase (Fig. 7). Between 12 and 24 h after IL-3 removal, most of the cells lost their capability to respond to IL-3, suggesting that the commitment to death takes place during this period. As shown in Fig. 8, most of the cells irreversibly fell into crisis between 8 and 12 h after depletion. Since massive DNA fragmentation and subsequent loss of viability usually occur at around 16 and 24 h postdepletion, respectively (data not shown), the death process appears to proceed in the following order: death commitment, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, disintegration of cell structure, and finally total cell death. However, since apoptotic death induced by cytokine removal is likely to be dependent on cell cycle status, all cells may not synchronously go through the process. It will be interesting to examine how the first step in the activation of the caspase family cascade is triggered by cytokine deprivation. In the Fas/FasL system, the protein involved in Fas-signaling complex (FLICE) contains a caspase-like cysteine protease domain and is supposed to act as an initiator of the death protease cascade upon ligand receptor cross-linking (37Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). During the apoptotic process in cytokine-depleted cells, no such initiator of the protease cascade has been demonstrated. Since caspase family proteases are believed to preexist in the cell as inactive precursors even in the absence of an apoptotic signal (19Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that survival signals from cytokine receptors inhibit the activation of the protease cascade. However, caspase-1, an early protease activated upon death stimuli, has to be processed to be activated upon cytokine withdrawal. There must be an additional enzymatic cleavage step for initiation of the protease cascade that might be manifested by another protease or caspase-1 itself. It has been suggested that apoptosis triggered by cytokine depletion requires novel mRNA/protein synthesis (38Ishida Y. Agata Y. Shibahara K. Honjo T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar, 39Whetton A.D. Bazill G.W. Dexter T.M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An initiator protein for the death protease cascade is possibly induced upon cytokine deprivation, and its expression might be suppressed in the presence of appropriate cytokines. We thank Drs. N. Fujita, T. Mashima, and Y. Ito for helpful comments regarding this work. Also, we are grateful to Dr. S. Yonehara for providing the anti-Fas antibody and Dr. H. Kawai (Kirin Brewery Co.

Copper binding studies showed that this protein has four copper-binding sites per dimeric protein molecule with a dissociation constant of 0.46 microM and that in the presence of L-ascorbate, copper ions bind to a total of six binding sites with a great increase in affinity. Furthermore, we examined whether S100b protein can prevent copper-induced cell damage. Bovine S100b protein was found to suppress dose-dependently the hemolysis of mouse erythrocytes induced by CuCl2. We transformed Escherichia coli cells with pGEX-5X-3 vector containing a cDNA for rat S100b protein, so that this protein could be expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The transformed cells were demonstrated to be markedly resistant to a treatment with CuCl2 plus H2O2 as compared with the control cells expressing glutathione S-transferase alone. These results indicate that S100b protein does suppress oxidative cell damage by sequestering copper ions."

For mouse CD69, three putative N-glycan addition sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) exist within the extracellular region, accounting for the capacity to synthesize multiple CD69 glycoforms (3Ziegler S.

Human CD69 synthesis is somewhat enigmatic in that only one N-glycan addition sequence (Asn-Val-Thr) has been identified within the extracellular domain (1Lopez-Cabrera M. Santis A.G.

The molecular basis for human CD69 heterogeneity is unknown but has been proposed to result from qualititative heterogeneity in chain glycosylation, indicative of immature and mature oligosaccharides on CD69 species (2Testi R. Ambrosio D.D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Stem Cells (Dayton). 1994; 12: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Hamann et al. (14Hamann J. Fiebig H. Strauss M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4920-4927PubMed Google Scholar) argue against this idea, however, as CD69 polypeptides synthesizedin vitro in the presence of microsomes (in which immatureN-linked glycans predominate) existed as two glycoforms, indistinguishable from those made in intact cells. Thus, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of human CD69 glycoforms remain to be established (7Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Stem Cells (Dayton). 1994; 12: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The tripeptide sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr is widely recognized as the consensus motif for attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides to polypeptides (16Marshall R.D. Biochem. Soc.

However, early studies by Bause and Legler (21Bause E. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) showed that oligosaccharyl transferase can also transfer N-linked glycans to peptides having the atypical sequence Asn-X-Cys. To date, only three proteins have been demonstrated to contain N-linked glycans attached via atypical Asn-X-Cys motifs: human plasma protein C, bovine plasma protein C, and human von Willebrand factor (22Stenflo J.

Interestingly, an atypical glycosylation motif exists within the extracellular domain of human CD69 that is similar to those previously identified (see Table I). In the current study we examined the hypothesis that two N-glycan addition sites exist on human CD69 molecules by determining the importance of Asn residues contained within typical and atypical glycosylation sites in CD69 heterogeneity. These data establish that multiple dimeric forms of human CD69 result from the differential post-translational modification of CD69 polypeptides with 1–2 N-linked glycan chains at typical (Asn-X-Ser/Thr and atypical (Asn-X-Cys) glycosylation motifs.Table IAtypical Asn-X-Cys glycosylation sites on polypeptidesSequenceProteinReference No.Asn-Ser-Cys-Ala-Pro-AlaHuman von Willebrand factor24Titani K.

COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 atmosphere and were passaged by trypsinization every 5 days (27Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling and surface-biotin labeling were performed as described previously (28Balow J.P. Kearse K.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 189: 251-258Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by solubilization in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm iodoacetamide, plus protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation, and supernatants were removed and transferred to new tubes. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were mixed with anti-human CD69 mAb (FN50) (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed 3 times in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 wash buffer and 1 time in phosphate-buffered saline. Digestion ofN-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) was performed as previously reported (29Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).N-glycosidase F digestion was performed using aN-glycosidase F digestion kit (Glyko Inc., Novato, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. One-dimensional and two-dimensional nonreducing × reducing gel electophoresis was carried out according to previously published methods (29Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), except that a 10% acrylamide gel was used in the first dimension and a 13% acrylamide gel was used in the second dimension. For detection of surface biotin-labeled proteins, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose (Immobilon P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and visualized by chemiluminescence performed according to manufacturer instructions (Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent; NEN Life Science Products). Cell surface staining of CD69 proteins was performed by incubating cells with primary anti-human CD69 mAb (FN50; Pharmingen) and, after washing, with secondary goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pharmingen). Cells were analyzed on FACSSCAN and FACSSTAR flow cytometers (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). All fluorescence data were collected using logarithmic amplification on 50,000 viable cells as determined by forward light scatter intensity or propidium iodide exclusion. cDNA encoding human CD69 was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from interleukin 2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes using the 5′ oligonucleotide primer GCTAAGCTTAAGATGAGCTCTGAAAATTGT and the 3′ primer GCTGGATCCTTATTATTTGTAAGGTTTGTTACATATCCA. (These primers added a HindIII and BamHI enzyme restriction site to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the CD69 cDNA, respectively.) The polymerase chain reaction product was then cloned directly into pCRTMII with an Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) TA cloning kit. The insert encoding CD69 was removed by enzymatic digestion with HindIII and BamHI enzymes and subcloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the selection primer CGACCTCGAGGGGGGGCCCAGATCTCAGCTTTTGTTCCC (conversion of aKpnI site to a BglII site) and the following mutagenic primers: AsnA → Lys(NA → K), GGACTTCAGCCCAAAAGGCTTGTTCTGAACATGG; AsnT → Ile (NT → I), GGCAAAGAATTTAACAACTGGTTCATCGTTACAGGGTCTGAC; AsnA → Lys + AsnT → Ile, both of the mutant primers given above; AsnControl → Lys, GACAAGTGTGTTTTTCTGAAAAAGACAGAGGTCAGCAGC; CysA → Ser (CA → S), GGACTTCAGCCCAAAATGCTAGTTCTGAACATGGTGC. CD69 mutations were verified by sequencing BglII-sensitive mutant plasmids using the dideoxy chain termination procedure performed according to manufacturer instructions (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). CD69 transcription was done by linearization of CD69 plasmids with BamHI restriction enzyme; CD69 RNA was transcribed from each of the plasmids using the T3 RiboMaxTM large scale production system (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by two rounds of extraction, first with Tris-EDTA-saturated phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and then with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Extracted RNA was precipitated with sodium acetate and isopropanol and resuspended in nuclease-free water. Translation of CD69 RNA was done with the FlexiTM rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine for 60 min at 30 °C. Translation reactions were terminated by the addition of stop buffer (0.75m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA) and layered onto 0.5 m sucrose containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 10 mmEDTA. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatants were removed, and translation products were resuspended in 3 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer or digested with Endo H as previously detailed (29Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 107 COS-7 cells were transfected with 15 μg of CD69 cDNA by electroporation at 200 V and 960 microfarads using a Biotechologies and Experimental Research Transfector 300 (Biotechologies and Experimental Research, San Diego, CA). 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonidet P-40 lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD69 mAb and analyzed on 13% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Initially, surface expression of CD69 was examined on Jurkat T cells cultured in the presence of PMA. In agreement with previous reports, surface density of CD69 increased rapidly within hours of PMA addition (Fig. 1 A), which was verified by biochemical studies on surface-labeled proteins (Fig. 1 B). As demonstrated, two CD69 species existed on PMA-stimulated Jurkat cells: a 28-kDa chain and a 32-kDa chain (Fig. 1 B) previously shown to represent differentially glycosylated CD69 polypeptides (12Lanier L. Buck D.W. Rhodes L. Ding A. Evans E. Barney C. Phillips J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1572-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). CD69 glycoforms have been proposed to result from differential processing of CD69 glycoproteins by Golgi maturation enzymes, resulting in the presence of immature and mature oligosaccharides on 28- and 32-kDa species, respectively (2Testi R. Ambrosio D.D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Stem Cells (Dayton). 1994; 12: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar); however, the maturation status of surface CD69 glycoforms has not been rigorously evaluated (12Lanier L. Buck D.W. Rhodes L. Ding A. Evans E. Barney C. Phillips J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1572-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Sanchez-Mateos P. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Glycosidase digestion studies were performed on CD69 precipitates of surface-labeled PMA-stimulated T cells using Endo H, which is specific for immature N-glycan chains, and peptideN-glycosidase F, which cleaves both immature and matureN-linked glycans (31Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, both forms of surface CD69 were succeptible to N-glycosidase F treatment but were completely resistant to Endo H digestion (Fig. 2, left side). The effectiveness of Endo H in these studies was verified by parallel digests of T cell receptor alpha-glycoproteins from murine BW thymoma lysates (Fig. 2, right side), which are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of this cell type (29Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, in agreement with previous studies (12Lanier L. Buck D.W. Rhodes L. Ding A. Evans E. Barney C. Phillips J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1572-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Sanchez-Mateos P. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that 28- and 32-kDa CD69 species represent CD69 proteins that are differentially modified by N-linked glycan chains. Importantly, these data show that surface CD69 glycoforms expressed on PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells contain exclusively mature, Endo H-resistant N-linked glycan chains. Next, metabolic labeling studies were performed to examine the biosynthesis of CD69 proteins at time intervals when most CD69 proteins should exist within the ER and contain only immature glycan chains. As shown in Fig. 3 A, CD69 proteins synthesized during a short 5-min pulse period existed in two glycoforms (CD69 A and B), both of which contained immature glycans as indicated by their sensitivity to Endo H digestion (Fig. 3 A; CD69Aimmature and B immature). In agreement with our findings in Fig. 2 A on surface-labeled CD69, metabolically labeled CD69 glycoforms were both processed to mature, Endo H-resistant species by the conclusion of a 60-min chase period (Fig. 3 A). To confirm that CD69 heterogeneity does not involve maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi complex, CD69 proteins were synthesized in the presence of the Golgi mannosidase inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin (32Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As is evident, CD69 glycoforms persisted in deoxymannojirimycin-treated groups under conditions where conversion of immature, high mannose glycans to mature, complex type oligosaccharides was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these data show that CD69 glycoforms exist coincident with the synthesis and translocation of CD69 polypeptides into the ER and occur independently of processing by Golgi maturation enzymes. These results strongly suggest that CD69 heterogeneity results from quantitative differences in the number ofN-linked glycans added to the polypeptide backbone and not from qualitative differences in oligosaccharide processing as previously proposed (2Testi R. Ambrosio D.D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R.

Note that CD69 glycoforms do not reflect differential removal of glucose residues from nascent glycan chains by ER glucosidase enzymes as the mobility of both CD69 species was retarded following treatment with the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine (32Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). To determine the efficiency of assembly of newly synthesized CD69 glycoproteins into disulfide-linked dimers, immunoprecipitates of metabolically labeled lysates were analyzed on two-dimensional nonreducing × reducing gels. As shown in Fig. 4, most CD69 proteins synthesized during a 10-min pulse period existed in the low molecular weight B glycoform (approximately 73%), with the remaining CD69 proteins present in the A glycoform (Fig. 4, left lane); approximately 54% of newly synthesized CD69 was assembled into BB homodimers, 40% into AB heterodimers, and 6% into AA homodimers (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the random assembly of CD69 glycoforms into disulfide-linked homodimers and heterodimers and are similar to the proportion of CD69 dimers expressed on the cell surface (Ref. 12Lanier L. Buck D.W. Rhodes L. Ding A. Evans E. Barney C. Phillips J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1572-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and data not shown). In addition, these data show that CD69 rapidly disulfide-links to itself in the ER as few, if any, newly synthesized CD69 proteins migrated as monomeric proteins on the diagonal (Fig. 4). Careful examination of the amino acid sequence of human CD69 (1Lopez-Cabrera M. Santis A.G. Fernandez-Ruiz E. Blacher R. Esch F. Sanchez-Mateos P. Sancho-Madrid F. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) shows that two potentialN-linked glycan addition sequences exist within the extracellular domain: the previously identified consensus glycosylation motif Asn-Val-Thr (NVT) at positions 166–168 and the atypical Cys-containing glycosylation motif Asn-Ala-Cys (NAC) at positions 111–113 (Fig. 5). As noted, glycosylation of Asn-X-Cys sequences has been described for at least three other proteins (Table I). To determine the importance of specific amino acid residues in CD69 heterogeneity, site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed to create mutant CD69 proteins lacking Asn residues within the atypical site (AsnA → Lys), the typical site (AsnT → Ile), or both (AsnA → Lys + AsnT → Ile) (Fig. 5). In agreement with previous results, WT CD69 proteins translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes showed similar heterogeneity as CD69 synthesized in intact cells (Ref. 14Hamann J. Fiebig H. Strauss M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4920-4927PubMed Google Scholar and this study) with both CD69 A and B glycoforms present (Fig. 6 A). Synthesis of the higher molecular weight A glycoform was completely abolished by mutation of Asn residues within the atypical motif (AsnA → Lys) (Fig. 6 A), demonstrating that Asn residues within this site do indeed contribute to CD69 heterogeneity. Consistent with the idea that two sites for N-linked oligosaccharide addition exist within the CD69 extracellular domain, glycosylated CD69 products (B glycoform) were present in AsnT → Ile groups lacking Asn residues within the typical motif (Fig. 6 A). As expected, mutant CD69 proteins in which both Asn residues were deleted (AsnA → Lys + AsnT → Ile) showed no evidence of glycosylation and migrated coincident with glycosidase-digested CD69 proteins (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly, all CD69 proteins synthesized in WT groups were modified by carbohydrate addition (Figs. 6, Aand B), whereas nonglycosylated CD69 proteins were present in AsnA → Lys and especially AsnT → Ile groups (Fig. 6 A) (see below). These results were specific in that synthesis of CD69 glycoforms was unaffected by mutation of Asn residues localized within an unrelated tripeptide motif, Asn-Thr-Gln (AsnControl → Lys, Fig. 5) (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these data show that Asn residues within both typical and atypical glycosylation motifs contribute to the synthesis of CD69 glycoforms, providing a molecular basis for human CD69 heterogeneity. These data are consistent with the modification of CD69 polypeptides with 1–2 oligosaccharide chains in the ER attached to Asn residues localized with typical (NVT) and atypical (NAC) glycosylation motifs.Figure 6In vitro translation of WT and variant CD69 proteins.

To investigate these possibilities, mutant CD69 proteins were created in which the atypical Asn-X-Cys motif was replaced by a typical Asn-X-Ser motif generated by a cysteine-to-serine conversion (Fig. 5, CysA → Ser). As demonstrated, such CD69 proteins were exclusively modified to the A glycoform containing two N-glycan chains (Fig. 6 B, right side). These results indicate that glycosylation of CD69 polypeptides is primarily regulated by amino acid identity two positions distal to Asn, with Ser/Thr-containing sequences more efficiently modified than those containing Cys residues. Finally, to verify that synthesis of CD69 glycoforms occurred similarly in intact cells, CD69 cDNAs were transfected into COS cells, and biosynthesis of CD69 glycoforms was examined by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, wild-type CD69 proteins were synthesized as A and B glycoforms in COS cells (Fig. 7), data which are in agreement with previous findings that post-translational modification of CD69 is not cell-type specific (7Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Stem Cells (Dayton). 1994; 12: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 14Hamann J. Fiebig H. Strauss M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4920-4927PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these data show that mutation of Asn residues within atypical (AsnA → Lys) or typical (AsnT → Ile) CD69 glycosylation motifs completely extinguished synthesis of CD69 A glycoforms in COS cells (Fig. 7), corroborating our results on CD69 synthesis in cell-free translation systems (Figs. 6, A andB). Similarly, CD69 variants lacking Asn residues at both sites (AsnA → Lys + AsnT → Ile) were not modified by carbohydrate addition in COS cells (Fig. 7), and synthesis of CD69 glycoforms was similar in WT and control (AsnControl → Lys) groups (Fig. 7). As previously observed in our in vitro studies, glycosylation of CD69 AsnA → Lys proteins was more efficient than in CD69 AsnT → Ile proteins, with significant amounts of nonglycosylated proteins present in CD69 AsnT → Ile groups (Fig. 7). Interestingly, however, unlike in vitrotranslated AsnA → Lys proteins, the vast majority of AsnA → Lys proteins made in COS cells were modified by carbohydrate addition (Fig. 7). Although the significance of this latter difference is unknown, it is likely that these results reflect more efficient cotranslational modification of CD69 AsnA→ Lys proteins in COS cells relative to cell-free systems using microsomes. In conclusion, these studies show that two sites forN-glycan attachment exist within the extracellular domain of human CD69, both of which may be utilized for N-glycan addition and demonstrate that variable modification of typical and atypical glycosylation motifs represents the molecular basis for CD69 glycoform biosynthesis. In summary, the current study provides a molecular basis for human CD69 heterogeneity by documenting that human CD69 polypeptides contain two sites for attachment of N-linked glycans within their extracellular domain that are variably utilized during CD69 biosynthesis. To our knowledge, CD69 represents only the fourth protein known to contain N-glycans attached to atypical Asn-X-Cys sites. Interestingly, unlike human CD69, which contains a single atypical glycosylation motif, the human von Willebrand factor protein contains eight occurrences of the Asn-X-Cys sequence, only one of which is modified byN-glycan addition (24Titani K. Kumar S. Takio K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.D. Ashida K. Walsh K.A. Chopek M.W. Sadler J.E. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3171-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Multiple factors within the ER environment have been suggested to influence the usage of glycosylation motifs on polypeptides, including protein folding constraints, translation rate, and the amount of time a protein spends within the ER (23Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11397-11404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Holst B.A. Bruun A.W. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our studies on CD69 biosynthesis indicate that modification of CD69 proteins at atypical glycosylation motifs is regulated primarily at the level of amino acid identity, although the contribution of Cys versus Ser residues to polypeptide folding was not directly addressed in these experiments. Determining the circumstances that promote or disfavor the modification of atypical Cys-containing glycosylation sequences on CD69 polypeptides should provide valuable information regarding the quality control mechanisms that regulate their utilization during polypeptide synthesis. As described in the current report, variable glycosylation of CD69 polypeptides at atypical and typical motifs represents the molecular mechanism by which multiple dimeric forms of human CD69 molecules are generated. Indeed, several forms of CD69 dimers may exist, including CD69 AA homodimers, AB heterodimers, and BB homodimers (Fig. 8). Moreover, because oligosaccharide chains on monoglycosylated CD69 proteins can be attached to either typical or atypical glycosylation sequences, further heterogeneity among CD69 B glycoforms is possible (Fig. 8). Our data indicate that most monoglycosylated CD69 proteins (B glycoform) utilize the typical site for N-glycan addition, as nonglycosylated proteins were consistently synthesized in CD69 AsnT → Ile groups lacking functional typical motifs. Importantly, the data in the current study provide a corrected model for the molecular basis of human CD69 heterogeneity by showing that CD69 glycoforms do not represent qualitative heterogeneity due to differential processing of a single glycosylation site as previously proposed (2Testi R. Ambrosio D.D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32457-32463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but rather result from quantitative differences in the number of N-glycans that are added to CD69 polypeptides during their synthesis (Fig. 8). Indeed, the results in this study document that two sites forN-glycan attachment exist within the human CD69 extracellular domain and identify the second, cryptic site as the atypical glycosylation sequence, Asn-Ala-Cys. Concerning the potential role of glycosylation in CD69 structure and function, it is interesting that multiple glycosylated CD69 species are observed in both murine and human species (3Ziegler S. Ramsdell F. Hjerrild K.A. Armitage R.J. Grabstein K.H. Hennen K.B. Farrah T. Fanslow W.C. Shevach E.M. Anderson M.R. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 369-376PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to mouse CD69, N-glycan addition sequences of human CD69 are localized within the lectin-binding portion of the extracellular domain (3Ziegler S. Ramsdell F. Hjerrild K.A. Armitage R.J. Grabstein K.H. Hennen K.B. Farrah T. Fanslow W.C. Shevach E.M. Anderson M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Conceivably, N-linked oligosaccharides could influence the recognition of as yet undetermined ligands by CD69 and the delivery of activation signals to the interior of the cell. Interestingly, two other members of the NK gene complex family of proteins, NKR-P1 and NKG2, contain similarly situated N-linked glycans within their carbohydrate-binding domains (2Testi R. Ambrosio D.D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 34Houchins J.P. Yabe T. McSherry C. Bach F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and NKG2 has atypical Asn-X-Cys glycosylation sequences localized within this region (34Houchins J.P. Yabe T. McSherry C. Bach F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), although the extent of their usage is unknown. Finally, surface expression of human CD69 appears to be decreased following treatment with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (30Sanchez-Mateos P. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that N-glycans are important for the effective assembly and intracellular transport of CD69 molecules. However, because tunicamycin treatment would affect glycosylation of both typical and atypical sites on CD69 as well as glycosylation of numerous other cellular proteins, further studies are needed to fully define the role of N-linked glycosylation in CD69 assembly and expression. Experiments designed to address these issues are currently ongoing in the laboratory. We thank Drs. Richard Hodes and Jeroen Van Leeuwen for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2049543473,"The valanimycin producer Streptomyces viridifaciens contains a two-component enzyme system that catalyzes the oxidation of isobutylamine to isobutylhydroxylamine. One component of this enzyme system is isobutylamine hydroxylase, and the other component is a flavin reductase. The gene (vlmR) encoding the flavin reductase required by isobutylamine hydroxylase has been cloned from S. viridifaciens by chromosome walking. The gene codes for a protein of 194 amino acids with a calculated mass of 21,265 Da and a calculated pI of 10.2. Overexpression of thevlmR gene in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal His-tag derivative yielded a soluble protein that was purified to homogeneity. Removal of the N-terminal His-tag from the overexpressed protein by thrombin cleavage also produced a soluble protein. Both forms of the protein exhibited a high degree of flavin reductase activity, and the thrombin-cleaved form functioned in combination with isobutylamine hydroxylase to catalyze the conversion of isobutylamine to isobutylhydroxylamine. Kinetic data indicate that the overexpressed protein utilizes FAD and NADPH in preference to FMN, riboflavin, and NADH. The deduced amino acid sequence of the VlmR protein exhibited similarity to several other flavin reductases that may constitute a new family of flavin reductases."

RNA polymerases on these nucleosomal templates could extend their 15- or 35-nucleotide nascent RNAs by only about 10 nucleotides in 15 min, even in the presence of elongation factors TFIIF and SII. Efficient transcript elongation did occur upon dissociation of nucleosomes with 1% sarkosyl, indicating that the RNA polymerases were not damaged by the high salt reconstitution procedure. Since the elongation complexes were released by sarkosyl but not by SII, these complexes apparently did not enter the arrested conformation when they encountered nucleosomes. Surprisingly, elongation was no more efficient on nucleosomal templates reconstituted only with H3/H4 tetramers, even in the presence of elongation factors and/or competitor DNA at high concentration.

Despite the apparently tight packaging of transcriptionally active DNA in nucleosomes (see Ref. 2Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar and references therein), RNA polymerase II achieves high rates (25 nucleotides/s) of RNA chain elongation in the cell (3Ucker D.S.

However, attempts to elongate RNA polymerase II transcripts in vitrousing reconstituted chromatin templates have not reproduced efficient chain elongation (Refs. 5Izban M.G. Luse D.S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A number of reasons can be envisioned for this failure. It is known, for example, that nucleosomes from transcriptionally active regions have highly acetylated histones (recently reviewed in Refs. 8Sternglanz R. Trends Biochem.

Rhodes D. Nature. 1983; 301: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several molecular complexes have recently been described that can, in the presence of ATP, modify nucleosomes so that their DNA is more accessible for transcription factor binding (11Côté J.

It is conceivable that these chromatin remodeling activities might act within transcribed regions, making DNA within the gene body more accessible to RNA polymerase (7Brown S.A. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, transcription of mononucleosomal templates by SP6 RNA polymerase has been shown to be accompanied by displacement of the nucleosome (17Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G.

In this case, as the nucleosomal DNA is acquired by the leading edge of the advancing RNA polymerase, the octamer is exchanged onto a segment of free DNA, resulting in a transfer of the nucleosome away from its original location. Thus, efficient traversal of nucleosomal templates by RNA polymerase II in vitro could require free DNA molecules onto which nucleosomes could be exchanged. Investigations of elongation on chromatin templates by RNA polymerase II are limited by the fact that assembly of nucleosomes on the promoter blocks initiation (23Knezetic J.A. Luse D.S.

Thus, either a nucleosome-free promoter must be ligated onto a preformed nucleosomal array (24Lorch Y. LaPointe J.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1987; 49: 203-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) or elongation complexes must be obtained before loading nucleosomes on the DNA (25Workman J.L. Roeder R.G.

We had previously studied transcript elongation on chromatin templates assembled using Xenopus oocyte extracts and RNA polymerase II ternary complexes paused early in elongation (i.e. within 20 bases of transcription start (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This approach had the advantage of allowing chromatin assembly under transcription conditions, preserving the activity of the polymerase II elongation complex. However, substitution of other histones for those provided by the Xenopus extract is difficult, and the extended incubations required in the crude oocyte extract might allow the action of chromatin remodeling activities. Therefore, for the current work we decided to attempt chromatin reconstitution using only pure histones and purified transcript elongation complexes. We developed a modification of the standard high salt dialysis nucleosome reconstitution procedure that allowed us to assemble nucleosomes without cellular extracts while retaining activity of the transcription complex. We found that nucleosomes assembled in this way are completely inhibitory to transcript elongation, even in the presence of elongation factors and/or excess competitor DNA. Surprisingly, even H3/H4 tetramers serve as an essentially complete barrier to RNA polymerase under these conditions. Nuclear pellets obtained during the preparation of nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

These histones (10 mg, using an A 230 of 4.2 as 1 mg/ml; see Ref. 31Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were then applied to a Mono S column (Pharmacia) and eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a discontinuous NaCl gradient in 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8. The NaCl concentration was increased from 0.5 to 0.88 m over 20 min, followed by a wash with 0.88 m NaCl for another 20 min and a 1-h salt gradient from 0.88 to 2 m NaCl. Histone H1 eluted at 1.06 m NaCl, histones H2A/H2B at 1.15m, and histones H3/H4 at 1.26 m NaCl, respectively. The H2A/H2B and H3/H4 fractions (200–500 ng/μl) were stored at −70 °C. Elongation complexes were assembled and purified as described previously (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes were obtained by incubation of HeLa nuclear extracts with circular pML5–4NR (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) plasmid templates, which contain the adenovirus major late promoter. After gel filtration to remove residual NTPs, RNA polymerases were advanced to downstream locations (either +15 or +35) by incubation with an appropriate subset of NTPs. These NTPs were removed, and the transcription complexes were further purified by the addition of sarkosyl and a second round of gel filtration. The final transcription complex preparation typically contained 8 ng/μl of template DNA. For all of the studies reported here, the elongation complexes were assayed for transcriptional activity immediately after the second gel filtration step and were kept overnight at 4 °C until the assay was completed. Complexes that retained activity were assembled into chromatin at room temperature by mixing the elongation complexes with Mono S-purified histones (either H3/H4 tetramers and H2A/H2B dimers or H3/H4 tetramers alone) at histone:DNA ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2, for all four histones, or from 0.25 to 1 for H3/H4 only (see the figure legends), along with sufficient NaCl to bring the final NaCl concentration to 1 m. The reconstitution mixture was immediately diluted to 666 mm with TE buffer (1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 15 min, NaCl was diluted with TE to 466 mm, and after a further 15 min, the samples were dialyzed against 1 liter of MEM buffer (62.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 mm Tris, pH 7.9) for 30 min. Final DNA concentration in the dialyzed chromatin preparations was about 3 ng/μl. As controls, elongation complexes were processed through the reconstitution procedure with bovine serum albumin used in place of histones at a protein:DNA ratio of 1. To measure the extent of reconstitution, aliquots of the chromatin preparations were relaxed with topoisomerase I. One-fifth volume of 5 × topoisomerase buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added to 150 μl of chromatin along with 1 μl (14 units) of topoisomerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, DNA samples were purified by treatment with proteinase K and SDS, extraction with phenol-CHCl3, and ethanol precipitation; the supercoiled DNAs were resolved on 1.75% agarose gels. TFIIF was prepared from recombinant RAP30 and RAP74 subunits expressed in bacteria as described (32Wang B.Q. Kostrub C.F. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Wang B.Q. Lei L. Burton Z.F.

Finkelstein and Z. Burton, unpublished procedure. and was the gift of Drs. Finkelstein and Burton. Transcripts were extended by adding 8 mmMgCl2 and all four NTPs at 1 mm, with or without the addition of 1.5 ng/μl TFIIF and 1.5 ng/μl SII; reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 min, on nonreconstituted control templates, or for 15 min on chromatin templates. Superhelical pUC18 or HaeIII-digested pUC18 fragments were added at a 5-fold excess over the pML5–4NR template in experiments using competitor DNA. RNAs were purified and resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) as described previously (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Chromatin templates or mock-reconstituted controls (400 μl, containing about 1500 ng of DNA) were brought to 8 mmMgCl2; HindIII (80 units) and RNasin (20 units) were added and the mixture was incubated for 8 min at 37 °C. DNAs were recovered, further digested by EcoRI, and then analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Earlier work from this laboratory using RNA polymerase II and chromatin templates had relied on oocyte extracts as the source of histones and chromatin reconstitution factors (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study templates with modified histones or subsets of the core histones, as well as to avoid the possible introduction of chromatin remodeling factors from extracts, we decided to assemble transcriptionally active chromatin templates using only pure core histones and purified transcription complexes. Histones were prepared from HeLa cell nuclei by acid extraction followed by separation into H2A/H2B and H3/H4 fractions on a Mono S column, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The essentially complete separation of each histone pair from the other core histones, histone H1, and other acid-extractable proteins is illustrated by the gel in Fig. 1 A. Reconstitution of chromatin with purified histones may be accomplished by mixing histones and DNA at 1 m NaCl, followed by gradual reduction of salt to less than 100 mmby dialysis (35Stein A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This approach was not useful in our case, however, since we wished to assemble nucleosomes on RNA polymerase II transcription complexes. Polymerase II will elongate RNA chains in NaCl concentrations as high as 2 m (36Cai H. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 298-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but RNA polymerase II complexes will not survive hours of exposure to high salt. 3C.-H. Chang and D. S. Luse, unpublished results. We therefore developed a modified high salt assembly method, which minimizes the time in which components are exposed to NaCl concentrations greater than 0.5m (see “Experimental Procedures”). This procedure, which requires only 1 h, results in assembly of nucleosomes using either all four core histones or only H3 and H4. The RNA polymerase remains fully active after this procedure (see Fig. 2). The short reconstitution time did require higher levels of input histones than in the extended dialysis procedure. To obtain complete reconstitution (i.e. about 1 nucleosome/200 bp of DNA), we needed either 2 μg of core histones (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) or 1 μg of histones H3 and H4 (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) per μg of DNA, about twice the amount of histone needed with extended dialysis times. Correspondingly lower reconstitution levels were obtained with 0.75 or 0.5 times the amounts of core histones or histones H3 and H4 needed for full reconstitution (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and3 and lanes 5 and 6). It is important to note that the DNA topology assay reveals the number of nucleosomes on the DNA but not their location. We will return below to the question of the spacing of the assembled nucleosomes. RNA polymerase II elongation complexes stalled at either +15 or +35 downstream of the adenovirus major late promoter were prepared with gel-filtered preinitiation complexes and appropriate subsets of the nucleoside triphosphates. These complexes were then purified by transient exposure to sarkosyl during a second round of gel filtration (“sarkosyl rinsing”) as described previously (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified transcription complexes were then assembled into chromatin using the high salt method discussed above. Control complexes were subjected to the reconstitution procedure but without the addition of histones. The 15- and 35-base RNAs in the initial stalled complexes are shown in lane 1,left and right panels, of Fig. 2. RNA polymerase II remains active after exposure to the reconstitution procedure in the absence of histones, as shown in lane 8 in bothpanels. On this template, there are four prominent arrest sites located approximately 195, 380, 565, and 750 nucleotides downstream of transcription start (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); these are indicated bydots to the right of each panel. When saturating levels of SII and TFIIF were added to chases of the mock reconstitutions, arrest was essentially abolished, and the expected elongation rate of 20–25 nucleotides/s (6Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was achieved (lane 9 of both panels). However, on the chromatin templates reconstituted with one nucleosome/200 bp, RNA polymerase II was unable to extend nascent RNAs by more than a few bases in a 15-min reaction, even at saturating concentrations of TFIIF and SII (lanes 2and 3 of each panel). Somewhat surprisingly, the use of underreconstituted chromatin templates did not result in a substantial improvement in the elongation efficiency (lanes 5 and 6 of each panel). Since the results inpanels A and B were the same, failure of transcription was not dependent on choice of stalling site for the ternary transcription complex. The failure of transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II on the chromatin templates was not simply the result of inactivation, for example by a contaminant in the histone preparation, because the addition of 1% sarkosyl to the chromatin transcription reactions (which will strip nucleosomes from the DNA template) allowed transcription to proceed (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 7,left and right panels). In the presence of sarkosyl, transcription occurred with equal levels of pausing at each arrest site, at the rate expected from earlier work on transcription of this template as pure DNA (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that resumption of transcription on the chromatin templates is not facilitated by SII but is essentially dependent on sarkosyl. This indicates that the RNA polymerases did not fall into a state of transcriptional arrest when they encountered the initial nucleosome on the chromatin template. We repeated the experiment in Fig. 2 using either H3/H4 tetramers or the complete histone octamer as control. In this case, all transcription complexes were stalled at +15 prior to chromatin assembly. As in Fig. 2, the complexes were fully active after mock reconstitution (Fig. 3, lane 20) but completely blocked on templates fully (lanes 2 and3) or partially (lanes 5, 6,8, and 9) assembled with histone octamers. Very similar results were obtained with the H3/H4 tetramers. Transcript elongation could not continue on templates fully (lane 11) or partially (lane 14) assembled with tetramers; a very low level of elongation was seen in 15 min on the least reconstituted samples (lane 17). There was essentially no effect of elongation factors in these reactions (compare lanes 12,15, and 18 with lanes 11,14, and 17). The blocked RNA polymerases were released by sarkosyl (lanes 13, 16, and19), again indicating that polymerases on the assembled templates were active but not in an arrested state. We next challenged fully reconstituted templates bearing either histone octamers or H3/H4 tetramers with free DNA to test the possibility that providing an acceptor for nucleosome transfer might facilitate elongation on the chromatin templates. A 5-fold excess of either superhelical pUC18 or pUC18 restriction fragments was used as potential acceptor. The elongation activity of RNA polymerase II on mock-reconstituted templates, with or without elongation factors, was not influenced by the large excess of DNA (Fig. 4, lanes 18–21). Elongation on templates assembled with histone octamers was apparently identical with or without the addition of pUC18 DNA (lanes 2–7). The addition of pUC18 DNA, particularly in the circular form, had a very slight effect on templates with the H3/H4 tetramer (lanes 11–14); however, the resulting elongation activity was very low compared with either the sarkosyl control (lane 15) or the 1-min elongation on the naked, mock-reconstituted template (lanes 18–21). The stronger effect of the superhelical pUC18 fragments (lanes 11 and 12 versus lanes 13 and14) may have resulted from the higher binding preference of nucleosome to superhelical DNA, compared with the relaxed form (37Pfaffle P. Jackson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16821-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Patterton H.G. von Holt C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 623-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We did not detect any bulk loss of nucleosomes from the template plasmid as a result of the incubation with competitor DNA (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that the very modest stimulation of elongation on the tetramer templates did result from transcription-driven nucleosome displacement. We were somewhat surprised that even partially reconstituted templates, using either the histone octamer or the H3/H4 tetramer, provided nearly a complete block to elongation. This could be explained if nucleosome assembly begins directly adjacent to the transcription complex; in this case, there would always be an extensive nucleosome array downstream of the RNA polymerase, even if relatively few nucleosomes are reconstituted. This idea is based on the known tendency of nucleosomes to assemble in close packed groups when the decreasing salt assembly method is used (39Rhodes D. Laskey R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To investigate the location of nucleosomes on our reconstituted templates, we used the accessibility of restriction sites as a probe. FourHindIII sites are located at +235, +420, +605, and +790 relative to transcription start site on the pML5–4NR plasmid. We could thus assay for the presence of a nucleosome directly adjacent to the stalled RNA polymerases by cleaving the assembled templates withHindIII, releasing the blocked polymerases with sarkosyl, and observing the level of 235 base run-off RNA produced. The absence of any run-off RNA would indicate that the HindIII site was always protected; i.e. a nucleosome was always present on the site to block cleavage. Unfortunately, such a negative result could also occur for trivial reasons, such as the inability of theHindIII to cut in the linker between nucleosomes. In this context, it is important to recall that only a small percentage of templates are expected to be transcriptionally active in our experiments (40Linn S.C. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1508-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, if the distribution of nucleosomes on the bulk DNA were random, HindIII would cleave at +235 on a portion of the reconstituted plasmids. This fraction can be predicted from the known number of nucleosomes assembled and the assumption that cleavage can take place anywhere except within the roughly 150 bp of DNA in each nucleosome core particle. The ability of HindIII to cleave at +235, as opposed to its other sites, can be determined by purifying the HindIII-cleaved DNA and cutting it to completion withEcoRI, which has a unique cleavage site in pML-4NR.EcoRI cleavage gives a 416-bp DNA in theHindIII-EcoRI double digest only ifHindIII cleavage occurred at +235. Fig. 5 A shows an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, containing total DNA from three reconstitution experiments (lanes 1–3) as well as pure pML5–4NR DNA (lane C). All of the DNAs were digested withHindIII and EcoRI; for the chromatin samples, digestion with HindIII took place on intact chromatin, andEcoRI cleavage was done on the purified DNA. All samples showed the expected three fragments; also as expected, the yield of 416-bp fragment indicative of HindIII cleavage at +235 in chromatin decreased as the level of chromatin reconstitution increased. When the intensity of the 416-bp fragment was quantified, the values for the bands in lanes 1 and 2 were 20 and 50%, respectively, of the intensity of the band in lane 3. The expected values, assuming that 17 and 11 nucleosomes were assembled inlanes 1 and 2 (see Fig. 1 B) and that each nucleosome protects 150 bp of DNA, would be 29 and 54%. Thus, there is reasonably good agreement with the assumption that the overall distribution of nucleosomes on the DNA is random. However, when we checked for the ability of HindIII-cleaved chromatin templates to produce a 235-base run-off RNA in a sarkosyl chase, no such RNA was obtained (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and7). Note that the expected run-off RNA was obtained when mock-reconstituted templates were chased with sarkosyl afterHindIII cleavage (lanes 8 and 9). Despite significant advances in our understanding of both nucleosome structure and the mechanisms of transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II, it has not been possible (at least in the absence of activators; see Ref. 7Brown S.A. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to reproduce efficient transcript elongationin vitro using reconstituted chromatin templates.

https://openalex.org/W2165129102,"We have established a new purification procedure of cytochrome b 561 from bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin vesicles. The heme content analysis of the purified sample indicated the presence of 1.7 molecules of heme B/cytochromeb 561 molecule. EPR spectroscopy of the purified enzyme in oxidized state showed that there were three types of low spin heme species. Two of them showed usual EPR signals at gz = 3.14 and gz = 2.84 arising from the same heme and were interconvertible depending on pH. The other species showed a highly anisotropic low spin signal at gz = 3.70, with a lower redox potential than the others, and a temperature-sensitive character. These properties are very similar to low potential cytochromeb (b L orb 566) of the mitochondrial complex III, indicating that the gz = 3.70 species is derived from a heme component different from the one that shows the usual low spin EPR signals. Based on our new structural model, these two heme B prosthetic groups are likely to be located on both sides of the membranes in close contact with the ascorbic acid- and semidehydroascorbic acid-binding sites, respectively, to facilitate the electron transfer across the membranes. This molecular architecture may provide a structural basis for the transmembrane electron transfer catalyzed by this hemoprotein.

This molecular architecture may provide a structural basis for the transmembrane electron transfer catalyzed by this hemoprotein. Cytochrome b 561 is believed to play a key role in electron transfer across the chromaffin vesicle membranes required for noradrenaline biosynthesis inside these specialized organelles of the secretory cells (1Njus D. Kelley P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this process remains still unclear. The cytochrome is a highly hydrophobic hemoprotein with a molecular mass of ∼28 kDa and contains six or five transmembrane α-helices (2Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2697-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Srivastava M. Gibson K.R. Pollard H.B. Fleming P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence shows no apparent homology with any other membrane-bound cytochromes so far known (2Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2697-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cytochrome is characterized by a rather high redox midpoint potential (4Flatmark T. Terland O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 253: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and an asymmetric absorption peak in the α-band with a maximum at 561 nm and a shoulder at approximately 558 nm (5Silsand T.

Burbaev et al. (7Burbaev D.S. Moroz I.A. Kamenskiy Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that the intact chromaffin vesicle membranes from bovine adrenal medullae showed three different EPR signals of ferric cytochrome b 561. A typical gz signal of a low spin cytochrome observed at g ∼ 3 comprised a high potential component with gz = 3.14 and a low potential one with gz = 3.11. In addition, a highly temperature-sensitive heme signal at gz = 3.7 was observed. The latter signal was fully retained in the preparation of vesicle membranes with cytochrome b 561 reduced by 50% but disappeared upon full reduction of the cytochrome by ascorbic acid. The properties of the signal were strikingly similar to those of the mitochondrial low potential cytochrome b heme (b L or b 566) (8Orme-Johnson N.R. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Despite these pieces of evidence, it is widely accepted that purified cytochrome b 561 contains only one heme B per molecule (10Apps D.K. Pryde J.G. Phillips J.H.

The sigmoid shape in the Nernst plot of redox titration was, therefore, explained by negative cooperativity in oligomeric cytochromeb 561 (6Apps D.K. Boisclair M.D. Gavine F.S. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have established a new purification procedure for cytochrome b 561 from bovine adrenal chromaffin vesicles. Heme content analysis of the purified sample showed 1.7 heme B molecules/cytochrome b 561molecule. We found further that the purified cytochrome in oxidized state showed three types of low spin EPR signals originating from two distinct heme components. Chromaffin vesicle membranes were isolated from bovine adrenal glands according to the procedure of Bartlett and Smith (13Bartlett S.F. Smith A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31A: 379-389Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The washed chromaffin vesicle membranes (∼500 mg of protein with a concentration of ∼5 mg of protein/ml) were solubilized with 1.0% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 20% (w/v) glycerol and 1.0 mm sodium ascorbate with stirring at 4 °C for 1 h. The solubilized extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 19,000 rpm in a model 7800 centrifuge (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an RA-300 rotor. The extract was loaded onto a column of ω-aminooctyl-Sepharose 4B (2.5 (inner diameter) × 14 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1.0% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, and 1.0 mm sodium ascorbate (buffer A). After the loading, the column was washed with buffer A extensively, until turbid fractions and reddish fractions were eluted out. The column was then treated with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl. During this wash, cytochromeb 561 was eluted as a sharp red band. Fractions containing cytochrome b 561 were pooled and concentrated to less than 10 ml in a 50-ml Amicon concentrator fitted with a membrane filter (Millipore PTTK04310; pore size 30,000 nominal molecular weight limit). The concentrated sample was washed twice with buffer A in the concentrator and, then, applied to a column of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (1.0 (inner diameter) × 8.0 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The fractions not retained in the column were pooled and loaded directly onto a second column of ω-aminooctyl-Sepharose 4B (1.6 (inner diameter) × 14 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. After the loading, the column was washed with buffer A extensively. During this wash, cytochromeb 561 moved down slowly in the column and was then eluted out. Fractions containing cytochromeb 561 were pooled and concentrated in the Amicon concentrator. The purity of cytochrome b 561 was analyzed with visible absorption spectroscopy and on SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviation used is: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electroporesis. Visible absorption spectra were recorded with either a UVIKON 922 (Kontron Instruments) or a UV-2200A (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) spectrophotometers at room temperature. The purified cytochromeb 561 in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was oxidized with addition of aliquots of potassium ferricyanide solution (10 mm), and its heme content was analyzed with a pyridine hemochrome method in aqueous alkaline pyridine solution as described by Fuhrhop and Smith (14Fuhrhop J.-H.

Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975: 755-869Google Scholar) was used. The protein concentration was determined with a modified Lowry method as described previously (15Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Concentration of the standard solution was assessed spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 6.60%−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. The purified cytochromeb 561 (∼100 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1.0% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, and 1.0 mm sodium ascorbate was placed in a cuvette with a 3-mm light path length and was oxidized stepwise by adding aliquots of 100 mm potassium ferricyanide solution. Partially and fully oxidized cytochromeb 561 samples, thus obtained, were withdrawn into EPR tubes and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR measurements were carried out at X band (9.23 GHz) microwave frequency with a Varian E-12 EPR spectrometer with 100 kHz field modulation. An Oxford flow cryostat (ESR-900) was used for measurements at 5 and 15 K. The microwave frequency was calibrated with a microwave frequency counter (Takeda Riken Co., Ltd., model TR5212). The magnetic field strength was determined by a nuclear magnetic resonance of protons in water. Accuracy of the g values was approximately ±0.01. Table I shows a summary of a typical purification of the cytochrome using 50 bovine adrenal glands as starting materials. The procedure as described in detail under “Materials and Methods” was shown to be reproducible. Just after turbid fractions were eluted out, a part of cytochromeb 561 was also eluted from the 1st ω-aminooctyl-Sepharose 4B column during a wash with buffer A. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the fraction contained many protein bands with higher molecular weights, in addition to cytochromeb 561, indicating that cytochromeb 561 was not fully dissipated even in 1% β-octyl glucoside or cytochrome b 561 might interact strongly with other membrane proteins in chromaffin vesicles. Before loading onto the second ω-aminooctyl-Sepharose 4B column, the crude cytochrome b 561 sample was passed through a concanavalin A-Sepharose column to remove contaminating dopamine β-monooxygenase. Upon loading on the second ω-aminooctyl-Sepharose 4B column, cytochrome b 561 was adsorbed in the column as a red band. Washing the column with the equilibrating buffer caused a gradual elution of cytochrome b 561. The sample at this stage showed a single protein band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 27,700 and was considered as pure cytochrome b 561.Table IPurification of cytochrome b561 from bovine adrenal chromaffin vesiclesPurification stepProteinTotal cytochromeb 561Specific contentYieldmgnmolnmol/mg%Purified chromaffin vesicles576.9600.11.04100β-Octyl glucoside extract508.0557.01.1092.8First ω-aminooctyl-Sepharose column116.5404.13.4767.3Concanavalin A-Sepharose column93.2371.73.9961.9Second ω-aminooctyl-Sepharose column6.88232.433.7838.7Cytochrome b 561 content was determined using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 37.3 mm−1cm−1 for sodium dithionite-reduced minus potassium ferricyanide-oxidized cytochrome at the wavelength pair 561–575 nm for the first two steps, whereas millimolar extinction coefficients of 267.9 mm−1 cm−1 and 46.1 mm−1 cm−1 for the dithionite reduced absolute spectra at the wavelength at 427 and 561 nm, respectively, were used for the later purification stages (see Table II).

The pyridine hemochrome analysis of the purified sample in the aqueous alkaline condition showed α, β, and Soret absorption maxima at 556.5, 524.5, and 418.5 nm, respectively, confirming presence of heme B as the prosthetic group (5Silsand T. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 359: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purified cytochrome b 561 contained 61.4 nmol of heme B/mg protein (the mean value of 6 measurements with S.D. = 2.14). This corresponds to 1.70 molecules of heme B/cytochromeb 561 molecule, assuming the molecular weight as 27,700. It was essential to oxidize cytochromeb 561 before the pyridine hemochrome analysis; otherwise significant destruction of heme B was observed upon treatment of the cytochrome in the aqueous alkaline solution. The purified cytochromeb 561 in reduced form showed α, β, and Soret absorption maxima at 561, 530, and 427 nm, respectively, as reported previously (5Silsand T. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 359: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At the final stage of the purification, sodium ascorbate was omitted from the elution buffer to remove the absorption in ultraviolet region due to ascorbic acid or semidehydroascorbic acid. Millimolar extinction coefficients of the purified cytochromeb 561 at certain important wavelengths were determined assuming presence of two hemes B per molecule (see “Discussion”) and are summarized in Table II. The results show significant differences from the values previously reported (5Silsand T. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 359: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For instance, in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum, the reported ε561–575 value ranges from 23.3 (5Silsand T. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys.

Visible absorption spectra of the purified cytochrome b 561 in various redox levels are shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel). In almost (93%) oxidized state at pH 8.0 (Fig. 1, upper panel, trace C), three types of low spin species were observed in the EPR spectra at 15 K (Fig. 1, center panel,trace C): a highly anisotropic species with gzvalue at 3.70 and two typical low spin species (one with gz= 3.14 and the other with gz = 2.84, gy = 2.24, and gx = 1.66). The two typical low spin signals (gz = 3.14 and 2.84) showed a significant pH dependence and were found to be interconvertible. Upon lowering the pH to 6.8, the gz = 2.84 signal was completely gone in the EPR spectrum at 15 K (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, at pH 8.8, the intensity of the gz = 2.84 signal became much stronger than that of the gz = 3.14 signal (spectra not shown). The apparent pK a of this transition was estimated at approximately 8. 2M. Tsubaki, M. Nakayama, and H. Hori, unpublished result. The gy and gx components of the gz = 3.14 species could be clearly seen at ∼2.1 and 1.49, respectively (Fig. 2 A), as reported previously for the oxidized chromaffin vesicles (pH 7.2). Although Burbaev et al. reported that the gz = 3.12 species comprised a high potential component with gz = 3.14 and a low potential one with gz = 3.11 (7Burbaev D.S. Moroz I.A. Kamenskiy Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), our present data showed only one species. The g values of both the gz = 3.14 and gz = 2.84 species are very similar to those of microsomal cytochrome b 5 (gz = 3.05, gy = 2.22, and gx = 1.41) (16Ikeda M. Iizuka T. Takao H. Hagihara B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 15-24Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), chloroplast cytochrome b 559 (gz = 2.94, gy = 2.27, and gx = 1.54) (17Babcock G.T. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Oertling W.A. Metz J.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and cytochromeb of bo-type ubiquinol oxidase (gz = 2.98, gy = 2.26, and gx = 1.45) (18Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), all of which are known to have bisimidazole ligands. At 5 K, the gz = 3.70 species dominated in the low spin signal region of the fully oxidized spectra (both pH 6.8 and 8.0) (Fig. 2, B and C), being consistent with the previous observation on the oxidized chromaffin vesicle preparation (7Burbaev D.S. Moroz I.A. Kamenskiy Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There was a slight pH-dependent change in the gzvalue (Fig. 2, B and C). We noticed further that, at 5 K, intensity of the gz = 3.70 signal in the partially (43%) oxidized spectrum was almost fully retained compared with the one in the 93% oxidized spectrum (Fig. 1, lower panel,traces B versus C). At 15 K, the gz = 3.70 signal intensity in the 43% oxidized spectrum was almost fully retained as well (Fig. 1, center panel, traces B versus C). These observations indicate that the redox potential of the gz = 3.70 species is lower than those of the usual low spin species (gz = 3.14 and 2.84 species). The high spin heme signal (g ∼ 6.1) represents merely a minor population of cytochrome b 561 based on spin contents. The nature of this species is not clear at this stage. There was another type of EPR signal at g = 4.3. It is likely a product of the heme decomposition. In the present study we have established a new purification procedure that enabled us to prepare a large quantity of highly purified cytochrome b 561 from bovine chromaffin vesicles. The heme content analysis of the purified cytochromeb 561 showed 1.7 molecules of heme B/molecule. This number is in marked contrast to the previously reported value of 1.0 molecule of heme B/cytochrome b 561 molecule (6Apps D.K. Boisclair M.D. Gavine F.S. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Apps D.K. Pryde J.G. Phillips J.H. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Duong L.T.

Methods. 1984; 9: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is very likely that previous purification procedures suffered a significant loss of heme B prosthetic group from the cytochrome. We noticed that a part of heme B prosthetic group is particularly labile and is easily lost during the purification. Even with our new purification procedure, the heme content values of as low as 1.4 molecule of heme B/cytochrome b 561 were obtained for some preparations. Thus it is very probable that the cytochrome b 561 in native state contains two hemes B per molecule. Extremely high value (3.9) ofA 427/A 280 ratio in the visible absorption spectrum in reduced state (without sodium ascorbate) (spectrum not shown) is consistent with the presence of two hemes B per molecule. The presence of several EPR species of cytochromeb 561 in chromaffin vesicle membranes had been reported (7Burbaev D.S. Moroz I.A. Kamenskiy Y.A. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and was confirmed in the present study for the purified sample. There were three types of low spin species; two of them showed usual low spin EPR signals (gz = 3.14 and gz = 2.84) arising from the same heme component and were interconvertible depending on pH. A similar transition of EPR signals upon elevation of pH was reported for cytochrome b 5, in which a neutral form (gz = 3.05, gy = 2.22, gx = 1.41 at pH 6.2) was converted to an alkaline form (gz = 2.76, gy = 2.26, gx = 1.67 at pH 12.0) (16Ikeda M. Iizuka T. Takao H. Hagihara B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 15-24Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cause of this transition is likely either due to deprotonation of one of the axial bisimidazole ligands to form an imidazolate ligation or the imidazole ligand to become strongly hydrogen-bonded from a nearby amino acid residue (19Quinn R. Nappa M. Valentine J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 2588-2595Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Since the pH within chromaffin vesicles is around 5.7 (20Njus D. Kelley P.M. Harnadek G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 237-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the gz = 2.84 species may not participate in the physiological electron transfer reaction. The other EPR species showed a highly anisotropic low spin signal (gz = 3.70), a lower redox potential than the others, and a temperature-sensitive character, being very similar to cytochromesb (b 566, gz = 3.75;b 562, gz = 3.45) of the mitochondrial complex III (8Orme-Johnson N.R. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Salerno J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2331-2336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to chloroplast cytochromeb 6 (b 563, gz= 3.5) (21Bergström J. Andréasson L.-E. Vänngård T. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 71-74Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The gz = 3.70 species showed only a slight pH-dependent spectral change. These properties indicate that the gz = 3.70 species is derived from a heme component different from the one that shows the usual low spin EPR signals. Presence of two independent heme B centers is consistent with the observation of two different forms (midpoint potentials, 170 and 70 mV, respectively) of cytochrome b 561 determined by an optical potentiometric technique (6Apps D.K. Boisclair M.D. Gavine F.S. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently we have proposed a plausible structural model of cytochromeb 561 on the basis of comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of seven species. 3E. Okuyama, R. Yamamoto, Y. Ichikawa, and M. Tsubaki, unpublished result. In the model, a polypeptide spans the vesicle membranes six times. There are two fully conserved regions in the sequences; the first conserved sequence (69ALLVYRVFR77) is located on the extravesicular side of an α-helical segment, and the second one (120SLHSW124) is located in an intravesicular loop connecting two α-helical segments, respectively. The first and second conserved sequences are likely to form the binding sites for extravesicular ascorbic acid and intravesicular semidehydroascorbic acid, respectively (1Njus D. Kelley P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).3 In addition, there are six totally conserved histidyl residues (His54, His88, His92, His110, His122, and His161) in the cytochrome.3 Thus, we have proposed that one of the two heme irons of cytochromeb 561 (extravesicular side) is coordinated with the pair, either His88(helix 3)-His161(helix 5) or His92(helix 3)-His161(helix 5). The pair, His54(helix 2)-His122(end of helix-4) is likely to coordinate with another heme iron (intravesicular side).3 Consideration on the EPR properties of the two heme B species suggests further that a lower redox potential of the gz = 3.70 species is favorable for an electron acceptor from extravesicular ascorbic acid, whereas the usual low spin heme species has a higher redox potential suitable for donating an electron to intravesicular semidehydroascorbic acid. Indeed, the EPR character of the gz = 3.70 species is very similar to those of cytochromesb of the mitochondrial complex III, particularly to the low potential cytochrome b (b L orb 566) (8Orme-Johnson N.R. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Salerno J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2331-2336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is considered to exist within the mitochondrial membranes (22Degli Esposti M. De Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnello T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 23Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the usual low spin species seems to be located in relatively hydrophilic environments, showing a striking pH dependence. It is likely that the highly anisotropic (gz = 3.70) EPR signal is derived from the heme at the extravesicular side and that the usual low spin EPR signals (gz = 3.14 and gz = 2.84) are originated from the heme at the intravesicular side. Therefore, the two heme B centers are located on both sides of the membranes in close contact with the ascorbic acid- and semidehydroascorbic acid-binding sites, respectively, to facilitate the electron transfer across the membranes. The well allocated molecular architecture provides a structural basis for the efficient transmembrane electron transfer catalyzed by this hemoprotein. Further studies are in progress to reveal the mechanism of the ascorbic acid-regenerating system in the secretory vesicles."

We have stably overexpressed the native form and a catalytically inactive cysteine to serine mutant of the enzyme, SHP-1-(Cys → Ser), in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Following stimulation of the cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interferon-γ (INF-γ), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) activity was analyzed by using two 32P-labeled DNA probes, namely hSIE which is derived from a high affinity mutant form of the serum-inducible element in the c-fos promotor and GAS which resembles the INF-γ activation site. EGF induced hSIE binding activity only, and the activity was suppressed by ∼70% when the inactive mutant form of SHP-1 was expressed but was essentially unaffected by expression of the native enzyme. INF-γ treatment resulted in appearance of both hSIE and GAS binding activities. While expression of the inactive mutant reduced the activities by 30–50%, the native enzyme caused a 20–30% increase. Consistent with effects on STAT activation, altered SHP-1 expression also affected EGF-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; expression of SHP-1-(Cys → Ser) inhibited activity of MEK by ∼25%, whereas expression of SHP-1 resulted in a ∼25% increase. Further studies revealed that overexpression of SHP-1 caused decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and that EGF induced phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-1. Together, the data suggest that SHP-1 is positively involved in EGF- and INF-γ-induced STAT activation in non-hematopoietic HeLa cells and that, in the EGF signaling system, SHP-1 functions at least partly by modulating tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor.

Engagement of growth factor or cytokine receptors that lack intrinsic kinase activity with their ligands causes dimerization of the receptors and activation of Janus kinases (JAKs). The activated JAKs subsequently phosphorylate the receptors on specific tyrosyl residues thus providing docking sites for STAT molecules. STATs are then recruited to the receptors, phosphorylated by JAKs, and then translocated to the nucleus where, by themselves or in combination with other DNA binding proteins, they bind to specific DNA sequences and stimulate transcription. Growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity also transduce their signals by activating STATs. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF), colony stimulating factor-1, and platelet-derived growth factor activate STATs (4Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), playing positive as well as negative roles in signal transduction (9Hunter T.

Among the numerous PTPs identified so far, two mammalian SH2 domain-containing PTPs, namely SHP-1 (previously termed PTP1C, SHPTP-1, SHP, and HCP) and SHP-2 (also known as SHPTP-2, SHPTP-3, Syp, PTP2C, and PTP1D) have been extensively studied (10Adachi M.

Expression of a dominant negative mutant of SHP-1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells suppressed serum- and EGF-activated MAP kinase activity (24Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fisher E.H.

On the other hand, evidence also exists suggesting a negative role of SHP-2 in signal transduction. For example, recruitment of SHP-2 to CTLA-4 leads to inactivation of T-cell activation (26Marengere L.E. Waterhouse P. Duncan G.S. Mittrucker H.W. Feng G.S. Mak T.W.

In this study, we demonstrate that, in non-hematopoietic HeLa cells, SHP-1 is positively involved in EGF- and INF-γ-induced STAT activation.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have demonstrated that, in non-hematopoietic HeLa cells, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 resulted in a significant decrease in EGF- and INF-γ-induced STAT activity, whereas overexpression of the native form of enzyme had no effect on the former but had a moderate positive effect on the latter. This suggests that SHP-1, like SHP-2, can function as a positive regulator in the activation of the STAT transcription factors. These results are consistent with the recent reports on the positive role of SHP-1 in activation of the MAP kinase pathway in human embryonic kidney 293 cells induced by serum and EGF and in macrophages induced by CSF-1 (24Su L.

In fact, previous reports have demonstrated that SHP-1 plays a negative role in INF-α/β- and erythropoietin-induced cell signaling by specifically dephosphorylating JAK1 and JAK2, respectively (14Klingmüller U.

First, our study was performed by using stably transfected human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells with altered SHP-1 expression while almost all the other studies were performed by using mature hematopoietic cells (macrophages or lymphocytes) derived from moth-eaten or viable moth-eaten mice which have a natural defect in SHP-1 expression (14Klingmüller U.

Med. 1996; 184: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Second, SHP-1 has two forms (13Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Adv. Prot. Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 297-317Google Scholar). One referred to as the hematopoietic form is expressed predominantly in hemopoietic cells, and the other designated as the regular form is widely distributed. These two forms of SHP-1 differ in their N termini, which might affect their functions. Our current study was performed by using the regular form of SHP-1. Third, EGF and INF-γ were used in our study to stimulate cell signaling while most prior studies concerned signal transduction initiated by other stimuli such as INF-α/β and erythropoietin (14Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 15David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These differences in experiment approaches and in signaling systems may account for the differences in the distinct functions of SHP-1 in signal transduction. Above all, our results presented here provide further evidence to suggest that SHP-1 can play either positive or negative roles in regulating signal transduction pathways depending on the cell types, signaling systems involved, position of the enzyme targeted within the cells, and the particular molecules with which it interacts.Although our data provide strong evidence that SHP-1 plays a positive role in regulating STAT activation in HeLa cells, the precise mechanism by which SHP-1 functions is not clear. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is absolutely required for their activation. It is unlikely that SHP-1 enhances activation of STATs by directly acting on them. Instead, it may act directly or indirectly on a component that is upstream of the pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by MAP kinase is required in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation for maximum transcriptional activation (32David M., III, E.P. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 33Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). This establishes a direct link between the MAP kinase pathway and STATs. Therefore, SHP-1 could affect the activation of STATs via regulation of MAP kinase. In the present study, we have found that overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 modestly suppressed EGF-induced MAP kinase activation whereas that of the native form of the enzyme enhanced it. Moreover, the peak of EGF-induced MEK activation was observed at 5 min while maximum activation of STATs was at 15 min. The data suggest that SHP-1 may indeed affect the EGF-induced STAT activation indirectly by altering the activation of MAP kinase. However, for the INF-γ-induced STAT activation, this may not be the case since the present study indicated that activation of MAP kinase is not involved in INF-γ-induced signaling. SHP-1 may be directly involved in the pathway leading to activation of STATs.As an SH2 domain-containing protein, SHP-1 is among the signaling molecules that are recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors upon stimulation. In fact, binding of SHP-1 to EGF-R has been reported previously (34Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and our results further verified it in EGF-treated HeLa cells. More importantly, our results indicated that active SHP-1 markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. However, rather than decreasing the downstream signal transduction of the receptor as one might expect, it enhanced it. This suggests that transduction of signals via EGF-R is not proportional to the level of its tyrosine phosphorylation and that dephosphorylation of the receptors, perhaps, at certain sites which otherwise negatively regulate the activity of the receptor or serve as docking sites for proteins with inhibitory functions, may be essential. This would explain the positive role of the native form of SHP-1. For the catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1-(Cys → Ser), one trivial explanation is that SHP-1-(Cys → Ser) may bind EGF-R via the inactive catalytic domain, thus preventing other signaling molecules from accessing the receptor and blocking their signaling. This has proven to be unlikely, since the mutant SHP-1-(Cys → Ser) was shown to be less efficient in binding to EGF-R than the native SHP-1. In fact, the inability of SHP-1-(Cys → Ser) to bind EGF-R might suggest that the binding alone requires PTP catalytic activity. Another consequence of the EGF stimulation of cells is the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 (Fig. 5). Previous studies have demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 can provide binding sites for GRB2 (19Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 7: 3685-3697Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which presumably could lead to activation of the Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathway. However, since the Cys to Ser mutation of SHP-1, which diminishes auto-dephosphorylation of the enzyme, displayed an even stronger phosphorylation but inhibited downstream signaling, the present results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation per seis probably not a key factor in the process. Further support for this is that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 was not observed in response to INF-γ stimulation although it had similar effects on STAT activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation also results in activation of SHP-1 (35Uchida T. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Horita K. Suzuki T. Fujioka Y. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12220-12228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is meaningful to the native form of SHP-1 but not to the dead mutant SHP-1-(Cys → Ser). Above all, the catalytic activity of SHP-1 has a major role in signaling transduction initiated by growth factors and cytokines. At present, we can only speculate that, as a positive regulator, SHP-1 functions by dephosphorylating the receptors at certain tyrosine phosphorylation sites that have inhibitory roles or by dephosphorylating other intermediate signaling proteins that would be activated. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-R, EGF receptor; INF, interferon; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s); JAK, Janus kinases; INF, interferon. 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-R, EGF receptor; INF, interferon; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s); JAK, Janus kinases; INF, interferon. are transcription factors that are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to growth factors and cytokines (1Ihle J.N. Cell. 1991; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Activation of STATs via the JAK/STAT pathway has been well defined (1Ihle J.N.

Engagement of growth factor or cytokine receptors that lack intrinsic kinase activity with their ligands causes dimerization of the receptors and activation of Janus kinases (JAKs). The activated JAKs subsequently phosphorylate the receptors on specific tyrosyl residues thus providing docking sites for STAT molecules. STATs are then recruited to the receptors, phosphorylated by JAKs, and then translocated to the nucleus where, by themselves or in combination with other DNA binding proteins, they bind to specific DNA sequences and stimulate transcription. Growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity also transduce their signals by activating STATs. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF), colony stimulating factor-1, and platelet-derived growth factor activate STATs (4Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E.

Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Whether these receptor tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate STATs remains to be defined (8Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthuhn B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20775-20780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is a central event in these signaling processes. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), playing positive as well as negative roles in signal transduction (9Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar), must have a crucial role in the process. Among the numerous PTPs identified so far, two mammalian SH2 domain-containing PTPs, namely SHP-1 (previously termed PTP1C, SHPTP-1, SHP, and HCP) and SHP-2 (also known as SHPTP-2, SHPTP-3, Syp, PTP2C, and PTP1D) have been extensively studied (10Adachi M.

Recent studies demonstrated that SHP-1 suppresses interferon-α/β- and erythropoietin-stimulated activation of STATs by dephosphorylating JAK1 and JAK2, respectively (14Klingmüller U. Lorenz U.

First, our study was performed by using stably transfected human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells with altered SHP-1 expression while almost all the other studies were performed by using mature hematopoietic cells (macrophages or lymphocytes) derived from moth-eaten or viable moth-eaten mice which have a natural defect in SHP-1 expression (14Klingmüller U.

Med. 1996; 184: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Second, SHP-1 has two forms (13Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Adv. Prot. Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 297-317Google Scholar). One referred to as the hematopoietic form is expressed predominantly in hemopoietic cells, and the other designated as the regular form is widely distributed. These two forms of SHP-1 differ in their N termini, which might affect their functions. Our current study was performed by using the regular form of SHP-1. Third, EGF and INF-γ were used in our study to stimulate cell signaling while most prior studies concerned signal transduction initiated by other stimuli such as INF-α/β and erythropoietin (14Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 15David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These differences in experiment approaches and in signaling systems may account for the differences in the distinct functions of SHP-1 in signal transduction. Above all, our results presented here provide further evidence to suggest that SHP-1 can play either positive or negative roles in regulating signal transduction pathways depending on the cell types, signaling systems involved, position of the enzyme targeted within the cells, and the particular molecules with which it interacts.Although our data provide strong evidence that SHP-1 plays a positive role in regulating STAT activation in HeLa cells, the precise mechanism by which SHP-1 functions is not clear. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is absolutely required for their activation. It is unlikely that SHP-1 enhances activation of STATs by directly acting on them. Instead, it may act directly or indirectly on a component that is upstream of the pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by MAP kinase is required in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation for maximum transcriptional activation (32David M., III, E.P. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 33Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). This establishes a direct link between the MAP kinase pathway and STATs. Therefore, SHP-1 could affect the activation of STATs via regulation of MAP kinase. In the present study, we have found that overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 modestly suppressed EGF-induced MAP kinase activation whereas that of the native form of the enzyme enhanced it. Moreover, the peak of EGF-induced MEK activation was observed at 5 min while maximum activation of STATs was at 15 min. The data suggest that SHP-1 may indeed affect the EGF-induced STAT activation indirectly by altering the activation of MAP kinase. However, for the INF-γ-induced STAT activation, this may not be the case since the present study indicated that activation of MAP kinase is not involved in INF-γ-induced signaling. SHP-1 may be directly involved in the pathway leading to activation of STATs.As an SH2 domain-containing protein, SHP-1 is among the signaling molecules that are recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors upon stimulation. In fact, binding of SHP-1 to EGF-R has been reported previously (34Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and our results further verified it in EGF-treated HeLa cells. More importantly, our results indicated that active SHP-1 markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. However, rather than decreasing the downstream signal transduction of the receptor as one might expect, it enhanced it. This suggests that transduction of signals via EGF-R is not proportional to the level of its tyrosine phosphorylation and that dephosphorylation of the receptors, perhaps, at certain sites which otherwise negatively regulate the activity of the receptor or serve as docking sites for proteins with inhibitory functions, may be essential. This would explain the positive role of the native form of SHP-1. For the catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1-(Cys → Ser), one trivial explanation is that SHP-1-(Cys → Ser) may bind EGF-R via the inactive catalytic domain, thus preventing other signaling molecules from accessing the receptor and blocking their signaling. This has proven to be unlikely, since the mutant SHP-1-(Cys → Ser) was shown to be less efficient in binding to EGF-R than the native SHP-1. In fact, the inability of SHP-1-(Cys → Ser) to bind EGF-R might suggest that the binding alone requires PTP catalytic activity. Another consequence of the EGF stimulation of cells is the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 (Fig. 5). Previous studies have demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 can provide binding sites for GRB2 (19Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 7: 3685-3697Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which presumably could lead to activation of the Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathway. However, since the Cys to Ser mutation of SHP-1, which diminishes auto-dephosphorylation of the enzyme, displayed an even stronger phosphorylation but inhibited downstream signaling, the present results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation per seis probably not a key factor in the process. Further support for this is that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 was not observed in response to INF-γ stimulation although it had similar effects on STAT activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation also results in activation of SHP-1 (35Uchida T. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Horita K. Suzuki T. Fujioka Y. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12220-12228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is meaningful to the native form of SHP-1 but not to the dead mutant SHP-1-(Cys → Ser). Above all, the catalytic activity of SHP-1 has a major role in signaling transduction initiated by growth factors and cytokines. At present, we can only speculate that, as a positive regulator, SHP-1 functions by dephosphorylating the receptors at certain tyrosine phosphorylation sites that have inhibitory roles or by dephosphorylating other intermediate signaling proteins that would be activated. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, in non-hematopoietic HeLa cells, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 resulted in a significant decrease in EGF- and INF-γ-induced STAT activity, whereas overexpression of the native form of enzyme had no effect on the former but had a moderate positive effect on the latter. This suggests that SHP-1, like SHP-2, can function as a positive regulator in the activation of the STAT transcription factors. These results are consistent with the recent reports on the positive role of SHP-1 in activation of the MAP kinase pathway in human embryonic kidney 293 cells induced by serum and EGF and in macrophages induced by CSF-1 (24Su L.

Maximal activation was observed 1 h after treatment but declined at 3 and 6 h. The levels of IκBα and IκBβ were analyzed during this period in an attempt to correlate NF-κB activity with IκB resynthesis. Degradation of IκBα was very rapid and was followed by recovery 1 h after LPS administration. IκBβ degradation, which has been associated with persistent NF-κB activation, was complete at 1 h. However, a rapid recovery of IκBβ in these tissues was observed at 3 h in parallel with the abrogation of NF-κB activity. Immunolocalization of newly synthesized IκBβ by confocal microscopy revealed its preferential accumulation in the cytosol. Analysis of IκBβ by Western blot using high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the presence of two bands in cytosolic extracts of LPS-treated macrophages at 3 h, but only one band with the same mobility as the control was detected at 6 h. Moreover, treatment of extracts of resynthesized IκBβ with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the accumulation of the protein of slightly higher electrophoretic mobility, indicating the prevalence of a rapid phosphorylation of the newly synthesized IκBβ. At the mRNA level, up-regulation of IκBβ was observed in macrophages stimulated for 1 h with LPS. When the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines was investigated, tumor necrosis factor α, but not interleukin-1 or interferon-γ, promoted an important degradation of IκBβ followed by an increase in the mRNA at 1 h. These results suggest the existence of LPS- and tumor necrosis factor α- specific pathways involved in a rapid IκBβ degradation and resynthesis and might explain the transient period of activation of NF-κB in these tissues upon stimulation with these factors.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of specific residues seems to be the signal for ubiquitin conjugation followed by degradation via the 26 S proteasome (16Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Degradation of IκBα is rapidly followed by induction of IκBα mRNA through a mechanism dependent on the binding of NF-κB to the κB sequences present in the promoter of the IκBα gene (18Sun S.-C.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This newly synthesized IκBα resets the NF-κB switch in the cytoplasm and possibly in the nucleus (20Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although in some cases IκBα resynthesis is not sufficient to suppress nuclear NF-κB activity (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and, together with IκBα, is the main regulator of NF-κB activity through the interaction with the same Rel proteins (2Kopp E. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 58: 1-27Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that IκBβ degradation causes a sustained activation of NF-κB due to the large lag period of IκBβ resynthesis (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 21Johnson D.R. Douglas I. Jahnke A. Ghosh S. Pober J.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these observations are specific of some cell types or represent a general mechanism of NF-κB activation, we investigated IκBα and IκBβ turnover in an experimental model of murine septic shock and in cultured peritoneal macrophages triggered with different stimuli. Our results show a rapid IκBβ degradation followed by a fast recovery, both in liver and in macrophages. This recovery of IκBβ contrasts with the results obtained in LPS-stimulated lymphoid cells, where absence of IκBβ was observed for large periods of time (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In our experimental model, an increase of IκBβ mRNA was detected as early as 1 h after stimulation and paralleled the resynthesis of IκBβ levels and the fall in NF-κB activity. Cytokines were from Boehringer Mannheim. Polymerase chain reaction reagents were from Perkin-Elmer. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium and other reagents were from Sigma. Cell culture reagents were from BioWhittaker, Inc.(Walkersville, MD). Antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Septic shock was induced in mice after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of a solution containing LPS (1 mg/kg of body weight) in saline. Animals were anesthetized with ether and immediately sacrificed. Tissues were processed immediately after extraction. Elicited peritoneal macrophages were prepared from male mice 4 days after intraperitoneal inoculation of 1 ml of 10% thioglycollate broth. Cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 in 6-cm plates and cultured with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO2. After incubation for 1 h, nonadherent cells were removed, and remanent cells were cultured and stimulated for different periods of time in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium lacking serum. Total RNA was extracted from 1.5 × 106 cells or from 50 mg of tissues following the guanidinium thiocyanate method (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis in a 0.9% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde, the RNA was transferred to a Nytran membrane (NY 13-N; Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., FRG) with 10 × SSC (1.5 m NaCl, 0.3m sodium citrate, pH 7.4). The membranes were prehybridized, and the levels of different mRNAs were determined with specific labeled probes. A 422-base pair IκBβ fragment was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using 1 μg of mouse testis RNA as template and oligonucleotides, based on the published sequence (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for amplification: 5′GGACACAGCCCTGCACTTGG3′ (forward, nucleotides 247–266) and 5′GTAGCCTCCAGTCTTCATCA3′ (reverse, nucleotides 668–648). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned in a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced (Sequenase, Amersham Life Science, Inc.), exhibiting the expected published sequence (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis of IκBα, a BamHI/HindIII fragment (1.4 kilobases) of the IκBα cDNA was used. The plasmid containing the cDNA for IκBα was a gift of Dr. Moscat (24Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dı́az-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The membranes were washed with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min followed by exposure to an x-ray film (Kodak X-OMAT). Quantitation of the films was performed by laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using the hybridization with a ribosomal 18 S probe as internal standard. Various exposition times of the micrograph films were used to ensure that bands were not saturated. Results are expressed in arbitrary units as the ratio of IκB/ribosomal 18 S RNA level. A modified procedure based on the method of Schreiber (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) et al. was used. Cells (1.5 × 106) were washed with PBS and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were homogenized with 100 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml TPCK, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaV04, 10 mm Na2MO4). After 10 min at 4 °C, Nonidet P-40 was added to reach a 0.5% concentration. The tubes were gently vortexed for 15 s, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 8.000 × g for 15 min. Tissues (100 mg) were homogenized in 8 volumes of buffer A containing 0.5 msucrose. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C (cytosolic extracts), and the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer A supplemented with 20% glycerol, 0.4 m KCl and gently shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear protein extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were stored at −80 °C. Protein content was assayed using the Bio-Rad protein reagent. All steps of cell fractionation were carried out at 4 °C. To dephosphorylate proteins, extracts were treated for 1 h at 30 °C with 1 unit of agarose-immobilized alkaline phosphatase/μg of protein. Appropriate controls of heat-inactivated alkaline phosphatase were used to ensure the specificity of the reaction. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in a Pharmacia oligonucleotide synthesizer. The oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to the consensus NF-κB binding site (nucleotides −978 to −952) of the murine iNOS promoter was 5′TGCTAGGGGGATTTTCCCTCTCTCTGT3′ (26Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were annealed with their complementary sequence by incubation for 5 min at 85 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of 50 ng of these annealed oligonucleotides were end-labeled with Klenow enzyme fragment in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and the other unlabeled dNTPs in a final volume of 50 μl. 5 × 104dpm of the DNA probe were used for each binding assay of nuclear extracts as follows: 3 μg of protein were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with the DNA and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, in a final volume of 20 μl. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on native 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5% Tris borate-EDTA buffer (27Dı́az-Guerra M.J.M. Velasco M. Martin-Sanz P. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30114-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Supershift assays were carried out after incubation of the nuclear extract with the antibody (0.5 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by EMSA. Anti-p50 (human) and anti-c-Rel (human) were a generous gift of Dr. N. R. Rice (27Dı́az-Guerra M.J.M. Velasco M. Martin-Sanz P. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30114-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); anti-p65 (murine), anti-IκBα (murine), and anti-IκBβ (murine) polyclonal Abs were from Santa Cruz. After determining the protein content of cytosolic extracts, samples were boiled in 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins (15 μg) were size-separated in minigels (7 cm) of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When a higher resolution of the proteins was required, the proteins were separated in a 15-cm gel, allowing the 36.5-kDa band of the prestained molecular weight markers to reach the border of the gel. Gels were blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluorescein membrane (Amersham) and processed as recommended by the supplier of the antibodies for IκBα and IκBβ (Santa Cruz). Proteins recognized by the antibodies were revealed following the ECL technique (Amersham). Autoradiographs were quantified by laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics), and several time expositions were analyzed to ensure the linearity of the band intensities. At the end of the experiment, the membranes were treated with Ponceau S reagent to confirm the protein charge after blotting. Macrophages were stimulated for the indicated period of time, and the cell layers were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed for 2 min with methanol (−20 °C). Fixed cells were blocked for 1 h at reverse transcription with blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and then treated for 1 h with a 1:50 dilution of anti-IκBα or anti-IκBβ Abs. After two washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min at reverse transcription with fluorescein-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Cy3, Amersham) diluted 1:150 in PBS. The dishes were washed three times with PBS and analyzed in a MRC-100 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). The fluorescence of the cell was digitalized using the Cosmos software (Bio-Rad). Results were expressed as the total fluorescence intensity associated to the cytosol or nuclear compartments, respectively. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical significance was estimated using Student's t test for unpaired observations. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. It has been suggested that the persistent NF-κB activation observed in B lymphocytes in response to LPS is due to a selective degradation and delayed resynthesis of IκBβ (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Indeed, administration of LPS to mice induces NF-κB activation in several tissues, including resident peritoneal macrophages and liver (5Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. Ihrig-Biedert I. Förstermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6039-6044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Dı́az-Guerra M.J.M. Velasco M. Martin-Sanz P. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30114-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using this animal model of septic shock, we analyzed the process of NF-κB activation together with IκB degradation and synthesis. As Fig. 1 A shows, a peak of NF-κB binding was observed 1 h after LPS administration both in peritoneal macrophages and in liver. This response decreased at 3 and 6 h and was completely absent in samples obtained at 18 h. Because NF-κB activation is largely dependent on IκB degradation, we analyzed the levels of IκBα and IκBβ at several sampling times. In liver, IκBα was lost at 20 min and rapidly recovered at 3 h (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, IκBβ degradation and resynthesis was delayed with respect to IκBα, recovering basal levels at 6 h. However, the recovery of IκBα and IκBβ in peritoneal macrophages from these animals was more rapid (Fig. 1 B), suggesting a differential kinetic control of this process among cells. To assess whether this extremely rapid IκBβ up-regulation was a peculiarity of the in vivo experimental model of septic shock, cultured peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS, and NF-κB activity and IκB levels were determined. As Fig. 2 A shows, NF-κB activation exhibited a maximum at 1 h followed by a rapid decrease of binding. Characterization of the proteins retained in EMSA by supershift analysis revealed the presence of p50/p50 (Fig. 2 B, lower band) and p50/p65 dimers (Fig. 2 B, upper band), and a negligible content in p52 or c-Rel (Fig. 2 B). The amount of IκBβ present in the cytosol was determined by Western blot, and the protein levels were barely detectable at 1 h and increased at 3 h (28% of the control level; Fig. 2 A). Newly synthesized IκBβ seems to require phosphorylation to interact with and to inhibit Rel proteins (22Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the kinetics of this phosphorylation could depend on the cell type analyzed, we investigated the phosphorylation state of the IκBβ after resynthesis. Using high resolution SDS-polyacrylamide gels, two bands of IκBβ-immunodetected protein were observed at 3 h after LPS treatment of the cells, the upper band corresponding to a phosphorylated IκBβ species in view of the increased mobility of the protein after treatment with immobilized alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, the main IκBβ species detected in control cells corresponded to the phosphorylated state of the protein as deduced by the shift after phosphatase treatment. Quantitation of the relative intensity of the two bands observed in samples from cells treated for 3 h with LPS showed a 78 and 22% distribution for the upper and lower bands, respectively. However, in samples analyzed after 6 h of LPS treatment, the upper band systematically represented >90% of the distribution, indicating the prevalence of the phosphorylated form in the cytosol. The presence of nonphosphorylated IκBβ species has been related to the formation of IκBβ-protected NF-κB active complexes both in the cytosol and in the nucleus (22Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether these protected ternary complexes could be present in the nuclei of LPS-activated cells, a supershift EMSA was performed with anti-IκBβ Ab after incubation of the nuclear extracts from cells treated for 1 or 3 h with LPS. However, the electrophoretic profile of NF-κB binding was not affected. Moreover, the minimal amount of IκBβ detected in the nuclear extracts corresponded to the phosphorylated form. These results indicate that the level of IκBβ present in the nucleus was very low, always corresponding to the active form of the protein (not shown, see next section). To determine the contribution of the proteasome to IκBβ degradation, experiments were done in the presence of several proteasome inhibitors, and the amount of IκBβ was determined by Western blot. As Table I shows, these inhibitors prevented IκBβ degradation at the time that prevented NF-κB activation (not shown).Table IProteasome inhibitors block IκBβ degradation in cultured peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPSTreamentIκBβ level20 min1 h4 h%None100101101 Calpain I inhibitor, 40 μm105107110 TPCK, 40 μm109109112LPS, 1 μg/ml18<171 Calpain I inhibitor, 40 μm9189104 TPCK, 40 μm949299Cells were incubated with the indicated inhibitors 30 min before stimulation.

At the indicated times, cells were homogenized, and the cytosolic content of IκBβ was determined by Western blot. Results show the mean of three experiments expressed as percentage of the content in control cells. The degradation and resynthesis of IκBα and IκBβ in cells treated with LPS was also investigated in situ using fluorescence confocal microscopy. As Fig. 3 shows, IκBα and IκBβ were undetectable at 30 min. Newly synthesized IκBα was detected at 1 h after LPS treatment, and at 4 h the protein was present both in the cytosol and in the nucleus. A quantitative analysis of the subcellular distribution of the fluorescence is shown in Fig. 4. When the immunofluorescence associated with IκBβ was analyzed (Fig. 3), a complete absence of staining was observed in cells treated for 1 h with LPS, followed by a resynthesis of the protein that accumulates in the cytosol. These time courses of resynthesis were in agreement with the immunodetection of the protein by Western blot analysis. Whereas IκBα was observed both in the cytosol and nucleus, IκBβ was detected in the cytosol in agreement with the rapid phosphorylation of this protein, which blocks the nuclear localization signal domain of the NF-κB·Rel complexes. The quantitative analysis of these data is reported in Fig. 4.Figure 4Quantitative analysis of IκBα and IκBβ levels in intact cells. The fluorescence intensity of cells treated as indicated in the Fig. 3 legend was digitalized using the software of the confocal microscope.

As Fig. 5, A and B, show and in agreement with previous reports, IκBα mRNA was rapidly up-regulated after treatment of cultured macrophages with LPS (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J.

Interestingly, IκBβ mRNA also increased in response to LPS, although the changes were lower and delayed with respect to the IκBα levels (peak values were obtained at 1 and 4 h for IκBα and IκBβ, respectively). To confirm the specificity of the mRNA detected by the probes, total RNA from selected murine tissues was examined by Northern blot, and cross-hybridization with both probes was accomplished. As Fig. 5 C shows, IκBα and IκBβ mRNAs were expressed at different levels in several tissues in agreement with a previous report (12Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). IκBα was very abundant in spleen, whereas IκBβ exhibited a high expression in testis. However, both IκB mRNA increased in the liver of animals after LPS treatment for 4 h (Fig. 5 C), supporting the results shown in Fig. 1 at the protein level.

https://openalex.org/W1999966734,"To study how the pattern of sulfation along a heparan sulfate chain affects its turnover, we examined heparan sulfate catabolism in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells and mutant pgsF-17, defective in 2-O-sulfation of uronic acid residues (Bai, X., and Esko, J. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 17711–17717). Heparan sulfate from the mutant contains normal amounts of 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues and iduronic acid and somewhat higher levels of N-sulfated glucosamine residues but lacks any 2-O-sulfated iduronic or glucuronic acid residues. Pulse-chase experiments showed that both mutant and wild-type cells transport newly synthesized heparan sulfate proteoglycans to the plasma membrane, where they shed into the medium or move into the cell through endocytosis. Internalization of the cell-associated molecules leads to sequential endoglycosidase (heparanase) fragmentation of the chains and eventual lysosomal degradation. In wild-type cells, the chains begin to degrade within 1 h, leading to the accumulation of intermediate (10–20-kDa) and small (4–7-kDa) oligosaccharides. Mutant cells did not generate these intermediates, although internalization and intracellular trafficking of the heparan sulfate chains appeared normal, and the chains degraded with normal kinetics. This difference was not due to defective heparanase activities in the mutant, since cytoplasmic extracts from mutant cells cleaved wild-type heparan sulfate chains in vitro. Instead, the heparan sulfate chains from the mutant were relatively resistant to degradation by cellular heparanases. These findings suggest that 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues in heparan sulfate are important for cleavage by endogenous heparanases but not for the overall catabolism of the chains.

These enzymes generally require the substrate to contain N-sulfated glucosamine residues for activity, which may be located at or near the cleavage site (6Bame K.J. Robson K. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To study how the pattern of sulfation might affect degradation of a heparan sulfate chain in vivo, we have examined turnover in a mutant cell line defective in 2-O-sulfation of iduronic acid residues. Altered sulfation in the mutant does not affect the overall turnover of heparan sulfate, but the defect prevents the formation of intermediate breakdown products characteristic of heparanase action. The lack of intermediates results from reduced susceptibility of the chains to cellular heparanases, suggesting that the enzymes in CHO cells prefer substrates containing 2-O-sulfated uronic acids. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61, Rockville, MD). The cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and 100% relative humidity in Ham's F-12 growth medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml of penicillin G. Sulfate-free medium was prepared from individual components (25Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), substituting chloride salts for sulfate and fetal bovine serum that had been dialyzed exhaustively against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (26Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). Both wild-type CHO and mutant pgsF-17 cells were grown to near confluence and pulse-labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi/ml Na35SO4 (25–40 Ci/mg; NEN Life Science Products) in sulfate free F-12 medium. After removing the labeled medium, the cell layers were washed three times, and fresh F-12 medium supplemented with 1 mmNa2SO4 was added. In some experiments, 100 μg/ml chloroquine was included in the chase medium. At the times indicated in the figure legends, the medium was collected, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. Cell surface proteoglycans were released by treating the cells with 0.125% (w/v) trypsin for 5–10 min at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min, and the released proteoglycans were recovered in the supernatant. The pellets were designated as the intracellular pool. Wild-type CHO and mutant pgsF-17 cells were labeled to constant radiospecific activity after 24 h with Na35SO4 (50 μCi/ml) in sulfate-free F-12 medium. The lack of sulfate in the medium does not cause undersulfation of the chains, since CHO cells derive adequate sulfate from the catabolism of cysteine and methionine (27Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled glycosaminoglycan chains were isolated from various fractions in the following way. The medium, the cell surface pool, and the pellet were adjusted to 0.1 m NaOH and then neutralized with 10m acetic acid. Chondroitin sulfate A (2 mg) and 16volume of a protease solution containing 1 mg/ml Pronase (Boehringer Mannheim) in 0.24 m sodium acetate (pH 6.5) and 1.92m NaCl were added. After overnight incubation, the solutions were diluted 5-fold with water to reduce the salt concentration to ∼0.1 m and applied to a 0.5-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel prepared in a disposable polypropylene pipette tip plugged with glass wool. The column was washed with 20 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.25 m NaCl. Bound glycosaminoglycans were eluted with 1 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and precipitated with 4 volumes of ethanol at 4 °C (2 h). The precipitate was dissolved in 0.5m sodium acetate (1 ml, pH 5.5) and reprecipitated with ethanol. The final material was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). [35S]chondroitin sulfate was removed by treating a sample overnight at 37 °C with 20 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku). The remaining heparan sulfate was treated at 4 °C for 24 h with 0.5 m NaOH containing 1 m NaBH4 to β-eliminate the chains and reduce the terminal sugars to their corresponding alditols. Carrier chondroitin sulfate was added, the samples were diluted with water, and the glycosaminoglycans were purified by another round of DEAE chromatography and ethanol precipitation. The [35S]heparan sulfate chains were analyzed by gel filtration HPLC using a TSK G2000SW column (7.5 mm × 30 cm column; TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The column was equilibrated in 100 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.2% (w/v) Zwittergent 3–12 and 0.5 m NaCl and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (0.5-ml fractions). Blue dextran (Sigma) and [6-3H]glucosamine-HCl (NEN Life Science Products) were used to determine the V o andV t of the column, respectively. The column was calibrated with standard chondroitin sulfate (∼50 kDa,K av ∼0.13) and heparin fragments (13.5 kDa,K av ∼0.4; 5–6 kDa, K av∼0.6; 3 kDa, K av ∼0.8) (6Bame K.J. Robson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2245-2251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Tumova S. Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effluent from the column was monitored for radioactivity with an in-line radioactivity detector (Radiomatic FLO-ONE/Beta, Packard Instruments) with sampling rates every 6 s and data averaged over 1 min. Samples were counted using Ultima Gold XR scintillation fluid (Packard). To prepare cell extracts, confluent monolayers of cells were washed three times with cold PBS. The cells were scraped with a rubber policeman into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25m sucrose, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mmphenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were sonicated for 10 s (on 50% duty) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the microsomal pellet was resuspended in a buffer of 50 mmcitrate, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), and 0.15m NaCl. Purified [35S]heparan sulfate isolated from the cell surface pool of proteoglycans (∼5000 cpm) was mixed with the pellet prepared from ∼5 × 106 cells. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the sample was boiled and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove precipitated proteins. The supernatant was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC on a TSK G2000SW column. Heparanase activity was partially purified (∼100-fold) from CHO-K1 cells as described (28Tumova S. Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purified [35S]heparan sulfate (∼5000 cpm) was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a buffer of 50 mm sodium citrate and 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5, 75 μl) with enzyme (1–1.5 μg of protein). Carrier heparin (100 μg) was added, and the reaction mixture was treated with 1% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride in 0.32 m NaCl, 40 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at 37 °C for 2 h. Under these conditions, uncleaved heparan sulfate chains precipitate, whereas the cleavage fragments do not (28Tumova S. Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the 35S counts in the supernatant were assayed by liquid scintillation counting. The size of the heparanase-cleaved heparan sulfate also was examined by gel filtration HPLC. Cell surface proteoglycans were biotinylated as described (29Fransson L.Å. Edgren G. Havsmark B. Schmidtchen A. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cells were first chilled on ice and then washed four times at 4 °C with a solution containing 10 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 0.137 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EDTA. The cells were gently stirred at 4 °C for 30 min with 1 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in buffer. The cells were brought to room temperature, washed once with warm buffer (37 °C), twice with sulfate-free F-12 medium, and then labeled with35SO4 (100 μCi/ml) in sulfate-free F12 medium for 24 h. After biotinylation, the medium was removed, and the cell layers were washed three times with PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min with 1 ml of buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride. The extract was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and 1 mg of chondroitin sulfate A and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin were added to the supernatant. The sample was chromatographed on a small DEAE-Sephacel column to separate the proteoglycans from other proteins. The column was washed with 0.3 m NaCl in the same buffer and eluted with 2.5 ml of 1 m NaCl. A sample (0.5 ml) was diluted to 0.5 m NaCl with water, and 30 μl of strepavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) was added. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C overnight with end-over-end mixing. The agarose beads were then washed three times by centrifugation with a buffer composed of 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.5 m NaCl. An aliquot was taken for counting, and another sample was digested with chondroitinase ABC. The digestion products were removed by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the beads was counted as a measure of heparan sulfate proteoglycans containing biotin. To calculate the extent of recycling, the counts recovered on the beads were expressed relative to the counts recovered from cells that were first labeled with 35SO4 for 24 h and then biotinylated. The 2-O-sulfotransferase clone, pcDNA3HS2ST, was kindly provided by H. Habuchi and K. Kimata (30Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This clone contains a 1.28-kilobase pair open reading frame encoding the 2-O-sulfotransferase from CHO cells. The plasmid was stably transfected into mutant pgsF-17 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were selected in growth medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (effective concentration). Resistant colonies were replica-plated to polyester cloth (31Esko J.D. Tartakoff A.M. Methods in Cell Biology: Vesicular Transport. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 387-422Google Scholar) and incubated with 125I-labeled basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (32Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Colonies that bound bFGF were detected by autoradiography, picked with glass cloning cylinders, and expanded in culture. Cell extracts from the transfectants were assayed for 2-O-sulfotransferase activity as described (32Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells were also labeled with 50 μCi/ml of35SO4 for 8 h, and the [35S]heparan sulfate was isolated and analyzed by gel filtration HPLC as described above. Confluent monolayers of wild-type and mutant pgsF-17 cells were washed three times with PBS. Sodium [125I]iodide (0.5 mCi) was added in PBS with 20 units of lactoperoxidase (Sigma), and three 20-μl aliquots of 0.1% H2O2 were added with gentle agitation in 5-min intervals (33Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Adamson E.D. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 108: 1433-1441Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by sedimenting the cells and washing them three times with PBS. Wild-type and pgsF-17 cells labeled with 35SO4 for 24 h or by radioiodination were washed twice at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mmCaCl2 and scraped into 1 ml of buffer. The cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride and forced through a 28-gauge needle 10 times. Postnuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifuging the samples at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Percoll (20%, w/v) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was prepared in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl. A sample of postnuclear supernatant (1 ml) was loaded on top of 11 ml of Percoll solution and centrifuged for 50 min at 4 °C at 20,000 ×g using a 75Ti fixed-angle rotor (Beckman). Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient and counted. The distribution of plasma membranes was determined be the recovery of125I counts from surface-labeled proteins. The lysosomes were found in the higher density fractions, as assessed by the distribution of β-hexosaminidase activity. [35S]Heparan sulfate chains were isolated from pooled fractions and analyzed by gel filtration HPLC as described above. Cell surface proteoglycans in CHO cells are either shed into the growth medium or taken up by endocytosis. The internalized proteoglycans undergo degradation with accumulation of intracellular oligosaccharides of intermediate (10–20-kDa) and small (4–7-kDa) size prior to complete degradation in lysosomes (6Bame K.J. Robson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2245-2251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Bame K.J. J. Biol.

One or more cellular heparanases catalyze the formation of these intermediate and small size fragments (6Bame K.J. Robson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2245-2251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These enzymes apparently require the presence ofN-sulfated glucosamine residues in the chains, butO-sulfate groups appear to be dispensable (14Oldberg Å. Heldin C.-H. Wasteson A. Busch C. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, much of the evidence derives from in vitro studies of partially purified enzymes with defined substrates. To test this hypothesis directly in cells, we examined the turnover of heparan sulfate chains in a CHO cell mutant (pgsF-17) defective in 2-O-sulfation of uronic acid residues. This mutant produces heparan sulfate chains with normal levels of 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues and iduronic acid and somewhat higher levels ofN-sulfated glucosamine residues (60% GlcNSO3 in the mutant versus 45% in the wild-type). In contrast, the mutant fails to make any 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues due to a deficiency in a 2-O-sulfotransferase (32Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Analysis of steady-state labeled [35S]heparan sulfate chains by gel filtration HPLC showed that wild-type cells contain large, intermediate, and short chains, in agreement with previous studies (6Bame K.J. Robson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2245-2251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutant contained only large chains that eluted near the void volume of the TSK 2000 column (Fig. 1). Their elution position on a TSK 4000 column (K av ∼0.4) indicated anM r of ∼8 × 104 (28Tumova S. Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The lack of intermediates in the mutant indicated that their formation somehow depended on 2-O-sulfation of the uronic acid residues. To confirm this hypothesis, mutant cells were transfected with a cDNA clone encoding the CHO 2-O-sulfotransferase (30Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected by replica plating using125I-bFGF blotting to detect colonies that produced cell surface heparan sulfate (32Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Several colonies that bound bFGF strongly were purified, and one was characterized in greater detail. By enzymatic assay, the transfectant contained a normal level of 2-O-sulfotransferase activity (118 ± 10 pmol/min/mg of cell protein versus 98 ± 10 in the wild-type and 15 ± 5 pmol/min/mg of cell protein in pgsF-17 cells). 2The products generated in crude extracts of wild-type cells consisted of ∼85% 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues and 15% GlcNSO3 or 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues. The sulfated products made in the mutant were entirely GlcNSO3 and a small amount of 6-O-sulfate esters (32Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Analysis of [35S]heparan sulfate chains from the transfectant by gel filtration HPLC showed that both intermediate and small sized chains were present in the transfectant (Fig. 2). These findings confirmed that the altered processing of the chains in the mutant was due to reduction in 2-O-sulfation of the uronic acid residues. Further studies were therefore performed to determine the cause for the degradation defect (e.g. altered secretion, endocytosis, heparanase cleavage, or lysosomal degradation).Figure 2Gel filtration HPLC of [35S]heparan sulfate obtained from mutant cells, wild-type cells, and mutant cells transfected with a cDNA encoding the 2-O-sulfotransferase.

[35S]Heparan sulfate proteoglycans were isolated from the growth medium (secreted or shed material in solution), the cell surface (trypsin-releasable), and intracellular pools that remained with the cell pellet after trypsin treatment of the cells and centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The heparan sulfate chains found on cell surface proteoglycans were large in size (M r ∼8 × 104) (28Tumova S. Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and decreased in amount very rapidly during the chase in both wild-type and mutant cells (Fig. 3, A and B). During the chase, chains were recovered in increasing amounts from the growth medium, but the chains remained large in size in both cells. The intracellular pool behaved very differently in mutant and wild-type cells. At the start of the experiment, most of the label was in large chains, presumably associated with newly made proteoglycans in the Golgi and proteoglycans recently internalized from the cell surface. In addition, wild-type cells contained a small amount of intermediate and small sized chains (Fig. 3 E, filled circles). These fragments accumulated during the chase as the large chains decreased. The large chains in the mutant also declined with time, and a small shift in elution position occurred, suggesting slow, incomplete cleavage (Fig. 3 F). Some intermediate and small sized chains accumulated as well, but the extent of cleavage was greatly reduced compared with the wild-type. Thus, the mutant produced few degradation intermediates by puls"
https://openalex.org/W2074058827,"It is widely believed that Fanconi anemia cells possess a reduced ability to repair inter-strand DNA cross-links. While the mechanism through which inter-strand DNA cross-links are removed from mammalian chromosomes is unknown, these lesions are repaired via homologous recombination in lower eukaryotes and bacteria. Based on the hypothesis that a similar mechanism of DNA repair functions in mammalian somatic cells, we measured homologous recombination activity in diploid fibroblasts from healthy donors, and Fanconi anemia patients. Somewhat surprisingly, homologous recombination levels in nuclear protein extracts prepared from Fanconi anemia cells were nearly 100-fold higher than in extracts prepared from control cells. We observed a similar increase in the activity of a 100-kDa homologous DNA pairing protein in extracts from Fanconi anemia cells. Transfection studies confirmed that plasmid homologous recombination levels in intact Fanconi anemia cells were substantially elevated, compared with control cells. These results suggest that inappropriately elevated levels of homologous recombination activity may contribute to the genomic instability and cancer predisposition that characterize Fanconi anemia.

Individuals suffering from the autosomal recessive disorder Fanconi anemia (FA) 1The abbreviations used are: FA, Fanconi anemia; HR, homologous recombination; NEO, neomycin phosphotransferase; POM, pairing on membrane. have a greatly elevated risk for leukemia and other malignancies (1Auerbach A.D. Allen R.G. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1991; 51: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The disease is genetically heterogeneous, with at least five distinct complementation groups having been identified (2Joenje H. Lo Ten Foe J.R. Oostra A.B. van Berkel C.G.M.

The major clinical features of this illness include progressive pancytopenia, and a number of congenital abnormalities (3Glanz A. Fraser F.C. J. Med. Genet. 1982; 19: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In affected individuals, the incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia is nearly 15,000-fold greater than the general population, and these individuals are also at a higher risk of developing solid tumors (1Auerbach A.D.

FA cells show enhanced levels of spontaneous and induced chromosome breakage (7Auerbach A.D. Wolman S.R. Nature. 1976; 261: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and are particularly susceptible to the clastogenic and cytotoxic effects of DNA damaging agents such as diepoxybutane and mitomycin-C (7Auerbach A.D. Wolman S.R. Nature. 1976; 261: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thesein vitro findings, in conjunction with the clinical predisposition to cancer suggest that the primary genetic defects in FA may involve DNA repair or recombination genes. Since these cells are not particularly sensitive to ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, or to monofunctional alkylating agents such as ethyl methane sulfonate or methyl methane sulfonate, it appears likely that the affected DNA repair pathway is specific for the removal of DNA cross-links. In light of evidence that the nucleotide excision repair pathway functions to remove intra-strand cross-links (8Huang J.-C. Zamble D.B. Reardon J.T. Lippard S.J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10394-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), it would appear that the defect in FA cells involves specifically the removal of inter-strand DNA cross-links. The recent observations that inter-strand DNA cross-link binding activity is absent from protein extracts prepared from FA complementation group A cells (10Hang B. Yeung A.T. Lambert M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4187-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and that these cells possess a diminished ability to remove DNA cross-links in vitro (11Rousset S. Nocentini S.

Res. 1987; 184: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar) further support this hypothesis. Numerous studies of lower eukaryotes and bacteria have provided strong evidence that lesions of this type are removed via homologous recombination (HR) in those organisms (13Sinden R.R. Cole R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 538-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sinden R.R. Cole R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2373-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Salles B.

A number of recent observations suggest that mammalian somatic cells also utilize HR to repair DNA damage. First, mammalian homologs of the yeast Rad51 protein (18Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), which is itself a functional homolog of the bacterial strand transferase recA (19Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 20Sung P.

Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and shown to be expressed in somatic cells. Second, it has been determined that the Rad51 protein localizes to discrete foci within murine somatic cells that have been exposed to DNA damaging agents. These foci were shown to be sites of unscheduled DNA synthesis, suggesting that they were sites of DNA repair activity (22Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Third, mammalian homologs of another yeast recombinational repair gene, RAD52, have been identified (23Muris D.F.R. Bezzubova O. Buerstedde J.-M. Vreeken K. Balajee A.S. Osgood C.J. Troelstra C. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Ostermann K. Schmidt H. Natarajan A.T. Eeken J.C.J. Lohman P.H.M. Pastink A. Mutat.

Overexpression of either the yeast (26Johnson B.L. Thyagarajan B. Krueger L. Hirsch B. Campbell C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or human (27Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) RAD52 genes in mammalian somatic cells has been shown to enhance cellular homologous recombination, and confer resistance to DNA damaging agents, including the DNA cross-linking agent diepoxybutane. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the apparent DNA repair deficiency in Fanconi anemia cells could result from defective recombinational repair. In apparent contradiction to this model, a previous study indicated that HR levels in SV40-immortalized FA cells were indistinguishable from those seen in wild-type cells (28Timme T.L. Wood C.M. Moses R.E. Plasmid. 1989; 22: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, we (29Thyagarajan B. McCormick-Graham M. Romero D.P. Campbell C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4084-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and others (30Finn G.K. Kurz B.W. Cheng R.Z. Shmookler Reis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4009-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that HR levels are greatly elevated in both spontaneously and virally immortalized cells. These latter observations suggested that it would be more appropriate to examine homologous recombination levels in diploid cells from Fanconi anemia patients. In this report we describe our results indicating that nuclear protein extracts prepared from Fanconi anemia cells obtained from two unrelated donors catalyze elevated levels of inter-plasmid homologous DNA recombination activity. We also demonstrate that these extracts possess substantially elevated levels of a 100-kDa homologous DNA pairing protein, that has been previously associated with immortalized cells (29Thyagarajan B. McCormick-Graham M. Romero D.P. Campbell C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4084-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Finn G.K. Kurz B.W. Cheng R.Z. Shmookler Reis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4009-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that plasmid recombination substrates introduced into Fanconi anemia cells undergo greatly elevated levels of intra-molecular homologous recombination. We discuss the possible relationship between this elevated HR activity, and the genomic instability and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents known to be associated with Fanconi anemia. Diploid fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CeRel, HG261) or provided by Dr. Robert O'Dea, University of Minnesota. All diploid cells were used at passage numbers between 6 and 12. The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 (31Rasheed S. Nelson-Rees W.A. Toth E.M. Arnstein P. Gardner M.B. Cancer. 1974; 33: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Raju Kucherlapati, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum, in a humidified, 5% CO2environment. Extracts were prepared from growing cells exactly as described (32Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). HR catalyzed by cell-free extracts was performed essentially as described (32Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using either of two plasmid substrate pairs: 1) double-stranded circular plasmids pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR (Ref. 34Kucherlapati R.S. Eves E.M. Song K.-Y. Morse B.S. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, see Fig. 1 A), or 2) SalI linearized pSV2neoDL and single-stranded circular ssneoDR (Ref. 35Rauth S. Song K.-Y. Ayares D. Wallace L. Moore P.D. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, see Fig. 1 B). Briefly, 500 ng of each of these plasmids were incubated with nuclear protein extracts prepared from human fibroblasts, purified, and used to electroporate the recombination-defective Escherichia coli strain DH10B using a Life Technologies Cell-Porator. The ratio of kanamycin-resistance (resulting from the generation of an intact neomycin phosphotransferase gene, see Fig. 1) to ampicillin resistance (both parental molecules confer ampicillin resistance) permits one to calculate the frequency with which HR has occurred within the extract. Control experiments were performed in parallel in which the two plasmids are separately incubated with the extracts and subsequently purified, combined, and used to transform bacteria. The frequency of HR seen in these controls was subtracted from that seen in coincubated samples to determine the frequency with which HR occurred within the extract. In the experiments described in this report this “background recombination” frequency was always 10–20-fold lower than that seen in extracts prepared from cells possessing elevated levels of HR. The pairing-on-membrane (POM) assay described by Akhmedov et al. (36Akhmedov A.T. Bertrand P. Corteggiani E. Lopez B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was used to quantitate the amount of homologous DNA pairing activity present in nuclear protein extracts from normal, immortalized, or FA cells. Briefly, the assay measures the ability of protein immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane to catalyze the pairing of linear double-stranded DNA (which is in solution) with homologous single-stranded circular DNA that is also immobilized on the membrane. This pairing is detectable because the double-stranded DNA is labeled by incorporation of radioactive nucleotides using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase. This double-stranded DNA contains a region of approximately 1.5 kb that is not homologous to the immobilized single-stranded DNA. Depending upon where this DNA is linearized, it is possible to create molecules that lack complementarity on either or both ends (see Fig. 4). When double-stranded DNA lacking any complementarity to the immobilized single-stranded DNA is used in these experiments, we do not detect any pairing activity. Homologous recombination activity within human fibroblasts was measured with plasmid pSV2neoDR:DL(D) (see below) as described previously (29Thyagarajan B. McCormick-Graham M. Romero D.P. Campbell C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4084-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, we utilized calcium phosphate co-precipitation (37Keown W.A. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 185: 527-537Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to cointroduce a replication-defective plasmid pRSVEdl884 (38Ray F.A. Peabody D.S. Cooper J.L. Cram L.S. Kraemer P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 42: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) encoding the SV40 large T antigen along with the plasmid recombination substrate. Following a 48-h incubation, low molecular weight DNA was recovered (39Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and digested with the restriction endonucleaseDpnI, to remove unreplicated plasmid DNA. The recombination substrate pSV2neoDR:DL(D) will replicate during this incubation period due to the presence of the SV40 large T antigen. As a consequence, methyl adenine moieties (introduced into the plasmid during its amplification in the bacterial host that produced it) will be replaced by non-methylated adenine residues, rendering these plasmids resistant to the restriction endonuclease DpnI. The pRSVEdl884 plasmid, which lacks an origin of replication, along with plasmid molecules that have not entered the cell nucleus during transfection, or have not replicated, will be degraded by the restriction endonuclease. This restriction-digested material is used to transform recombination-deficient E. coli, and the bacteria plated on ampicillin or ampicillin plus kanamycin containing plates. As in the cell-free recombination described above, the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies indicates the total number of plasmids recovered, while the number of kanamycin-resistant colonies indicates the number of recombinant plasmids present. Control experiments indicate that the frequency of HR seen under these conditions is significantly greater than that which occurs when pSV2neoDR:DL(D) is directly introduced into E. coli. In all cases, the data represent the pooled results obtained from at least 6 separate transfections. Single- and double-stranded M13mp18 were obtained from New England Biolabs. The construction of plasmids pSV2neoDL (34Kucherlapati R.S. Eves E.M. Song K.-Y. Morse B.S. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), pSV2neoDR (34Kucherlapati R.S. Eves E.M. Song K.-Y. Morse B.S. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and pRSVEdl884 (37Keown W.A. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 185: 527-537Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have been previously described. Restriction digestion of pSV2neoDL yields 4 bands of sizes 2.2, 1.4, 0.96, and 0.92 kb, while similar digestion of pSV2neoDR yields bands of 2.4, 1.4, 0.96, and 0.64 kb. These bands are referred to in descending size as bands A (2.4 kb) through F (0.64 kb). Bands C (1.4 kb) and D (0.96 kb) are common to both plasmids (see Fig. 2 C). Plasmid pSV2neoDR:DL(D) was constructed by introducing a Klenow-treated HindIII,SmaI fragment of pSV2neoDL (containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene) into the Klenow-treated EcoRI site of pSV2neoDR. Note that the transcriptional orientation of both the neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) genes within this plasmid is counterclockwise. Single-stranded circular molecules were derived from ssneoDR which was made by introducing the NEO gene from pSV2neoDR into M13mp18. We wanted to test the hypothesis that FA cells possess altered levels of homologous DNA recombination activity. A number of well established assays may be used to measure HR activity. In all cases, the approach involves the detection of recombinant, or joint, molecules that have been formed from two distinct, yet homologous, DNA sequences. In general, these assays involve measuring HR in either nuclear protein extracts, or in whole cells that have been transfected with recombination substrate. Ideally, to provide compelling evidence that HR activity in FA cells is altered relative to normal cells, it would be desirable to obtain similar results using both cell-free as well as intact cell systems. Toward this end, we initially measured HR activity in cell-free extracts from FA cells, using two different recombination assay systems. The FA cells used in this study were non-transformed, diploid fibroblasts derived from two unrelated individuals. Nuclear protein extracts (32Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were prepared from diploid fibroblasts from two unrelated FA patients, and from normal donors. We initially measured the ability of these different extracts to catalyze HR between two double-stranded circular plasmids, pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR (see Fig. 1). Using the recombination substrate pair of pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR, HR levels in the FA cells were elevated 10–20-fold, relative to the normal cells, in which HR activity was undetectable (Table I). Interestingly, the HR activity in the FA cells was nearly as great as that seen in the transformed cell line HT1080.Table IHomologous recombination catalyzed by nuclear protein extracts prepared from normal, FA, and immortal fibroblastsCellsHomologous recombination frequency1-aHomologous recombination frequency is expressed as the number of recombinant colonies per million non-recombinant colonies, ±S.E.pSV2neoDR + pSV2neoDL Normal 11-bFibroblasts obtained from two unrelated normal donors.<0.051 Normal 21-bFibroblasts obtained from two unrelated normal donors.<0.025 FA11-cFibroblasts obtained from Fanconi anemia donors.

Open table in a new tab To extend this finding, we repeated the HR assays using the substrate pair of double-stranded pSV2neoDL, linearized with the restriction enzyme SalI, and single-stranded ssneoDR (see Fig. 1). This substrate pair yields lower levels of background HR activity (see “Experimental Procedures”), providing a better opportunity to determine the extent to which HR in FA cell-derived extracts is elevated, relative to extracts from normal cells. As Table I indicates, we observed that HR levels in the FA-derived extracts were between 50 and 100-fold greater than those seen in extracts from normal cells, and nearly indistinguishable from those seen in the immortalized HT1080 cell extracts. HR activity levels seen in this latter cell line are similar to those seen in other immortal cell lines (29Thyagarajan B. McCormick-Graham M. Romero D.P. Campbell C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4084-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Finn G.K. Kurz B.W. Cheng R.Z. Shmookler Reis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4009-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cell-free HR assay relies upon complementation of the strand-transferase deficiency ofrecA− E. coli (32Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results presented indicate that joint molecules can be formed between two circular double-stranded molecules (substrate pair A, Fig. 1), or between a single-stranded circular molecule and a double-stranded linear molecule (substrate pair B, Fig. 1). However, it is conceivable that a combination of enzymatic activities (for example, the concerted actions of an endonuclease and an annealing activity) within the extract could generate a joint molecule. Indeed, a number of reports indicate that such a process, referred to as single-strand annealing, can be detected in cultured mammalian cell lines and in Xenopus oocytes (40Seidman M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Lin F.-L.M. Sperle K. Sternberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 42Lin F.-L.M.

Biol. 1992; 12: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In principle, therefore, it is possible that single-strand annealing, as opposed to “traditional” HR is responsible for the formation of kanamycin-resistant colonies represented in Table I. Fortunately, it is possible to distinguish between these two recombination pathways (44Symington L.S. Fogarty L.M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1983; 35: 805-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 45Kucherlapati R. Moore P.D. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Biochemical Aspects of Homologous Recombination in Mammalian Somatic Cells in Genetic Recombination. ASM, Washington, D. C.1988: 575-595Google Scholar, 46Thyagarajan B. Padua R.A. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27536-27543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As Fig. 2 Aillustrates, the single-strand annealing pathway predicts that the kanamycin-resistant product of HR between double-stranded pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR will be monomeric pSV2neo. In contrast, since authentic HR is conservative, this pathway (Fig. 2 B) will yield two NEO genes, one of which will be full-length. Note that the nature of this second allele will depend upon a host of factors, including, for example, whether gene conversion or reciprocal recombination has occurred. The major distinguishing feature of these two pathways is that single-strand annealing yields a single NEO gene, whereas authentic homologous recombination produces two genes. Since co-transformation of E. coli with two plasmid molecules does not occur to an appreciable extent in our system (data not shown) the demonstration that kanamycin-resistant bacteria harbor two alleles of the NEO gene would strongly support the hypothesis that authentic HR is responsible for the generation of kanamycin-resistant colonies. Plasmid DNA was isolated from a number of kanamycin-resistant bacterial colonies derived from cell-free HR reactions (using the substrate pair of pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR) catalyzed by FA cell-derived nuclear protein extracts. This material was treated with the restriction enzymePstI, and separated on a 1% agarose gel. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” digestion with this endonuclease permits one to identify the presence of either or both of the NEO genes. An ethidium bromide-stained gel of two such digests is presented in Fig. 2 C. Lanes 1–3 contain pSV2neoDL, pSV2neoDR, and pSV2neo wild-type, respectively. Lanes 4 and 5 contain DNA from kanamycin-resistant colonies obtained from a cell-free HR experiment. As the figure indicates, in both cases, bands corresponding to full-length as well as both deletion alleles are present (see legend to Fig. 2 and “Experimental Procedures”). Electrophoresis of uncut plasmid DNA from these two colonies indicates that they both contained a single, dimeric plasmid (not shown). These two observations confirm that both of these colonies arose following a single reciprocal (conservative) HR event, such as is depicted in Fig. 2 B. An expanded analysis of this type determined that 83% (25/30) of the kanamycin-resistant colonies harbored two NEO genes, while 17% (5/30) contained a single, wild-type gene. (In 5 out of 30 cases, we recovered one wild-type NEO gene and one NEO gene harboring both the pSV2neoDL-derived and pSV2neoDR-derived deletions. In these latter cases, we concluded that a single reciprocal recombination event had occurred. It is noteworthy that we detect both reciprocal and non-reciprocal, or apparent gene conversion, events in this system. In addition, intra-molecular recombination appears to occur with some frequency within the E. coli host, converting dimeric molecules to mixed monomers.) As these results indicate, in the great majority of cases (83%), conservative HR, rather than non-conservative single-strand annealing is responsible for the formation of joint molecules within the nuclear protein extracts. The analysis of recombinant plasmid DNA described above is consistent with our hypothesis that authentic HR has occurred within the nuclear protein extracts. To obtain additional, independent support that HR activity present in the FA (and immortalized) fibroblasts, and absent in the normal fibroblasts was responsible for the results depicted in Table I, we turned to the POM assay (36Akhmedov A.T. Bertrand P. Corteggiani E. Lopez B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This in situ assay demonstrates the presence of homologous DNA pairing activity, and has been used to detect a 100-kDa recombination protein in nuclear extracts prepared from immortalized mammalian somatic cells (36Akhmedov A.T.

https://openalex.org/W1997606154,"The Escherichia coli DnaA protein, as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, promotes the initiation of chromosomal replication by binding to four asymmetric 9-mer sequences termed DnaA boxes in oriC. Characterization of N-terminal, C-terminal, and internal in-frame deletion mutants identified residues near the C terminus of DnaA protein required for DNA binding. Furthermore, genetic and biochemical characterization of 11 missense mutations mapping within the C-terminal 89 residues indicated that they were defective in DNA binding. Detailed biochemical characterization of one mutant protein bearing a threonine to methionine substitution at position 435 (T435M) revealed that it retained only nonspecific DNA binding activity, suggesting that threonine 435 imparts specificity in binding. Finally, T435M was inactive on its own for in vitro replication of an oriC plasmid but was able to augment limiting levels of wild type DnaA protein, consistent with the proposal that not all of the DnaA monomers in the initial complex are bound specifically to oriC and that direct interaction occurs among monomers."

We present here the first identification of a serine/threonine kinase that possesses an RNP-type RNA recognition motif: KIS. We originally isolated KIS in a two-hybrid screen through its interaction with stathmin, a small phosphoprotein proposed to play a general role in the relay and integration of diverse intracellular signaling pathways. Determination of the primary sequence of KIS shows that it is formed by the juxtaposition of a kinase core with little homology to known kinases and a C-terminal domain that contains a characteristic RNA recognition motif with an intriguing homology to the C-terminal motif of the splicing factor U2AF. KIS produced in bacteria has an autophosphorylating activity and phosphorylates stathmin on serine residues. It also phosphorylates in vitro other classical substrates such as myelin basic protein and synapsin but not histones that inhibit its autophosphorylating activity. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses indicate that KIS overexpressed in HEK293 fibroblastic cells is partly targetted to the nucleus. Altogether, these results suggest the implication of KIS in the control of trafficking and/or splicing of RNAs probably through phosphorylation of associated factors.

Evidence is growing that controls of RNA processing and translation are major mechanisms associated with the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. These controls involve numerous RNA-protein interactions mediated by protein domains that in most cases are characterized by specific sequence features (for reviews see Refs.1Kenan D.J. Query C.C.

Of these, RNA recognitionmotifs (RRMs) 1The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor. 1The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor.are the best characterized. RRM domains are regions of about 80 amino acids containing several well conserved residues, some of which cluster into two short submotifs, RNP-1 (octamer) and RNP-2 (hexamer). One or more RRMs are found in a variety of RNA-binding proteins, and the identification within a sequence of an RRM is a strong indication that the function of this protein involves binding to RNA (2Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is another important aspect of the regulation of RNA processing; phosphorylation seems to be involved at multiple steps of RNA processing, most probably through various mechanisms. Spliceosome assembly has been shown to be inhibited by phosphatase 1 (4Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 13: 5679-5688Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Following assembly the spliceosome activation requires dephosphorylation events (5Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Tazi J. Kornstadt U. Rossi F. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Lurhmann R. Nature. 1993; 363: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Different kinases have been proposed to be involved in these processes (see references in Ref. 7Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm phosphorylation of eIF-2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α-subunit) inhibits translational initiation of the majority of mRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 8Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of eIF-4E (the smallest subunit of the cap-binding factor eIF-4F) correlates with enhanced translation (for review see Ref. 9Altmann M. Trachsel H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 429-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this context of growing evidence of the importance of phosphorylation in RNA processing, we present here the first complete identification and analysis of a serine/threonine kinase, KIS, that possesses an RRM. We initially identified KIS as a putative kinase interacting with stathmin in the two-hybrid system. We therefore called this kinase KIS for “kinase interacting withstathmin” (10Maucuer A. Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Stathmin is a small ubiquitous cytoplasmic heat soluble protein that is enriched in neurons. Its phosphorylation is highly regulated in correlation with very diverse cell regulations including neuronal differentiation, T cell activation, stress, and cell cycle progression (11Schubart U.K. J.

At least four serines of stathmin can be phosphorylated in vivo, and the same sites are in vitro substrates for a variety of kinases including cdks, PKA, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (17Beretta L.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and in particular stathmin has recently been proposed to be a key regulator of microtubule dynamics (24Belmont L.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We present here the complete sequence determination of rat KIS showing the presence of a characteristic RNA recognition motif. We further demonstrate and characterize the serine kinase activity of this protein and its cytoplasmic as well as nuclear localization when overexpressed in cultured cells. These results strongly indicate that KIS could be an important actor in the regulation of RNA processing through phosphorylation of associated factors. Using the insert of the previously cloned mouse KIS cDNA (10Maucuer A. Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a rat striatum library in lambda zap (Stratagene) was screened according to standard protocols (26Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 1633-base pairEcoRI-SspI insert covering the entire reading frame of rat KIS was isolated from one of the cloned cDNAs (KR11, ∼5000-base pair insert), reinserted into pBluescript previously restricted with EcoRI and EcoRV to yield clone BS-KR1, and sequenced on both strands using synthetic oligonucleotides (Genset) and the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit from Amersham Corp. The entire reading frame was confirmed by sequencing the same region on four other cloned cDNAs. The NBRF/PIR, SwissProt, GenBank, Prints, Prosite, Saccharomyces cerevisiae complete genomic, Caenorhabditis elegans genomic, and EST data bases were searched for homologous proteins using the BLAST and/or FASTA programs (27Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9328) Google Scholar). Digoxygenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were prepared using the BS-KR1 construct. In situ hybridization on embryos at 14 days of gestation was then performed using previously described procedures (28Henrique D. Adam J. Myat A. Chitnis A. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Nature. 1995; 375: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The complete KIS coding sequence was inserted into the prokaryotic GST fusion expression vector pGEX-KG that is derived from pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) by insertion of a 5-Gly linker in between theSmaI and EcoRI sites (kindly provided by F. Schweissguth, CNRS, France). GST-KIS was produced from a 100-ml overnight culture of transformed Xl1blue after induction with 0.4 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside for 1.5 h as described (29Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). After purification on glutathione-Sepharose beads and elution with 500 μl of a 40 mm reduced glutathione solution, the kinase solution was dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmEDTA and adjusted to 1 ml with glycerol before freezing at −80 °C. Phosphorylation reactions were performed in 20 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, using either 10 μl of GST-KIS solution, 75 ng of the catalytic subunit of the PKA or 200 units of p34cdc2, 0.3–1 μg of the different substrates, and 0.2 μl of γ-32P-labeled ATP at 10 mCi/ml and 3000 Ci/mmol. PKA, histone mixture, and myelin basic protein were from Sigma. Stathmin was prepared as described previously (30Curmi P. Maucuer A. Asselin A. Lecourtois M. Chaffotte A. Schmitter J.M. Sobel A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). p34cdc2 was a kind gift from Drs. M. Dorée and J. C. Labbé (INSERM U249, Montpellier, France). After 1 h at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by adding SDS migration buffer, loaded on 13% acrylamide gel, and analyzed by autoradiography. For phosphoamino acid and phosphopeptide mapping, labeled proteins were excised and processed as described (17Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized twice with 200 μg of a synthetic peptide (CPLSAYKRGYLYQTLL) coupled to keyhole lympet hemocyanin; this peptide corresponds to the 15-amino acid C-terminal sequence of KIS with an additional cysteine for coupling. Serum C6 collected 7 weeks after the second injection was selected for purification. 2 ml of serum were loaded on a column made by coupling 500 μg of peptide to 1 g of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B; antibodies were eluted with 0.1m glycine and then buffered with Tris-HCl to neutral pH. The coding sequence of rat KIS was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) to allow constitutive expression of KIS under the cytomegalovirus promoter, episomal replication, and hygromycin selection. HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 200 μg/ml G418 (because the particular HEK293 cell line used (Invitrogen) possesses neomycin resistance). Transfections were performed with 105 cells in a 35-mm plate using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μg of pCEP4-KIS according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Cells were exposed to the transfection mix for 6 h and fixed for immunofluorescence 30 h post-transfection or further cultured in selecting medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin. The medium was changed every 2 days for 2 weeks until an homogeneous hygromycin-resistant population was obtained; cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in SDS gel loading buffer for Western blot analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by standard methods (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, Western blotting was carried out as described previously (33Koppel J. Boutterin M.-C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3703-3707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications: transfer was performed in a buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, and 20% isopropanol. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 1 h using 5% dry milk in 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 160 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The purified antibody was then added at a 1:20 dilution in blocking buffer with 1% milk. After overnight incubation the blot was washed and probed with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) before development using ECL (Amersham Corp.). Phase contrast and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus Provis fluorescence microscope. Cells were fixed for 8 min with methanol at minus 20 °C. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, the purified anti-KIS antibody (1:10 dilution) was added for overnight incubation. After washes with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) were used to visualize the staining pattern. Hoechst 33258 stain (Molecular Probes) at 100 μg/ml in water was used to visualize cell nuclei. Using the partial mouse KIS cDNA previously found to encode a stathmin interacting domain in the two-hybrid system, we isolated a rat striatum cDNA covering the entire coding sequence of KIS mRNA, which by in situhybridization experiments appeared to be expressed mainly in the developing nervous system (Fig. 1). The translation initiation site was determined by the presence of a nonambiguous Kozak consensus sequence leading to the translation of a putative 419-amino acid protein (Fig. 2 A). This open reading frame was confirmed by sequencing of a cDNA from a neonate mouse brain library that coded for the first 414 amino acids of mouse KIS with 99% amino acid identity with rat KIS. After release of our sequence in the EMBL data base, part of the same sequence encoding amino acids 21–419 has been identified in a two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (34Alam M.R.

Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and has actual kinase activity (see below). Alignments with protein kinase sequences shows that KIS does not belong to a previously defined subfamily of kinases. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of KIS showed 42% identity in a 98-amino acid overlap with the C-terminal RRM containing domain of hU2AF65, the mammalian 65-kDa subunit of the splicing factor U2AF (36Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). U2AF is known to specifically bind polypyrimidine tracts associated with 3′ splice sites (see Ref. 7Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarfor a review), and deletion of this RRM domain from a GST-hU2AF65 fusion dramatically reduced its binding to RNA (36Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The tertiary structures of RRM domains of U1-A (A polypeptide of the U1 snRNP) and of hnRNP C have been solved and were found to be very similar (reviewed in Ref. 2Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). They form a βαββαβ structure with a four-stranded antiparallel β sheet separating the two α helices on one side and an RNA interacting surface on the other side. Two RNP submotifs are localized in the central β1 and β3 strands and have conserved solvent exposed aromatic residues that are implicated in contacting RNA. Secondary structure predictions of the RRM domains of KIS and U2AF are consistent with this overall tertiary structure and location of the RNP submotifs (Fig. 2 B). Altogether the C-terminal domain of KIS appears to contain a bona fide RNA recognition motif showing a striking similarity to the C-terminal motif of U2AF65, including its specific features. To characterize the kinase activity of KIS, we produced a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli (Fig. 3 A). GST-KIS has autophosphorylation activity and also phosphorylates stathmin on serine residues, thus showing that KIS is actually a serine kinase (Fig. 3,B and C). Surprisingly, comparison of the phosphopeptide maps obtained with stathmin phosphorylated by KIS, PKA, and p34cdc2 showed that KIS phosphorylates stathmin on a site different from those already known to be phosphorylated in vivo (17Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 D). This result was confirmed with phosphorylation site mutants of stathmin (not shown). Thus, this novel phosphorylation of stathmin might correspond to a particular regulatory role of stathmin in a cell type or cell situation that has not been explored until now. We tested KIS specificity using various classical substrates. KIS could phosphorylate synapsin and myelin basic protein in vitro(Fig. 4 A). As expected, replacement of the active site lysine 54 with arginine (R54mutant form) totally suppressed its kinase activity. Interestingly, KIS could not phosphorylate histones (whereas PKA did in the same experiment), and even autophosphorylation of KIS was dramatically inhibited by histones but not by spermidine and polylysine (which like histones are basic molecules), suggesting a specific inhibition of KIS in the nucleus (see below). Further work is in progress to identify physiological substrates for KIS and corresponding regulations. We also asked whether the C-terminal RRM-containing domain could regulate the kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 4 B, a truncated form of KIS composed of residues 1–309 and lacking this C-terminal domain was still autophosphorylated, but this activity was reduced compared with that of full-length KIS, indicating a role for the C-terminal domain in activating the kinase. This experiment also showed that the residue (or one of the residues) that gets autophosphorylated is between residues 1 and 309. We raised an antibody against a C-terminal peptide and purified it on the peptide-coupled column. KIS, when overexpressed in fibroblastic HEK293 cells, was detected with this purified antibody by Western blot as a single ∼50-kDa band, in agreement with its calculated molecular mass (46.5 kDa) (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). Although KIS could not be detected in tissue extracts probably because of its low expression, we recently identified a protein in HeLa cells with the expected molecular mass that was recognized by the purified antibody (Fig. 5 A, lane 4) but not after preincubation with the peptide antigen (Fig. 5 A, lane 5). Cell fractionation showed that about 20% of the protein was in the nuclear extract of transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 B). KIS could also be detected by immunofluorescence when highly expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 6). Whereas most labeled cells displayed a damaged morphology, others displayed a speckled labeling corresponding to the nucleus, sometimes together with a homogeneous labeling in the cytoplasm. No labeling was observed when the purified serum was incubated with the peptide antigen. These results indicate that in these conditions of overexpression, KIS is partially targetted to the nucleus.Figure 6Localization of KIS overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Cells were fixed with methanol 30 h after transfection and processed for immunofluorescence detection with the purified anti-KIS antiserum. Phase contrast and Hoechst staining are also shown. The arrow indicates a typical speckled labeling of a cell nucleus, whereas most labeled cells displayed a damaged morphology (arrowhead). Some cells displayed also a cytoplasmic diffuse labeling that is not discernable on this photograph.

Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the present work, we cloned a rat brain cDNA encoding the full-length protein. We demonstrate the expression of the KIS gene, the actual kinase activity of KIS protein, and the presence of a C-terminal RNA recognition motif. These features together with the partial nuclear targetting of the overexpressed protein provide a strong indication for a role of KIS in the phosphorylation events involved in the regulation of RNA processing. In situ hybridization on E14 embryos showed the preferential expression of KIS mRNA in nervous structures, suggesting a role for KIS in the developing nervous system, in agreement with previous Northern blot results (10Maucuer A. Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this preferential expression fits also the expression profile of stathmin and related neuronal proteins potentially interacting with KIS (37Ozon, S., Maucuer, A., and Sobel, A. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). Although the antibodies raised against a peptide of its C-terminal domain did not allow until now a direct detection of the KIS protein in tissues, they did recognize a protein with the expected molecular size in HeLa cells that could thus correspond to a particularly high expression of KIS in these cells. Antisera directed to other parts of the molecule should allow further and more direct characterization of the physiological expression of KIS in tissues and during development. Sequence analysis indicates that KIS is a protein kinase because it displays all the conserved residues characteristic of protein kinases, but it does not belong to a defined subfamilly inasmuch the sequence of its catalytic core does not share a particular homology with another characterized kinase. Furthermore, KIS is the only kinase that possesses an RRM known so far, and as such it might be the first identified member of a novel kinase family. The in bacterioproduced protein has actually autophosphorylating as well as serine kinase activity toward stathmin. Interestingly phosphorylation of stathmin is not on a site known to be phosphorylatable in vivo. This novel phosphorylation of stathmin might correspond to a particular regulatory function of this ubiquitous regulatory protein. Conversely, the interaction of stathmin with KIS might also reflect a regulatory action of stathmin on this enzyme. In our in vitro phosphorylation conditions using the recombinant protein, KIS also phosphorylates other classical kinase substrates such as myelin basic protein and synapsin, indicating a weak substrate specificity. However, KIS could not phosphorylate histones, and even autophosphorylation was dramatically reduced in the presence of histones. This inhibition might reflect a physiological regulation of KIS, in agreement with its partial nuclear targetting when overexpressed in HEK293 cells. KIS might also be regulated through phosphorylation by other kinases. In particular the tyrosine residue in position 191 in the catalytic loop might correspond to the one that is implicated in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Thus phosphorylation of this residue could be necessary to get full activity of KIS. Further work is in progress to identify physiological substrates of KIS and regulatory secondary modifications or cofactors that could be involved in regulating its activity. In particular, the C-terminal domain of KIS that contains the RNA recognition motif is probably involved in targetting and/or regulating the kinase activity. Accordingly, a mutant form of KIS in which the C-terminal domain has been removed has a weaker autophosphorylating activity in our in vitro phosphorylation conditions. The strong homology with the peculiar C-terminal RRM-containing domain of the splicing factor U2AF65 is probably the result of duplication of a corresponding exon. Thus, the homology of these two domains probably reflects a conserved function. Together with the presence of an RRM motif, this specific homology with an RRM domain that has been shown to participate in RNA binding strongly indicates that the C-terminal domain of KIS interacts with RNA. The homology with U2AF suggests further that KIS could preferentially bind polypyrimidine tracts, whereas the presence of a single RRM (in contrast with the presence of multiple RRMs often found in RNA-binding proteins) suggests that the binding of KIS to RNA could require the previous binding to one or several cofactors. Two previously identified kinases, which are interestingly both eIF-2 kinases and involved in protein expression controls, are thought to be regulated through interaction with RNA: 1) binding of the mammalian PKR to RNA is mediated by two conserved double-stranded RNA binding domains that are N-terminal to the kinase core (for review see Ref. 38Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and 2) GCN2 from S. cerevisiae interacts with tRNA through a domain C-terminal to the kinase core that does not contain an RRM but shows sequence similarity to the histidyl-tRNA synthetases (39Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). KIS differs strikingly from these two RNA-interacting kinases, because it possesses a very characteristic RRM and because it does not belong to the eIF-2 kinase family on the basis of sequence comparison (in particular it lacks homology to the consensus sequence LFIQME between kinase subdomains V and VI that seemingly characterizes the eIF-2 kinases and participates in substrate binding (42Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, its particular nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression suggest that KIS function involves the phosphorylation of nuclear or shuttling components of the RNA processing machinery. This potential involvement of KIS in trafficking and/or RNA processing will be further investigated, as well as its interactions with stathmin and other putative partners such as peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (34Alam M.R.

https://openalex.org/W1970951301,"Expression of the rabbit pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) gene is lung-specific, occurs primarily in type II cells, and is developmentally regulated. We previously identified two E-box-like enhancers, termed the distal binding element (DBE) and proximal binding element (PBE), in the 5′-flanking region of the rabbit SP-A gene. In the present study, the PBE was used to screen a rabbit fetal lung cDNA expression library; a cDNA insert was isolated which is highly similar in sequence to human upstream stimulatory factor 1 (hUSF1). By use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, two isoforms of rabbit USF1 (rUSF1) mRNAs were identified in fetal rabbit lung and other tissues. The levels of rUSF1 mRNAs reach a peak in fetal rabbit lung at 23 days gestation, in concert with the time of initiation of SP-A gene transcription. Binding complexes of nuclear proteins obtained from fetal rabbit lung tissue and isolated type II cells with the DBE and PBE were supershifted by the addition of anti-rUSF1 IgG. Binding activity was enriched in type II cells compared with lung fibroblasts. Overexpression of rUSF1s in A549 adenocarcinoma cells positively regulated SP-A promoter activity of cotransfected reporter gene constructs. It is suggested that rUSF1s, which bind to two E-box elements in the SP-A gene 5′-flanking region, may serve a key role in the regulation of SP-A gene expression in pulmonary type II cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042298776,"The pgr1 + gene encoding glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) was isolated fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe using a polymerase chain reaction fragment as a probe. The gene consists of two exons and an intron of 55 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 465 amino acids (50,238 Da) with conserved residues characteristic of GR. The transcriptional start site was localized at 239 nucleotides upstream from the ATG initiation codon. The level of transcript as well as the GR enzyme activity increased more than 11-fold when the clonedpgr1 + gene was expressed on a multicopy plasmid. This overexpression conferred on S. pombe cells more resistance against menadione, a redox cycling agent, but not against H2O2. The level ofpgr1 + transcripts increased by treatment with oxidants such as menadione, cumene hydroperoxide, and diamide. It also increased by treatment with high osmolarity, heat shock, or at the stationary growth phase. The deletion of thepap1 + gene encoding an AP-1 homolog in S. pombe caused reduction in the pgr1 + gene expression. Furthermore, Δpap1 cells lost the inducibility of pgr1 + gene expression by the above stresses, implying that Pap1 is involved in general stress-inducible gene expression.

Repression of nmt1 promoter-drivenpgr1 + expression by thiamine caused cessation of growth, which was rescued by the episomalpgr1 + gene.

Glutathione (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine, GSH) is one of the most prevalent reducing thiols in eukaryotic cells, which functions in many biological processes such as protein and DNA synthesis, transport, modulation of enzyme activity, and metabolism of various xenobiotics and free radicals (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar, 2Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSH is oxidized nonenzymatically through the reaction with disulfides, metals, and reactive oxygen species, or through peroxidase-mediated reaction, yielding oxidized glutathione (GSSG). GSSG is known to be very toxic to biological molecules due to its high reactivity with free sulfhydryl groups. The intracellular ratio of GSH to GSSG, therefore, is usually kept high in most eukaryotic cells examined (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The reduction of GSSG to GSH is efficiently mediated by glutathione reductase (GR), 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glutathione reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; MD, menadione; STRE, stress-response element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium. 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glutathione reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; MD, menadione; STRE, stress-response element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium. using NADPH specifically as a reducing equivalent (4Carlberg I Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5475-5480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GR is a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of flavoenzymes, which includes thioredoxin reductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, mercury reductase, and trypanothione reductase (5López-Barea J. Bárcena J.A. Florindo J. Garcı́a-Alfonso C. López-Ruis A. Martı́nez-Galisteo E. Peinado J. Vina J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, London1990: 105-116Google Scholar).In addition to glutathione, several peptide thiols such as thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx), which contain redox-active dithiol groups, provide reducing environment to the cell as electron (hydrogen) donors (6Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Holmgren A. Åslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). They provide hydrogens to specific reductases that reduce ribonucleotide for DNA synthesis, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate for generating cysteine, and methionine sulfoxide to repair oxidized protein (6Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo A. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). They also provide hydrogen to glutathione peroxidase (11Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Åkesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trx is reduced by Trx reductase using NADPH. Grx is reduced by GSH using its own thiol-disulfide exchange activity. Recently a regulatory network of Trx, Grx, and GSH for the efficient regulation of the level of ribonucleotide reductase has been proposed in Escherichia coli, in which GSH, Trx, and Grx all compensate for each other (12Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In prokaryotes the role of GSH is not well characterized. An E. coli mutant (gshA − deficient in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) contains less than 0.4% of the wild-type GSH but is as resistant as the wild type against treatments with oxidants, heat, or γ-ray (13Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, glutathione reductase-deficient (gor −) mutants maintained the highly reduced glutathione pool, suggesting that GSSG can be reduced independently of GR (14Tuggle C.K. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 448-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Either Grx or Trx system can carry out this function (15Russel M. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition lipoate can function as a hydrogen donor of Grx in the absence of GSH (12Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thegor − mutant, however, exhibited sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and diamide, a thiol oxidizing agent, suggesting that GR protects cells from oxidative damage. Recent work in E. coli demonstrates that GSH defends cells against attack by chlorine compounds (16Chesney J.A. Eaton J.W. Mahoney Jr., J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2131-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GSH is critically required for aerobic survival as well as protection against oxidative stress, as judged from the phenotype of mutants deficient of GSH synthesis (17Kistler M. Maier K. Eckardt-Schupp F. Mutagenesis. 1990; 5: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The adaptation to hydrogen peroxide was suppressed by depleting GSH (20Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The GLR1 gene encoding GR in S. cerevisiae is required in defending cells against oxidative stress judging from the marked sensitivity of the glr1 disruptant to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat (21Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 156: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the gene is not essentially required for normal aerobic growth. The dispensibility of GR seems to be due to the presence of Trx since glr1 trx1 trx2 triple mutant is not viable, suggesting the functional overlap of GR and Trx in S. cerevisiae (23Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). TheGLR1 gene of S. cerevisiae is induced by hydrogen peroxide in a manner dependent on yAP-1, a yeast homolog of mammalian AP-1 (22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Schizosaccharomyces pombe displays different physiology fromS. cerevisiae and is probably more closely related to higher eukaryotes (24Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). S. pombe cells adapt to oxidative stress accompanied by the induction of several antioxidant enzymes (25Lee J. Dawes I.W. Roe J.-H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The induction pattern of these enzymes is quite different from that ofS. cerevisiae. For example, hydrogen peroxide induce catalase and peroxidase whereas menadione (MD), a redox cycling agent which can generate superoxide radical (O·̄2), could induce not only catalase and peroxidase but superoxide dismutase, GR, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, S. pombecells pretreated with MD are adapted for subsequent shock of hydrogen peroxide, but not vice versa, implying different effects of these oxidants in cellular induction of defense mechanisms (25Lee J. Dawes I.W. Roe J.-H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under the same laboratory condition, S. pombe cells are more resistant to hydrogen peroxide and MD than is S. cerevisiae. Part of this resistance can be ascribed to higher levels of catalase and GSH/GSSG ratio. As a first step to examine the role of GSH in the physiology of S. pombe, we isolated thepgr1 + gene encoding GR in S. pombeand hereby report its characterization. The regulation of its expression was examined under different stressful conditions, and the involvement of Pap1, a S. pombe homolog of mammalian AP-1 (26Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), was investigated. Surprisingly, we found that GR is essentially required for the aerobic growth of S. pombe, and thepgr1 + gene is regulated by Pap1 for induction upon various stressful conditions.DISCUSSIONThe expression of the pgr1 + gene encoding GR in S. pombe is induced by various oxidants, heat shock, high osmolarity, and starvation. We observed that MD induced the expression of pgr1 + gene, whereas H2O2 did not. In comparison, GR of S. cerevisiae is reported to be induced by H2O2 at the transcript level (22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The induction of pgr1 + by cumene hydroperoxide and diamide to a level comparable with MD suggests that oxidants in general can trigger the expression of pgr1 +. The inert response toward H2O2 cannot result from the action of relatively high level of catalase found in this organism for the following reasons: 1) addition of 0.2 mmH2O2 was sufficient to induce adaptive response against further H2O2 treatment at lethal dose, and 2) the 10-fold higher concentration (2 mm) of H2O2 was not effective for inducingpgr1 + expression, either (Fig. 5). These suggest that H2O2 does not produce the signal to inducepgr1 + gene expression, whereas other oxidants do.Whatever the internal signal and its transduction pathway is, the observation that the induction of pgr1 + gene expression by various external stresses is mediated by Pap1 suggests that different external stimuli may merge into a common path in the Pap1-dependent transcription of thepgr1 + gene. Similar example of induction by multiple external stresses are found in catalase gene expression inS. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Catalase is induced by H2O2, MD, high osmolarity, UV, and starvation (25Lee J. Dawes I.W. Roe J.-H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43Nakagawa C.W. Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 109-116.44Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Catalase T (encoded by CTT1) ofS. cerevisiae has been shown to be regulated by various stresses via stress-response element (STRE) (44Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 45Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Although the role of catalase in such stressful conditions is not fully understood, the presence of CTT1 is required for cell viability under severe osmotic stress and heat shock (45Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, it has also been suggested that heat-induced cell death is mediated by reactive oxygen species as observed in oxidative stress conditions (46Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestle R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, different external stimuli may share the common signal inside the cell, thus co-activate the same transcriptional activator. The activation of mammalian AP-1 by various external stimuli has been documented to proceed via redox-regulated reaction (47Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 48Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is tempting to speculate that the Pap1-dependent induction of pgr1 + by oxidants and possibly by various other stresses may involve reactive oxygen species in the internal signaling pathway. In S. cerevisiae, the osmotic stress response is mediated by STRE through the signaling of Hog1p, a mitogen-activated protein kinase found in S. cerevisiae. Although STRE mediates induction by multiple stresses partly through the binding of Msn2p, the Hog1p signaling path is activated only by osmotic stress (45Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 49Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The Hog1p homolog in S. pombe has been identified as Sty1/Spc1 (50Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It transmits the signal from the external stimuli such as osmotic, oxidative, and heat stresses as well as UV irradiation to the transcription factor Atf1, which then activates transcription of such genes encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and catalase (51Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toon W.M. Shieh J.-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar,52Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A putative Atf1 binding sequence was found in the upstream of thepgr1 + gene. However it remains to be investigated whether Atf1 also regulates thepgr1 + expression in response to various stimuli as Pap1 did in this study. An interesting implication of Sty1-Atf1 signal cascade is that this pathway may be distinctively different from the one involving Pap1, since purified Sty1 did not phosphorylate Pap1 (51Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toon W.M. Shieh J.-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Our results imply that there could be an alternative pathway inS. pombe, which senses oxidative stress and/or other stress signals and transduces the signals through Pap1 to thepgr1 + gene expression.The involvement of Pap1 in defending S. pombe cells against oxidative stress has been partly confirmed by the hypersensitive phenotype of Δpap1 cells against H2O2 and MD. 2J.-H. Roe and J. Lee, unpublished results. A parallel phenomenon has been observed in S. cerevisiae in which yAP-1 confers resistance against various kinds of chemicals, including oxidants (53Schnell N. Krems B. Entian K.-D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It has been shown that yAP-1 regulates several oxidative defense enzymes such as thioredoxin (encoded by TRX2) (54Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), GR (encoded by GLR1) (22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), as well as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (encoded by GSH1) (18Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via AP-1 responsive element present in their promoters. It also plays a role in regulating the induction of H2O2 adaptive response (55Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and is responsible for the stationary phase induction of GR gene inS. cerevisiae (56Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), just as Pap1 is responsible for the stationary phase induction of pgr1 + gene.The growth defect of Δpgr1 strain is not complemented by adding free thiol compounds such as GSH orN-Acetyl-l-cysteine to the media, suggesting that the lowered amount of GSH is not the cause of growth arrest. This is consistent with the observation that the limited supply of GSH is not so much detrimental in this yeast, as mutants containing lowered level of GSH has been isolated (57Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GR depletion in JL36 by thiamine led to the increased accumulation of total glutathiones, possibly by triggering GSH synthesis system as observed in glr1 mutant of S. cerevisiae (23Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of GR GSSG was not reduced efficiently and accumulated as oxidized form (Table II). Therefore the results suggest that the accumulation of oxidized GSSG rather than limited supply of GSH is the cause of growth inhibition. Furthermore it can be concluded that S. pombecells are in constant need for GR activity to reduce (remove) GSSG, to ensure normal proliferation. The indispensibility of GR in S. pombe growth is a unique phenomenon, suggesting that the alternative pathways to remove GSSG such as Trx, Trx reductase, Grx, or the lipoamide and lipoamide dehydrogenase system as proposed inE. coli and S. cerevisiae may not function efficiently to reduce GSSG in S. pombe. Glutathione (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine, GSH) is one of the most prevalent reducing thiols in eukaryotic cells, which functions in many biological processes such as protein and DNA synthesis, transport, modulation of enzyme activity, and metabolism of various xenobiotics and free radicals (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar, 2Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSH is oxidized nonenzymatically through the reaction with disulfides, metals, and reactive oxygen species, or through peroxidase-mediated reaction, yielding oxidized glutathione (GSSG). GSSG is known to be very toxic to biological molecules due to its high reactivity with free sulfhydryl groups. The intracellular ratio of GSH to GSSG, therefore, is usually kept high in most eukaryotic cells examined (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.2nd Ed.

The reduction of GSSG to GSH is efficiently mediated by glutathione reductase (GR), 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glutathione reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; MD, menadione; STRE, stress-response element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium. 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glutathione reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; MD, menadione; STRE, stress-response element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium. using NADPH specifically as a reducing equivalent (4Carlberg I Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5475-5480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GR is a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of flavoenzymes, which includes thioredoxin reductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, mercury reductase, and trypanothione reductase (5López-Barea J. Bárcena J.A. Florindo J. Garcı́a-Alfonso C. López-Ruis A. Martı́nez-Galisteo E. Peinado J. Vina J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, London1990: 105-116Google Scholar). In addition to glutathione, several peptide thiols such as thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx), which contain redox-active dithiol groups, provide reducing environment to the cell as electron (hydrogen) donors (6Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Holmgren A. Åslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). They provide hydrogens to specific reductases that reduce ribonucleotide for DNA synthesis, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate for generating cysteine, and methionine sulfoxide to repair oxidized protein (6Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo A. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). They also provide hydrogen to glutathione peroxidase (11Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Åkesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trx is reduced by Trx reductase using NADPH. Grx is reduced by GSH using its own thiol-disulfide exchange activity. Recently a regulatory network of Trx, Grx, and GSH for the efficient regulation of the level of ribonucleotide reductase has been proposed in Escherichia coli, in which GSH, Trx, and Grx all compensate for each other (12Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes the role of GSH is not well characterized. An E. coli mutant (gshA − deficient in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) contains less than 0.4% of the wild-type GSH but is as resistant as the wild type against treatments with oxidants, heat, or γ-ray (13Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, glutathione reductase-deficient (gor −) mutants maintained the highly reduced glutathione pool, suggesting that GSSG can be reduced independently of GR (14Tuggle C.K. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 448-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Either Grx or Trx system can carry out this function (15Russel M. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition lipoate can function as a hydrogen donor of Grx in the absence of GSH (12Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thegor − mutant, however, exhibited sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and diamide, a thiol oxidizing agent, suggesting that GR protects cells from oxidative damage. Recent work in E. coli demonstrates that GSH defends cells against attack by chlorine compounds (16Chesney J.A. Eaton J.W. Mahoney Jr., J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2131-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GSH is critically required for aerobic survival as well as protection against oxidative stress, as judged from the phenotype of mutants deficient of GSH synthesis (17Kistler M. Maier K. Eckardt-Schupp F. Mutagenesis. 1990; 5: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The adaptation to hydrogen peroxide was suppressed by depleting GSH (20Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The GLR1 gene encoding GR in S. cerevisiae is required in defending cells against oxidative stress judging from the marked sensitivity of the glr1 disruptant to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat (21Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 156: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the gene is not essentially required for normal aerobic growth. The dispensibility of GR seems to be due to the presence of Trx since glr1 trx1 trx2 triple mutant is not viable, suggesting the functional overlap of GR and Trx in S. cerevisiae (23Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). TheGLR1 gene of S. cerevisiae is induced by hydrogen peroxide in a manner dependent on yAP-1, a yeast homolog of mammalian AP-1 (22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Schizosaccharomyces pombe displays different physiology fromS. cerevisiae and is probably more closely related to higher eukaryotes (24Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). S. pombe cells adapt to oxidative stress accompanied by the induction of several antioxidant enzymes (25Lee J. Dawes I.W. Roe J.-H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The induction pattern of these enzymes is quite different from that ofS. cerevisiae. For example, hydrogen peroxide induce catalase and peroxidase whereas menadione (MD), a redox cycling agent which can generate superoxide radical (O·̄2), could induce not only catalase and peroxidase but superoxide dismutase, GR, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, S. pombecells pretreated with MD are adapted for subsequent shock of hydrogen peroxide, but not vice versa, implying different effects of these oxidants in cellular induction of defense mechanisms (25Lee J. Dawes I.W. Roe J.-H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under the same laboratory condition, S. pombe cells are more resistant to hydrogen peroxide and MD than is S. cerevisiae. Part of this resistance can be ascribed to higher levels of catalase and GSH/GSSG ratio. As a first step to examine the role of GSH in the physiology of S. pombe, we isolated thepgr1 + gene encoding GR in S. pombeand hereby report its characterization. The regulation of its expression was examined under different stressful conditions, and the involvement of Pap1, a S. pombe homolog of mammalian AP-1 (26Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), was investigated. Surprisingly, we found that GR is essentially required for the aerobic growth of S. pombe, and thepgr1 + gene is regulated by Pap1 for induction upon various stressful conditions. DISCUSSIONThe expression of the pgr1 + gene encoding GR in S. pombe is induced by various oxidants, heat shock, high osmolarity, and starvation. We observed that MD induced the expression of pgr1 + gene, whereas H2O2 did not. In comparison, GR of S. cerevisiae is reported to be induced by H2O2 at the transcript level (22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The induction of pgr1 + by cumene hydroperoxide and diamide to a level comparable with MD suggests that oxidants in general can trigger the expression of pgr1 +. The inert response toward H2O2 cannot result from the action of relatively high level of catalase found in this organism for the following reasons: 1) addition of 0.2 mmH2O2 was sufficient to induce adaptive response against further H2O2 treatment at lethal dose, and 2) the 10-fold higher concentration (2 mm) of H2O2 was not effective for inducingpgr1 + expression, either (Fig. 5). These suggest that H2O2 does not produce the signal to inducepgr1 + gene expression, whereas other oxidants do.Whatever the internal signal and its transduction pathway is, the observation that the induction of pgr1 + gene expression by various external stresses is mediated by Pap1 suggests that different external stimuli may merge into a common path in the Pap1-dependent transcription of thepgr1 + gene. Similar example of induction by multiple external stresses are found in catalase gene expression inS. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Catalase is induced by H2O2, MD, high osmolarity, UV, and starvation (25Lee J. Dawes I.W. Roe J.-H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43Nakagawa C.W. Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 109-116.44Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Catalase T (encoded by CTT1) ofS. cerevisiae has been shown to be regulated by various stresses via stress-response element (STRE) (44Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 45Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Although the role of catalase in such stressful conditions is not fully understood, the presence of CTT1 is required for cell viability under severe osmotic stress and heat shock (45Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, it has also been suggested that heat-induced cell death is mediated by reactive oxygen species as observed in oxidative stress conditions (46Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestle R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, different external stimuli may share the common signal inside the cell, thus co-activate the same transcriptional activator. The activation of mammalian AP-1 by various external stimuli has been documented to proceed via redox-regulated reaction (47Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 48Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is tempting to speculate that the Pap1-dependent induction of pgr1 + by oxidants and possibly by various other stresses may involve reactive oxygen species in the internal signaling pathway. In S. cerevisiae, the osmotic stress response is mediated by STRE through the signaling of Hog1p, a mitogen-activated protein kinase found in S. cerevisiae. Although STRE mediates induction by multiple stresses partly through the binding of Msn2p, the Hog1p signaling path is activated only by osmotic stress (45Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 49Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The Hog1p homolog in S. pombe has been identified as Sty1/Spc1 (50Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It transmits the signal from the external stimuli such as osmotic, oxidative, and heat stresses as well as UV irradiation to the transcription factor Atf1, which then activates transcription of such genes encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and catalase (51Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toon W.M. Shieh J.-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar,52Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A putative Atf1 binding sequence was found in the upstream of thepgr1 + gene. However it remains to be investigated whether Atf1 also regulates thepgr1 + expression in response to various stimuli as Pap1 did in this study. An interesting implication of Sty1-Atf1 signal cascade is that this pathway may be distinctively different from the one involving Pap1, since purified Sty1 did not phosphorylate Pap1 (51Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toon W.M. Shieh J.-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Our results imply that there could be an alternative pathway inS. pombe, which senses oxidative stress and/or other stress signals and transduces the signals through Pap1 to thepgr1 + gene expression.The involvement of Pap1 in defending S. pombe cells against oxidative stress has been partly confirmed by the hypersensitive phenotype of Δpap1 cells against H2O2 and MD. 2J.-H. Roe and J. Lee, unpublished results. A parallel phenomenon has been observed in S. cerevisiae in which yAP-1 confers resistance against various kinds of chemicals, including oxidants (53Schnell N. Krems B. Entian K.-D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It has been shown that yAP-1 regulates several oxidative defense enzymes such as thioredoxin (encoded by TRX2) (54Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), GR (encoded by GLR1) (22Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), as well as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (encoded by GSH1) (18Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via AP-1 responsive element present in their promoters. It also plays a role in regulating the induction of H2O2 adaptive response (55Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and is responsible for the stationary phase induction of GR gene inS. cerevisiae (56Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), just as Pap1 is responsible for the stationary phase induction of pgr1 + gene.The growth defect of Δpgr1 strain is not complemented by adding free thiol compounds such as GSH orN-Acetyl-l-cysteine to the media, suggesting that the lowered amount of GSH is not the cause of growth arrest. This is consistent with the observation that the limited supply of GSH is not so much detrimental in this yeast, as mutants containing lowered level of GSH has been isolated (57Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GR depletion in JL36 by thiamine led to the increased accumulation of total glutathiones, possibly by triggering GSH synthesis system as observed in glr1 mutant of S. cerevisiae (23Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of GR GSSG was not reduced efficiently and accumulated as oxidized form (Table II). Therefore the results suggest that the accumulation of oxidized GSSG rather than limited supply of GSH is the cause of growth inhibition. Furthermore it can be concluded that S. pombecells are in constant need for GR activity to reduce (remove) GSSG, to ensure normal proliferation. The indispensibility of GR in S. pombe growth is a unique phenomenon, suggesting that the alternative pathways to remove GSSG such as Trx, Trx reductase, Grx, or the lipoamide and lipoamide dehydrogenase system as proposed inE. coli and S. cerevisiae may not function efficiently to reduce GSSG in S. pombe. The expression of the pgr1 + gene encoding GR in S. pombe is induced by various oxidants, heat shock, high osmolarity, and starvation. We observed that MD induced the expression of pgr1 + gene, whereas H2O2 did not. In comparison, GR of S. cerevisiae is reported to be induced by H2O2 at the transcript level (22Grant C.M.

Addition of 100 units/ml SOD or 10 μmof the nitroxides 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPOL), 3-carboxy-proxyl, and 3-ethoxycarbonyl-proxyl, increased the chemiluminescence signal. The effect of these nitroxides on the amount of ⋅NO released from cell monolayers was dose-dependent, with the highest efficacy between 30 and 100 μm. EPR spin trapping in SIN-1 solutions revealed the formation of ⋅OH adducts from spontaneous dismutation of O·̄2 and concomitant reaction with H2O2. Both SOD and TEMPOL increased the signal intensity of the ⋅OH adduct by accelerating the dismutation of O·̄2. The results of this study demonstrate that the SOD-mimetic activity of nitroxides increases the amount of bioavailable ⋅NO in vitro. Nitroxides are known to exert superoxide dismutase-mimetic properties and to decrease O·̄2- and H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity. However, the effect of nitroxides on ⋅NO homeostasis has not been studied yet. The present study investigates the effect of nitroxides on the detectable amount of ⋅NO released by 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) and cultured endothelial cells. Cultured bovine aortic and atrial endothelial cells stimulated with 10 μm A23187 released a stable flux of ⋅NO, as detected by ⋅NO chemiluminescence. Addition of 100 units/ml SOD or 10 μmof the nitroxides 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPOL), 3-carboxy-proxyl, and 3-ethoxycarbonyl-proxyl, increased the chemiluminescence signal. The effect of these nitroxides on the amount of ⋅NO released from cell monolayers was dose-dependent, with the highest efficacy between 30 and 100 μm. EPR spin trapping in SIN-1 solutions revealed the formation of ⋅OH adducts from spontaneous dismutation of O·̄2 and concomitant reaction with H2O2. Both SOD and TEMPOL increased the signal intensity of the ⋅OH adduct by accelerating the dismutation of O·̄2. The results of this study demonstrate that the SOD-mimetic activity of nitroxides increases the amount of bioavailable ⋅NO in vitro.

The physicochemical properties allow ⋅NO to serve as a biological messenger.⋅NO can exert cytoprotective and cytotoxic effects depending on its concentration, site of generation, and the reactions it undergoes (1Moncada S.

Released from endothelial cells, it acts as an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) with anticoagulant and antithrombotic properties (4Rubanyi G.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22: S1-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Disturbances in ⋅NO release and its decreased stability and bioactivity are proposed to be a major part of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, ischemia, or hypertension (5Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5758) Google Scholar, 6Halliwell B. Br. Med. J. 1993; 307: 885-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Rubanyi G.M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1988; 4: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Like ⋅NO, superoxide anion (O·̄2) is a free radical with a relatively low overall reactivity (e.g. compared with the hydroxyl radical, ⋅OH). It is formed as an intermediate in a variety of enzymatic reactions and is kept within a physiological concentration range by superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) (8Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7761-7764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar). It has been shown that SOD increases the half-life of EDRF released from isolated arteries (10Rubanyi G.M. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H815-H821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated O·̄2 production (e.g. via the xanthine oxidase, arachidonic acid, or NADH oxidoreductase pathway) and a concomitant increase in cytotoxicity are described for different pathological conditions (11Katusic Z.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The reaction of O·̄2 with ⋅NO at a diffusion controlled rate not only depletes both radicals, it also leads to the formation of more toxic species, such as peroxynitrite (12Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar, 13Beckman J.S. Crow J.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Thus, superoxide dismutase-mimetic compounds could be of therapeutic interest in the conventional context (e.g. as antiinflammatory agents; Ref.14Shuff S.T. Chowdhary P. Khan M.F. Sorenson J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1601-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) but also by increasing the lifetime and biological activity of⋅NO. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a well known nitrovasodilator simultaneously releasing ⋅NO and O·̄2(15Feelisch M. Ostrowski J. Noack E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: S13-S22Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), provides a model system for evaluation of the interaction of both species and the influence of SOD-mimetic compounds. Among SOD-mimetic compounds, low molecular weight copper or iron complexes were found to be very effective (16Haseloff R.F. Gruner S. Wischnewsky G.G. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1992; 7: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17Nagano T. Hirano T. Hirobe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9243-9249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoprotection, at least partly due to SOD-like activity, was also reported for nitroxides, a class of free radicals widely applied as tools in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (18Zhang R. Hirsch O. Mohsen M. Samuni A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A subgroup of nitroxides, nitronyl nitroxides, can be used for ⋅NO detection (19Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Hyde J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); however, reduction by O·̄2 and other reducing agents limits its application (20Haseloff R.F. Zöllner S. Kirilyuk I.A. Grigor'ev I.A. Reszka R. Bernhardt R. Mertsch K. Roloff B. Blasig I.E. Free Radical Res. 1997; 26: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in SchemeFS1, nitroxides can oxidize O·̄2 to molecular oxygen (I). The resulting hydroxylamine is EPR-silent and is oxidized back to the nitroxide by reducing another O·̄2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (II) (21Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Riesz P. Finkelstein E. Russo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture studies revealed an inhibition of superoxide-mediated cytotoxicity and mutagenicity by nitroxides similar to SOD (22Hahn S.M. Krishna C.M. Samuni A. DeGraff W.G. Cuscela D.O. Johnstone P. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2006S-2010SPubMed Google Scholar, 23DeGraff W.G. Krishna M.C. Russo A. Mitchell J.B. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1992; 19: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although SOD activity of nitroxides could not be found by stopped-flow kinetic analysis (24Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nitroxides have been identified as genuine SOD mimetics rather than O·̄2 scavengers by direct and indirect physicochemical methods (25Krishna M.C. Russo A. Mitchell J.B. Goldstein S. Dafni H. Samuni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26026-26031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Additionally, protection against oxidative damage independent of O·̄2 and H2O2 was found and proposed to result from nitroxide-mediated oxidation of redox-active trace metal ions (26Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. DeGraff W. Krishna C.M. Samuni U. Russo A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because of the predominantly intracellular generation of O·̄2, membrane permeation by SOD mimetics or superoxide scavengers applied to biological systems is an important aspect. Moreover, stability and toxicity have to be considered. Nitroxides fulfill these requirements (27Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Mitchell J.B. Collins C.R. Russo A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 9: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); they are relatively stable low molecular weight compounds with non-immunogenic properties, their toxicity is low, and, most important, their synthesis allows large variations of physicochemical properties, such as lipophilicity. However, the effect of nitroxides on ⋅NO generated by model systems (e.g. SIN-1) or endothelial cells has not been investigated so far. This study demonstrates that, similar to SOD (28Rubanyi G.M. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H822-H827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar), nitroxides augment the detectable amount of ⋅NO released from SIN-1 and cultured endothelial cells by selectively removing O·̄2. SOD was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO, used as described previously; Ref. 30Haseloff R.F. Blasig I.E. Meffert H. Ebert B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) from Aldrich. 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPOL) and 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-N-oxyl (3-carboxy-proxyl, CP) were obtained from Sigma; 3-ethoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-N-oxyl (3-ethoxycarbonyl-proxyl, ECP) was synthesized starting from CP (31Sosnovsky G. Cai Z.-W.J. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 3414-3418Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SIN-1 was supplied by Alexis (San Diego, CA). Gases were provided by Middleton Bay Airgas (San Leandro, CA) and Messer Griessheim (Berlin, Germany). All commercial chemicals were of the highest quality available and purchased from Sigma if not stated otherwise. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC, passages 14–18) (32Halle W. Siems W.E. Jentsch K.D. Teuscher E. Göres E. Pharmazie. 1984; 39: 77-81PubMed Google Scholar) were cultivated on 25-cm2 flasks (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) in minimal essential medium (Eagle's salt) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2 m glutamine, without antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Subcultivation was made twice a week with trypsin/EDTA (0.25% v/v each). Bovine atrial endothelial cells (BAtEC) were prepared as described by Ryan et al. (33Ryan U.S. Mortara M. Whitaker C. Tissue Cell. 1980; 12: 619-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cells were subcultivated to confluence on Corning flasks (162 cm2), seeded at passage 14 in a ratio of 1:3 on six-well plates (Corning), and used at confluence after 3 days of culture. The culture medium was Medium 199 (Earle's salts) containing 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and 25 mm HEPES buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1.0 μm thymidine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Quality of the endothelial cell cultures was verified by phase contrast microscope-detected cobblestone appearance at confluence, presence of factor VIII antigen, contents of alkaline phosphatase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. All cell experiments were performed in physiological salt solution (PSS) supplemented with 1 mml-arginine. For BAEC phosphate-buffered PSS (composition in mm: 136.9 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 9.6 Na2HPO4, 1.5 KH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.9 CaCl2, pH 7.4) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) was used, whereas experiments with BAtEC were performed in 10 mmHEPES-buffered PSS (composition in mm: 140.0 NaCl, 5.0 KCl, 4.5 NaHEPES, 5.5 HEPES, 1.0 MgCl2, 0.0034 EDTA, 1.5 CaCl2, pH 7.4). Prior to the experiments, cells were washed two times with PSS. The determination of ⋅NO was performed using a ⋅NO analyzer NOA270B (BAEC experiments) or NOA280 (BAtEC experiments) (Sievers, Boulder, CO) without use of a reducing agent. The output signal (mV) is proportional to the amount of ⋅NO. The signal was recorded using a chart recorder (Gould, Cleveland, OH) and a modified high performance liquid chromatography data acquisition and calculation system (ACCESS CHROM, Perkin Elmer Nelson Systems, Cupertino, CA) and either expressed as mV (headspace) or as nanomolar concentration of⋅NO (supernatant). The ⋅NO concentration (nm) calculation was performed only with samples from the supernatant solution, where ⋅NO standards were used as a basis of calculation. The ⋅NO release from endothelial cells was measured (a) in samples of the supernatant solution (for BAtEC) and (b) continuously in the headspace (for BAEC). All cell experiments were performed at 37 °C. Cells grown in six-well plates were washed twice with PSS and covered with 1 ml of PSS containing the required agents. After incubation for 30 min, 0.8 ml of the supernatant was injected into a special purge vessel with a gas-tight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV).⋅NO was expelled and transported to the reaction chamber by a stream of helium. The area under the resulting peak was calculated and calibrated with peak areas from ⋅NO standards. Cells grown in flasks (25 cm2) were washed as described for (a) and covered with 2 ml of PSS. Through a tube placed above the supernatant, headspace gas was drawn by vacuum continuously into the reaction chamber. Under these conditions, determination of⋅NO is based on the fixed distribution of gases between liquid and gas phase depending on their solubility. During the experiment the flask was shaken gently in a shaking incubator (Boekel Industries, Feasterville-Trevose, PA). For experiments with SIN-1, 3 ml of freshly prepared aqueous solution was placed into a sealed glass vessel and stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The rubber seal contained two tubes: one for headspace gas that was drawn into the reaction chamber and one inlet for gas exchange. The cell-free experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C). ⋅NO released into the supernatant was quantified by comparison with ⋅NO standards. Diluted ⋅NO gases (65 and 6.8 ppm in N2) were used as standards. For preparation of⋅NO solutions, deionized water was deaerated, saturated with argon, and gassed with a continuous stream of diluted ⋅NO (65 ppm) for at least 20 min, resulting in a concentration of 130 nm at 22 °C. There was no significant difference in the area under the curve using gaseous (6.8 ppm) or liquid standards containing the same amount of ⋅NO. Standard curves were recorded each day. The detection limit was less than 1 pmol (1 nm⋅NO concentration for an injected sample volume of 1 ml) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 for single injections of ⋅NO. The response was linear at least up to 1 μm⋅NO concentration. EPR experiments were carried out at room temperature on a Bruker ECS 106 X-band spectrometer (equipped with a high sensitivity rectangular-mode cavity ER 4102 ST). The samples were placed into a flat quartz cell, and standard experimental conditions were as follows: modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 0.1 mT; field set, 347.5 mT; scan range, 10.0 mT; microwave power, 10 milliwatts. The protein content of BAtEC was measured for selected experiments with a kit for protein determination (per procedure no. TPRO-562, Sigma). Cells were lysed by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 30 min. Bovine serum albumin was used as standard. Cell death was evaluated by quantification of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the cell supernatant as an index for plasma membrane damage (34Thomas J.P. Geiger P.G. Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of LDH was measured with a commercially available cytotoxicity detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The dose response of SOD and nitroxides on ⋅NO release was done in sets of n = 4–6 (n represents the number of experiments performed on different cell cultures or model systems). ⋅NO concentration was expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant difference between means of control and treatment groups was calculated by Student's t test; a value of p < 0.01 was accepted for statistically significant difference. SIN-1 was chosen to study the interaction of ⋅NO with O·̄2 in a cell-free system. The ⋅NO release from freshly prepared aqueous solutions of SIN-1 increased during the first 30–40 min and reached afterwards a stable plateau (Fig. 1, inset) as detected by ozone-mediated chemiluminescence. During the plateau phase, SOD was added to remove O·̄2 produced by SIN-1. The detectable amount of ⋅NO was rapidly elevated by a factor of 16.7 (Fig. 1, trace a; Table I). A similar but less prominent effect was observed when the nitroxides were added under the same conditions (Fig. 1, traces b–d; Table I).Table IIncrease of detectable ·NO released from SIN-1 and from BAtEC by SOD and nitroxidesCompoundSIN-11-aThe values for SIN-1 represent the -fold increase of detectable ·NO in the headspace 15 min after addition of SOD (100 units/ml) or nitroxides (10 μm).BAtEC1-bThe values for BAtEC are the -fold increase of detectable ·NO (measured in the supernatant) by SOD or nitroxides (100 μm) after 30 min of coincubation with 10 μmA23187.Superoxide dismutase16.72.7TEMPOL6.21.63-Ethoxycarbonyl-proxyl3.71.43-Carboxy-proxyl4.51.51-a The values for SIN-1 represent the -fold increase of detectable ·NO in the headspace 15 min after addition of SOD (100 units/ml) or nitroxides (10 μm).1-b The values for BAtEC are the -fold increase of detectable ·NO (measured in the supernatant) by SOD or nitroxides (100 μm) after 30 min of coincubation with 10 μmA23187. Open table in a new tab Addition of 1 mm SIN-1 to a 0.1 m DMPO solution resulted in the appearance of a spin adduct spectrum witha N = a Hβ = 1.49 mT, indicating the formation of the DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct (DMPO/⋅OH, Fig. 2 a). In the presence of either 100 units/ml SOD or 10 μm TEMPOL (giving a strong triplet signal superimposition), a significant increase of the spin adduct signal intensity was found (Fig. 2,b and c). When catalase (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the reaction mixtures, formation of DMPO spin adducts was prevented both in the presence of SOD (Fig. 2 d) and nitroxides (spectra not shown). Endothelial cell monolayers grown in a culture flask are not exposed to flow or shear stress; unstimulated (“basal”)⋅NO release from BAEC was not detected in the headspace of this system. A sustained and reproducible ⋅NO signal was measured after incubation with 1–10 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (5 μm, Fig. 3).⋅NO release was abolished by 0.1 mm N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) in the absence of exogenousl-arginine. Similar to BAEC, exposure of BAtEC to 10 μm A23187 in a six-well plate resulted in an increase of ⋅NO concentration in the supernatant reaching steady state after approximately 15 min and lasting for at least 30 min (12.4 ± 0.7 nm, corresponding to a production rate of approximately 2.3 pmol of⋅NO/min/mg of protein). Addition of SOD resulted in an increase of the amount of⋅NO detected using both BAEC and BAtEC after stimulation with A23187. Fig. 3 displays a representative experiment with BAEC, whereas Fig. 4 illustrates SOD-induced concentration-dependent augmentation of detectable⋅NO released from BAtEC stimulated with different concentrations of A23187. Higher concentrations of SOD (up to 300 units/ml) did not cause a further increase of detectable ⋅NO (data not shown). Addition of TEMPOL to the supernatant of endothelial cells resulted in an effect similar to SOD (see Fig. 3). Fig. 5 shows the dose dependence of the effect of nitroxides on ⋅NO released from BAtEC. Starting at concentrations of 10 μm for TEMPOL and 1 μmfor ECP and CP, the nitroxides significantly (p < 0.01) increased the detectable ⋅NO concentration in the supernatant. The maximum effects of SOD and nitroxides on ⋅NO release from both SIN-1 and endothelial cells are summarized in Table I. The study of the interaction of O·̄2 and ⋅NO is complicated by several factors; both species are unstable, the rate constant of their reaction is exceptionally high, and the concomitant formation of other reactive species has to be considered. These restrictions were taken into account by application of appropriate methods for detection of these radicals: ozone-mediated chemiluminescence (for authentic ⋅NO) and EPR spectroscopy (for other radical species). This approach allowed us to study an effect of SOD-mimetic nitroxides that has not been investigated so far: the influence of these SOD-mimetic compounds on ⋅NO released from SIN-1 and cultured endothelial cells. Two different modes of ⋅NO analysis were used in this study: (a) headspace measurements for qualitative time-course assessment, and (b) discrete sample collection from the supernatant of cells at single time points. The assay of the ⋅NO detection in solution represents absolute values for dissolved⋅NO, whereas headspace measurements allow resolution of the time course of the ⋅NO generation within a period of 5 s. Aqueous solutions of 1 mm SIN-1 resulted in a stable flux of ⋅NO into the headspace after an initial lag phase of approximately 30–40 min. Similarly, spontaneous ⋅NO release measured by the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin has been described by Feelisch et al. (15Feelisch M. Ostrowski J. Noack E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: S13-S22Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In contrast, using a chemiluminescence technique with a helium-flushed, gas-permeable tubing inserted into the SIN-1 solution for sample collection, Beckmanet al. did not observe ⋅NO release in vitro in the absence of SOD (35Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C1424-C1437Crossref Google Scholar). An effective removal of⋅NO from the headspace, as it occurs by reaction with hemoglobin, reduces its depletion by O·̄2. Since O·̄2 and⋅OH enhance sydnonimine decomposition (conversion of SIN-1 to SIN-1A as the rate-limiting step; Ref. 15Feelisch M. Ostrowski J. Noack E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: S13-S22Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), an increase in O·̄2lifetime would potentially favor a higher ⋅NO liberation until a new equilibrium between ⋅NO release into the headspace and⋅NO reaction with O·̄2 is reached. Furthermore, the oxygen-dependent breakdown of SIN-1A might decline under conditions where no oxygen supply is guaranteed, as it would happen in an airtight sealed reaction vessel. Addition of 100 units/ml SOD to SIN-1 solution at the plateau phase of⋅NO release caused a significant 16.7-fold increase in the headspace concentration of ⋅NO (Table I). This effect was also observed after addition of the nitroxides (10 μm). The order of efficacy was as follows: SOD > TEMPOL > CP > ECP (Table I). EPR spin trapping experiments using DMPO were performed to characterize the radical species formed during the decomposition of SIN-1 and to verify the SOD-mimetic activity of nitroxides (26Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. DeGraff W. Krishna C.M. Samuni U. Russo A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Mitchell J.B. Collins C.R. Russo A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 9: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Only DMPO/⋅OH adducts were detected. Since the reaction rate of⋅NO with O·̄2 (6.7 × 109m−1 s−1) and the rate for the spontaneous dismutation of O·̄2 to H2O2(in the range of 105m−1s−1 at pH 7.4; Ref. 36Behar D. Czapski G. Rabani J. Dorfman L.M. Schwarz H.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1970; 74: 3209-3213Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar) is much higher than that of O·̄2 with DMPO (in the range of 101m−1 s−1; Ref. 37Finkelstein E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4994-4999Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar), virtually no O·̄2 can be trapped by DMPO under these conditions. In the presence of trace amounts of metal ions, in particular ferrous ions, reaction of O·̄2 with H2O2 leads to the formation of ⋅OH (Fenton reaction), which in turn reacts with DMPO (in control experiments, addition of iron chelators resulted in a significant reduction of spin adduct formation). In the presence of SOD, the dismutation of O·̄2 (leading to formation of H2O2) is accelerated, increasing the formation of ⋅OH via the Fenton reaction. In the same way, nitroxides elevated the signal intensity of the DMPO/⋅OH adducts. Addition of catalase effectively removes H2O2, and the formation of DMPO/⋅OH is prevented both in the presence and absence of SOD or nitroxides. These results are supported by a recent study showing that SIN-1-mediated cytotoxicity of HepG2 cells is increased by SOD but completely abolished in the presence of catalase (38Gergel D. Misik V. Ondrias K. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our data clearly demonstrate the SOD-mimetic activity of nitroxides in the SIN-1 model system. Furthermore, there is no indication of peroxynitrite-dependent ⋅OH formation, which would be independent from catalase activity (35Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C1424-C1437Crossref Google Scholar, 39Shi X.L. Lenhart A. Mao Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To study the effect of nitroxides on ⋅NO produced by cultured endothelial cells, a stable and maintained ⋅NO release was induced by stimulation of the cells with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 for up to 30 min. Within this time frame, there was no sign of decreased cell viability as measured by release of LDH into the extracellular space (data not shown). Increase of intracellular free calcium concentration is a stimulus not only for ⋅NO production (i.e. activation of endothelial ⋅NO synthase, ecNOS), but for other processes as well, including production of O·̄2(40Cosentino F. Sill J.C. Katusic Z.S. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 41Shimizu S.I. Ishii M. Yamamoto T. Kawanishi T. Momose K. Kuroiwa Y. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1994; 84: 301-314PubMed Google Scholar), which could decrease the detectable amount of ⋅NO (28Rubanyi G.M. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H822-H827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor of NOS, was found to rapidly oxidize ⋅NO through the generation of O·̄2(42Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present study shows that SOD as well as three different nitroxides significantly enhanced the detectable amount of ⋅NO released from cultured endothelial cells by removing O·̄2. Continuous monitoring showed an instantaneous elevation of the steady-state ⋅NO concentration in the headspace gas. This observation has been confirmed by experiments measuring ⋅NO accumulated in the supernatant of cells. The maximum increase in⋅NO concentration was observed at 30 units/ml SOD (≈200 nm) and 30–100 μm nitroxides. The higher concentration required for nitroxides versus SOD (factor > 102), may be explained by the difference in the rate constants for the reaction of O·̄2 with SOD or TEMPOL (i.e. ≈2 × 109m−1 s−1 (43Koppenol W.H. Rodgers M.A.J. Powers E.L. Oxygen and Oxy-Radicals in Chemistry and Biology. Academic Press, New York1981: 671-674Google Scholar) versus4.0 × 105m−1s−1 (44Gadzheva V. Ichimori K. Nakazawa H. Raikov Z. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), respectively). The rank order of efficacy for the four compounds tested was the same in the cell culture and SIN-1 experiments: SOD > TEMPOL > CP > ECP (Table I). The increased detectable concentration of ⋅NO in the presence of the nitroxides could be explained either by enhanced ⋅NO release, decreased ⋅NO removal, or a combination of both. Considering the chemistry of SIN-1 degradation (45Noack E. Feelisch M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: S1-S5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is no reaction known by which SOD or the nitroxides would selectively increase ⋅NO liberation without a concomitant increase in O·̄2 release. Similarly, an activation of ecNOS (direct or indirect via increase of intracellular free calcium concentration or cofactors) leading to an elevated ⋅NO biosynthesis is rather unlikely. Therefore, the most probable explanation is that the nitroxides increase the detectable amount of NO via reducing⋅NO degradation by removal of O·̄2 from the system. The EPR data clearly demonstrated an SOD-like action of the investigated nitroxides in the SIN-1 model. Thus, the most probable explanation for nitroxide-induced increase in detectable ⋅NO release from endothelial cells is the selective removal of O·̄2 by these compounds. Genetically elevated amounts of endogenous SOD (46Chan P.H. Brain Pathol. 1994; 4: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), SOD derivatives (47Beckman J.S. Minor Jr., R.L. White C.W. Repine J.E. Rosen G.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6884-6892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or SOD-mimetic nitroxides (18Zhang R. Hirsch O. Mohsen M. Samuni A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have been reported to reduce the cytotoxic effect of oxygen free radicals in vitro andin vivo. On the other hand, it must be mentioned that decreasing the O·̄2 concentration alone by catalyzing its dismutation does not necessarily reduce an elevated cytotoxic potential (38Gergel D. Misik V. Ondrias K. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The spin trapping experiments point out that catalase activity is required for the further destruction of H2O2 to nontoxic species. In summary, this study demonstrates that the SOD-mimetic activity of nitroxides increase the amount of bioavailable and detectable⋅NO in vitro. Since O·̄2 is a main cause of⋅NO degradation, its removal would be beneficial especially in situations when O·̄2 is increased leading to the inactivation of⋅NO and formation of toxic species such as peroxynitrite (i.e. in arteriosclerosis or inflammation). Since the discovery of SOD-mediated increase in stability of EDRF or ⋅NO in in vitro systems (28Rubanyi G.M. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H822-H827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar), the body of evidence is growing supporting a role of O·̄2 and its effective removal by superoxide dismutation as determinants of ⋅NO bioavailability under physiological and pathological conditions. Nitroxides exert the properties of potential pharmacological agents since they are (compared with SOD) relatively stable low molecular weight compounds without immunogenic properties and with low toxicity (26Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. DeGraff W. Krishna C.M. Samuni U. Russo A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Ankel E.G. Lai C.S. Hopwood L.E. Zivkovic Z. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Their structure allows synthetic modifications necessary for adaptation to the intended use. Nevertheless, it has to be determined in further in vitro and in vivo studies whether the SOD-mimetic properties of nitroxides could be of therapeutic importance against O·̄2-mediated lowering of bioavailable ⋅NO.

Adhesion and chemoattractant receptors are known to trigger activation of Ras in human neutrophils, but the signaling mechanism that activates Ras has only been partially elucidated. The present results show that in neutrophils, a time- and dose-dependent f-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP)-induced activation of Ras is mediated by Gi2-proteins, because such activation is inhibited by pertussis toxin and because direct stimulation of heterotrimeric G-proteins with AlF4− is sufficient to activate Ras. Pretreatment of neutrophils with tyrosine kinase inhibitors,i.e. genistein or erbstatin that completely block FMLP-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylations, did not affect the FMLP-induced activation of Ras.

This recruitment involves several distinct phases, for example adhesion to the vessel wall and subsequent transmigration and locomotion of PMN in a chemotactic gradient(s) formed at the site of infection (1Cramer E.B. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1992: 341-352Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which PMN respond to chemotactic stimuli, such as f-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) and C5a, include their interaction with seven transmembrane-spanning receptors coupled to heterotrimeric Gi2-proteins (2Murphy P.M.

That interaction triggers Gi2-proteins to dissociate into a GTP-bound Gα subunit and a βγ complex, which in turn activate effectors, e.g.various phospholipases, the Src-related tyrosine kinase Lyn, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; Refs. 2Murphy P.M.

Cell. 1992; 40: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3049) Google Scholar), make it crucial to reveal the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Ras. Despite the undoubted relevance of such pathways for the regulation of PMN locomotion, the signaling events mediating chemoattractant-induced activation of Ras has only been partially elucidated.Ras was originally identified as the key signaling protein involved in the regulation of cell growth. The activity of Ras is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), which exchange GDP for GTP on Ras, and by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), which accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (15Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 16Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Two putative GEF, Vav and Sos, have been identified in human leukocytes (15Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The activity of Vav is regulated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation (17Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Science. 1992; 256: 1196-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Margolis B. Hu P.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and possibly by the direct association of this exchange factor with Ras (6Zheng L. Sjölander A. Eckerdal J. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8431-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Gulbins E. Schlottmann K. Brenner B. Lang F. Coggeshall K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Sos, on the other hand, regulates Ras when it is recruited to the cell membrane by the adaptor protein Grb2, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues on Shc proteins and/or receptor tyrosine kinases (15Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 21van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which a receptor might regulate Ras-GAP activity is not clear, although inhibition of GAP activities has been shown to activate Ras in T-cells stimulated via antigen-receptor and in HEL cells stimulated with erythropoietin (22Graves J.D. Downward J. Rayter S. Warne P. Tutt A.L. Glennie M. Cantrell D.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3709-3712PubMed Google Scholar, 23Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8293-8298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ras is now considered to be an initial regulator of multiple signaling pathways that may bifurcate further downstream or at the level of Ras itself (15Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 25Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that engagement of β2 integrins activates Ras through tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and the subsequent association of Vav with Ras (6Zheng L. Sjölander A. Eckerdal J. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8431-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This finding, together with several reports on the ability of different chemoattractants to activate Ras (7Worthen G.S. Avdi N. Buhl A.M. Suzuki N. Johnson G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 815-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Buhl A.M. Avdi N. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies on how such coordination occurs are hampered by the fact that the mechanisms by which Ras are activated in chemoattractant-stimulated PMN have not been fully elucidated. However, indirect studies on the activation of Raf/MAPK, the best defined downstream effectors of Ras, suggest a possible role of tyrosine kinase and/or PI3K in Ras activation (7Worthen G.S. Avdi N. Buhl A.M. Suzuki N. Johnson G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 815-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

The aim of the present study was to increase our knowledge about the mechanism(s) by which Ras is activated by the chemotactic peptide FMLP in human PMN by direct analysis of the ratio of Ras-bound GTP/GDP.DISCUSSIONBy direct analysis of the ratio between GTP and GDP bound to Ras, we here show that stimulation of PMN with FMLP results in a pertussis toxin-sensitive activation of Ras. Apparently, this activation does not require the participation of the two known Ras-GEF expressed in PMN,i.e. Sos and Vav, both of which require the activation of a tyrosine kinase (15Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Instead, FMLP-induced activation of Ras is correlated with a distinct inhibition of Ras-GAP activity in PMN.Agonist activation of Gi-coupled receptors leads to the formation of activated Gα-GTP and the release of Gβγ subunits. In many cell types, the Gβγ subunit has been identified as the primary mediator of Ras activation induced by stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors (2Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 3Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this context, it has been suggested that Gβγ subunits activate a Src-related tyrosine kinase (e.g. Lyn in PMN) that phosphorylates Shc, which allows the formation of Shc-Grb2-Sos complexes and the subsequent activation of Ras (3Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments, neither genistein nor erbstatin affected FMLP-induced activation of Ras, which indicates that a signaling event other than the activation of a tyrosine kinase mediates the Gi2-coupled receptor-induced activation of Ras. This conclusion is supported by our observations that both inhibitors effectively suppressed all detectable FMLP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events and also abolished the β2integrin-mediated activation of Ras in PMN (6Zheng L. Sjölander A. Eckerdal J. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8431-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The present results are substantiated by the recent report that in transfected fibroblasts FMLP can activate MAPK in the absence of Lyn and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (26Torres M. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13244-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In other words, the earlier findings together with our present results indicate that activation of a tyrosine kinase is not involved in the regulation of Ras by Gi2-protein-coupled receptors in PMN, although it might well participate in the further downstream regulation of the MAPK cascade (7Worthen G.S. Avdi N. Buhl A.M. Suzuki N. Johnson G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 815-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Torres M. Hall F.L. O'Neill K.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1563-1567PubMed Google Scholar).Theoretically, Ras is stimulated by the activation of GEF and/or the inhibition of GAP. At present, two putative GEF, i.e. Sos and Vav, have been identified in human leukocytes (15Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The activities of these GEF are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Vav) or by the formation of a complex composed of Sos and its adaptor proteins Grb2-Shc (3Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). The part these GEF play in FMLP-stimulated activation of Ras is now being questioned, because such activation is not affected by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, in our study, stimulation with FMLP did not induce any detectable translocation of either Sos or Grb2 to a membrane fraction of PMN. Thus, it is unlikely that Sos participates in the chemotactic peptide-induced activation of Ras.In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of PI3K or PKC and an increase in [Ca2+]i have also been implicated in the regulation of Ras activity (23Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 39Touhara K. Howes B.E. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was recently reported that PI3K is an early intermediator in the Gβγ-induced activation of Ras in COS cells (43Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The fact that Gβγ-sensitive PI3K is present in PMN (53Stephens L. Smarcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and that FMLP triggers the activation of PI3K (5Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) indicates that this enzyme may regulate the FMLP-induced activation of Ras. However, the possibility of such a regulatory mechanism is refuted by the fact that wortmannin, which completely inhibits PI3K activity in PMN (45Arcaro A. Wyman M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit FMLP-induced activation of Ras in our experiments. Moreover, genistein and wortmannin combined had only a marginal inhibitory effect, which further supports our suggestion that the activation of a tyrosine kinase and/or PI3K is not required for the FMLP-induced activation of Ras in PMN. In agreement with our results, it was recently observed that wortmannin inhibits the activation of Raf/MAPK but not that of Ras in PMN stimulated with C5a and interleukin-8 (9Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2832-2838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These findings imply that activation of Ras and Raf/MAPK activation can be controlled by different regulatory mechanisms. Considering the other possible signaling events mentioned above, our results show that neither an increase in [Ca2+]i nor an activation of PKC is involved in FMLP-induced activation of Ras in PMN.Most studies on the regulation of Ras have been focused on receptor-mediated control of GEF, and little is known about the role of GAP in the activation of Ras. In the present study, we found that stimulation of PMN with either FMLP or C5a, both of which activate Gi2-proteins, induced a rapid but transient inhibition of Ras-GAP activity, and the kinetics correlated well with their activation of Ras. Because Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of Ras, strong inhibition of its activity in PMN shortly after stimulation with chemoattractants would allow progressive accumulation of the Ras-GTP complex. The decrease in GTP-bound Ras observed in PMN after longer stimulation (5 min) was probably due to the recovery of Ras-GAP activity. These results indicate that the inhibition of Ras-GAP activity is an important regulator of the chemotactic peptide-induced activation of Ras in PMN, although we cannot of course exclude the possibility that the chemotactic peptide activates Ras in part through novel/unknown GEF and/or a novel regulatory mechanism for those GEF.Although both p120-GAP and NF1 are expressed in PMN, the decreased Ras-GAP activity in FMLP-stimulated cells was most likely due to the inhibition of p120-GAP. The precise modulatory mechanisms underlying the inhibition of Ras-GAP observed in our study are at present unclear. Although FMLP can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p120-GAP (54Dusi S. Donini M. Wientjes F. Rossi F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it has been shown that such phosphorylation per se is not sufficient to inhibit the activity of p120-GAP (32Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.A.F. Vogel U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20437-20442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That finding is compatible with our results showing that genistein abolished the FMLP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp120 but had no effect on the activation of Ras. Recent studies in vitro have shown that Gβγ subunits can reversibly bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of several proteins, such as Ras-GAP, and overexpression of pleckstrin homology domain peptides in vivo has been found to inhibit the Gi-coupled receptor-mediated activation of Ras (55Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Touhara K. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, such a mechanism might be involved in the inhibition of Ras-GAP activity seen in our experiments. This hypothesis is in agreement with a recent report that FMLP triggers the translocation of p120-GAP to the membrane of PMN as early as 20 s after stimulation (54Dusi S. Donini M. Wientjes F. Rossi F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).PMN are nonmitotic cells and their main function is to migrate to sites of infection; hence the effects of Ras on cell growth and differentiation are irrelevant in PMN. Marshall (57Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar) recently proposed that the outcome of Ras/MAPK signaling is largely dependent on the duration of its activation. If that is the case, rapid activation of Ras in PMN may represent a distinct category of signaling. Accumulating evidence indicates that Ras is an initial regulator of multiple-signaling pathways, including those comprising key proteins involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (i.e.Rac, Rho, and PI3K; Ref. 11Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Transfection of the active form of Ras into granulocytic HL-60 cells is associated with an increased level of F-actin and a tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin (58Katagiri K. Kinashi T. Irie S. Katagiri T. Blood. 1996; 87: 4276-4285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Joneson et al. (25Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) reported that regulation of the MAPK pathway and the pathway controlling cell morphology bifurcates at the level of Ras itself, lending further support for a role of Ras in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. β2 integrins, which are essential for PMN locomotion, were recently found to induce activation of Ras via tyrosine phosphorylation of the Ras-GEF Vav (6Zheng L. Sjölander A. Eckerdal J. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8431-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to FMLP-induced activation of Ras, which is most likely controlled by an inhibition of Ras-GAP activity (present study). Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that the different signaling mechanisms used by receptors for adherence and chemotaxis to activate Ras might lead to a better coordination in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby a more efficient locomotory response of PMN.

This recruitment involves several distinct phases, for example adhesion to the vessel wall and subsequent transmigration and locomotion of PMN in a chemotactic gradient(s) formed at the site of infection (1Cramer E.B. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1992: 341-352Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which PMN respond to chemotactic stimuli, such as f-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) and C5a, include their interaction with seven transmembrane-spanning receptors coupled to heterotrimeric Gi2-proteins (2Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 3Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That interaction triggers Gi2-proteins to dissociate into a GTP-bound Gα subunit and a βγ complex, which in turn activate effectors, e.g.various phospholipases, the Src-related tyrosine kinase Lyn, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; Refs. 2Murphy P.M.

In addition, recent studies have shown that stimulation of adhesion and chemoattractant receptors leads to activation of the small G-protein Ras in PMN (6Zheng L. Sjölander A. Eckerdal J.

Despite the undoubted relevance of such pathways for the regulation of PMN locomotion, the signaling events mediating chemoattractant-induced activation of Ras has only been partially elucidated.

The activity of Ras is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), which exchange GDP for GTP on R"
https://openalex.org/W2080129938,"COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with human thyrotropin receptor and dog A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor cDNAs. An A<sub>1</sub> agonist,<i>N</i> <sup>6</sup>-(l-2-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (PIA), which is ineffective alone, enhanced the thyrotropin (TSH)-induced inositol phosphate production, reflecting phospholipase C (PLC) activation, but inhibited the TSH-induced cAMP accumulation, reflecting adenylyl cyclase inhibition. These PIA-induced actions were completely inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment. Moreover, in the cells expressing a PTX-insensitive mutant of G<sub>i</sub>2α or G<sub>i</sub>3α, in which a glycine residue was substituted for a cysteine residue to be ADP-ribosylated by PTX, at the fourth position of the C terminus, PIA effectively exerted both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the TSH-induced actions although the cells were treated with the toxin. Overexpression of the βγ subunits of the G proteins enhanced the TSH-induced inositol phosphate production without any significant effect on the cAMP response; under these conditions, PIA did not further increase the elevated inositol phosphate response to TSH. On the contrary, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of G<sub>i</sub>2α, in which the guanosine triphosphatase activity is lost, inhibited the TSH-induced cAMP accumulation but hardly affected the inositol phosphate response; under these conditions, PIA never exerted further inhibitory effects on the cAMP response to TSH. In contrast to the case of the TSH-induced inositol phosphate response, the response to a constitutively active G<sub>11</sub>α mutant was not appreciably affected, and that to NaF was rather inhibited by PIA and overexpression of the βγ subunits. Taken together, these results suggest that a single type of PTX-sensitive G protein mediates the A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor-linked modulation of two signaling pathways in collaboration with an activated thyrotropin receptor; α subunits of the PTX-sensitive G proteins mediate the inhibitory action on adenylyl cyclase, and the βγ subunits mediate the stimulatory action on PLC. In the case of the latter stimulatory action on PLC, the βγ subunits may not directly activate PLC. The possible mechanism by which βγ subunits enhance the TSH-induced PLC activation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2059218768,"Prenylated proteins contain one of two isoprenoid lipids, either the 15-carbon farnesyl or the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl, covalently attached to cysteine residues at or near their C terminus. The cellular abundance of prenylated proteins, which can comprise up to 2% of total cellular protein, raises the question of how cells dispose of prenylcysteines produced during the normal turnover of prenylated proteins. We have identified and characterized a novel enzyme, which we term prenylcysteine lyase, that is capable of cleaving the thioether bond of prenylcysteines. The enzyme was isolated from bovine brain membranes and exhibits an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa. The enzyme did not require NADPH as cofactor for prenylcysteine degradation, thus distinguishing it from cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases that catalyze S-oxidation of thioethers. Purified prenylcysteine lyase shows similar kinetics in utilization of both farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine as substrates, although V max is 2-fold higher with the former compound. Interaction of prenylcysteine substrates with the enzyme requires that they possess a free amino group; N-acetylated prenylcysteines and prenyl peptides are not substrates. These findings suggest that prenylcysteine lyase is a specific enzyme involved in prenylcysteine metabolism in mammalian cells, most likely comprising the final step in the degradation of prenylated proteins.

In eukaryotic organisms, a specific subset of proteins is subject to a post-translational lipid modification termed prenylation (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 2Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Two distinct isoprenoids are involved in the process, the 15-carbon farnesyl and 20-carbon geranylgeranyl, and they are attached to cysteine residues at or near the C terminus of proteins they modify. Isoprenoid attachment has been shown to be crucial for the biological function of prenylated proteins (3Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Geranylgeranylated proteins comprise 80+% of prenylated proteins (5Farnsworth C.C. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Science. 1990; 247: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Rilling H.C. Breunger E. Epstein W.W. Crain P.F. Science. 1990; 247: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).One important property of protein prenylation is that, unlike many other post-translational modifications, it is a stable modification of proteins (7Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The average half-life of a prenyl protein in a mammalian cell line has been determined to be roughly 20 h, and furthermore, prenylated proteins can comprise up to 2% of total cellular protein (7Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 8Epstein W.W. Lever D. Leining L.M. Bruenger E. Rilling H.C. Proc. Natl.

These features of prenylation raise a metabolic challenge for cells, in that the prenylcysteines produced upon the turnover of prenylated proteins would somehow need to be disposed of. This situation is similar to that which apparently exists in the metabolism of another group of lipid-modified proteins, these being proteins subject to S-acylation, generally by the fatty acyl group, palmitoyl. A lysosomal enzyme termed palmitoyl-protein thioesterase has recently been found to remove theS-acyl group from cysteine-containing molecules thought to be the degradation products of S-acylated proteins (9Lu J.Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetic defects in palmitoyl-protein thioesterase are linked to forms of the neurodegenerative disorder infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (10Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar).We recently identified a potential route for cellular disposition of prenylcysteines, that being active transport by the cell-surface transporter P-glycoprotein (11Zhang L. Sachs C.W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15973-15976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Sachs C.W. Fu H.-W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, most normal tissues do not express appreciable levels of this transporter (13Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar, 14Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Prenylated proteins, on the other hand, are ubiquitously expressed in animal cells (2Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice in which the gene encoding P-glycoprotein was disrupted were phenotypically normal except for their increased sensitivity to certain drugs (15Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J.M. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M. van der Valk M.A. Robanus-Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P.J. Berns A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1994; 77: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). Thus, although P-glycoprotein can recognize prenylcysteines as substrates, its ability to function as a metabolic mechanism for disposal of these metabolites may be quite limited.If transport is not the major route for disposal of prenylcysteines, a logical route would be one of further metabolism. This could also be advantageous, since it could allow re-utilization of the degradation products by cells. In this case, the best mechanism would seem to be cleavage of the thioether bond that links the isoprenoid to cysteine, so that cells could recover both cysteine and the isoprenoid. Several enzymes have been described that are capable of acting on cysteineS-conjugates and xenobiotic compounds containing thioether bonds, the most prominent of these being one termed β-lyase that cleaves at the β-carbon of cysteine to produce pyruvate, ammonia, and stably modified thiols (16Dekant W. Vamvakas S. Drug Metab. Rev. 1989; 20: 43-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). β-Lyase has been found in liver, kidney, and gut microflora, where it plays an important role in the metabolism of glutathione S-conjugates (17Park S.B. Osterloh J.D. Vamvakas S. Hashmi M. Anders M.W. Cashman J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, thioether bonds can be subject to enzymatic S-oxidation to form their sulfoxide counterpart, which can then proceed to an elimination-type reaction that eventually cleaves the C–S bond. Cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases can catalyze this type ofS-oxidation using NADPH as cofactor (18Cashman J.R. Olsen L.D. Bornheim L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Sausen P.J. Elfarra A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6139-6145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a flavin-containing monooxygenase isolated from pig liver can carry outS-oxidation of farnesylcysteine (FC) 1The abbreviations used are: FC,S-farnesylcysteine; PCLase, prenylcysteine lyase; GGC,S-geranylgeranylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, TLC, thin-layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: FC,S-farnesylcysteine; PCLase, prenylcysteine lyase; GGC,S-geranylgeranylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, TLC, thin-layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.(20Park S.B. Howald W.N. Cashman J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The significance of this reaction in the metabolism of prenylated proteins, however, remains to be established. The ability of cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases to protect cells from toxic metabolites and xenobiotics is dependent on their abilities to recognize a broad spectrum of substrates. On the other hand, a cellular enzyme responsible for the prenylcysteine metabolism would need to be quite specific, since it must distinguish those molecules from the functional prenyl proteins and peptides in cells. It is not clear whether the cytochrome P450- or flavin-containing monooxygenases possess the substrate specificity required for this catabolic process.In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel enzyme, which we have termed prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase). This enzyme, purified from bovine brain membranes, cleaves the thioether bond of prenylcysteine in a fashion that results in free cysteine production. The biochemical properties of PCLase are distinct from that of β-lyase and cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases. PCLase recognizes both farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine with high affinity and specificity, suggesting its involvement in the metabolism of prenylated proteins in mammalian cells. In eukaryotic organisms, a specific subset of proteins is subject to a post-translational lipid modification termed prenylation (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, most normal tissues do not express appreciable levels of this transporter (13Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar, 14Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Prenylated proteins, on the other hand, are ubiquitously expressed in animal cells (2Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice in which the gene encoding P-glycoprotein was disrupted were phenotypically normal except for their increased sensitivity to certain drugs (15Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J.M. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M. van der Valk M.A. Robanus-Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P.J. Berns A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1994; 77: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). Thus, although P-glycoprotein can recognize prenylcysteines as substrates, its ability to function as a metabolic mechanism for disposal of these metabolites may be quite limited. If transport is not the major route for disposal of prenylcysteines, a logical route would be one of further metabolism. This could also be advantageous, since it could allow re-utilization of the degradation products by cells. In this case, the best mechanism would seem to be cleavage of the thioether bond that links the isoprenoid to cysteine, so that cells could recover both cysteine and the isoprenoid. Several enzymes have been described that are capable of acting on cysteineS-conjugates and xenobiotic compounds containing thioether bonds, the most prominent of these being one termed β-lyase that cleaves at the β-carbon of cysteine to produce pyruvate, ammonia, and stably modified thiols (16Dekant W. Vamvakas S. Drug Metab. Rev. 1989; 20: 43-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). β-Lyase has been found in liver, kidney, and gut microflora, where it plays an important role in the metabolism of glutathione S-conjugates (17Park S.B. Osterloh J.D. Vamvakas S. Hashmi M. Anders M.W. Cashman J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, thioether bonds can be subject to enzymatic S-oxidation to form their sulfoxide counterpart, which can then proceed to an elimination-type reaction that eventually cleaves the C–S bond. Cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases can catalyze this type ofS-oxidation using NADPH as cofactor (18Cashman J.R. Olsen L.D. Bornheim L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Sausen P.J. Elfarra A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6139-6145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a flavin-containing monooxygenase isolated from pig liver can carry outS-oxidation of farnesylcysteine (FC) 1The abbreviations used are: FC,S-farnesylcysteine; PCLase, prenylcysteine lyase; GGC,S-geranylgeranylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, TLC, thin-layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: FC,S-farnesylcysteine; PCLase, prenylcysteine lyase; GGC,S-geranylgeranylcysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, TLC, thin-layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.(20Park S.B. Howald W.N. Cashman J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The significance of this reaction in the metabolism of prenylated proteins, however, remains to be established. The ability of cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases to protect cells from toxic metabolites and xenobiotics is dependent on their abilities to recognize a broad spectrum of substrates. On the other hand, a cellular enzyme responsible for the prenylcysteine metabolism would need to be quite specific, since it must distinguish those molecules from the functional prenyl proteins and peptides in cells. It is not clear whether the cytochrome P450- or flavin-containing monooxygenases possess the substrate specificity required for this catabolic process. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel enzyme, which we have termed prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase). This enzyme, purified from bovine brain membranes, cleaves the thioether bond of prenylcysteine in a fashion that results in free cysteine production. The biochemical properties of PCLase are distinct from that of β-lyase and cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases. PCLase recognizes both farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine with high affinity and specificity, suggesting its involvement in the metabolism of prenylated proteins in mammalian cells.

We have developed a spiroketal vector model which appears to account for the spatial orientation of the hydrophobic and basic chains extending from the spiroketal-phosphate core of calyculin A. The model also clearly demonstrates why the unnatural enantiomer of calyculin A does not fit properly into the pocket of the active site. Based on our model, we present a possible open binding mode for calyculin A in the enzyme. This open structure is conceptually similar to the predicted binding mode of the peptide inhibitor DARPP-32 to the enzyme; the hydrophobic, metal-binding, and electrostatic interactions are all retained in this model.

Serine/threonine phosphatases form a structurally and functionally homogeneous protein superfamily (reviewed in Refs. 1Holmes C.F.B. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). They have been divided into four groups (1, 2A, 2B, and 2C) on the basis of their biochemical properties and metal dependence. However, from a phylogenetic and structural point of view, it would be more appropriate to classify the enzymes into family I (PP-1, 1The abbreviations used are: PP-1, PP-2A, PP-2B, and PP-2C, protein phosphatase-1, -2A, -2B, and -2C; PP-1c, catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1; DARPP-32, dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of apparent M r32,000. PP-2A, and PP-2B) and family II (PP-2C). The family I phosphatases are regulated and inhibited by a wide variety of regulatory protein subunits and natural toxins (1Holmes C.F.B. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The role of the regulatory subunits, which usually form a 1:1 complex with the enzyme, is to target the catalytic subunit toward specific subcellular locations (3Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). A portion of the regulatory subunits are also inhibitory to the enzyme. These include the heat-stable inhibitors I-1, its isoform DARPP-32, and inhibitor I-2. The inhibitors I-1 and DARPP-32 are activated by phosphorylation at Thr-35 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The natural toxins inhibiting Ser/Thr protein phosphatases include certain cyclic peptides, the microcystins and the nodularins, and also open-chain spiroketal polyethers such as okadaic acid, the calyculins, and tautomycin (2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The structures of these inhibitors are presented in Fig. 1. The microcystins and the nodularins share a common structural motif, a hydrophobic side chain (the amino acid Adda) extending from a twisted ring-shaped core. Okadaic acid and the calyculins also share common structural elements: a relatively rigid hydrophobic tail structure connected via a flexible arm to a very rigid spiroketal structure with an acidic group, capable of coordination to the metals and/or the aquo ligands at the active site of the enzyme. Tautomycin also shares an acidic group (anhydride), as well as a rigid hydrophobic tail. The x-ray crystal structures for rabbit muscle PP-1c complexed with microcystin-LR (2.1 Å resolution) as well as for human PP-1c and its complex with tungstate (both at 2.5 Å resolution) are now available (4Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 5Egloff M.-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These crystal structures, along with the wealth of structural data that has accumulated for the various inhibitors, create a fruitful basis for exploring the structure-activity relationships of the inhibitors. Furthermore, the structure-based design of rationally modified and completely new inhibitors can now be envisaged. A recent paper (6Bagu J.R. Sykes B.D. Craig M.M. Holmes C.F.B. J. Biol.

The results obtained for the binding of calyculin A were in a clear conflict with our own results. In this communication, we will describe our own approach to the binding mode of calyculin A to PP-1c. Macromodel 4.5 and 6.0 (7Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C.

Chain B of the Protein Data Bank structure 1FJM (4Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) was deleted. All water molecules and the microcystin were also deleted. Hydrogens on the heteroatoms of the acidic and basic side chains were added to correspond to pH 7. The two Mn2+ atoms were replaced by Fe2+ and Zn2+. Calyculin A (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center code DOPSUW) was retrieved from CCDC, all hydrogens were added, and the charges were adjusted: −2 for the phosphate and +1 for Me2N−. Both the CCDC enantiomer and the fully inverted structure were studied. The opened-up version of calyculin A was obtained by manual adjustment of suitable torsion angles, guided by the shape of the active site cleft of PP-1c. Partial charges were assigned using the standard bond dipole method in AMBER* force field. The following non-standard van der Waals parameters were used: Fe2+, r = 1.5 Å, ε = 0.134; Zn2+, r = 1.1 Å, ε = 0.0125. For Zn2+, the parameters were obtained from Ref. 8Hoops S.C. Anderson K.W. Merz Jr., K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 8262-8270Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar. For Fe2+, the parameters were obtained by iterative adjustment to produce a reasonable geometry for a phosphate interacting with the metals when compared with the crystal structure of PP-1c complexed with tungstate (5Egloff M.-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). All calyculin A structures thus obtained were docked manually into the active site of PP-1c. The residues in PP-1c within 15 Å from the ligand were included in the energy calculation. These residues were frozen at their crystallographic coordinates with a force constant of 300 kJ/(mol Å) while a full minimization was carried out for the ligand. The default values for non-bonded cutoffs and the default convergence criteria were used. The buried surface areas were calculated with the built-in algorithm of Macromodel 6.0 using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. We are aware that our models are only educated guesses due to the numerous challenges faced when predicting enzyme-inhibitor interactions. In particular, solvation effects are difficult to take into account, as ordered water molecules may or may not be replaced by an inhibitor. We therefore felt that a major modelling effort, such as an extensive conformational search of calyculin within the enzyme active site, was not justified. The purpose of the energy minimizations was to refine the initial guesses by removing bad steric contacts and to optimize the electrostatic interactions. Despite these deficiencies, we believe that cautious interpretation of our models yields new insights into the binding of calyculins and other inhibitors sharing the same structural motifs to PP-1c. Inspection of the crystal structure of PP-1c after removal of the microcystin from the crystal structure coordinates reveals the active site of free PP-1c (4Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The active site is located at the Y-shaped intersection of three surface grooves on the surface of the molecule: 1) a relatively narrow hydrophobic groove which ends in a port-like arrangement of two Arg residues (Arg-96 and Arg-221) and a Tyr-134 residue near the active site, 2) an acidic groove extending from the active site, with Glu and Asp side chains protruding from both sides of the groove, and 3) a C-terminal groove. The catalytic site consists of a bowl-shaped pit where two metal ions (Fe2+ and Zn2+) (9Chu Y. Lee E.Y. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are bound by His, Asp, and Asn residues and are also joined by three water molecules (4Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). For docking studies, the x-ray crystal structure of PP-1c with bound microcystin-LR was taken as the point of departure (4Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Using the rigid body assumption, with the enzyme locked in the crystal state conformation and the inhibitor in either the crystal state conformation or in an extended conformation, one can easily dock the inhibitors into the enzyme cleft by simply superimposing their structures over the structure of the bound microcystin-LR. Further refinement of the model can then proceed with energy minimization using the AMBER* force fieldin vacuo (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 illustrates our energy-minimized model for the unnatural enantiomer of calyculin A bound to PP-1c. The overall fold of the inhibitor remains similar to the crystal structure, with the salt bridge in place. The tetraene unit fits into the hydrophobic groove, whereas the spiroketal is exposed to solution. The phosphate group does not interact directly with the enzyme. Overall, the inhibitor is rather exposed in this complex. Inverting the crystal structure gives the coordinates for the natural enantiomer of calyculin A. Fig. 3 shows the docked structure of calyculin A thus obtained. Again, the overall fold of the inhibitor after minimization is very similar to the crystal structure. However, now the phosphate can interact with Arg-96,i.e. the phosphate can interact with the positive electrostatic potential, with the hydrophobic interactions simultaneously satisfied. Although the tetraene now makes somewhat poorer contact with the enzyme, the inhibitor as a whole is now better buried, with a buried area of 490 Å2 (compared with a buried area of 440 Å2 for the unnatural enantiomer). In the preceding model the Me2N group prevents the phosphate from interacting with the second arginine, Arg-221. In the crystal structure of calyculin A, the phosphate forms a salt bridge with Me2N, thereby locking the otherwise flexible chain that contains the Me2N group. However, this chain prevents, because of its steric bulk, the phosphate and therefore the whole inhibitor from penetrating deeper into the enzyme active site. In other words, the chain is simply too big to fit into the pocket together with the spiroketal-phosphate. We therefore opened up the folded crystal conformer and cleaved the intramolecular salt bridge to reveal the phosphate. In this process we manually rotated torsion angles in an effort to maximize the contacts between the enzyme and the inhibitor. The operation was carried out in the presence of the enzyme so as to obtain continuous feedback of the quality of the fit. After minimization we obtained the model shown in Fig. 4. In this model the hydrophobic interactions and the electrostatic attraction between the phosphate and the enzyme active site are well satisfied, with no intervening groups preventing maximal interaction. Additionally, the chain containing the basic dimethylamino group is directed into the acidic groove, with the protonated Me2N interacting with the acidic side chain of Glu-256. The buried area for the inhibitor in the extended conformation is 820 Å2, nearly twice as large as the buried area for the crystal structure conformation of calyculin A (490 Å2). Holmes and co-workers (6Bagu J.R. Sykes B.D. Craig M.M. Holmes C.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) begin their docking studies with the assumption that “the free structures of the toxins would not change dramatically upon binding.” This approach seems to work well with the microcystins and the nodularins, which, being rather rigid cyclic structures, are all likely to adopt a very similar conformation in solution, in the crystal state and also in the bound state. However, it is questionable whether the same approach will be as successful with open-chain molecules such as okadaic acid and calyculin A. Indeed, although it is quite possible to dock the crystal structure of calyculin A depicting the unnatural enantiomer to the crystal structure of PP-1c (Fig. 2), the conclusions drawn from such a model cannot be valid. In their original publication, Fusetani and co-workers (10Kato Y. Fusetani N. Matsunaga S. Hashimoto K. Fujita S. Furuya T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2780-2781Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar) disclosed the crystal structure of calyculin A with the comment “no absolute configuration is implied.” It was not until 1991, when Shioiri and co-workers (11Hamada Y. Tanada Y. Yokokawa F. Shioiri T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 5605-5608Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) compared the synthetic C33-C37amino acid fragment with the one obtained by hydrolysis of the natural product, that the absolute stereochemistry of calyculin A was ascertained. It turned out to be enantiomeric to the published crystal structure. Unfortunately, Holmes and co-workers (6Bagu J.R. Sykes B.D. Craig M.M. Holmes C.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) have employed the CCDC structure of calyculin A (representing the unnatural enantiomer) directly in their docking study. This is readily visible from their docked structure (Fig. 8B in Ref. 6): the configuration of the phosphate-bearing carbon (C17) is S, whereas the natural product has C17 in the Rconfiguration. The crystal structure of the natural enantiomer of calyculin A is clearly better shaped for interaction with the enzyme (compare Figs. 2 and 3). However, for reasons discussed under “Results,” we were not satisfied with the location of the basic chain of calyculin A in the complex. Not only does it prevent the negatively charged phosphate group from penetrating deeper into the positively charged pit of the active site, but its steric bulk prevents the whole molecule from closely contacting the enzyme. The extended conformation obtained by allowing the molecule to open up (Fig. 4) satisfies these requirements and allows a more intimate contact between calyculin A and the enzyme. In a similar manner, DARPP-32, a natural inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 in vivo, has been proposed to bind to PP-1c in an extended conformation which maximizes the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (4Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated (active form) of DARPP-32 has the following sequence at the phosphorylated region: -RRRR-pT-PAMLFR-. With the peptide chain in an open conformation, the arginine side chains could interact with the negatively charged side chains of the acidic groove, the phosphorylated threonine could fit into the positively charged pocket, and the hydrophobic residues following the phosphothreonine would then be accommodated into the hydrophobic groove. This model, of course, must be regarded as tentative especially in light of the recent finding that a KIQF sequence located 23 residues toward the N terminus from the phosphothreonine is also required for the activity of I-1, a close relative of DARPP-32 (12Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although the role of this sequence is uncertain, it is quite possible that the conformation of PP-1c changes upon binding to regulatory peptides (see also Ref. 5Egloff M.-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). With calyculin A, although the exact placement of the basic and hydrophobic chains is not feasible with the current data available, the salient features of our binding model for calyculin A can be represented by a simple spiroketal vector model (Fig. 5). The binding model must satisfy three basic requirements: 1) the phosphate must be allowed to reach the strong positive electrostatic field generated by the two metals and the Arg-96 and Arg-221 residues, 2) the hydrophobic tetraene fragment must fit into the hydrophobic groove, and 3) the basic chain must be able to interact with the acidic groove. The spiroketal-phosphate unit represents the most rigid part of calyculins and was therefore chosen as the core of the model. Fig. 5 illustrates the model where the nature and point of attachment for the two chains are represented by arrows. The model clearly shows how the wrong enantiomer fits only poorly into the active site: the basic chain would interact with the C-terminal groove rather than the acidic site. The model remains neutral over the exact position of the phosphate, but recognizes the need to accommodate the spiroketal-phosphate unit near the positively charged pit of the enzyme."

Cellular growth and differentiation are dependent upon multiple signaling pathways initiated by polypeptide growth factors. A predominant mechanism requires the activation of intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation through a specific ligand-receptor binding event, followed by recruitment of SH2 containing proteins that recognize specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). A common outcome is the activation of ras, which regulates the enzymatic activities of serine-threonine kinases in the MAP kinase family. These regulatory events occur with every known receptor tyrosine kinase and lead to specific responses ranging from cell proliferation to cell survival and differentiation. What determines the final biological outcome elicited from transmembrane signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation?

In PC12 cells, NGF induces prolonged activation of MAP kinases lasting several hours, whereas EGF-mediated MAP kinase activation is transient in nature (2Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 3Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 4Gotoh Y.

The time course of downstream signaling is therefore one of the major differences that accounts for the differentiation program elicited by NGF versus other mitogenic growth factors, such as EGF. The MAP kinase family plays a pivotal role, because the activation of these enzymes is both necessary and sufficient for NIH 3T3 cell transformation and PC12 cell differentiation (5Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of the EGF receptor in PC12 cells led to a long term activation of MAP kinases and neuronal differentiation by EGF (6Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

In the retina, expression of EGF receptors using retroviral mediated gene transfer resulted in selective differentiation of glial cells (7Lillien L. Nature. 1995; 377: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These results suggest that overexpression may lead to an amplification of the signal, which leads to differential biological outcomes. An amplification of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling may be generated by several mechanisms. Receptors, by virtue of overexpression, may recruit multiple substrates to the receptor complex and may give rise to additional interactions that are not normally found. Alternatively, tyrosine kinase receptors, when expressed abundantly, may display less internalization, leading to more receptors that remain longer at the cell surface. This situation may also permit additional substrate recruitment and phosphorylation. It should be noted, however, that ligand induced autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor is actually higher than the TrkA NGF receptor in PC12 cells (8Berg M.M. Sternberg D.W. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so that the level of receptor activation cannot solely account for the difference in growth factor action. Both the EGF and TrkA receptors share common substrates, including the recruitment of phospholipase C-γ, Grb2, and Shc (9Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J.

Halfter H., K.-H., W. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and Shc binds to the juxtamembrane tyrosine residue, Tyr490 (9Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J.

Shc can associate with a variety of signaling molecules, such as the Grb2 adaptor protein and PI3-kinase substrates, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (13Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W.

Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The large number of potential interactions suggests that Shc may play a crucial role in substrate recruitment to activated tyrosine kinase receptors and that Shc phosphorylation may determine specific growth factor responses. In support of this conclusion is the finding that overexpression of Shc in PC12 cells is sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (15Rozakis-Adcock McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane region of the TrkA NGF receptor contains a single Shc binding motif, IENPQpY, which is distinct from other Shc binding sites, such as those found in the EGF receptor (9Obermeier A.

In addition, the neighboring amino acid sequences in this region are unique among tyrosine kinase receptors, suggesting that distinct functions are subserved by these sequences. We therefore undertook a domain swap approach to explore the functional significance of the juxtamembrane (JM) region of the TrkA NGF receptor. Here we demonstrate that the juxtamembrane domain of TrkA can function in the corresponding location of the EGF receptor to promote differentiation of PC12 cells. The effect of the juxtamembrane sequence is mainly mediated by the Shc site, IENPQpY, because a change of the tyrosine residue to phenylalanine (NPQY to NPQF) abrogated the differentiation signaling properties of the chimeric receptor. These results suggest that the juxtamembrane region, in particular the Shc site, is a major determinant of specificity for trk receptor tyrosine kinases. The JM of the human EGF receptor was replaced with the corresponding domain of the humantrkA receptor, using a hybrid PCR strategy (18Zhong D. Bajaj S.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 874-878PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, use of hybrid primers (see the primer sequences JMa and JMb shown below) from human trkA as a template generated a hybrid PCR fragment consisting of the trkA juxtamembrane region spanning amino acid residues 434–509 (19Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This sequence was flanked at both the 5′ and 3′ end by sequences from the EGF receptor corresponding to amino acid residue 640 at the 5′ end and 692 at the 3′ end (20Xu Y. Ishii S. Clark A.J.L. Sullivan M. Wilson R.K. Ma D.P. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Nature. 1984; 309: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Three amino acids at the swap junctions of the resulting fragment were LFMnkc and kweLGS, where the lowercase letters designatetrkA amino acid sequences. The second round of PCR reactions utilized the EGF receptor and the first PCR fragment as the templates. A PCR reaction using a primer complementary to amino acid residues 565–572 of the human EGF receptor cDNA and JMb generated a PCR fragment of 476 bp. Another PCR reaction using a primer that was complementary to amino acids 811–816 in the EGF receptor and the JMa primer resulted in a PCR fragment of 630 bp. A third round of PCR utilized the two fragments from the second round of PCR as templates to generate a final PCR fragment 839 bp in length. This fragment was digested with NaeI and ApaLI and cloned into the EGF receptor cDNA digested with the same enzymes. The entire fragment of 839 bp, which was subjected to PCR reaction, was sequenced for any potential mutations. The JM chimera was then subcloned intoXbaI/SmaI sites of the pCMV5 expression vector. The hybrid primers used in the chimera are: JMa, GGGGATCGGCCTCTTCATGaacaaatgtggacggagaaac, and JMb, GCCGAACGCACCGGAGCCCAGctcccacttgagcacgatgtc. The uppercase letters represent the EGF receptor, and the lowercase ones represent thetrkA receptor. The wild type human EGF receptor was also cloned into pCMV5 expression vector usingXbaI/SmaI sites. The JMY490F chimera was constructed using a hybrid PCR strategy with the JM chimera as a template. The primers used for the JMY490F chimera are: JMc, ATCATCGAGAACCCACAATtCTTCAGTGATGCCTGTGTT, and JMd, AACACAGGCATCACTGAAGaATTGTGGGTTCTCGATGAT. The tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation is indicated by a TAC to TtC substitution. The PCR fragment containing the point mutation was introduced to the JM chimera usingBstXI sites. The 712-bp PCR fragment was sequenced in its entirety to verify its integrity. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. The 3T3–2.2 line lacking the endogenous EGF receptor was kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. For generation of stable lines, cells were transfected with each construct plus MEX-neo plasmid at 10:1 ratio using lipofectamin reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 days, cells were maintained in 0.4 mg/ml G418 for selection. Upon expanding the stable colonies, the positive clones were initially identified by125I-EGF binding and further confirmed by performing immunoprecipitation/Western analysis. Stable PC12 lines were tested for neurite extension upon EGF/NGF treatment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. After 5–6 days, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a blocking solution containing 10% horse serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1m phosphate buffer. Cells were stained with antibodies against MAP1B (generous gift from Dr. R. Vallee) at 1:6000 dilution overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, biotinylated, Vector) was used at 1:500 dilution in 2.5% horse serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Stained cells were then visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine reaction (Vectastain, Vector). Metabolic labeling of PC12 stables with [35S]methionine was performed according to Ref. 21Yan H. Schlessinger J. Chao M.V. Science. 1991; 252: 561-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, except that mixture of R1 and 528 antibodies were used to pull down the human-specific form of the EGF receptor or chimeras. To prepare cell lysates, cultured cells were typically starved for 3–4 h for PC12 stable cell lines and 18–20 h for 3T3–2.2 stable cell lines. After induction, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mmNa2P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Upon lysis, the lysates were spun at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected. For the immunoprecipitation of chimeric receptors from PC stables, the lysates were precleared twice by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and subsequent incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibodies and for an additional 1 h with protein A-Sepharose. The protein A beads were then washed three times in the lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The samples were then boiled for 3–5 min in the Laemmli sample buffer before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For Western analysis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper and blocked for 2–3 h at room temperature in a buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Incubation with primary antibodies was carried out for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer as a blocking buffer. For the detection, an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) was used with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim). Antibodies used in this work were as follows: R1, anti-EGF receptor (Santa-Cruz, CA); 528, anti-EGF receptor (a generous gift from Dr. H. Masui, Sloan-Kettering); 4G10, anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology); PY20, anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Lab); MAP-1B (a generous gift from Dr. R. Vallee); anti-MAP kinase 1 and 2 and anti-Grb2 (Santa-Cruz); anti-Shc; and RK2, anti-human EGF receptor (provided by J. Schlessinger, New York University). Assays of MAP kinase activity were performed using myelin basic protein as a substrate as described previously (22Teng K.K. Lander H. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20677-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Assay of PI3-kinase activity was performed according to Soltoff and Cantley (23Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, 4G10, for immunoprecipitation reactions. EGF receptors and chimeric receptors were immunoprecipitated with 528 and RI anti-human EGF receptor, and the immune complexes were subjected to an in vitroauto-kinase assay in the presence of 50 mm Tris (pH 8.2), 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2 and [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was subjected to gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. To examine the TrkA JM domain in NGF signaling, we transferred the JM region oftrkA (amino acids 434–509) onto the corresponding region in the human EGF receptor, as shown in Fig. 1 A. No mutations or new amino acids were introduced at the swap junction. The resulting JM chimera contains three Shc binding motifs compared with the wild type EGF receptor, which has two Shc binding sites at the carboxyl-terminal tail (24Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnick E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Okutani T. Sugimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18674-18678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable PC12 lines expressing cDNAs encoding the chimeric receptor (JM-1 and JM-2), the wild type human EGF receptor (ER-1 and ER-2), and human trkA cDNA (Trk-1) were generated. PC12 cells were chosen as a recipient due to several considerations. First, PC12 cells display a well studied and characteristic neuronal phenotype after NGF treatment. Second, PC12 cells do not differentiate upon EGF treatment. Finally, we found that other potential recipient cell lines, such as mutant PC12 cells lacking the TrkA receptor, the PC12nnrcell line (26Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), displayed a higher number of EGF receptors, which would make an analysis based on EGF treatment more difficult to interpret. The expression of the JM chimera and the human EGF receptor was examined after metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies, RI and 528, which specifically recognized epitopes in the extracellular domain of the human EGF receptor, and not the endogenous rat receptor. The transfected receptor could be specifically detected after immunoprecipitation with these antibodies (Fig. 1 B). The A431 line, which overexpresses the human EGF receptor, was used as a positive control. Native PC12 cells did not give a signal, indicating the antibody did not recognize the rat EGF receptor (Fig. 1 B). We found that PC12 cells expressed approximately 10,000 EGF receptors per cell, consistent with other measurements (6Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and considerably less than A431 cells, which express nearly 106receptors per cell (27Prywes R. Livneh E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The level of JM receptors was measured to be 5–15,000 receptors per cell, based upon binding measurements (data not shown). It should be emphasized that the level of receptors in the stable lines described here was well below the levels measured previously for insulin receptors (28Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and EGF receptors (6Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) transfected in PC12 cells. The ability of the JM chimera to induce differentiation was evaluated by analyzing neurite outgrowth upon EGF treatment. To detect the morphology of neurites with an appropriate marker, transfected cells were stained for MAP1B immunoreactivity. MAP1B is a microtubule-associated protein that is expressed in PC12 cells (22Teng K.K. Lander H. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20677-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing the JM chimera (JM-1) were found to be responsive to EGF treatment (50 ng/ml) with increased neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2 A, panel J). As a control, PC12 cells stably transfected with the wild type EGF receptor (ER-1) did not induce neurite extension (Fig. 2 A,F). This response was quantitated by assessing the number of cells bearing neurites twice the length of the cell bodies in two independent lines that expressed similar level of receptors (Fig. 2 B). Both lines behaved similarly. The percentage of neurite-bearing cells in the two JM lines reached over 50% after 6 days of EGF treatment, whereas other cell lines failed to respond. Under the same condition, 60% of the native PC12 cells contained neurites upon NGF treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, the morphology of neurites generated by EGF treatment in the JM-1 line was the same produced by NGF treatment (compare panels J andK in Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the JM domain of TrkA was capable of conferring a differentiative signaling potential onto the EGF receptor. The striking morphological response by EGF in the JM cell lines raises a question regarding the tyrosine kinase activity of the chimeric receptor. To assess this activity in PC12 cells, the receptor was immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for the human EGF receptor, followed by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In transfected PC12 cells, the JM chimeric receptors were found to be autophosphorylated after EGF treatment (Fig. 3 A). The extent of receptor autophosphorylation was comparable in ER-1 and JM-1 lines. To determine whether the JM chimeric receptor contained intrinsic kinase activity, a 3T3 cell line that lacked endogenous EGF receptors, clone 2.2 (29Honegger A.M. Dull T.J. Felder S. Van Obberghen E. Bellot F. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1987; 51: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), was used. Analysis of the JM receptor in these 3T3 cells indicated that ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of the chimeric receptor was not detectable compared with the wild type EGF receptor (Fig. 3 B). The expression of the wild type and JM receptors in stably transfected cells was verified by subsequent blotting with the RK2 antibody against the EGF receptor. The lack of kinase activity by the JM chimera was further supported by receptor immunoprecipitation and autokinase experiments with anti-human EGF receptor antibodies, RI and 528 (Fig. 3 C). These results indicated that the JM receptor lacked intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The lack of detectable autophosphorylation by the JM receptor suggested that the domain swap rendered the chimeric receptor defective in its intrinsic kinase activity. Nevertheless, the results in PC12 cells indicated that the JM receptor could serve as a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). The detection of JM autophosphorylation in PC12 cells suggests that the chimeric receptor underwent ligand-dependent phosphorylation by endogenous EGF receptors, which contain an active catalytic domain. A similar kind of receptor transactivation has been observed in a kinase-inactive ErbB3 receptor coexpressed with wild type EGF receptors (30Soltoff S.P. Carraway K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) or other ErbB family members (31Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) . To investigate whether endogenous EGF receptors are responsible for the transphosphorylation of the JM chimeras, we utilized an inhibitor, AG1478, which is specfic for the EGF receptor (32Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1993; 265: 1093-1096Crossref Scopus (814) Google Scholar). When the JM-1 line was treated with EGF in the presence of 300 nm AG1478, cells failed to produce neurites (Fig. 2 A, L). The effect of AG1478 on EGF treatment of the JM-1 cell line was specific, because NGF-induced differentiation of native PC12 cells was unaffected by the same dose of AG1478 (Fig. 2 A, D). The differential effect of AG1478 on the EGF receptor and the TrkA NGF receptor was further probed by examining the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the MAP kinases (Fig. 4). Cells were treated with AG1478 for 2 h prior to a 5-min treatment with EGF. In both PC12 and JM-1 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinases was reduced as the dose of the drug increased with EGF treatment (Fig. 4). In contrast, AG1478 treatment did not affect NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinases in PC12 cells overexpressing the TrkA receptor (Trk-1 line), even at the highest dose (Fig. 4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinases was also unaffected by NGF treatment in PC12 and JM-1 cells (data not shown). The specific inhibitory action of AG1478 on the EGF receptor and not the NGF TrkA receptor indicates that the phosphorylation of the JM chimera required the action of the endogenous EGF receptor and not the TrkA receptor. NGF-mediated differentiation in PC12 cells is characterized by a long term activation of MAP kinases (2Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 3Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 4Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To assess whether the JM domain from TrkA had an influence upon the time course of downstream signaling by the EGF receptor, we examined the temporal activation of MAP kinases in the JM-1 line by EGF. As shown in Fig. 5 A, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinases, pp44, was observed for at least 6 h in the JM-1 line but was significantly reduced after 1 h in the ER-1 line. MAP kinase activity was also measured by an immunoprecipitation kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate. This assay indicated a similar temporal difference (Fig. 5 B). The observed correlation of neurite formation and sustained MAP kinase activation in the JM cells indicates that the TrkA juxtamembrane domain contains critical sequences for long term activation of MAP kinases. Previous studies implicated sequences in the juxtamembrane region of TrkA in the generation ofras-independent signaling (33Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of the Shc binding site at position Tyr490 revealed that this site was linked to PI3-kinase activity (34Baxter R.M. Cohen P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Downes C.P. Doza Y.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore measured PI3-kinase activity in the transfected cell lines by an immunoprecipitation kinase assay using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and phosphoinositide as a substrate with [γ32P]ATP. The enzymatic activity of PI3-kinase was found to be higher in JM-1 cells than the control ER-1 cell line, suggesting the increased activity was linked to the JM receptor. After 1 and 5 min of EGF treatment, there was a 3–4-fold difference between the two cell lines in absolute values of PI3-kinase activity (Fig. 6). The peak values of PI3-kinase activity in the JM cell lines was comparable with the one obtained in the Trk-1 line with NGF treatment, indicating that the TrkA receptor is also capable of recruiting PI3-kinase to the same extent as the JM chimera (Fig. 6). Hence, some PI3-kinase activity appears to be contributed by the juxtamembrane region of the chimeric receptor. PI3-kinase activity has been shown to be associated with the TrkA receptor (35Soltoff S.P. Rabin S.L. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17472-17477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and displays a prolonged time course in PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA receptors (36Hempstead"

Expression of human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase in pigs has been proposed as a strategy for reducing the expression level of the α-galactose epitope, thereby rendering the pig organs more suitable for transplantation into humans. The aim of this study was to examine how the cell surface expression of α-galactose, H, and related fucosylated and sialylated structures on a pig liver endothelial cell line is affected by transfection of human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase cDNA. Nontransfected and mock-transfected cells expressed α-galactose, α-2,3-sialylated, and α-2,6-sialylated epitopes strongly, with low level expression of type 2 H and LewisX. By contrast, expression of the H epitope was increased 5–8-fold in transfected cells with a 40% reduction in the expression of α-galactose epitope and a 50% decrease in sialylation, as measured by binding of Maackia amurensis and Sambuccus nigra agglutinins. LewisX expression was reduced to background levels, while the LewisY neoepitope was induced in human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase-expressing pig cells. The activities of endogenous α-1,3-galactosyltransferase, α-1,3-fucosyltransferases, and α-2,3- and α-2,6-sialyltransferases acting on lactosamine were unaffected. Our results show that a reduction in α-galactose epitope expression in porcine endothelial cells transfected with human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase cDNA may be achieved but at the expense of considerable distortion of the overall cell surface glycosylation profile, including the appearance of carbohydrate epitopes that are absent from the parent cells.

LewisX expression was reduced to background levels, while the LewisY neoepitope was induced in human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase-expressing pig cells. The activities of endogenous α-1,3-galactosyltransferase, α-1,3-fucosyltransferases, and α-2,3- and α-2,6-sialyltransferases acting on lactosamine were unaffected. Our results show that a reduction in α-galactose epitope expression in porcine endothelial cells transfected with human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase cDNA may be achieved but at the expense of considerable distortion of the overall cell surface glycosylation profile, including the appearance of carbohydrate epitopes that are absent from the parent cells. Hyperacute rejection of an organ in pig to primate xenotransplantation is triggered by the binding of the recipient's natural preformed antibodies to the antigens expressed on the endothelium of the graft (1Platt J.L.

Nonetheless, inhibition of the expression of the α-Gal epitope is a highly desirable goal in that it would greatly reduce preformed human natural antibody binding and consequently reduce the risk of endothelial cell activation (2Platt J.L.

Given that genetic knockout is not currently possible in pigs, due to the absence of suitable embryonic stem cells, several strategies have been considered for preventing the binding of human preformed IgM antibodies to the α-Gal epitopes expressed on pig endothelial cells. Besides IgM antibody depletion (28Kroshus T.J. Dalmasso A.P. Leventhal J.R. John R. Matas A.J. Bolman R.M. J. Surg.

Simpson P. Spackman D. Palmer A. Taube D. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Extensive down-regulation of α-Gal epitope expression in the pig kidney fibroblast cell line PLL-K1 was achieved by expression of human blood group H GDP-Fuc:Galβ-R α-1,2-fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.69) by Sandrin et al. (33Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. Mckenzie I.F.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This was the result of competition between the human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase (α-1,2FT) and endogenous pig α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (α-1,3GT) for the same type 2 lactosamine acceptor substrate (α-1,3GT cannot α-galactosylate type 2 H structures (34Blanken W.E. van den Eijnden D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12927-12934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The net result of decreased expression of the α-Gal epitope was increased resistance to lysis by human complement. However, other glycosyltransferases can also utilize lactosamine as their acceptor substrate as shown in Fig. 1. Several α-1,3-fucosyltransferases (α-1,3FTs) can fucosylate the GlcNAc residue of terminal lactosamine sequences to synthesize the LewisX epitope. The same acceptor substrate can also be sialylated by α-2,3-sialyltransferases to produce α-2,3-sialyllactosamine, the precursor of sialyl LewisX (35Mollicone R. Gibaud A. Francois A. Ratcliffe M. Oriol R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 36Lowe J.B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 280-289Google Scholar). Sialylation of lactosamine by α-2,6-sialyltransferase leads to CDw75, CD76, and HB-6 carbohydrate epitope expression (37De-Lau W.B. Kuipers J. Voshol H. Clevers H. Bast B.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4911-4919PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the consequences of human α-1,2FT expression on the overall glycosylation profile of porcine cells, we have transfected a pig liver endothelial cell line (PLECT) with a cDNA encoding human α-1,2FT. We studied cell surface expression of H, α-Gal, and several fucosylated and sialylated oligosaccharide epitopes. For α-1,2-fucosyltransferase, a 3.4-kilobase pair XhoI fragment encoding α-1,2FT was excised from pCDM7-a1,2FT and subcloned into XhoI-digested, dephosphorylated pREP10 (Invitrogen) expression vector. Clones with a correctly oriented insert were identified as the ones whereXbaI digestion produced 2.1 kilobase pairs, 10.8 kilobase pairs, and several 200–500-base pair fragments. The pig liver cell line used in the expression studies was established from the liver of a male inbred blood group H SLAb/b pig developed at the Babraham Institute (Cambridge, UK). Briefly, 2 g of freshly collected tissue were minced with a scalpel and then pushed gently through 250-μm stainless steel mesh. The disrupted tissue was collected and washed four times with PBS containing 10 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Washed cells were digested with 0.1% collagenase type V (Sigma) in PBS/glucose/penicillin/streptomycin for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, the sieved and collagenase-digested cells were fractionated usingDolichos biflorus agglutinin-coated Microcellactor flasks (Applied Immune Services, Inc.), since D. biflorusagglutinin is known to be an endothelial cell-specific marker in mice (38Plendl J.

Purified cells were maintained in EC-SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% heat-inactivated (30 min at 56 °C) FCS (GlobePharm, UK) and penicillin/streptomycin as above. Immortalized cell lines were established by transfection with pSV3neo using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Selection for transformants was performed by adding G418 (Boehringer Mannheim) at 200 μg/ml to the growth medium. Cells were plated into 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark) at 200 cells/well 72 h after transfection to isolate individual clones. Transformed cells were found to take up 3,3′-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled low density lipoprotein (Biogenesis), bound FITC-conjugated D. biflorus agglutinin, and secreted factor VIIIa-like activity. Transformation of PLECT cells with α-1,2FT cDNA was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (44Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell.

Transformed cells were plated out 72 h after transfection into 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark) at 200 cells/well and selected in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Boehringer Mannheim). Clones were screened for the expression of blood group H antigen using flow cytometry. Plasmid DNA for mammalian cell transfections was purified using Qiagen Midi columns. Anti-blood group A, B, and H mAbs were from Dako (Denmark), anti-LewisX(CD15) was from Sigma, and anti-LewisY was from Serotec.D. biflorus agglutinin, FITC-DBA, and FITC-Bandeireia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (I/B4) lectins were from Vector Laboratories. Reagent grade human IgM was from Sigma. FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment was from Sigma. FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgM and goat anti-mouse IgG were from Vector Laboratories, UK. Oligosaccharides were from Dextra Laboratories, except sucrose, which was from Sigma. Cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks by brief treatment with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, centrifuged for 5 min at 256 × g in a Heraeus 2.0R Megafuge in the presence of 10% FCS, and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in cold (4 °C) PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3 (Sigma, UK). 50 μl of cells in triplets or quadruplets were incubated in U-well Falcon microtiter plates with the primary antibody added at 10 μg/ml, or at the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer, for 1 h with shaking at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS/FCS/NaN3 before being resuspended in the same buffer containing second-stage reagents at the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer. Following a 1-h incubation with shaking at 4 °C in the dark, the samples were again washed three times with cold PBS/FCS/NaN3 and resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold PBS, 1% formaldehyde. FITC-conjugated Ulex europaeus, D. biflorus agglutinin, and B. simplicifoliaI/B4 lectins were used at 5 μg/ml in PBS/FCS/NaN3. Cells were labeled for 1 h with shaking at 4 °C and then washed and fixed as above. Each individually labeled sample was analyzed separately by flow cytometry using a Coulter XL cytometer. The errors reported are S.D. values. Labeling of PLECT cells with 3,3′-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-conjugated low density lipoprotein and flow cytometric analysis was performed as recommended by Biogenesis. Cell membrane extracts were prepared using n-octyl glucopyranoside (Sigma). 2 million cells were detached from the plastic using 5 mm EDTA in PBS. After two washes with PBS, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold PBS containing 50 mm n-octyl glucopyranoside, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, leupeptin, and cystatine (all inhibitors from Sigma) and incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional gentle mixing. At the end of the solubilization step, the cells were spun down at 500 × g, and the supernatant was used for electrophoresis and Western blots. 2–3 million cells were removed from the plastic by brief treatment with cell culture 5 mm EDTA in PBS and washed into 200 μl of 150 mm NaCl solution. Papain digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h after addition of an equal volume of Papinex reagent to the cell suspension. Cells were resuspended from time to time and, at the end of the incubation, were washed several times with cold PBS before lectin binding experiments for flow cytometry or preparation of cell membrane extracts as described above. The Mini-protean II Western blotting system was used to transfer 10 μl of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated PLECT cell membrane-extracted proteins onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1 h or at 20 V overnight. Background binding was blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. Biotinylated lectin was applied at 5 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, 9 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2and left to bind at room temperature for 1 h. After several washes, bound lectin was detected using Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Aliquots of cell suspensions (2 × 104 in 150 mm NaCl) were stored at −70 °C prior to assay. Cells were solubilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. α-1,3-Fucosyltransferase was assayed with the following 8-methoxycarbonyloctyl (R) acceptors: Fucα1–2Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-R (H type 2-R), Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-R (LacNAc-R), NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-R (3′-sialylLacNAc-R), Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ-R (H type 1-R), and Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ-R (LNB1-R). Incubation mixtures contained [3H]GDP-fucose (50,000 dpm; NEN Life Science Products; specific activity, 6.95 Ci/mmol), 400 μm acceptor, sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1m, pH 7.0, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm MnCl2. The reaction volume was 20 μl. Assays were incubated for 15 min or 3 h (to obtain adequate incorporation of radioactive sugar) at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of water. Radioactive product was separated from the nucleotide sugar donor using Whatman Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and eluted in 3.5 ml of methanol for scintillation counting (46Palcic M.M. Heerzo L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). α-1,2-Fucosyltransferase was assayed with 5 mmphenyl-β-d-galactoside as the acceptor substrate. To compare the levels of enzyme activity in transfected cells, saturating concentrations (50 μm) of GDP-fucose were achieved by adding cold GDP-fucose (Sigma). α-1,3-Galactosyltransferase was assayed with LacNAc-R as acceptor and [14C]UDP-galactose (50,000 cpm) (Amersham Corp.; specific activity, 330 mCi/mmol) as nucleotide sugar donor. Otherwise, reaction conditions were the same as for fucosyltransferase assays. α-2,3- and α-2,6-sialyltransferases were measured with LacNAc-R and LNB1-R as acceptor substrates on 4 × 104 cells. Incubation mixtures contained [3H]CMP-sialic acid (200,000 dpm) (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity, 20.6 Ci/mmol), 1.6 mm acceptor, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MnCl2. The reaction volume was 20 μl. Assays were incubated for 2 h. Untransfected PLECT cells and cells transfected with the pREP10 vector (mock-transfected) expressed low levels of H and LewisX epitopes. No blood group A, B, VIM-2, Lewisa, sialyl LewisX or sialyl Lewisa antigens were present on the parent cell line or on any of the human α-1,2FT-expressing clones. Transfection of PLECT cells with human α-1,2FT cDNA resulted in the isolation of several stable clones displaying increased levels of type 2 H epitope. Clones D and E, displaying the highest staining with anti-H mAb andU. europaeus lectin using flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A and B), were chosen for further study. Increased staining with anti-H reagents correlated with increased α-1,2FT activity as measured in vitro using β-phenylgalactoside as acceptor substrate (Table I). However, there was no significant difference between the level of α-1,2FT activity in clones D and E despite measurable two-fold difference in U. europaeuslectin or anti-H mAb binding (Fig. 3). Increased expression of H was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the α-Gal epitope as detected by the binding ofB. simplicifolia I/B4 (Fig. 3). There was no change in the α-1,3GT activity (data not shown).Table Iα-1,2-Fucosyltransferase activity in the mock-transfected and human α-1,2-fucosyltransferase-expressing PLECT cell linesCell lineα-1.2FT activity1-aActivity measured with β-phenylgalactoside is expressed as pmol of fucose transferred/h/105 cells.PLECT (control)<2Clone D500Clone E5801-a Activity measured with β-phenylgalactoside is expressed as pmol of fucose transferred/h/105 cells.

By contrast, the LewisY antigen, which was not previously detectable, appeared following transfection (Fig. 4 A). α-1,3FT activity, which is necessary for the synthesis of LewisX and LewisY structures on PLECT cells, was present with a substrate specificity similar to that of human Fuc-TIV (Table II). There were no differences in activity measured with H type 2-R between the control and α-1,2FT-transfected cells (data not shown). These results suggest that down-regulation of LewisX expression in transfected cells was a result of direct competition between human α-1,2- and pig α-1,3-fucosyltransferases occurring in the α-1,2FT-transfected cells.Table IIEndogenous α-1,3-fucosyltransferase activity in the PLECT cell line measured with a panel of low molecular weight acceptor substratesSubstrateα-1.3FT activity2-aActivity expressed relative to that measured with LacNAc-R (100%).%H type 2-R189%LacNAc-R1003′-SialylLacNAc-R0H type 1-R0LNB1-R02-a Activity expressed relative to that measured with LacNAc-R (100%). Open table in a new tab Maackia amurensis agglutinin and Sambuccus nigraagglutinin lectins were used to detect terminal α-2,3- and α-2,6-linked sialic acid on control transfected and α-1,2FT-expressing PLECT cells. Binding of α-2,3-linked sialic acid-specific M. amurensis agglutinin was reduced by approximately 50%, and binding of the α-2,6-linked sialic acid-specific S. nigra agglutinin was reduced by 20 and 60% in clones E and D, respectively (Fig. 5). Sialyltransferase activity was detectable with LacNAc-R and LNB1-R. The former is an acceptor for both α-1,3- and α-2,6-sialyltransferases, whereas activity measured with LNB1-R is indicative of α-1,3-sialyltransferase only. There was no difference in activity between control and transfected cells measured with either acceptor. Human IgM binding was studied by flow cytometry using total purified human IgM. At concentrations up to 700 μg/ml the mean fluorescence intensity of IgM bound to the PLECT cells was proportional to the IgM concentration in the incubation buffer (data not shown). It was not possible to obtain saturating conditions with the IgM preparation used (supplied at 1 mg/ml). Therefore, at the concentrations used (100 and 200 μg/ml), the mean fluorescence intensity measures the level of xenoreactive natural antibody present in the IgM preparation rather than the level of xenoreactive epitope expression on the PLECT cells. Contrary to expectation, the human α-1,2FT-expressing clones D and E bound more human IgM than the mock-transfected PLECT cells (Fig. 6). Oligosaccharide inhibition studies of human IgM binding to the PLECT cells by sucrose, type 2 H trisaccharide, LewisYtetrasaccharide, and α-Gal trisaccharide were carried out to characterize the xenoreactive epitopes on mock-transfected and human α-1,2FT-expressing PLECT cells. Only α-Gal trisaccharide inhibited human IgM binding to PLECT cells, by 65% in mock transfected cells and by 80% in the α-1,2FT-expressing PLECT cells (Fig. 7). This suggests that the increased binding of human IgM to the α-1,2FT-expressing PLECT cells was still largely due to the α-Gal-related epitopes. This is further supported by a similar pattern of inhibition achieved by α-Gal trisaccharide for the mock-transfected and the α-1,2FT-expressing PLECT cells (Fig. 7). Western blots of cell membrane extracts from human α-1,2FT-expressing and control cell lines were probed with biotinylated U. europaeus andB. simplicifolia I/B4 lectins to identify the glycoprotein substrates of α-1,3GT and α-1,2FT. Although lactosamine is a substrate for both α-1,3GT and α-1,2FT in vitro, it can be seen that the glycoprotein substrate repertoires of these two porcine enzymes in the PLECT cells are not identical (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 3). It was also noted that expression of human α-1,2FT in PLECT cells did not affect either overall intensity or distribution of H or α-Gal epitopes on the cell surface proteins (Fig. 8, lanes 2 and 4). To further distinguish between H and α-Gal epitopes on glycoproteins and glycolipids synthesized by PLECT cells, the cells were subjected to papain digestion. Preincubation of mock-transfected and α-1,2FT-expressing PLECT cells with papain was found to decrease significantly the amount of U. europaeuslectin- and B. simplicifolia I/B4-reactive glycoproteins in cell membrane extracts (Fig. 8, lanes 5–8). Although there was a marked decrease in the lectin binding to blotted proteins from papain-treated cells, binding to the cell surface, as measured by flow cytometry, was virtually unchanged (Fig. 9). This difference may be explained by the fact that flow cytometric analysis measures antigen expression on both glycoprotein and glycolipid components of the cell surface, whereas Western blotting characterizes primarily glycoproteins.

https://openalex.org/W1987719171,"The expression of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene is restricted to cells of the myeloid cell lineage and is induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In this study, a series of deletion mutations was introduced in the promoter of the human MPO gene, which was then fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The G-CSF-induced promoter activity was examined in mouse myeloid precursor FDC-P1 transformants that constitutively express the G-CSF receptor. A G-CSF-responsive element (GRE) in the MPO gene was found approximately 800 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site. When the 5′-flanking region of the human MPO gene contained this element, it yielded promoter activity in cells cultured with G-CSF but not in cells cultured with interleukin 3. Gel shift assays with the element showed that a specific nuclear factor(s) (NF/G-CSF) binds to the element. The NF/G-CSF was purified by affinity chromatography using an oligonucleotide of GRE. Protein sequence analysis of the purified NF/G-CSF indicated that NF/G-CSF is a ubiquitous transcription factor, NF-Y, which is composed of three subunits. The recombinant NF-Y was then shown to bind to GRE in a combination of the three subunits."

Our present work suggests that SUG1 can specifically interact with protein-coding RNA (mRNA) and play some roles in mRNA metabolism. The 26 S proteasome is a huge protease complex that degrades short-lived proteins related to metabolic regulation and cell cycle progression (1Ciechanover A.

It is composed of the 20 S catalytic core and an ATPase-containing 22 S regulatory complex (3Tanahashi N. Tsurumi C. Tamura T. Tanaka K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human 22 S complex contains at least five highly related putative ATPases,i.e. TBP1, TBP7, S4, MSS1, and p45 (a homolog of yeast SUG1), which are members of a novel ATPase family named the AAA family (ATPases associated with a variety of cellularactivities) (5Confalonieri F. Duguet M. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The family members have a highly conserved ATPase module with 200 amino acids and fulfill a large diversity of functions. It was demonstrated that the five ATPases contain four conserved motifs characteristic of putative ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases (6Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kanemaki M. Yoshida T. Yamano K.

We previously reported constant distances between each motif among proteasomal ATPases, suggesting the functional importance of these motifs (6Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kanemaki M. Yoshida T. Yamano K.

Of the above ATPases, SUG1 (11Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) has been shown by various studies to be involved in transcriptional regulation in addition to proteolytic function. The yeast SUG1 was reported to be a component of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) holoenzyme (12Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 13Koleske A.J. Young R.A.

Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) also reported that mouse SUG1 interacts with various nuclear receptors. However, it is still controversial as to whether or not SUG1 acts as an intrinsic transcription factor because one cannot eliminate the possibility that those ATPases are involved in degradation of transcription factors mediated by the 26 S proteasome. Actually, some transcription factors are regulated by proteasome-dependent proteolysis (1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Biochemical study is required to resolve issues such as how the ATPases are involved in RNA metabolism such as transcriptional regulation. In this study, we report the purification and characterization of rat SUG1. We found that rSUG1 1The abbreviations used are: rSUG1, rat SUG1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. exhibited ATPase activity that was specifically stimulated by particular RNA molecules. SUG1 cDNA was cloned from a rat liver cDNA library as described previously (6Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kanemaki M. Yoshida T. Yamano K. Kishimoto T. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged rSUG1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coliby use of the pET vector system (16Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Insoluble recombinant rSUG1 was purified by Ni2+-agarose under denaturing conditions according to the instructions supplied by Qiagen. The resulting proteins were further subjected to a preparative SDS-PAGE and recovered from the excised gels. The protein was redissolved in a urea-containing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 8 m urea), and the urea was gradually removed by dialysis. These proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In the case of Fig. 3 A, the ATPase activity was assayed by thin layer chromatography as described (32Fuller-Pace F.V. Nicol S.M. Reid A.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl) contained 0.5 μg of purified rSUG1 in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm ATP, and 1.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). ATP hydrolysis reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 min. Radioactive phosphate released from [γ-32P]ATP was separated on a polyethyleneimine plate (Macherey-Nagel) using 1 m formic acid and 0.5m lithium chloride. The released phosphates were visualized by autoradiography. In other cases, the ATPase activity was assayed using activated charcoal (Sigma) as described by Armon et al. (17Armon T. Ganoth D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20723-20726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified recombinant SUG1 (0.5 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in buffer A. On the basis of εmax, amounts of RNA homopolymers were precisely determined from theirA 260. Control reactions without rSUG1 were carried out in parallel tubes, and the control value (radioactivity) was subtracted from each experimental one. Each assay was done in triplicate, and the results were presented as a simple arithmetic average. ATP cross-linking assays were performed as described by Pause and Sonenberg (18Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 0.5 μg of rSUG1 in a buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP) was irradiated by UV cross-linker LS1500 (Funakoshi) from a distance of 2 cm at 4 °C for 20 min. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and subjected to autoradiography. Radioactivities were measured by a BAS 1500 phosphoimager (Fuji Film). Cellular total RNA was prepared from rat liver by use of cesium trifluoroacetate as described (19Okayama H. Kawaichi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota T. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The total RNA was fractionated into poly(A)+ and poly(A)− RNAs by oligo(dT)-Latex (Takara Shuzo) (20Kuribayashi K. Hikata M. Hiraoka O. Miyamoto C. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. Symp. Ser. 1988; 19: 61-64PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding rat HTF, TIP120, SUG1, and MSS1 were cloned in pBluescript, and in vitro RNA synthesis was conducted with T7 or T3 polymerase according to the instructions supplied by Promega. Quality of the synthesized RNAs was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. HTF is a rat b-Zip transcription factor closely related to the human X-box-binding protein/Tax-response element-binding protein 5 and is activated in hepatocellular carcinoma as well as during normal hepatic cell growth in rats (30Kishimoto T. Kokura K. Kumagai Y. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). TIP120, having partial homology toDrosophila TAF80, is a novel rat TBP-binding protein (31Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MSS1 is a rat homolog of the human MSS1 and is a part of the 26 S proteasome (6Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kanemaki M. Yoshida T. Yamano K. Kishimoto T. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We cloned rat SUG1 (rSUG1) cDNA and found it to encode a protein of 406 amino acids (6Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kanemaki M. Yoshida T. Yamano K. Kishimoto T. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and to have exactly the same structure as human p45 (21Akiyama K. Yokota K. Kagawa S. Shimbara N. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Noda C. Tanaka K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the human homolog of yeast SUG1. The central regions of rSUG1 and the other four proteasomal ATPases share greater than 60% identity and are designated as the ATPase module (Fig. 1). This domain contains a putative ATP-binding motif, GX 4GKT, and ATP hydrolysis motif, DEID, which is analogous to the DEXD box proteins including many ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases (22Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gray N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar, 23Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 24Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 25Koonin E.V. Nature. 1991; 352: 290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Two additional sequences in rSUG1, SAT and (H/Q)RXGRXXR, are also characteristic motifs for RNA/DNA helicases (Fig. 1). Strikingly, we found the distance between individual motifs to be conserved in the five proteasomal ATPases, i.e. 51 residues between GX 4GKT and DEID, 40 residues between DEID and SAT, and 10 residues between SAT and (H/Q)RXGRXXR (Fig. 1) (6Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kanemaki M. Yoshida T. Yamano K. Kishimoto T. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The above findings suggest that these four motifs have some essential roles in the functioning of those ATPases. To investigate the enzymatic nature of rSUG1, we subcloned its cDNA into the pET3a vector and expressed rSUG1 as a fusion protein with a histidine-tag appended to its N terminus in E. coli.Although rSUG1 protein was able to be overexpressed in E. coli (Fig. 2, lane 2), most of the protein was obtained in an insoluble fraction. We attempted to dissolve the insoluble protein in a urea-containing buffer and to purify it under denaturing conditions. Purification by Ni2+-agarose resulted in >40% pure protein as judged by inspection of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-acrylamide gel (Fig. 2, lane 3). To further remove contaminating E. coli proteins, we subjected the protein sample to a preparative SDS-PAGE and subsequently excised the rSUG1 and extracted it from the gel. The recovered proteins were dissolved in a urea-containing buffer and then refolded by dialysis to gradually remove urea (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, the final preparation was apparently pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 4). The ATPase activity of the purified rSUG1 was tested by its ability to release radioactive phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A commercial ATPase from dog kidney was used as a positive control (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). We found that rSUG1 hydrolyzed ATP to release monophosphate (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) but that the enzyme activity could not be detected in a parallel sample prepared from control E. coli (data not shown). It is thus evident that rSUG1 was able to hydrolyze ATP. Release of labeled monophosphates was inhibited by cold ATP and EDTA (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that the rSUG1 is a Mg2+-dependent ATPase. Kinetic analyses of the rSUG1 determined theK m for ATP to be 35 μm and theV max to be 7 pmol of ATP/min/μg of protein (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of ATP hydrolysisK mV maxμmpmol/min/μg proteinrSUG1357rSUG1 + 0.25 μg poly(U)3316rSUG1 + 0.5 μg poly(U)3023rSUG1 + 1.0 μg poly(U)3028ATPase activity was measured using activated charcoal for 10 min as described under “Experimental Procedures” with ATP concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 μm. Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and kinetic constants were calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot. Open table in a new tab ATPase activity was measured using activated charcoal for 10 min as described under “Experimental Procedures” with ATP concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 μm. Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and kinetic constants were calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot. To examine the nucleotide specificity for the SUG1-catalyzed hydrolysis, we employed unlabeled nucleotides as competitors. Expectedly, we found ATP was the most potent competitor; however, CTP competed little with ATP for hydrolysis. GTP and UTP significantly competed with ATP for hydrolysis by rSUG1 to some extent (Fig. 3 B). Thus, rSUG1 is suggested to interact efficiently with all nucleotides except for CTP. This specificity of rSUG1 is similar to that of Yhs4p, a yeast homolog of the human S4 (26Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using a photolabeling technique, we next studied whether polyribopyrimidines affect the interaction of rSUG1 with ATP. This technique, in which ATP is photolyzed by UV light in the presence of ATP-binding protein, yields a covalent adduct between ATP and proteins. By use of [α-32P]ATP, specific radioactive proteins can be visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 A, illumination with UV light resulted in the labeling of the rSUG1 protein (lane 1), and the labeling was efficiently inhibited by cold ATP (lane 2). Incubation of [α-32P]ATP for 20 min did not cross-link the ATP to the protein in the absence of UV light (Fig. 4 A,lane 3). To further confirm the labeling specificity, we carried out the UV-labeling reaction in the presence of cold nucleotides and then estimated the radioactive protein by a phosphoimager. Addition of CTP to the reaction had little effect on the UV labeling of rSUG1 with [α-32P]ATP, whereas GTP and UTP significantly reduced the labeling (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, the effects of nucleotides on the UV labeling of rSUG1 were consistent with those on the ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the labeled rSUG1 is attributed to the specific interaction with ATP. Because SUG1 contains a DEID motif, the protein is considered to belong to a subfamily of the DEAD-box proteins. This family carrying a putative DEAD-box helicase motif includes more than 100 proteins with diverse functions, and some of these proteins have an RNA-stimulated ATPase activity (27Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). So we investigated whether or not nucleic acids would affect the ATPase activity of rSUG1. The enzyme activity was not affected by single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, whereas the rSUG1 ATPase activity was stimulated 6-fold by poly(U) (Fig. 5 A). When the other RNA homopolymers were tested, we observed significant enhancement of the ATPase activity by polyribopyrimidines: poly(U) and poly(C). It is noteworthy that the homoribopolymer stimulation of the rSUG1 ATPase activity is different from that of Yhs4p, whose activity is enhanced by single stranded-DNA, double-stranded DNA, and RNA (26Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, we analyzed the effect of RNA homopolymers on the UV labeling of rSUG1. Fig. 5 B shows that the cross-linking was also highly stimulated by poly(U) and poly(C), but not by poly(G) and poly(A). On the basis of these results, we demonstrated that polyribopyrimidines specifically faclitate the photolabeling of rSUG1 as well as its ATPase activity. We also determined the kinetic parameters of the rSUG1 ATPase in the presence of poly(U). The K m andV max values showed similar affinity (K m) for ATP in the hydrolysis reaction with or without poly(U) (Table I). In contrast, addition of 1 μg of poly(U) increased the V max 4-fold (Table I). When poly(C) was used, similar results were obtained (data not shown). The increased ATP cross-linking of rSUG1 by poly(U) and poly(C) correlated with their higher rate of ATP hydrolysis, but not with their ATP binding ability, since the K m values of rSUG1 were similar in the presence or absence of the polyribopyrimidines. We suppose that the cross-linking assay used here detects two molecular species, i.e. ATP-bound rSUG1 and ADP-bound rSUG1. The ATP cross-linking of rSUG1 is suggested to reflect the abilities to both bind and hydrolyze ATP. On the basis of the above results, it was important to examine whether natural RNA can stimulate the ATP hydrolysis reaction of rSUG1. Cellular total RNA, poly(A)+ RNAs, and poly(A)− RNAs were added to the ATPase reaction. As shown in Fig. 6 A, total RNA slightly stimulated the ATPase activity (1.5-fold). It was most striking that the ATPase activity was highly enhanced (6-fold) by poly(A)+ RNA, whereas poly(A)− RNA exhibited apparently no effect (Fig. 6 A). This finding suggests that the rSUG1 activity is specifically stimulated by mRNA. We therefore examined the effect of various kinds of mRNA-type RNAs on the ATP hydrolysis. Four kinds of cDNAs encoding rat SUG1, MSS1 (6Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kanemaki M. Yoshida T. Yamano K. Kishimoto T. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), HTF (30Kishimoto T. Kokura K. Kumagai Y. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and TIP120 (31Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in pBluescript were transcribed by T7 or T3 RNA polymerase in vitro to produce sense and antisense RNAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each kind of RNA was then added to the reaction mixture for ATP hydrolysis by rSUG1. In these experiments, sense HTF RNA apparently stimulated ATP hydrolysis in a dose-dependent manner, and TIP120 sense RNA had a weak but significant effect (Fig. 6 B). However, sense SUG1 and MSS1 RNAs, and antisense HTF RNA enhanced the ATPase activity little (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that, in a physiological environment, the ATPase activity of rSUG1 can be specifically stimulated by particular species of protein-encoding RNAs. In this paper, we have provided evidence that rat SUG1 exhibits ATPase activity. Our rSUG1 preparation was apparently pure, and Sf9 cell-expressed soluble rSUG1 protein also showed the same enzyme properties (data not shown) as obtained with the renatured bacterially expressed protein. This agreement suggests that the nature of rSUG1 presented in this study reflects intrinsic enzyme activities. Importantly, biochemical characterization of the recombinant rSUG1 yielded the following significant findings. (i) The rSUG1 ATPase activity is specifically stimulated by particular types of RNAs including poly(C) and poly(U), but not by single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs. (ii) Polyribopyrimidines also enhance the labeling of rSUG1 with [α-32P]ATP. (iii) Cellular poly(A)+ RNAs and in vitro transcribed specific RNAs enhance ATP hydrolysis. Although several DEAD-box family proteins show ATPase activity facilitated by RNA, the observation that rSUG1 exhibits a specific RNA requirement is particularly interesting. rSUG1 is the first example of a proteasomal ATPase having such a requirement. Yhs4p, a yeast homolog of human S4, is activated by unspecified RNAs and DNAs commonly (26Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is of interest to investigate the effect of nucleic acids on the ATPase activity of human S4 and to compare the results between the human and yeast ATPases. Other mammalian proteasomal ATPases might also exhibit such a nucleic acid requirement, since members of the ATPase family are highly homologous to each other. The DEAD-box proteins such as eIF-4A and p68 exhibit an RNA-unwinding activity as well as RNA-stimulated ATPase activity (27Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that rSUG1 also could have an RNA-dependent helicase activity; however we unable to detect it in our rSUG1 preparation. A particular RNA substrate or some co-factor(s) might be required for nucleic acid unwinding. We have reported here that rSUG1 activity is efficiently stimulated by synthetic RNAs and mRNA-type RNAs. How does HTF cDNA-derived RNA specifically activate the ATPase activity of rSUG1? We found that HTF cDNA contained clustered TC-rich stretches, whereas other cDNAs tested here did not (data not shown). Thus it is reasonable to assume that these stretches are important in such activation (30Kishimoto T. Kokura K. Kumagai Y. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), since polyribopyrimidines highly stimulated ATP hydrolysis by rSUG1 (Fig. 3 B). Additionally, it may be possible that the RNA requirement for rSUG1 is determined by unknown secondary/tertiary structure in mRNA-type RNAs. We suspect that more suitable substrates for SUG1 than RNA encoding HTF may be present among cellular mRNAs. The observation that some mRNAs are specifically required to stimulate ATPase activity by rSUG1 raises an interesting question. SUG1 is one of the regulatory subunits of the 26 S proteasome (21Akiyama K. Yokota K. Kagawa S. Shimbara N. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Noda C. Tanaka K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Hengartner C. Young R.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Nature. 1996; 379: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein has been reported to be an integral component of the RNA polymerase II complex and to bind to TATA-binding protein, as well as to several nuclear hormone receptors (12Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear that SUG1 functions as a factor responsible for transcription. Our data that ATPase activity of rSUG1 is facilitated by particular mRNAs suggest that rSUG1 interacts with mRNA and can play a role in mRNA metabolism in addition to one in proteolysis. This assumption may be supported by the fact that the ATPase activity of the rat 26 S proteasome (9Ugai S. Tamura T. Tanahashi N. Takai S. Komi N. Chung C.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 113: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was not stimulated by poly(C) or poly(U) (data not shown). Most recently, McCracken et al. (10McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II large subunit associates with 3′-processing factors and splicing factors. These findings suggest that transcription, splicing, and processing (cleavage, polyadenylation, etc.) of mRNA are intimately coupledin vivo. Other investigations employing staining with antibodies against nuclear factors also support our idea (33Zeng C. Kim E. Warren S.L. Begget S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The RNA pol II holoenzyme is likely to contain all the general transcription factors and mRNA-processing factors. If SUG1 is, in fact, associated with RNA pol II holoenzyme, our findings might have profound implications for the role of SUG1 in mRNA processing,i.e. transcription or post-transcriptional events. However, we cannot exclude an alternative possibility that SUG1 in the 26 S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of some mRNA-binding proteins. Antizyme, a noncompetitive inhibitory protein, is responsible for degradation of ornithine decarboxylase by the 26 S proteasome (34Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,35Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 893-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of antizyme induces a conformational change in ODC that promotes recognition of ornithine decarboxylase by the 26 S proteasome to stimulate its proteolysis (36Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kemeji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 37Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it is possible that some mRNA-binding proteins that undergo conformational changes induced by interaction with mRNAs may be targets of SUG1 for proteasome-mediated proteolysis.

Mature thyroglobulin is a dimer with a M r of 660,000, consisting of two apparently identical chains, each containing 67 tyrosyls and 2748 amino acid residues (numbered to exclude a 19-residue leader sequence) in the human (1Malthiéry Y. Lissitzsky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein is synthesized and partially matured within thyrocytes (intramonomer disulfide bonding, glycosylation, sulfatation, phosphorylation) and then secreted into the follicular lumen. In this compartment, thyroglobulin is further processed by iodination, hormonogenesis, and completion of some complex type oligosaccharide units (2Bjorkman U. Ekholm R. Greer M.A. Biochemistry of Thyroid Hormone Formation and Secretion. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 83-125Google Scholar). Iodination of thyroglobulin tyrosyls is thought to be mediated by the thyroperoxidase at the thyrocyte apical cell surface. About 10–50 atoms of iodide are associated with each molecule (3Ekholm R. Wollman S. Endocrinology. 1975; 97: 1432-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hormone formation per se requires thyroperoxidase-mediated coupling of two iodotyrosyls. The coupling reaction leaves iodothyronine and dehydroalanine at the acceptor and donor sites, respectively (4Gavaret J.-M. Nunez J. Cahnmann H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5281-5285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gavaret J.M. Cahnman H.J. Nunez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9167-9173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thyroglobulins from various species have been compared. The hormonogenic iodotyrosyl residues (no more than four per monomer) are in both the N- and C-terminal domains of the prohormone, and their positions are well conserved (6Rawitch A.B. Chernoff S.B.

The hormonogenic 580 C-terminal residue domain is cysteine-poor, presents no repeated sequence, and structure predictions suggest that it is flexible (1Malthiéry Y. Lissitzsky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal domain (encoded by exon 1 to exon 15, residues 1–1209) consists of tandem repeats rich in cysteine residues, called type 1 repeats, interrupted by unrelated sequences (1Malthiéry Y. Lissitzsky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Merken L. Simon M.J. De Martynoff G. Swillens S. Vassart G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These cysteine-rich repeats are probably involved in disulfide bonds, suggesting that iodotyrosyl coupling results in a highly coordinate three-dimensional structure with a limited flexibility. In vivo kinetic experiments have shown the following: (i) production of mature prohormones requires intralumenal retention, and (ii) mature thyroglobulins preferentially participate in the secretion of hormones in the venous flow, after thyroglobulin internalization and its proteolytic cleavage in the lysosomal system (2Bjorkman U. Ekholm R. Greer M.A. Biochemistry of Thyroid Hormone Formation and Secretion. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 83-125Google Scholar, 13Bastiani P. Simon C.

These findings and the observation that thyroglobulin iodination is closely associated with glycan completion (15Bastiani P. Papandreou M.J. Blanck O. Fenouillet E. Thibault V. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4204-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) led us to investigate and demonstrate a quality control system that prevents lysosomal homing and degradation of iodine-poor immature thyroglobulin. This control depends on the recognition of a subset of molecules by an endogenous receptor and suggests that there is a recycling mechanism by which receptor-bound immature thyroglobulins are passed back to the thyroperoxidase iodination site via the Golgi apparatus (16Miquelis R. Courageot J. Jacq A. Blanck O. Perrin C. Bastiani P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin binding to the thyrocyte receptor is optimal at acidic pH (17Miquelis R. Alquier C. Monsigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15291-15298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mziaut H. Bastiani P. Balivet T. Papandreou M.J. Fert V. Erregragui K. Blanck O. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which is consistent with an interaction in prelysosomal compartments. The thyroglobulin receptor interacts with both carbohydrate and peptide determinants of the prohormone (15Bastiani P. Papandreou M.J. Blanck O. Fenouillet E. Thibault V. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4204-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Miquelis R. Courageot J. Jacq A. Blanck O. Perrin C. Bastiani P. J.

Bastiani P. Balivet T. Papandreou M.J. Fert V. Erregragui K. Blanck O. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to use anti-thyroglobulin antibodies to identify the receptor binding domain of the human prohormone. We thereby mapped the receptor binding domain to the N-terminal thyroglobulin region encoded by exons 10 to 14. The domain presents incompletely processed oligosaccharide units bearing accessible GlcNAc residues and includes tyrosyl residues reported to be either iodinated or involved in hormonogenesis. The antithyroglobulin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs, 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CNBr, cyanogen bromide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Tg, thyroglobulin; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin.

Malthiéry Y. Zanelli E. Charvet B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3692-3698PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Y. Malthiery (Faculté de Medecine, Angers, France). Endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (N-glycanase) from Flavobacterium meningosepticumwas from Boehringer Mannheim, and Clostridium perfringensneuraminidase was from Sigma. Peptide fragments from iodine-poor human thyroglobulin (gift from B. Mallet and P-J Lejeune, Faculté de Medecine, Marseille, France) were aliquot fractions of previously described preparations (20Marriq C. Lejeune P.J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzsky S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, thyroglobulin (2.8 atoms of iodine/mol, traces of T3, 10 mmol T4/mol) was from a patient with a single colloid goiter. Purified thyroglobulin was treated with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), and the resulting digest was eluted by chromatography on a Sephadex G-200 column in 1 m propionic acid. Five fractions (I–V) were collected (void volume to gel-included fractions), dialyzed, and lyophilized. CNBr peptide fragments of fraction II were further separated using a model 491 Prep Cell preparative electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). Peptides (20 mg) were solubilized in buffer A (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 5% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated (5 min at 90 °C) and loaded onto a 12% acrylamide running gel on small Prep Cell column (28 mm inner diameter). Electrophoresis was carried out (200–250 V/40 mA constant current) for 12 h. After elution of the bromphenol blue, 2.5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Prestained standards were used to estimate molecular masses. Peptide fractions called fraction II1 (26 kDa, corresponding to collected fractions 22–30), II2 (28 kDa, fractions 40–46), II3 (40 kDa, fractions 65–82), II4 (44 kDa, fractions 162–171), and II5 (50 kDa, fractions 191–206) were pooled, dialyzed at 4 °C for 24 h against ammonium acetate, and lyophilized. The purified hormonogenic CNBr N-terminal domain (Asn1-Met171, see Refs. 20Marriq C. Lejeune P.J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzsky S.

Fractions II1 to II5 were further characterized by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and immunoblotting using mAb78 or mAb240 (1–3 μg/ml) for 2 h and then alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for an additional 2 h. Single peptides N2 and N3, corresponding to the major peptide of subfractions II2 and II3, respectively, were separated from minor contaminants either using a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column in a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (peptide N2) or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, excision of the major band, and electroelution (peptide N3). Purified N2 and N3 peptides (500 pmol) were concentrated and washed onto a Problott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Prospin Sample Preparation Cartridge, Applied Biosystems) and sequenced. Automated Edman degradations were performed using a 476A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with an on-line 140A analyzer for identification of the phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid derivatives separated on a phenylthiohydantoin C18 reverse-phase HPLC column. The location of sequences within thyroglobulin were found by computer comparison with amino acid sequences deduced from published cDNA sequences (Ref. 1Malthiéry Y. Lissitzsky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, accession number 625277). pEX1, pEX2, and pEX3 human thyroglobulin expression libraries (18Mziaut H. Bastiani P. Balivet T.

Malthiéry Y. Zanelli E. Charvet B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3692-3698PubMed Google Scholar), were plated on nitrocellulose disks (BA85, diameter 85 mm; Schleicher and Schüll, Dassel, Germany) by filtration to obtain approximately 100–500 colonies per disk and were grown at 32 °C on Luria Bertani/ampicillin medium. After amplification and regrowth, fusion protein synthesis was induced by a 2-h incubation at 42 °C. Nitrocellulose disks were treated with chloroform vapor for 15–30 min, incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml DNase I, 40 μg/ml lysozyme) for 4 h at room temperature, and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline. For immunoscreening, disks were incubated for 2 h in the presence of mAb78 or mAb240 (1–5 μg/ml). Selected immunoreactive clones were grown in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin per ml at 32 °C to obtain an optical density at 550 nm of 0.4. Protein expression was induced to obtain large quantities of hybrid protein (23Stanley K.K. Luzio J.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1429-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Bacterial extract (5 μl) was dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunodetection was performed as described above. The sequence of the cDNA insert of the positive clone was determined by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method with T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Human thyroglobulin (10 μg) was iodinated with IODO-GEN (50 μg) and Na125I (1 mCi) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for 15 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by dilution with 1 ml of PBS, and Tg was isolated by gel filtration on a Sephadex S-200 column. The specific activity was 95 μCi/μg. The N3 peptide (4 μg, specific activity 10 μCi/μg) was iodinated using the same procedure. Endoglycosidase H treatment was carried out by incubating the reduced N3 peptide (1.5 μg) for 20 h at 37 °C with 2 milliunits of Endo-H in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.03% SDS.N-Glycanase treatment was also performed on the reduced N3 peptide (1.5 μg) by incubation at 37 °C for 20 h with 1.5 milliunits of N-glycanase in 50 μl of 50 mmacetate buffer, pH 5.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was stopped by heating for 3 min at 100 °C and subjecting the sample to SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose which was then incubated with mAb78 (diluted 1/100), added for 2 h, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for 2 h. In an additional experiment to assess the extent of deglycosylation at various concentrations of N-glycanase, aliquot fractions of radiolabeled 125I-N3 peptide (10 ng, 120,000 cpm) were treated in the same medium with N-glycanase at each 25, 2.5, 0.25, 0.025, 0.0025, and 0.00025 milliunits. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gel was scanned and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad, Les Ullis, France). Neuraminidase treatment was performed on aliquots (30 ng) of the radiolabeled N3 peptide by reaction with 25 milliunits of C. perfringens sialidase in 60 μl of acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 20 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by heating for 3 min at 80 °C, and the sample was then extensively dialyzed against phosphate buffer. Incompletely processed complex type oligosaccharides bearing accessible GlcNAc residues were detected using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Bandeiraea simplicifola II (BSS II)-conjugated agarose columns. A minor modification of established method (18Mziaut H. Bastiani P. Balivet T. Papandreou M.J. Fert V. Erregragui K. Blanck O. Miquelis R.

Briefly, 20 μl of radiolabeled125I-N3 peptide (before (250,000 cpm) or after neuraminidase treatment (330,000 cpm)) was applied to WGA columns (150 μl) and allow to stand for 1 h. The columns were washed with 15 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (wash buffer), and then with 5 ml of a Gal elution buffer (1 md-(+)-galactose in wash buffer, this step served as a specific control) and 5 ml of a GlcNAc elution buffer (1 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine in wash buffer). 0.5-ml fractions were collected and counted in a gamma counter. BSS II affinity chromatography was performed as described previously for the native thyroglobulin (15Bastiani P. Papandreou M.J. Blanck O. Fenouillet E. Thibault V. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4204-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Mziaut H. Bastiani P. Balivet T. Papandreou M.J. Fert V. Erregragui K. Blanck O. Miquelis R.

The column (300 μl) was equilibrated with loading buffer consisting of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, MnCl2, and MgCl2. After equilibration, 40 μl of 125I-N3 peptide (500,000 cpm) was loaded onto the column and allowed to interact for 1 h. The unbound fraction was recovered by adding 30 ml of loading buffer. The bound fraction was recovered by addition of a buffer containing 0.5 m GlcNAc. 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Solid phase assays of thyroglobulin binding to FRTL 5 membranes were performed as follows. Membranes, prepared as described previously (15Bastiani P. Papandreou M.J. Blanck O. Fenouillet E.

The wells were washed three times with 150 μl of PBS and once with 200 μl of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Thyroglobulin (5 × 104 to 106 cpm in 100 μl of a binding buffer containing 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was then added and incubated at 4 °C for 90 min. The wells were washed four times with the binding buffer, and radioactivity was measured. Reported data are means of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. pEX human thyroglobulin expression libraries were prepared from PstI fragments of thyroglobulin cDNA inserted into the three forms of the pEX plasmid, corresponding to the three reading frames. Between 200 and 700 transformed pOp2136 E. coli cells were plated, corresponding to about seven copies of each fragment in every reading frame. Nitrocellulose culture disk replicas were tested for the presence of peptides encoding the receptor thyroglobulin binding domain by using mAb78 and mAb240 antibodies. One immunoreactive clone recognized by mAb240 was isolated in the initial screening, and only in pEX1 (Fig. 1 A). The hybrid protein produced by this positive clone was further characterized. As expected, the length of the Cro-LacZ fusion protein obtained after induction (23Stanley K.K. Luzio J.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1429-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) was greater than β-galactosidase (M r of the fusion protein about 165,000). Moreover, this fusion protein was recognized by mAb240 only (Fig. 1 C). The length of the PstI cDNA fragment in this positive clone was 444 base pairs, and the deduced peptide sequence, we named peptide N1, corresponded to Ala1148-Glu1295 on the human thyroglobulin monomeric molecule (Fig. 4).Figure 4Positions in thyroglobulin and amino acid sequences of isolated peptides.

The failure to obtain a thyroglobulin fragment-fusion protein encoding the mAb78 epitope prompted us to search for such immunoreactive peptides from human native thyroglobulin. Five fractions previously obtained after Sephadex G-200 filtration of the CNBr digest from iodine-poor thyroglobulin were used as a source of peptide fragments (Ref. 20Marriq C. Lejeune P.J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzsky S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 A). After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, immunoreactive peptides were found only in fraction I (M r 42,000 with mAb78, ranging from 50,000 to 64,000 with mAb240) and fraction II (M r 38,000, and ranging from 50,000 to 80,000 with both mAbs) (Fig. 2 B). Because they included the smallest fragment (about 39 kDa) recognized by both mAbs, peptides of fraction II were further separated by preparative electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis of five fractions, designated II1 to II5 and ranging from 25 to 55 kDa (Fig. 3 A), led to the identification of two peptides fractions. One (II2, about 28 kDa) was recognized by mAb78 and the second (II3, about 40 kDa) by both mAb78 and mAb240 (Fig. 3 B). The same results were obtained by immunoblot using single peptides N2 and N3, prepared from fractions II2 and II3, respectively, and devoid of minor contaminants after further purification on reverse-phase HPLC column and/or by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and electroelution (data not shown).Figure 3Preparative electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis of human Tg CNBr peptide subfractions.

After 8 Edman degradation cycles of both peptides, we obtained the same sequence, SYREAASG, corresponding to Ser789-Gly796 on the thyroglobulin polypeptide chain, indicating that both peptides began at Ser789. Four additional Edman degradation cycles on peptide N3 failed to identify the residue at position 797. As an Asn residue was expected at this position, but in a context of a potential glycosylation site (NXS), we inferred that Asn797 was glycosylated. Finally, taking into account both their apparent molecular weights and the possible CNBr cleavage sites within the thyroglobulin corresponding domain (see Fig. 4, lower part), we deduced that the C-terminal residues were Met1008 and Met1172 for peptides N2 and N3, respectively.Table IN-terminal sequencing and thyroglobulin position of the N2 and N3 CnBr peptidesPeptideN-terminal sequenceApparentM rCalculatedM rThyroglobulin positionN2SYREAASG28,00024,987Ser789–Met1008N3SYREAASG?FSL39,30042,527Ser789–Met1172 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 indicates the com"
https://openalex.org/W1981218571,"The poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol) has been shown to contain two NTP binding sites by chemical cross-linking of oxidized nucleotide to the intact protein. Only one site (Lys-61) was shown to be essential for RNA chain elongation activity by purified enzyme; however, a full-length viral RNA, coding for an altered lysine residue (K276L) in the second site, generated virus with a minute plaque phenotype that rapidly reverted to a wild-type phenotype with Arg-276 replacing Leu-276 in 3D. Viruses with lysine to leucine substitutions in other positions of the second binding site of their polymerase proteins grew with wild-type phenotype. To test the significance of the second binding site, poliovirus 3Dpol was generated with lysine (wild-type), leucine, or arginine at residue 276 and tested for NTP cross-linking using 32P-oxidized GTP. Analysis of cyanogen bromide peptides of each 3D preparation showed that the second NTP binding site had severely reduced NTP binding in μ276(Leu) but not in the revertant μ276(Arg), despite the reported requirement for lysine in the cross-linking reaction. To eliminate the possibility that32P-oxidized GTP cross-linked to Arg at residue 276, a model system was designed with unmodified amino acid or acetylated (α-amino) amino acid and 32P-oxidized GTP. Cross-linking to lysine, but not leucine or arginine, was observed thus eliminating the possibility that NTP could be cross-linked to residue 276 in 3D. We conclude that NTP binding at the second site in poliovirus 3D is at lysine residues at positions other than 276 (278 or 283), and nucleotide binding at these sites has no bearing on elongation activity or replication of the virus.

Nucleotide binding only at the site including Lys-61 is essential for RNA replication. Investigations of structure-function relationships have been conducted recently for a number of DNA- and RNA-directed polymerases (1Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 2Moras D. Nature. 1993; 364: 572-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Joyce C.M.

A unifying structural framework has been observed with three conserved sequence motifs for DNA-directed polymerases. Four conserved motifs are found in RNA-directed polymerases, two of which are shared with the DNA-directed polymerases (5Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). These conserved motifs contain several invariant amino acids, which appear in close proximity in three dimensional space and may have direct involvement in active site functions. Crystallographic studies demonstrate that DNA and RNA polymerases have marked structural similarities. The common structural features have been described as the “fingers”, “palm”, and “thumb” subdomains relating to a cupped right hand (2Moras D. Nature. 1993; 364: 572-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Joyce C.M.

Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). A characteristic protein fold forms a nucleic acid binding cleft, and a trio of invariant acidic amino acids in the conserved motifs are clustered in the “palm”, allowing binding of metal ions associated with the nucleotide to bring these substrates into the catalytic pocket. More recently T7 RNA polymerase, Taq polymerase, and the mammalian DNA polymerase β have been added to the list of polymerases studied, and all share these core structural features (4Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar,7Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1123-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although these unified structural features are seen in DNA-directed DNA and RNA polymerases and in RNA-directed DNA polymerase, little has been reported for RNA-directed RNA polymerases. The poliovirus RNA-directed RNA polymerase, designated 3Dpol, is the best-studied of this class of enzymes. As with the other enzymes, signature sequence motifs are present in the central portion of the protein sequence, and residues in the conserved YGDD sequence (residues 326 to 329) have been implicated in metal ion binding (10Jablonski S.A. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure has been solved, and structural alignments with other polymerases demonstrate similar fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains for this member of the superfamily as well. 1S. Schultz and J. Hansen, personal communication. 1S. Schultz and J. Hansen, personal communication. To identify residues involved in the catalytic site of this enzyme, we performed chemical cross-linking studies to determine where NTP bound to the protein (12Richards O.C. Hansen J.L. Schultz S. Ehrenfeld E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cross-linking to two different peptides was observed: one spanned amino acid residues 57 to 74, near the N terminus of the protein; the other was between residues 266 and 286, in the central portion of the molecule. It was unclear, however, whether NTP binding to both of these sites was required for polymerase function. Since the chemical cross-linking procedure used is reported to require lysine residues (13Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wallace J.C. Keech D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we engineered mutations into the polymerase cDNA that changed each lysine individually to leucine (14Richards O.C. Baker S. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8564-8570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the peptide near the N terminus, substitution of a specific lysine residue (Lys-61) abolished NTP binding measured by GTP-agarose affinity chromatography and abolished polymerase activity of the enzyme in vitro. Substitution of Lys-66, the only other lysine in this NTP binding peptide, had no effect on either activity. For the second cross-linked peptide, replacement of each of the three lysine residues (Lys-276, Lys-278, Lys-283) did not affect NTP binding and had no effect on polymerase activity. Thus, it initially appeared that NTP cross-linking to this portion of the polymerase protein was fortuitous and unrelated to any significant biological reaction. However, when the altered polymerase containing leucine at residue 276 was inserted into full-length viral RNA and used to transfect HeLa cells, an extremely slow growing virus emerged forming minute plaques, which quickly generated pseudorevertants with arginine replacing the leucine. Virus containing leucine residues at position 278 or 283 showed wild-type growth properties. Thus, the possibility remained that NTP binding at Lys-276 of the 3Dpol molecule was required for some step in the RNA replication reaction. Fig. 1shows a schematic representation of the NTP binding sites and summarizes the properties of the enzymes containing different residues at position 276. For preparation of each 3D sequence altered at amino acid residue 276 (3Dμ276) aBlnI-SfuI (1200 base pair) fragment was excised from pT5T-3D, a plasmid expressing wild-type poliovirus polymerase (15Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar), and exchanged with the corresponding fragments from pEXC-3Dμ276(Arg) or pEXC-3Dμ276(Leu), which were described previously (14Richards O.C. Baker S. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8564-8570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to generate plasmids pT5T-3Dμ276(Arg) and pT5T-3Dμ276(Leu). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS for 3D expression. Expression was at room temperature in 2 × YT medium under ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) selection and were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 reached 0.5; induction was continued for 20 h. Poliovirus RNA polymerase was purified from these cells, essentially as described previously (11Richards O.C. Yu P. Neufeld K.L. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17141-17146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Neufeld K.L. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including preparation of a soluble lysate, 0–40% saturation ammonium sulfate precipitation, phosphocellulose chromatography, and two MonoQ column purifications. Cyanogen bromide digestion of polymerase-[32P]GTP complexes was done as described previously (12Richards O.C. Hansen J.L. Schultz S. Ehrenfeld E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Peptides were fractionated on a Vydac C4 (wild-type 3Dpol) or a Vydac C18 (3Dμ276(Leu) or 3Dμ276(Arg)) reverse phase column (4.6 × 250 mm) using Buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and Buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) in the following regimen: 15% Buffer B isocratic wash for 60 min, 15–50% Buffer B for 70 min, 50–100% Buffer B for 5 min, and maintain at 100% Buffer B for 5 min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected starting immediately after the isocratic wash and monitored by Cerenkov radiation in the scintillation counter. [32P]GTP was oxidized with NaIO4, as described previously (12Richards O.C. Hansen J.L. Schultz S. Ehrenfeld E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The32P-oxidized GTP was purified by passage over Sephadex G10 (13Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wallace J.C. Keech D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cross-linking to amino acids was done in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 400 μm magnesium acetate with 200 μm32P-oxidized GTP, 2 mm amino acid (lysine, arginine, or leucine), and 1 mmNaCNBH3 at 0 °C. for 17 to 24 h. Products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on cellulose polyethyleneimine (Baker-flex) sheets (J. T. Baker, Inc.) using ascending chromatography in a solvent of 0.8 mNH4HCO3. Plates were dried, and products were detected by autoradiography on Kodak BioMax MR film. To determine whether NTP binding to Lys-276 was essential for virus replication, enzyme containing lysine (wild-type), leucine (minute plaque), or arginine (revertant) at position 276 in 3Dpol was purified and analyzed for their abilities to cross-link to NTP. Fig. 2 shows the state of purity of each 3D preparation; each appears greater than 90% homogeneous by Coomassie Blue staining. 32P-Oxidized GTP was cross-linked to 3D and stabilized by reduction with NaCNBH3, as described previously (12Richards O.C. Hansen J.L. Schultz S. Ehrenfeld E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The enzyme-[32P]GTP complex was digested with cyanogen bromide, and the resulting peptides were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC. Fig. 3 shows the elution patterns of 32P-labeled peptides recovered. Our previous work had identified the earliest eluting peak for wild-type enzyme (top panel) as a peptide consisting of residues 252 to 286 and containing lysine residues 276, 278, and 283. The second peak consisted of peptides containing residues 7 to 74, whereas the remaining material consisted of a mixture of multiple peptides including incomplete digestion products. Similar analysis of enzyme 3Dμ276(Leu) (middle panel) showed almost a complete absence of the earliest peak, indicating that protein with a leucine residue at position 276 failed to bind NTP to the central region of the protein sequence. (Total radioactivity in these samples is not directly comparable.) These data indicated either that NTP cross-linking occurred to Lys-276 in the wild-type protein or that contacts were at Lys-278 or Lys-283 but were prevented from forming due to structural alterations induced in the protein by the substitution at position 276. To distinguish between these possibilities, enzyme containing Arg-276 was purified and subjected to the same cross-linking and peptide analysis (bottom panel). This enzyme was fully functional for all essential activities, since the virus containing this coding sequence manifested wild-type growth properties (14Richards O.C. Baker S. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8564-8570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [32P]NTP cross-linking to the earliest peak was restored. If cross-linking to the oxidized nucleotide requires the ε-amino group of lysine for reactivity, then these data show that nucleotide cross-linking occurred at either Lys-278 or Lys-283. Elimination of either of these lysine residues had no effect on the properties of the enzymes or on the phenotype of virus harboring these mutations (Fig. 1); thus nucleotide binding to this portion of the 3D molecule is not relevant to any essential activity of the protein.Figure 3Elution profiles obtained by fractionation of cyanogen bromide-digested [32P]GTP-3Dpolcomplexes.

To confirm this conclusion, a model system was designed to test whether32P-oxidized GTP could be cross-linked to arginine under conditions consistent with cross-linking to poliovirus polymerase.32P-Oxidized GTP was reacted with lysine, arginine, or leucine residues present at position 276 in 3D for wild-type and mutant enzymes, and reaction mixes were analyzed by thin layer chromatography to look for an altered mobility of the labeled GTP. The results of cross-linking reactions are depicted in Fig. 4. [32P]GTP migrates with aR F of 0.27 in this solvent system under our chromatography conditions (lane 7). 32P-Oxidized GTP remains at the origin (lanes 1 and 6); not all GTP is oxidized in this experiment. Reduction of the32P-oxidized GTP with NaCNBH3 causes no change in the migration pattern of the oxidized nucleotide (lane 2). Lysine exhibits cross-linking to oxidized GTP (lane 3; R F 0.38), whereas arginine (lane 4) and leucine (lane 5) do not. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 was performed at pH 8.5; similar results were obtained at pH 11 by using the amino acid as the buffering agent (data not shown). Furthermore, cross-linking reactions were done with acetyl derivatives of each amino acid (Bachem Bioscience Inc.) in which the α-NH2 group was blocked, and the results were identical to those obtained with unblocked amino acids. We conclude that of these three amino acids, only lysine can be cross-linked to oxidized GTP under conditions used for cross-linking to poliovirus RNA polymerase (12Richards O.C. Hansen J.L. Schultz S. Ehrenfeld E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus by extrapolation to the polymerase, only wild-type enzyme could be cross-linked to oxidized GTP at residue 276. Since 3Dμ276(Arg) shows essentially normal levels of nucleotide cross-linking to the 252–286 residue peptide, the observed cross-linking must occur at residue 278 or 283. Reduced cross-linking to GTP for 3Dμ276(Leu) compared with 3Dμ276(Arg) or 3Dwt276(Lys) is likely the result of a different conformational presentation at 278 or 283 to oxidized GTP in these polymerases. Thus nucleotide binding to this central region in poliovirus 3D appears to have no bearing on elongation activity or on any other essential steps in RNA replication. The poliovirus RNA polymerase manifests approximately stoichiometric binding of NTP to each of two sites on the linear polypeptide chain, at Lys-61 and Lys-278 or -283. Binding at Lys-61 is implicated in catalytic activity in the polymerization reaction; the position of this residue in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme has not been resolved. Binding at Lys-278 or Lys-283 appears not to be required for any essential activity. Although these residues are positioned toward the back of the fingers domain in the three-dimensional structure and might have been suggested as candidates for contribution to the active site, their efficient cross-linking appears to occur fortuitously due to site exposure and potential reactivity, and serves as a warning to the interpretation of cross-linking data."
