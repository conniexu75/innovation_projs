https://openalex.org/W2117023388,"Schistosoma mansoni is the primary causative agent of schistosomiasis, which affects 200 million individuals in 74 countries. We generated 163,000 expressed-sequence tags (ESTs) from normalized cDNA libraries from six selected developmental stages of the parasite, resulting in 31,000 assembled sequences and 92% sampling of an estimated 14,000 gene complement. By analyzing automated Gene Ontology assignments, we provide a detailed view of important S. mansoni biological systems, including characterization of metazoa-specific and eukarya-conserved genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests an early divergence from other metazoa. The data set provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of tissue organization, development, signaling, sexual dimorphism, host interactions and immune evasion and identifies novel proteins to be investigated as vaccine candidates and potential drug targets."

We examined whether superoxide and lipid peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal act independently to activate UCPs, or if they share a common pathway, perhaps by superoxide exposure leading to the formation of lipid peroxidation products. This possibility can be tested by blocking the putative reactive oxygen species cascade with selective antioxidants and then reactivating UCPs with distal cascade components. We synthesized a mitochondria-targeted derivative of the spin trap α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone, which reacts rapidly with carbon-centered radicals but is unreactive with superoxide and lipid peroxidation products. [4-[4-[[(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-oxidoimino]methyl]phenoxy]butyl]triphenylphosphonium bromide (MitoPBN) prevented the activation of UCPs by superoxide but did not block activation by hydroxynonenal. This was not due to MitoPBN reacting with superoxide or the hydroxyl radical or by acting as a chain-breaking antioxidant. MitoPBN did react with carbon-centered radicals and also prevented lipid peroxidation by the carbon-centered radical generator 2,2′-azobis(2-methyl propionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH). Furthermore, AAPH activated UCPs, and this was blocked by MitoPBN. These data suggest that superoxide and lipid peroxidation products share a common pathway for the activation of UCPs. Superoxide releases iron from iron-sulfur center proteins, which then generates carbon-centered radicals that initiate lipid peroxidation, yielding breakdown products that activate UCPs.

Pathological oxidative damage to mitochondria in diseases and aging is a consequence of this ROS production, although there are many protective and adaptive responses to prevent and repair oxidative damage (2.Wallace D.C.

Three UCPs have been characterized in mammals (6.Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp. Physiol. 2003; 88: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). UCP1 increases the proton conductance of the mitochondrial inner membrane in brown adipose tissue (BAT) for thermogenesis; in contrast, the physiological role of its homologs UCP2 and UCP3 is uncertain. One possibility (7.Brand M.D. Buckingham J.A. Esteves T.C. Green K. Lambert A.J. Miwa S. Murphy M.P. Pakay J.L. Talbot D.A. Echtay K.S. Biochem. Soc.

That UCP2 and UCP3 have a role in preventing mitochondrial oxidative damage is supported by the increased expression of UCPs in response to elevated mitochondrial oxidative damage (6.Nedergaard J.

To distinguish between these possibilities, antioxidants that block different components of the putative oxidative damage cascade leading from superoxide to peroxidation products such as HNE should be informative. Previously we found that the superoxide stimulation of UCPs was blocked by mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (12.Echtay K.S. Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Talbot D.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These compounds are selectively directed to and accumulate within mitochondria due to their conjugation to the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation (13.Smith R.A.J. Porteous C.M. Gane A.M.

Targeting derivatives of ubiquinol (MitoQ) or α-tocopherol (MitoVit E) to mitochondria showed that it was superoxide within the matrix that led to UCP activation (12.Echtay K.S. Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Talbot D.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, as both these compounds react with a range of ROS and lipid peroxidation intermediates (14.Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A.J.

Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), it was not possible to distinguish between superoxide itself or a downstream product of the ROS cascade as the UCP activator (12.Echtay K.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar).We have now synthesized a more selective mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoPBN, which is derived from α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN). The spin trap PBN was chosen because of its high reactivity with carbon-centered radicals (16.Rosen G.M. Britigan B.E. Halpern H.J. Pou S. Free Radicals: Biology and Detection by Spin Trapping. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 442-446Google Scholar, 17.Pou S. Ramos C.L. Gladwell T. Renks E. Centra M. Young D. Cohen M.S. Rosen G.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas its reactivity with superoxide and peroxyl radicals is low, and it does not prevent lipid peroxidation by a chain-breaking antioxidant mechanism (18.Barclay L.R. Vinqvist M.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MitoPBN should be accumulated within mitochondria and there react preferentially with carbon-centered radicals but not with superoxide. Here we show that MitoPBN prevents the activation of proton conductance through UCPs by superoxide but not by HNE. Furthermore, a carbon-centered radical generator stimulates UCPs, and this activation is also blocked by MitoPBN. These data suggest that superoxide and lipid peroxidation products are both components of a single oxidative damage pathway that activates UCPs. This pathway starts with superoxide as the initiator of a cascade of phospholipid peroxidation reactions. These reactions form lipid peroxidation breakdown products (such as HNE) that then activate the UCPs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthetic Chemistry—1H (300 MHz) and 31P (121 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 300 spectrometer in chlorform-d1 standardized against the solvent peak or external 85% (v/v) phosphoric acid, respectively. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan spectrophotometer in 95% (v/v) ethanol solutions. Elemental analyses were performed in the Campbell Microanalytical Laboratory, University of Otago.

The sodium hydride was washed 3 times with pentane and then dried in vacuo (0.1 mm Hg). Dimethylformamide (5 ml) was then added, and the suspension was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. A solution of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (633 mg, 5.43 mmol) in dimethylformamide (5 ml) was added dropwise to the reaction vessel causing bubbling and the appearance of a yellow/orange precipitate. After 2.5 h stirring at room temperature, the reaction mixture had become an orange suspension. A solution of (4-iodobutyl)triphenylphosphonium iodide (3.11 g, 5.43 mmol) (19.Lin T.K. Hughes G.

Distilled water (50 ml) was then added, and the mixture was partitioned with dichloromethane (3 times, 30 ml). The combined organic layers were dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residual oil was dissolved in minimal dichloromethane and precipitated with excess ether, and the solvent layer was decanted. The precipitate was then redissolved in minimal dichloromethane and precipitated with excess ether, and the solvent layer was decanted. This precipitation process was repeated 9 times. The residue was dried under reduced pressure for 3 h yielding the monohydrate of 1 as a pale yellow solid (2.65 g, 4.53 mmol, 84%). UV spectroscopy gave a λmax of 275 nm (ϵ 19,725 m–1·cm–1.

This mixture was stirred under argon for 10 min. A mixture of glacial acetic acid (5.05 g, 84.2 mmol) in dry absolute alcohol (15 ml) was then added dropwise over 100 min. The mixture was then stirred for 2 h in an ice bath, after which time it was stored at 4 °C for 9 days, with daily agitation. The white precipitate was filtered off, and the green solution was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 ml) and washed twice with aqueous potassium bromide (15 ml, 20%, pH 7.0).

After 5 min of preincubation, oxidative stress was induced by addition of 100 μm FeSO4 and 300 μm ascorbic acid, and 40 min later the incubation was divided into two 800-μl aliquots and 400 μl of thiobarbituric acid (TBA; 0.05% w/v in 10 ml of H2O, 10 ml of perchloric acid) was added to each aliquot. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 15 min, cooled on ice, and then transferred to a glass tube, and 3 ml of water and then 3 ml of butanol were added. After vortexing, the organic layer was isolated by centrifugation, and 200-μl aliquots were analyzed in a fluorometric plate reader (λEx 515 nm, λEm 553 nm) and compared with a standard curve of 0–30 nmol of 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane.To assess reactivity of different molecules with the hydroxyl radical, we used ferrous iron to generate the hydroxyl radical and then measured the hydroxylation of benzoic acid (29.Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This was done in 30 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl containing 690 μm sodium benzoate, 30 μm EDTA, and 200 μm FeCl2. Compounds were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, then cooled on ice, and diluted in 3 ml of buffer, and the fluorescence was measured in a stirred 3-ml system (λEx 305 nm, λEm 407 nm).To study the interaction of different compounds with superoxide, xanthine oxidase (XO; 0.01 units/ml) in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm DTPA supplemented with 500 μm hypoxanthine was used to generate superoxide. Superoxide production was measured as the rate of reduction of 50 μm acetylated cytochrome c (Sigma) at 550 nm in a 1-ml cuvette at 30 °C.To measure the oxidation of ferrous iron, 110 μm FeCl2 was incubated in Chelex-treated 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, under argon. At various times 100-μl samples were removed, added to 900 μl of 1 mm FerroZine (30.Welch K.D. Davis T.Z. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in the same buffer, and the FerroZine-Fe(II) complex was assayed spectrophotometrically (ϵ564 = 27.9 × 103m–1·cm–1) (30.Welch K.D. Davis T.Z. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Fe(II) oxidation over 30 min and the absorbance of the tested compounds at 564 nm were both negligible. To confirm that oxidation of Fe(II) produced Fe(III) we used desferrioxamine, which chelates Fe(III) (desferrioxamine-Fe(III), ϵ428 = 2.8 × 103m–1·cm–1). This was done under argon as desferrioxamine in the presence of oxygen rapidly oxidizes Fe(II) to Fe(III). For this 1 mm desferrioxamine was stirred in an air-tight 3-ml cuvette under argon with 100 μm FeCl2 and after an injection of TEMPO there was rapid (<1 s) oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III).Aconitase activity was measured by a coupled enzyme assay linking isocitrate production by aconitase to NADP reduction by isocitrate dehydrogenase (ϵ340 NADPH = 6.22 × 103m–1·cm–1) (31.Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1870-1879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The background rate of NADPH formation was determined in the presence of fluorocitrate (100 μm), a competitive inhibitor of aconitase, and was always less than 10% of the initial rate. Aliquots of frozen yeast mitochondria were thawed rapidly, washed in mannitol buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.8, 5 mm KPi, 0.5 mm EDTA), and resuspended in this buffer at 0.2–0.3 mg of protein/ml. MitoPBN or TPMP (from stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide) and substrate were added, and the mitochondria were incubated in a shaking water bath at 30 °C. Samples were removed at various time points, snap-frozen on dry ice, and thawed prior to assaying. The aconitase assay was adapted for a 96-well plate format with a 10-μl sample added to 190 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 5 mm sodium citrate, 0.2 mm NADP+, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100, and 0.4 units/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase) at 30 °C and assayed with A340 readings at 15-s intervals over 7 min. The resulting slopes of multiple samples (typically 6) were averaged.The oxidation of cis-parinaric acid (cPA) was monitored fluorometrically (λEx = 324 nm; λEm = 413 nm) in a 3-ml fluorometer cuvette at 37 °C with constant stirring (33.Tribble D.L. van den Berg J.J.M.

Beef heart mitochondrial membranes, prepared as described (34.Walker J.E. Skehel J.M. Buchanan S.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 14-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), were incubated in 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 8.0, and after 40 s, cis-parinaric acid (0.5 μm) was added, and its oxidation was monitored. The absorption spectrum of MitoPBN overlaps with the excitation spectrum of cPA; therefore, for comparisons all experiments were adjusted to the same maximum 100% fluorescence immediately following addition of cPA.Proton Leak Measurements—Mitochondria (0.35 mg of protein/ml) from kidney or skeletal muscle were incubated in 120 mm KCl, 5 mm KPi, 3 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, at 37 °C, with 5 μm rotenone, 80 ng of nigericin/ml, and 1 μg of oligomycin/ml. BAT mitochondria were incubated in 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm KPi, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1% w/v defatted BSA at 37 °C with 5 μm rotenone, 80 ng of nigericin/ml, and 1 μg of oligomycin/ml. Respiration rate and membrane potential were measured simultaneously using electrodes sensitive to oxygen and TPMP (4.Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A.

TWINKLE displays primary sequence similarity to the phage T7 gene 4 primase-helicase, but no specific enzyme activity has been assigned to the protein. We have purified recombinant TWINKLE to near homogeneity and demonstrate here that TWINKLE is a DNA helicase with 5′ to 3′ directionality and distinct substrate requirements. The protein needs a stretch of 10 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA on the 5′-side of the duplex to unwind duplex DNA. In addition, helicase activity is not observed unless a short single-stranded 3′-tail is present. The helicase activity has an absolute requirement for hydrolysis of a nucleoside 5′-triphosphate, with UTP being the optimal substrate. DNA unwinding by TWINKLE is specifically stimulated by the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Our enzymatic characterization strongly supports the notion that TWINKLE is the helicase at the mitochondrial DNA replication fork and provides evidence for a close relationship of the DNA replication machinery in bacteriophages and mammalian mitochondria.

Our enzymatic characterization strongly supports the notion that TWINKLE is the helicase at the mitochondrial DNA replication fork and provides evidence for a close relationship of the DNA replication machinery in bacteriophages and mammalian mitochondria. The molecular mechanisms by which mtDNA is replicated in mammalian cells are of fundamental biological interest. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a model system for studies of mammalian mtDNA replication, but there are significant differences between yeast and mammalian cells (1.Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Replication of the S. cerevisiae mtDNA is initiated from multiple sites of the ∼86-kb genome, and the mtDNA molecules frequently undergo recombination. In contrast, the smaller mammalian mtDNAs (∼16 kb) initiate DNA replication from two specific origins of replication, oriH and oriL, and recombination is a rare or possibly even non-existent phenomenon (2.Eyre-Walker A. Awadalla P. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Mammalian mtDNA contains two major promoters, the light and heavy strand promoters, which produce near genomic length transcripts that, after RNA processing, release individual mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs. A separate transcription unit for the rRNA genes in mammalian mitochondria has also been reported (3.Montoya J. Christianson T. Levens D. Rabinowitz M. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7195-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Transcription from light strand promoters is not only necessary for gene expression but also produces the RNA primers required for initiation of mtDNA replication at oriH (1.Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 4.Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis from oriH is unidirectional and proceeds to displace the parental heavy strand. The nascent H strands frequently terminate 700 bp downstream of oriH, giving rise to 7 S DNA (D-loop strand). This termination event produces a characteristic triple-stranded structure, called the D-loop (5.Kasamatsu H. Robberson D.L. Vinograd J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2252-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The function of the D-loops is unknown, but they presumably play a role in regulating mtDNA replication.The mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ is a heterodimer comprising catalytic (A) and accessory (B) subunits of 140 and 54 kDa, respectively. The accessory subunit, polymerase γ B, which is not present in yeast, has been characterized as a processivity factor for the polymerase (6.Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38197-38203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Polymerase γ B increases the affinity of the polymerase for DNA and promotes tighter nucleotide binding, increasing the polymerization rate (7.Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38197-38203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8.Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The processivity of DNA polymerase γ is specifically stimulated by the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein, mtSSB 1The abbreviations used are: mtSSBmitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding proteinntnucleotidesadPEOautosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegiaMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: mtSSBmitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding proteinntnucleotidesadPEOautosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegiaMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).

Chem. 1999; 274: 14779-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The TWINKLE gene was originally identified in a search for mutations associated with chromosome 10q24-linked autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) (11.Spelbrink J.N. Li F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P. Tariq M. Wanrooij S. Garrido N. Comi G. Morandi L. Santoro L. Toscano A. Fabrizi G.M. Somer H. Croxen R. Beeson D. Poulton J. Suomalainen A. Jacobs H.T. Zeviani M. Larsson C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), which is a human disorder with exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, deafness, ataxia, cataracts, and hypogonadism. Homology searches revealed a striking sequence similarity between TWINKLE and the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein, which contains both the DNA helicase and the primase activities needed at the bacteriophage replication fork. Primary sequence analysis revealed that TWINKLE contains sequence motives typically found in DNA helicases, whereas no obvious similarities could be identified with known primases.Interestingly, adPEO is characterized by the presence of multiple mtDNA deletions, and the disorder has also been linked to mutations in DNA polymerase γ (12.Suomalainen A. Kaukonen J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13.Ponamarev M.V. Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15225-15228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate a functional relationship between TWINKLE and the DNA polymerase and suggest that TWINKLE may be a DNA helicase active in mammalian mitochondrial DNA replication. A molecular characterization of TWINKLE would therefore not only be of interest for a molecular understanding of adPEO but would also reveal important insights into the molecular mechanisms of mtDNA replication.We have purified TWINKLE in recombinant form and studied its enzymatic functions. We demonstrate here that TWINKLE is a 5′ → 3′ DNA helicase, which is specifically stimulated by mtSSB. Our findings strongly support the notion that TWINKLE is involved in mammalian mtDNA replication and further demonstrate the remarkable structural and functional similarities between the DNA replication machinery in bacteriophages and mammalian mitochondria.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant Proteins—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained and propagated in suspension in SFM 900 medium (Invitrogen), containing 5% fetal calf serum, at 27 °C. DNA fragments encoding TWINKLE and mtSSB were PCR-amplified from human cDNAs and cloned into the pBacPAK9 vector (Clontech). The TWINKLE expression construct encoded the mitochondrial form of the protein lacking the import signal (1–42 amino acids). A His6 tag was introduced at the N terminus. The construct for mtSSB also encoded the mitochondrial form of the protein without the import signal (1–16 amino acids) but had no affinity tag. Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis viruses recombinant for the individual expression constructs were prepared as described in the BacPAK™ manual (Clontech). Protein expression was performed by growing 400 ml of Sf9 cells to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in suspension. The cells were infected with 10 plaque-forming units/cell of recombinant baculovirus and harvested 72 h after infection. Infected cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 4 °C in 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× protease inhibitors (for all purifications, a 100× stock of protease inhibitors contained 100 mm phenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mm pepstatin A, 60 mm leupeptin, and 200 mm benzamidine in 100% ethanol). The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min, transferred to a Dounce homogenizer, and disrupted using 20 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle. Next, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1.0 m, and the homogenate was swirled gently for 45 min at 4 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C using a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor.Protein Purification—TWINKLE was purified by diluting the protein extracts with an equal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.6 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× protease inhibitors) containing 20 mm imidazole. The extract was then added to 1 ml of Ni2+-agarose Superflow beads (Qiagen) and incubated for 1 h at +4 °C. Ni2+-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation (JA-17, 2,500 rpm, 10 min, +4 °C), washed once with 15 ml of buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole, again collected by centrifugation, and finally loaded into a column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole and eluted with 15 column volumes of buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The recombinant protein was identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and the peak fractions were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer B (10 mm K·PO4, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1× protease inhibitors). TWINKLE was further purified on a 2-ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer B, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (20 ml) of buffer B to buffer B containing 400 mm K·PO4. The TWINKLE protein eluted at a concentration of ∼300 mm K·PO4. The peak fractions were diluted with 2 volumes of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl. The TWINKLE protein eluted in the flow-through. The flow-through was collected and loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with buffer C with 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer C with 0.3 m NaCl. The peak fractions were collected and eluted with a linear gradient (6 ml) of buffer C with 0.3–1 m NaCl. The TWINKLE protein eluted ∼700 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were collected and dialyzed against buffer C with 0.2 m NaCl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and finally stored at –80 °C. The yield of TWINKLE protein was ∼2 mg from a 400-ml culture. The purity of the protein was at least 95% as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1A).The mitochondrial SSB was purified by dialyzing the clarified Sf9 lysate against buffer C with 0.1 m NaCl. The lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml CM Superose column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with buffer C with 0.1 m NaCl. MtSSB eluted in the flow-through was collected and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with buffer C (0.1 m NaCl). MtSSB was eluted with a linear gradient (50 ml) of buffer C (0.1–1 m NaCl), and the peak fractions of mtSSB were found at ∼300 mm NaCl. The mtSSB fractions were collected and loaded on a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column, which had been equilibrated with buffer B (10 mm K·PO4). The column was washed by 3 volumes of equilibration buffer, and mtSSB was eluted with a linear gradient (10 ml) of buffer B (10–400 mm K·PO4). MtSSB, eluted at ∼100 mm K·PO4, and the peak fractions were collected and dialyzed against buffer C (0.2 m NaCl), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The yield of mtSSB was ∼20 mg from a 400-ml starting culture, and the purity was at least 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (see Fig. 5A).Fig. 5The TWINKLE helicase is specifically stimulated by mtSSB. In A, mtSSB (2 μg) purified over hydroxyapatite was separated by SDS-PAGE (14–20%) and revealed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The faint smear below the protein is an artifact in the SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein migrated as one single peak in mass determination with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In B, DNA helicase assays were performed as described under “Material and Methods” using the MG1/M13mp18 helicase substrate. The reactions contained 60 nm TWINKLE protein when indicated and increasing amounts of mtSSB and E. coli SSB (EcSSB). The reactions were incubated for 30 min. The unwinding reaction was unaffected by EcSSB but stimulated 2.6- (lane 8) and 2.3-fold (lane 9) with mtSSB.

The annealed DNA was purified from unannealed oligonucleotide by Centricon 100 (Amicon) using a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The helicase substrate used to decide the tail length necessary for unwinding was made by annealing a 60-nt-long oligonucleotide (MG2, 5′-GCCCTGATCACGGTACTCGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCTCCTCTAGACTCGACCG-3′) to three different oligonucleotides labeled with 32P at their 5′-termini. This procedure gave rise to three different substrates containing a common 40-nt 5′-tail and no 3′-tail (MG3, 5′-CGGTCGAGTCTAGAGGAGCC-3′), a 10-nt 3′-tail (MG4, 5′-CGGTCGAGTCTAGAGGAGCCTTTTTTTTTT-3′), or a 15-nt 3′-tail (MG5, 5′-CGGTCGAGTCTAGAGGAGCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) (see Fig. 3B). The helicase substrates used in the directionality assays were made by annealing the radiolabeled MG2 oligonucleotide to either of two different 60-nt-long oligonucleotides (MG6, 5′-CGGTCGAGTCTAGAGGAGCCCTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGACTGGAAAGCGGGCAGTCAG-3′, or MG7, 5′-CTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGACTGGAAAGCGGGCAGTCAGCCGAGTACCGTGATCAGGGC-3′). The MG1/MG6 and the MG1/MG7 annealing reactions also included an additional 40-nt oligonucleotide (MG8, 5′-CTGACTGCCCGCTTTCCAGTCGGGAAACCTGTCGTGCCAG-3′) to generate the two different fork substrates used in the directionality assays (see Fig.4, A and B). DNA helicase substrates were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 1.

TWINKLE was added as indicated in the figure legends. Incubation was for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of a suspension of Norit A (12% in 0.1 m HCl, 10 mm K·PO4). The mixture was briefly vortexed and then centrifuged for 3 min at 7,000 × g. Two hundred μl of the supernatant was mixed in 3 ml of scintillation mixture (Ready Safe; Beckman-Coulter), and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The enzyme-dependent release of phosphate was calculated by subtracting the release of phosphate in samples without enzyme.Helicase Assay—The reaction mixture (15 μl) contained 15 fmol of DNA substrate (DNA concentrations in this report are expressed in moles of molecules), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 mm NaCl, and the indicated amounts of TWINKLE, mtSSB, and Escherichia coli SSB. The reactions were incubated at 32 °C for the times indicated and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of stop solution (90 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol, 0.25% xylene cyanol). We did not observe any significant levels of spontaneous reannealing of unwound DNA at the assay conditions used. The products were separated by electrophoresis through a 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was dried onto DE81 (Whatman) and autoradiographed overnight at –80 °C with an intensifying screen. Intensities of the bands were quantified by densitometry using the program NIH Image (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/).RESULTSThe finding that TWINKLE mutations are associated with mtDNA deletions suggested that the protein might be involved in mtDNA replication, and we therefore characterized the enzymatic activities of the TWINKLE in vitro. We generated a recombinant baculovirus encoding the human TWINKLE gene to obtain sufficient quantities of the protein for studies of its associated biochemical activities. TWINKLE was expressed in insect cells and purified over Ni2+-agarose, hydroxyapatite, SP-Sepharose, and heparin-Sepharose to near homogeneity (Fig. 1A). Recombinant TWINKLE migrated as a doublet with an apparent molecular mass of about 70 kDa during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of 72 kDa. The weaker, lower band is a shorter form of the protein, lacking 15 amino acids at the very C terminus as demonstrated by mass analysis with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). The truncation is probably due to translational pausing since the relative levels of the two forms are unaffected by protease inhibitors. A strong contaminating exonuclease activity co-purified with TWINKLE over the first two columns, but it was lost at the SP-Sepharose step. Heparin column-purified TWINKLE co-migrated with a strong ATPase activity (Fig. 1B), supporting primary sequence analysis predictions that TWINKLE is a Walker-type ATPase.TWINKLE Is a DNA Helicase—To investigate whether TWINKLE is an active DNA helicase in vitro, we annealed a 32P-labeled 60-nt oligonucleotide to the complementary region of M13mp18 single-stranded DNA to form a helicase substrate with a 20-bp double-stranded region and a 40-nt 5′-single-stranded tail. Examination of the purified protein showed that it indeed possessed a strong DNA unwinding activity, which coincided perfectly with the peak of TWINKLE protein eluting from heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 1C). The helicase activity was not found when mock-infected insect cell extracts were purified in a similar way (data not shown). We next analyzed DNA unwinding as a function of TWINKLE protein concentration and found that addition of increasing concentrations of protein to our helicase substrate revealed a linear increase of displaced oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, A and B). Extensive DNA unwinding (>25%) was observed at protein concentrations above 30 nm of the protein, demonstrating that TWINKLE is a potent helicase in vitro. A time course experiment (Fig. 2C) demonstrated that TWINKLE initiates unwinding of the substrate without any apparent lag phase. The unwinding reaction is dependent on NTP hydrolysis and was inhibited at low concentrations of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS (Fig. 3A), TWINKLE was next incubated with a variety of different nucleoside 5′-triphosphates to analyze their ability to act as co-effectors for the helicase activity (Fig. 3B). UTP efficiently supported DNA unwinding, and to a lesser extent, so did ATP, GTP, and dTTP. CTP was a very poor co-effector.Fig. 2Helicase activity of TWINKLE. Assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” in the presence of the indicated amounts of TWINKLE. A, increasing amounts of TWINKLE incubated for 30 min. In B, helicase reactions were performed as in panel A and then analyzed with phosphorimaging, and the fractional amounts of base-paired substrate and single-stranded DNA product were determined. Each data point is the average of at least three experiments. Error bars represent the S.D. C, time course of DNA unwinding reactions. A reaction mixture (150 μl) was prepared in the presence of 30 nm TWINKLE. At the times indicated, 15-μl aliquots were removed and analyzed by 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was scanned and quantified as in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TWINKLE Has 5′ → 3′ Helicase Directionality—We next investigated the efficiency by which TWINKLE could unwind different DNA substrates. To this end, we made a series of constructs with a 60-nt-long oligonucleotide annealed to complementary oligonucleotides to form helicase substrates with a 20-bp double-stranded region, a 40-nt single-stranded 5′-tail, and 3′-tails of varying lengths (0, 10, 15 nt). No unwinding was observed with substrate lacking a 3′-tail, low levels of unwinding were observed with the 10-nt 3′-tail, whereas the 15-nt 3′-tail template was efficiently unwound (Fig. 3C). Similar experiments were also performed with a 40-nt 3′-tail substrate and varying lengths of the 5′-tail (0, 10, 15 nt). We found that unwinding was dependent on a free 5′-tail as well. No unwinding was observed on the template lacking a 5′-tail. TWINKLE displayed a moderate activity on the 10-nt 5′-tail substrate and efficiently unwound the 15-nt 5′-tailed template (data not shown).TWINKLE needs a fork-like structure with both a 5′- and a 3′-single-stranded stretch of DNA to efficiently initiate DNA unwinding, similar to what had been shown previously for the T7 gp4 helicase (15.Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could not use common DNA substrates for a directionality assay, due to this specific substrate requirement. Specific DNA substrates have been developed to circumvent this problem for the T7 gp4 protein. We used a directionality assay with substrates containing a 20-bp double-stranded region with one single-stranded and one double-stranded tail (Fig. 4, A and B) (16.Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TWINKLE requires a single-stranded stretch of DNA to initiate unwinding, and we could therefore determine the directionality of the enzyme by introducing a single-stranded 5′- or 3′-tail. We found that TWINKLE could only unwind the substrate with a 5′-single-stranded tail, thus demonstrating that TWINKLE unwinds DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, as does the T7 gp4 helicase.The TWINKLE Helicase Is Stimulated by mtSSB—We determined whether human mtSSB had any stimulatory effect on the TWINKLE helicase activity by using the same substrate as in Fig. 1C. We expressed recombinant mtSSB in insect cells and purified the protein to near homogeneity (Fig. 5A). We found that mtSSB had a strong stimulatory effect on the unwinding activity of the TWINKLE protein (Fig. 5B). The stimulation by mtSSB was specific because no such effect was observed with the E. coli SSB.DISCUSSIONThe mechanisms of mammalian mtDNA replication have not yet been fully defined (1.Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). We have initiated a project aimed at reconstituting mtDNA replication in vitro, which we hope will generate new insights into this fundamental cellular process. According to the generally accepted model, mammalian mtDNA replication is continuous on both strands and takes place in a strand-asymmetric mode. DNA synthesis is initiated from two different sites, one for each strand (17.Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Activation of oriL and the heavy strand origin oriH are physically and temporally distinct. DNA synthesis first commences at oriH, which is localized in the non-coding region of mtDNA. After leading strand synthesis has reached two-thirds of the genome, it comes to oriL, which is activated, and the DNA synthesis then initiates in the opposite direction. Recently, however, this strand-asymmetric model for mtDNA replication has been challenged by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrating the presence of conventional duplex mtDNA replication intermediates, indicative of coupled leading and lagging-strand DNA synthesis (18.Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19.Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T.

https://openalex.org/W2113679700,"Sec1-related proteins function in most, if not all, membrane trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells. The Sec1-related protein required in neurons for synaptic vesicle exocytosis is UNC-18. Several models for UNC-18 function during vesicle exocytosis are under consideration. We have tested these models by characterizing unc-18 mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the absence of UNC-18, the size of the readily releasable pool is severely reduced. Our results show that the near absence of fusion-competent vesicles is not caused by a reduction in syntaxin levels, by a mislocalization of syntaxin, by a defect in fusion or by a failure to open syntaxin during priming. Rather, we found a reduction of docked vesicles at the active zone in unc-18 mutants, suggesting that UNC-18 functions, directly or indirectly, as a facilitator of vesicle docking."

We used systems analysis to investigate how the components and topology of this signaling network permit neurohormonal control of excitation-contraction coupling in the rat ventricular myocyte. A kinetic model integrating β-adrenergic signaling with excitation-contraction coupling was formulated, and each subsystem was validated with independent biochemical and physiological measurements. Model analysis was used to investigate quantitatively the effects of specific molecular perturbations. 3-Fold overexpression of adenylyl cyclase in the model allowed an 85% higher rate of cyclic AMP synthesis than an equivalent overexpression of β1-adrenergic receptor, and manipulating the affinity of Gsα for adenylyl cyclase was a more potent regulator of cyclic AMP production. The model predicted that less than 40% of adenylyl cyclase molecules may be stimulated under maximal receptor activation, and an experimental protocol is suggested for validating this prediction. The model also predicted that the endogenous heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor may enhance basal cyclic AMP buffering by 68% and increasing the apparent Hill coefficient of protein kinase A activation from 1.0 to 2.0. Finally, phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel and phospholamban were found sufficient to predict the dominant changes in myocyte contractility, including a 2.6× increase in systolic calcium (inotropy) and a 28% decrease in calcium half-relaxation time (lusitropy).

By performing systems analysis, the consequences of molecular perturbations in the β-adrenergic signaling network may be understood within the context of integrative cellular physiology. In the cardiac myocyte, the β-adrenergic signaling network responds to the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine, providing coordinated control of contractility, metabolism, and gene regulation (1Katz A.M.

These actions are initiated by β-adrenergic receptor coupling with Gs and subsequent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, which synthesizes the classical second messenger cyclic AMP.

To probe the functional interactions of signaling networks in the context of integrative cellular physiology, systems level modeling and analysis will be valuable. Because the work of Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 (13Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref Scopus (14532) Google Scholar), ionic models of cell electrophysiology have complemented experimental research and helped in the formulation of new biological hypotheses (14Noble D. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent large scale efforts such as the Alliance for Cellular Signaling have identified systems modeling as essential for a comprehensive understanding of signaling networks and the response to genetic and pharmacological perturbations (15Gilman A.G.

Whereas portions of the mammalian β-adrenergic signaling network have been modeled mathematically in neurons and HEK-293 cells (16Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Tse T.E. Schaack J. Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W.

Science. 1999; 283: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), no analysis has modeled and validated an entire pathway from ligand to effectors so that neurohormonal regulation of cell physiology can be predicted. Here we use a systems model to investigate how the topology and interacting components in the β-adrenergic signaling network contribute to the control of cardiac myocyte contractility. Validation against a wide range of independent experimental data including cyclic AMP, phosphorylation, and calcium and electrophysiological assays demonstrate excellent consistency on a number of functional levels. The kinetic model was used to perform systematic in silico perturbations to the β-adrenergic network, whose interpretations show potential in molecular therapeutic analysis, experimental design, and the identification of signaling control mechanisms. These systems analyses provide a framework for a more integrated understanding of the β-adrenergic signaling mechanisms that control cardiac myocyte contractility. A differential algebraic model of β1-adrenergic signaling in the cardiac myocyte was formulated using the singular perturbation method (18Khalil H.K. Nonlinear Systems. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1996: 351-358Google Scholar), which decomposed the network into characteristic time scales. Sub-networks with dynamics on very fast time scales (<0.1 s) were assumed to be at quasi-equilibrium (e.g. binding reactions) and represented by algebraic equations, whereas sub-networks with very slow dynamics (>10 min) were assumed to be time-invariant (e.g. receptor internalization and gene expression). Remaining differential equations utilized standard rate laws such as mass action and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Examples of differential and algebraic equations from the model are shown below, describing the rate of change of total GTP-bound Gsα (Eq. 1) and the amount of GTP-bound Gsα that is bound transiently to adenylyl cyclase (Eq. 2),d([GsαGTPtot])dt=kgact([RG]+[LRG])-khyd[GsαGTPtot](Eq. 1) [GsαGTPtot]-[GsαGTP]-[GsαGTP:AC]=0(Eq. 2) Parameters were obtained from the literature whenever possible and generally measured in vitro with purified components or measured in rat ventricular myocytes (56 parameters). The remaining parameters were constrained using independent experimental data from the literature (11 parameters). The signaling network consisted of 37 differential and 12 algebraic equations. All equations and parameters from the signaling network model are provided in the Supplemental Material. Recent experimental techniques have enabled quantification of signaling specificity and speed afforded by protein complexation and scaffolding (10Zhang J. Ma Y. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14997-15002Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 19Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To capture the essence of these results within a traditional framework, we have introduced a coefficient ϵ, which modifies the effective concentration of proteins for reactions between members of a protein complex or microdomain, where [X]effective = ϵ [X]. This coefficient can be measured experimentally as the ratio of time constants without and with complexation, or ϵ = τfree/τcmplx. For the current model, a constant value of ϵ = 10 was used, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments used in conjunction with flash photolysis of caged cyclic AMP (10Zhang J. Ma Y. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14997-15002Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This approach was used to model localization of type II PKA, protein phosphatase-1, and protein phosphatase-2A to the LCC and protein phosphatase-1 to PLB. The calcium handling and electrophysiology portion of the model was based on an extension of the Luo-Rudy model (20Luo C.H. Rudy Y. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1071-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), modified for the rabbit ventricular myocyte (LabHEART) (21Puglisi J.L. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C2049-C2060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here this model was adapted to simulate the rat ventricular myocyte using experimental calcium handling data (3Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Academic Publishers, Boston2001: 42-282Google Scholar) and previously described formulations for the L-type calcium channel (22Jafri M.S. Rice J.J. Winslow R.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1149-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), transient outward, and steady-state potassium currents (23Pandit S.V. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. Demir S.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3029-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The resulting model was stable and exhibited positive excitation-contraction coupling gain and a negative force-frequency relationship (not shown), as seen experimentally in rat ventricular myocytes (3Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Academic Publishers, Boston2001: 42-282Google Scholar). The complete signaling, calcium handling, and electrophysiology model was implemented with the Rosenbrock stiff solver in Berkeley Madonna (www.berkeleymadonna.com). Formulation and Validation of Functionally Integrated Models—We developed a kinetic model of β-adrenergic signaling, calcium handling, and electrophysiology in the cardiac myocyte (Fig. 1). Briefly, the model describes agonist stimulation of β1-adrenergic receptor, activation of Gs protein, cyclic AMP synthesis by AC, cyclic AMP degradation by phosphodiesterase, PKA subunit activation and dissociation, phosphorylation of important target proteins phospholamban (PLB) and the L-type calcium channel (LCC), and β-adrenergic receptor kinase and PKA-mediated β1-adrenergic receptor desensitization. Type I PKA, the dominant PKA in the rat ventricular myocyte, diffuses throughout the cytosol. A population of A kinase anchoring protein-bound type II PKA is localized near the L-type calcium channel, along with a fraction of protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase-2A (3Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Academic Publishers, Boston2001: 42-282Google Scholar). Control of the SR Ca2+-ATPase by PLB is achieved by regulating the Ca2+ affinity of the pump, whereas control of the LCC is achieved by regulating channel availability and a state transition that affects channel open probability. As shown in Fig. 1a, PLB and LCC act as key connections between β-adrenergic signaling and excitation-contraction coupling in the model. The specific reaction schemes modeled are shown in Fig. 1b, with single-headed filled arrowheads denoting kinetics, single-headed empty arrowheads denoting enzyme catalysis, and double-headed arrowheads denoting quasi-equilibrium reactions. For example, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of β1-adrenergic receptor to β1-AR_S301 is modeled kinetically (single-headed filled arrowheads) with facilitation by PKA (single-headed empty arrowheads). On the other hand, ligand (L) binding to β1-adrenergic receptor to form the complex L·β1-adrenergic receptor is modeled as a quasi-equilibrium reaction, which has double-headed filled arrowheads. Integrated with a model of rat ventricular myocyte calcium handling and electrophysiology, the functional role of these signaling networks can be investigated. The model was validated with a wide range of experimental data (plotted as circles) from the literature (Fig. 2). The model reproduces the temporal response to β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol with partial adaptation due to desensitization (Fig. 2a) (9Zaccolo M. Pozzan T. Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 24Vila Petroff M.G. Egan J.M. Wang X. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) over a wide range of agonist concentrations (Fig. 2b, dashed line). When phosphodiesterase is inhibited so that cyclic AMP accumulation is a more direct measure of AC activity (Fig. 2b), cyclic AMP accumulation in the model (solid line) agrees well with experimental data (filled circles) with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (25Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 40-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tests of PKA activation (Fig. 2, c and d) with (dotted line) and without (solid line) the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) demonstrate a cyclic AMP-stimulated activation/dissociation relationship consistent with experimental data (circles) measured at physiological PKA concentrations (26Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3580-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Numerical experiments also show consistent relationships between agonist concentration and phosphorylation targets, particularly PLB phosphorylation (Fig. 2e) (27Vittone L. Mundina-Weilenmann C. Said M. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9804-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and single channel measurements of the LCC such as channel availability and open probability (not shown). Finally, the entire functionally integrated model was validated against measured changes in whole cell patch-clamped calcium currents (Fig. 2f), calcium transients (Fig. 2g), and action potential (Fig. 2h) in response to 1 μm isoproterenol (dotted lines) (3Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Academic Publishers, Boston2001: 42-282Google Scholar, 28Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Circ.

Isoproterenol stimulation causes an increase in calcium transient magnitude (control, 0.66 μm, versus isoproterenol, 1.71 μm), a decrease in diastolic calcium concentration (control, 0.14 μm, versus isoproterenol, 0.10 μm), a decrease in half-relaxation time t½ of the calcium transient (control, 117 ms, versus isoproterenol, 85 ms), an increase in SR Ca2+ load (control, 96 μmol/liter cytosol, versus isoproterenol, 168 μmol/liter cytosol), and an increase in APD80 (control, 30 ms, versus isoproterenol, 42 ms). These results represent stringent tests of model consistency, providing confidence in the utility of the model for generating and testing biological hypotheses. Analysis of Potential and Novel Molecular Therapeutics—A number of potential gene therapies have been proposed to modify β-adrenergic signaling at the receptor or adenylyl cyclase level, and these efforts have seen some success in animal models of heart failure (4Feldman A.M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1876-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, these approaches are hindered by difficulties in predicting the systemic effects of an acute perturbation and systematically identifying potential alternatives. Cellular systems modeling may serve as a useful tool for analysis and design of molecular therapeutics. Here we compare model analyses of receptor overexpression, adenylyl cyclase overexpression, and a novel potential pharmacological alternative. This alternative therapy, motivated by model analysis, involves increasing the affinity for Gαs-GTP and adenylyl cyclase (1/KGsα), similar to the action of forskolin. The ability of 3-fold increases in AC expression (Fig. 3a, dashed line), β1-adrenergic receptor expression (dotted line), and αs-GTP/AC affinity (dashed-dotted line) to affect isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was assessed in the presence of 1 mm IBMX. In addition, equipotent (as determined as in Fig. 3a) treatments (Fig. 3b; 1.5× AC, dashed line; 1.8× β1-adrenergic receptor, dotted line; 1.9× 1/KGsα, dashed-dotted line) were tested for the undesired side effect of increased basal cyclic AMP content, which may lead to a hypertrophic response (4Feldman A.M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1876-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Equipotent treatments appeared to elevate basal cyclic AMP content similarly. The results from Fig. 3, a and b, are qualitatively consistent with experimental data from transgenic mice overexpressing AC5 or β-adrenergic receptor (30Tepe N.M. Liggett S.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Dorn II, G.W. Tepe N.M. Lorenz J.N. Koch W.J. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6400-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). When comparing equal magnitude treatments (3-fold overexpression or 3-fold increase in affinity), adenylyl cyclase overexpression appears to be the most effective at increasing isoproterenol response with minimal side effects. Although greater receptor overexpression is possible, this comes at the cost of intolerably high basal cyclic AMP content due to constitutively activated receptors and other undesired effects. Increasing the affinity of Gsα and adenylyl cyclase by pharmacological means seems to have an effect similar to receptor overexpression. Such a strategy may have some advantages: 1) small molecule agents may be preferred to gene therapy, 2) lead optimization can be used to fine-tune the properties of the drug, and 3) the drug may be specifically targeted to certain microdomains, using compartmentation to minimize undesired increase in basal cyclic AMP content (Fig. 3b). Although a thorough consideration of compartmentation and cross-talk with other pathways may be required for a more comprehensive understanding, this analysis demonstrates the potential for models in analyzing the design goals and tradeoffs presented by many alternative therapeutic targets. Model-driven Experimental Design—Systems models present opportunities to design new experiments and formulate novel hypotheses, as illustrated recently by Hoffmann et al. (32Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). By using our model, we demonstrate a simple experimental design to estimate the fractional activation of adenylyl cyclase, which may prove to be useful in understanding the mechanisms by which cyclic AMP signaling is controlled. Whereas adenylyl cyclase has been described as stoichiometrically limiting in cyclic AMP metabolism (33Post S.R. Hilal-Dandan R. Urasawa K. Brunton L.L. Insel P.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (motivating target selection for gene therapy), preliminary modeling indicated that under physiological conditions only a small fraction of adenylyl cyclase may be activated. This paradoxical result suggests that receptor overexpression and the novel pharmacological therapy proposed above may function by increasing the fraction of adenylyl cyclase molecules that bind Gsα. A physiologically low fractional adenylyl cyclase activation is consistent with the finding that very high receptor overexpression levels are able to maximally stimulate adenylyl cyclase (31Dorn II, G.W. Tepe N.M. Lorenz J.N. Koch W.J. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6400-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Lacking methods to measure fractional adenylyl cyclase activation experimentally, we have designed a protocol to estimate this quantity indirectly, and we show that simulated results are linearly proportional to the actual fractional activation of adenylyl cyclase, suggesting a useful experimental protocol. This strategy would take advantage of the ability of cholera toxin to prevent the hydrolysis of GTP from Gsα or the resistance to hydrolysis of synthetic derivatives GTPγS and Gpp(NH)p. In Fig. 4a, the cyclic AMP response to 1 μm isoproterenol with and without reduced GTP hydrolysis is successfully validated with experimental data from Chung et al. (34Chung M.K. Gulick T.S. Rotondo R.E. Schreiner G.F. Lange L.G. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Agonist-stimulated activation of Gsα, coupled with the prevention of GTP hydrolysis by cholera toxin, keeps a large amount of Gsα in the GTP-bound state, causing near-maximal fractional activation of available adenylyl cyclase molecules (here 90% before desensitization). These results suggest that one could estimate fractional AC activation with a simple protocol involving cholera toxin. Positive control cells are given a maximally effective (∼300 ng/ml) dose of cholera toxin and nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (∼1 mm) together with a high concentration of agonist (∼10 μm isoproterenol). The experiment is terminated at 3 min to minimize the effect of receptor desensitization, and cyclic AMP is measured to determine the AC activity at maximal fractional AC activation. In parallel, the protocol is performed with or without cholera toxin and various doses of agonist or other pharmacological agents to compare with the positive control. By normalizing the measured cyclic AMP for each run by the results from the positive control (agonist + cholera toxin), an index of AC activation is obtained that correlates closely with the true fractional AC activation. We performed a numerical experiment to test whether a good estimate of fractional AC activation would be obtained with the above protocol (Fig. 4b). Over a wide range of agonist concentrations (0.1 nm to 10 μm isoproterenol) with (dotted line) and without (solid line) cholera toxin, we found a linear relationship between fractional AC activation and the normalized cyclic AMP accumulation. Fig. 4b demonstrates that in physiological conditions, fractional activation of AC at 3 min may be limited to a range between 5 and 26%, with a maximum activation of less than 40%. This finding suggests a possible role for currently uncharacterized natural or synthetic regulatory molecules to increase AC stimulation. Control Mechanisms in Cyclic AMP and Calcium Signaling—Whereas β-adrenergic signaling in the cardiac myocyte is one of the best characterized of mammalian signaling networks, the systems model presents an opportunity for analyses that may be difficult to predict or measure experimentally. The model is especially useful for predicting the effects of molecular interventions on a systems level relevant to whole cell function. To examine the role of cyclic AMP buffering in cellular function, we examined the concentration dependence of cyclic AMP to isoproterenol in control (Fig. 5, solid line), PKA knockout (–PKA; dashed line), and PKI knockout (–PKI; dotted line) versions of the model. Whereas PKA is known to be a significant cyclic AMP buffer and the primary mediator of cyclic AMP effects in the cell, the physiological role of the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) is not well characterized. As expected, comparison of the control and PKA knockout reveals significant buffering (the difference between the solid and dashed lines) over the entire range of isoproterenol concentrations due to PKA. More interesting is the indirect role of PKI in cyclic AMP buffering at low agonist concentrations (Fig. 5, compare solid and dotted lines), achieved by shifting the equilibrium of PKA activation toward greater holoenzyme dissociation and cyclic AMP retention (see reaction diagram in Fig. 1b). Additionally, PKI significantly increases the apparent Hill coefficient of PKA activation (from n = 1.0–2.0; Fig. 2c), a phenomenon known as ultrasensitivity due to a stoichiometric (high affinity) inhibitor (35Ferrell Jr., J.E. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas buffering of cyclic AMP by PKA and regulation of buffering by PKI helps maintain the amount of bound cyclic AMP in the cell (Fig. 5), the free cyclic AMP concentration is more sensitive to the balance of AC and phosphodiesterase activities and relatively insensitive to the presence of cyclic AMP buffers (not shown). These results provide a new perspective on the functional role of cyclic AMP buffering, in that buffering may provide a mechanism for maintaining a basal bound cyclic AMP content that is relatively insensitive to changes in synthesis (AC) and degradation (phosphodiesterase) activities. On the cellular level, cyclic AMP buffering may help maintain the basal phosphorylation state of PKA targets and enable prompt response to sympathetic stimulation via the β-adrenergic receptor. Examining the broader roles of cyclic AMP signaling, we explore the control of calcium handling mediated by phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel and phospholamban. A steady-state (1 Hz) calcium transient in an isoproterenol-stimulated cell was computed (Fig. 6a; PLB + LCC, solid line), together with variations in which only LCC (dotted line) or PLB (dashed line) can be phosphorylated. This analysis allows the contribution of each target to be distinguished, which would be difficult to measure experimentally. Whereas LCC and PLB phosphorylation appear to have similar effects on the magnitude of the calcium transient (PLB, 1.07 μm, versus LCC, 1.17 μm; Fig. 6a), PLB appears to be largely responsible for changes in diastolic calcium (PLB, 0.09 μm, versus LCC, 0.15 μm), half-relaxation time t½ (PLB, 101 ms, versus LCC, 109 ms), and SR Ca2+ load (PLB, 168 μmol/liter cytosol, versus LCC, 114 μmol/liter cytosol). These values may be compared with basal and isoproterenol-stimulated data presented above. PLB knockout simulations were performed to validate with experimental data (Fig. 6b) (3Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Academic Publishers, Boston2001: 42-282Google Scholar). By comparing the magnitude of the calcium transient (systolic calcium concentration) in response to isoproterenol in wild-type controls and PLB knockout models, we assessed the significance of targets other than PLB to the intropic and lusitropic response of the cell to β-adrenergic receptor agonists. This analysis suggests two conclusions. First, it appears that PLB is a dominant but not the sole PKA target responsible for inotropic response. Second, because the model does not include the controversial role of ryanodine receptor phosphorylation or other targets, it is clear that the role of LCC phosphorylation may be sufficient (but not the only contributing source) for the difference between unstimulated and isoproterenol-stimulated PLB knockout models. Although most experimental efforts have focused on small portions of the β-adrenergic signaling network at a time, functionally integrated computational models provide an opportunity to analyze systems properties of whole cell responses. A wealth of past research in β-adrenergic signaling has allowed us to develop and validate a functionally integrated systems model of β-adrenergic signaling, calcium handling, and electrophysiology in the cardiac myocyte. With this systems model, we investigated how the topology and molecular interactions of the β-adrenergic signaling network contribute to the control of excitation-contraction coupling. To accomplish this goal, we performed systematic in silico perturbations to the β-adrenergic network, gaining insight into the responses of the network to acute genetic and pharmacologic changes. Systems analysis of such perturbations demonstrated potential in the analysis of molecular therapeutics, experimental design, and identification of signaling control mechanisms. We began by considering molecular therapeutics, in particular the analysis of potential gene therapies for heart failure. Model analysis not only provided the means to directly compare the effect of receptor overexpression versus adenylyl cyclase overexpression, but it also suggested a role for a pharmacological alternative, in which a hypothetical drug is designed to increase the affinity of Gsα and adenylyl cyclase. Whereas the systems model does not reveal how treatments might differ in their ability to affect or be affected by cross-talk with other non-included pathways (e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinase or protein kinase C signaling) and compartmentation, the current model is clearly useful for systematic comparison of targets and identifying design goals and constraints. We found adenylyl cyclase overexpression to be the most sensitive means of increasing agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity while minimizing changes to basal cyclic AMP content. At the same time, we found evidence for a potential role of pharmacologic agents that may have similar effects to overexpression while obviating the need for gene therapy. Model analysis often exposes systems properties not readily apparent from examination of a handful of individual experiments. Whereas hypotheses generated using models clearly require testing, the opportunity exists to design experimental protocols in silico with which to test these hypotheses. We were surprised to find that whereas adenylyl cyclase appears to be a stoichiometrically limiting step in cyclic AMP synthesis (compared with the large amount of G protein), less than 40% of adenylyl cyclase molecules may be stimulated acutely by G protein under maximally effective isoproterenol concentration. This finding appears to be indirectly supported by previous studies in cardiac myocytes (34Chung M.K. Gulick T.S. Rotondo R.E. Schreiner G.F. Lange L.G. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). By using the model, we designed a simple protocol using cholera toxin to estimate fractional adenylyl cyclase activation experimentally for any given stimulus, showing that cyclic AMP measured according to the protocol should be linearly proportional to the actual fractional adenylyl cyclase activation. This analysis emphasized the tight range of fractional activation of adenylyl cyclase achieved in physiological situations, bounded on the low end by constitutively activated receptors and bounded on the high end by the number of β-adrenergic receptors able to activate Gs. These results contribute to our basic understanding of amplification mechanisms in cyclic AMP signaling networks. Although cyclic AMP buffering has been known for many years (26Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3580-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 36Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. Lincoln T.M. Keely S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3854-3861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the functional role it may play has remained unclear. We found that while cyclic AMP buffering by PKA greatly influences the total cyclic AMP content (Fig. 5), basal free cyclic AMP concentration remains much more sensitive to the balance of cyclic AMP synthesis and degradation. The heat-stable PKI, whose functional role is not well characterized, was found in the present study to regulate cyclic AMP buffering and enable ultrasensitivity for PKA activation. From a systems perspective, it appears that PKI may provide additional control over basal cyclic AMP content in the cell at the cost of decreased maximal kinase activity. Thus, cyclic AMP buffering by PKA and its regulation by PKI may have an important role in the control of the basal phosphorylation state of PKA substrate proteins in the cell. Understanding the quantitative role of numerous phosphorylation targets toward cellular function is important for conceptualizing the fundamental control mechanisms in the cell. We compared the role of L-type calcium channel and phospholamban phosphorylation toward isoproterenol-stimulated changes in calcium handling. Although phosphorylation of both channel and phospholamban contributes significantly to the magnitude of the calcium transient (Fig. 6a), other parameters such as lusitropy, diastolic calcium levels, and SR calcium content appear to be dominated by phospholamban phosphorylation. This analysis was further reinforced by the simulation of phospholamban knockouts and their response to isoproterenol. Although other known phosphorylation targets such as troponin I and the ryanodine receptor complex were not included, the current model demonstrates that the major changes to contractility can be accounted for by calcium channel and phospholamban phosphorylation alone. These studies provide a foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of β-adrenergic control of cardiac myocyte contractility. Future models may include additional PKA targets such as the controversial role of ryanodine receptor phosphorylation (37Marks A.R. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), troponin I (38Konhilas J.P. Irving T.C. Wolska B.M. Jweied E.E. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. de Tombe P.P. J. Physiol.

Systems models may also be useful for understanding the physiological roles of signaling cross-talk and compartmentation. We have developed a functionally integrated model of β-adrenergic signaling and control of contractility in the cardiac myocyte, and we have demonstrated the utility of the model as a tool for analysis of molecular therapeutics, experimental design strategies, and control mechanisms fundamental to cellular function.

When polyamine biosynthesis is inhibited, there is up-regulation of import. The mammalian polyamine transport system is unknown. We have previously shown that the heparan sulfate (HS) side chains of recycling glypican-1 (Gpc-1) can sequester spermine, that intracellular polyamine depletion increases the number of NO-sensitive N-unsubstituted glucosamines in HS, and that NO-dependent cleavage of HS at these sites is required for spermine uptake. The NO is derived from S-nitroso groups in the Gpc-1 protein. Using RNA interference technology as well as biochemical and microscopic techniques applied to both normal and uptake-deficient cells, we demonstrate that inhibition of Gpc-1 expression abrogates spermine uptake and intracellular delivery. In unperturbed cells, spermine and recycling Gpc-1 carrying HS chains rich in N-unsubstituted glucosamines were co-localized. By exposing cells to ascorbate, we induced release of NO from the S-nitroso groups, resulting in HS degradation and unloading of the sequestered polyamines as well as nuclear targeting of the deglycanated Gpc-1 protein. Polyamine uptake-deficient cells appear to have a defect in the NO release mechanism. We have managed to restore spermine uptake partially in these cells by providing spermine NONOate and ascorbate. The former bound to the HS chains of recycling Gpc-1 and S-nitrosylated the core protein. Ascorbate released NO, which degraded HS and liberated the bound spermine.

Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are essential for growth, differentiation, and survival of prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells. The polyamine content of cells is tightly regulated by biosynthesis, degradation, and transport.

Kakinuma Y. Micheal A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During transport, the cationic polyamines bind electrostatically to acidic amino acids in the transporters. Attempts to isolate and identify mammalian polyamine transport genes and their encoded proteins have so far been unsuccessful. Mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines deficient in polyamine uptake can be generated by polyamine analogs such as methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG). This substance, which is taken up via the polyamine transport system, is toxic to cells (10Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, only uptake-deficient cells will survive in MGBG-containing medium. By transfecting uptake-deficient cells with genomic DNA from normal cells, Pegg and co-workers (11Byers T.L. Wechter R.

Eukaryotic cells from multicellular organisms produce a multitude of cell-surface proteins that interact with soluble ligands, other cells, or extracellular matrix components. Cell-surface proteins that belong to the proteoglycan (PG) family are substituted with long, linear, highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains. Unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast do not produce such polyanionic proteoglycans. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that glycosaminoglycan chains, especially heparan sulfate (HS), bind polyamines very strongly, e.g. the affinity of HS for spermine is 10-fold higher than that of DNA (12Belting M. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which is regarded as a major natural polyamine-binding polyanion (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev.

Life Sci. 2001; 58: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we showed that exogenous HS competitively inhibits polyamine uptake and that PG-deficient or sulfate-depleted cells have a diminished uptake (13Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å.

We have also shown that polyamine-depleted cells synthesize glypican HS chains with an increased spermine affinity (15Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

Glypicans constitute a subfamily of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). Potentially localizing to rafts and caveolae, they are selective regulators of ligand-receptor encounters and can thereby control both growth and development. The discoveries that mutations in genes involved in glypican assembly cause dysmorphic syndromes in man and aberrant patterning during Drosophila development have brought this family of molecules into focus (for review, see Ref. 16Fransson L.-Å. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the glypican-1 (Gpc-1) core protein can accumulate NO as nitrosothiols in a reaction that is dependent on reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ (17Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, the HS chains of Gpc-1 contain a small amount of glucosamine units with an unsubstituted amino group (GlcNH3+), the number of which increases markedly upon inhibition of polyamine synthesis (15Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been known for a long time that the GlcNH3+ units in HS chains are especially sensitive to deaminative cleavage by nitrite (18Shively J.E. Conrad H.E.

Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The results of our studies show that when purified S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 substituted with GlcNH3+-rich HS chains is exposed in vitro to a reducing agent such as ascorbate, NO is released. Subsequently, NO degrades the Gpc-1 HS chains at the GlcNH3+ units in a reaction that results in conversion of GlcNH3+ to reducing terminal anhydromannose in the liberated HS oligosaccharide fragments (17Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This autocleavage can also be demonstrated in caveolin-1-positive endosomes of cultured cells (22Cheng F. Mani K. van den Born J. Ding K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results and the finding that NO depletion suppresses polyamine uptake (15Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we have hypothesized that recycling Gpc-1 is a vehicle for polyamine uptake in mammalian cells (see Scheme 1). The model proposes that the HS chains bind polyamines by cooperative salt bridges between-NH3+ or >NH2+ in the polyamines and the negative sulfate groups in HS (see Scheme 1, Position I). Polyamine depletion induces, by an unknown mechanism, an increased N-desulfation and/or N-deacetylation of the HS chains in recycling Gpc-1, generating an increased number of GlcNH3+ units, also within the polyamine-binding sites. Simultaneously, the Gpc-1 protein becomes S-nitrosylated in a copper-dependent reaction (see Scheme 1, Position II). When the recycling glypican-polyamine complex reaches late endosomes or caveosomes (see Scheme 1, Position III), NO is released; the polyamine-binding sites in HS are cleaved; the cooperative electrostatic interaction between HS and polyamines is diminished; and polyamines are liberated. In this study, using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed from the Gpc-1 gene, we have shown that Gpc-1 is required for polyamine uptake and that spermine and recycling Gpc-1 are co-localized. Furthermore, we have shown that HS degradation by NO-induced deaminative cleavage is defective in uptake-deficient cells. We have managed to restore polyamine uptake partially in these cells by providing NO in the appropriate context. The results point to a pivotal role for NO, derived from S-nitroso (SNO) groups in Gpc-1, in supporting polyamine uptake.

Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Fixation and permeabilization of cells, treatment with primary and secondary antibodies, and confocal microscopy were carried out as described (17Ding K.

The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse total Ig (when the primary antibody was monoclonal) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (when the primary antibody was polyclonal). They were tagged with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red and appropriately combined for co-localization studies. Detection of NOS—NOS activity was estimated in cell homogenates using the arginine-to-citrulline conversion procedure (24Xia H. Bredt D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 434-435Google Scholar). NOS protein was detected by anti-endothelial NOS mAb (1:250 dilution) and biotinconjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:500) as the secondary antibody followed by staining with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin and visualized by light microscopy as described (25Hsu S.M.

Spermine Uptake and Detection of Free Spermine—Cells were grown with or without 5 mm DFMO for 24 h. Uptake of [14C]spermine was measured as described (13Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Free spermine was detected by mAb Spm8-2 (26Delcros J.-G. Loeuillet L. Chamaillard L. Royou A. Bouille N. Seiler N. Moulinoux J.-P. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in confocal microscopic experiments. Involvement of Gpc-1 in Spermine Uptake by T24 Cells— Involvement of HSPG in polyamine uptake is indirectly supported by the previous findings that (a) HS binds the polyamine spermine very strongly; (b) HS competitively inhibits spermine uptake; and (c) HSPG-deficient cells have a low spermine uptake (12Belting M. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem.

A. 2002; 99: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Involvement of glypican-type HSPG is suggested by the observations that (d) polyamine deprivation increases the GlcNH3+ content in Gpc-1 HS chains (15Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); (e) HS chains in Gpc-1 are cleaved at these GlcNH3+ units by NO in conjunction with spermine uptake (22Cheng F. Mani K. van den Born J. Ding K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); and (f) NO depletion inhibits spermine uptake in DFMO-treated T24 cells (15Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore examined T24 cells for co-localization of Gpc-1 and spermine by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-Gpc-1 polyclonal antibody and mAb Spm8-2, which recognizes free spermine and spermidine (26Delcros J.-G. Loeuillet L. Chamaillard L. Royou A. Bouille N. Seiler N. Moulinoux J.-P. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Polyamines bound to DNA or RNA or to HS chains in recycling Gpc-1 should not be accessible to the antibody and thus should be undetectable. Structural modulation of HS generating a lower negative charge density and/or cleavage of HS is expected to diminish HS-polyamine interaction, resulting in release of polyamines. As long as the free polyamines remain in the same vesicles as Gpc-1, co-localization should be observed. The results show that, in unperturbed T24 cells, there was very little free polyamine, most of which was scattered in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, green). Gpc-1 (red) was in perinuclear compartments, partially co-localizing with polyamines. Addition of exogenous spermine to the cells did not significantly affect co-localization (Fig. 1B). A 1-h incubation of the cells with ascorbate, which induces release of NO from SNO groups and subsequent deaminative cleavage of HS in Gpc-1 (17Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), resulted in strong co-localization of Gpc-1 and polyamines to large, sometimes almost coalescent, vesicles near the nucleus (Fig. 1C, yellow). In some cells (Fig. 1C, left), no free polyamine could be seen (no green), whereas in others (right), free polyamines were seen peripheral to the co-localized material. We interpret these results to indicate that ascorbate had induced release of polyamines by NO-dependent degradation of HS chains in intracellular Gpc-1 and that, in some cells, the polyamines had not yet been transported out of the endosomal compartment. Treatment of cells with DFMO results in increased formation of GlcNH3+ units in HS of Gpc-1 (15Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In DFMO-treated T24 cells, there was an increase in free polyamines in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, green), but also an increased co-localization between Gpc-1 and polyamines in paranuclear vesicles (Fig. 1D, yellow). We interpret this result to indicate that the released free polyamines were derived from a pool of polyamines previously bound to HS of recycling intracellular Gpc-1. They had been released because the affinity of the polyamines for the GlcNH3+-enriched HS of Gpc-1 had been diminished. In keeping with these results, DFMO treatment is known to increase both the Vmax and Km for polyamine binding to the putative transporter, which means increased capacity for polyamine uptake, but reduced overall affinity (1Tabor C.W.

Addition of spermine to DFMO-treated cells resulted in a decrease in the amount of free polyamine (Fig. 1E; compare with green in Fig. 1D) as well as in the extent of co-localization with Gpc-1 (Fig. 1E; compare with yellow in Fig. 1D). Polyamines taken up from the environment under these conditions may be more firmly bound to HS of recycling Gpc-1 because they should be preferentially located in the highly sulfated, high affinity regions (15Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A 10-min incubation of DFMO- and spermine-treated cells with ascorbate resulted in strong co-localization of Gpc-1 and polyamines to large, again almost coalescent, vesicles near the nuclei of nearly all cells (Fig. 1F, yellow). Free polyamine (green) was mostly located close to the nuclear envelope and sometimes also inside the nucleus. Even Gpc-1 appeared in the nucleus (Fig. 1F, red). After a 1-h incubation of these cells with ascorbate, most of the co-localization was gone, and free polyamines were no longer detectable (data not shown). To evaluate the specific role of Gpc-1 in spermine uptake and delivery in T24 cells, expression of Gpc-1 was silenced with siRNA. Maximal suppression of Gpc-1 was seen 48 h after transfection (Fig. 2, compare A and E). Treatment with DFMO to inhibit endogenous polyamine synthesis and to increase spermine uptake followed by a 10-min exposure to ascorbate resulted in a great increase in free polyamines in control cells (Fig. 2, compare B and C), but not in siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2, compare F and G). The polyamines released in control cells co-localized with Gpc-1 in perinuclear compartments, but also inside the nucleus (Fig. 2D, yellow). The free spermine detected in siRNA-transfected cells did not co-localize with the remaining Gpc-1 (Fig. 2H, green and red, respectively; compare with Fig. 2G). Localization of Polyamines in Normal and Polyamine Uptake-deficient CHO Cells—We compared the co-localization of glypicans and polyamines in wild-type CHO-K1 cells and in polyamine uptake-deficient CHO-MGBG cells in an attempt to identify the defect(s) in uptake-deficient cells. This could contribute to an understanding of the mechanism(s) for polyamine uptake in normal cells. Antisera to human and mouse Gpc-1 were used, and both appeared to cross-react with hamster Gpc-1; anti-human Gpc-1 antiserum gave the strongest reaction and is shown here (Fig. 3A). In unperturbed CHO-K1 cells, free polyamines were undetectable (Fig. 3A, no green). Glypican (red) was mostly located perinuclearly, and limited co-localization with polyamines was seen near the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3A, yellow). After a 1-h incubation with ascorbate to release NO and to initiate HS degradation, Gpc-1 and polyamines extensively co-localized perinuclearly (Fig. 3C, yellow). Free polyamines (green) appeared both outside and inside the nucleus. Glypican not co-localizing with polyamines was particularly prominent in the nucleus of ascorbate-treated cells (Fig. 3C, red). Mutant CHO-MGBG cells can synthesize polyamines, but are unable to take up polyamines from the environment (10Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar, 11Byers T.L. Wechter R. Nuttall M.E. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CHO-MGBG cells are smaller than wild-type CHO-K1 cells and contain an irregularly shaped nucleus (Fig. 3, compare A and B). However, most of the CHO-MGBG cells appeared to contain both intranuclearly and perinuclearly located glypican (Fig. 3B, red). Polyamines partially co-localized at both sites (Fig. 3B, yellow). Free polyamines were scarce (Fig. 3B, no green). After a 1-h incubation with ascorbate, Gpc-1 and polyamines extensively co-localized perinuclearly (Fig. 3D, yellow), and free polyamines (green) were released into the cytoplasm. Glypican was also taken up into the nucleus (Fig. 3D, red). Hence, regarding the reaction to ascorbate, mutant cells did not differ significantly from wild-type cells. We have previously shown tha"
https://openalex.org/W2049094183,"In previous papers, we observed that dendrimers of peptide mimotopes of the nicotinic receptor ligand site are strong antidotes against the lethality of the nicotinic receptor ligand α-bungarotoxin. Although their in vitro activity is identical to that of dendrimers, the corresponding monomeric peptide mimotopes are not effective in vivo. Because the higher in vivo efficiency of dendrimers could not in this case be related to polyvalent interaction, the stability to blood protease activity of monomeric versus tetrabranched dendrimeric mimotope peptides was compared here by incubating three different mimotopes with human plasma and serum. Unmodified peptides and cleaved sequences were followed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Tetrabranched peptides were shown to be much more stable in plasma and also in serum. To assess the notable stability of multimeric peptides, different bioactive neuropeptides, including enkephalins, neurotensin and nociceptin, were synthesized in monomeric and tetrabranched forms and incubated with human plasma and serum and with rat brain membrane extracts. All the tetrabranched neuropeptides fully retained biological activity and generally showed much greater stability to blood and brain protease activity. Some tetrabranched peptides were also resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin. Our findings provide new insights into the possible therapeutic use of bioactive peptides."

Similarly, the pathogenic parkin mutant W453Stop, characterized by a C-terminal deletion of 13 amino acids, spontaneously adopted a misfolded conformation. Mutational analysis indicated that C-terminal truncations exceeding 3 amino acids abolished formation of detergent-soluble parkin. In the cytosol scattered aggregates of misfolded parkin contained the molecular chaperone Hsp70. Moreover, increased expression of chaperones prevented aggregation of wild-type parkin and promoted folding of the W453Stop mutant. Analyzing parkin folding in vitro indicated that parkin is aggregation-prone and that its folding is dependent on chaperones.

Parkin, a 465-amino acid protein, shows homology to ubiquitin at the N terminus and harbors a RING box near the C terminus, consisting of two RING finger motifs that flank a cysteine-rich domain (in-between RING fingers domain) (1Kitada, T., Asakawa, S., Hattori, N., Matsumine, H., Yamamura, Y., Minoshima, S., Yokochi, M., Mizuno, Y., and Shimizu, N.

Indeed, recent studies with cell culture models provide experimental evidence for such a scenario. It was shown that disease-related mutations in the parkin gene impair protein interactions of parkin with either a parkin substrate or another component of the ubiquitin ligase complex. Accumulation of Pael-R, one of the identified parkin substrates, causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, indicating that parkin has the potential to suppress unfolded protein stress-induced cell death (3Imai Y.

Furthermore, it has been shown that parkin is protective against the toxic effects of proteasomal dysfunction and mutant α-synuclein (10Petrucelli L. O'Farrell C. Lockhart P.J. Baptista M. Kehoe K.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), implying that the impact of parkin function and dysfunction might not be restricted to the entity of AR-JP.It still remains enigmatic why dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are highly vulnerable in AR-JP, as parkin as well as its substrates identified so far are not selectively expressed in these cells. However, an inherent feature of dopaminergic neurons is an elevated level of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species due to the metabolism of dopamine. In this study we show that oxidative and thermal stress causes misfolding and aggregation of wild-type parkin. In addition, a C-terminal deletion mutant associated with AR-JP, W453Stop, is constitutively misfolded, revealing that the C-terminal amino acids are essential for the native folding of parkin. Moreover, molecular chaperones interfere with the misfolding and aggregation of parkin in vivo and vitro, indicating a potential prophylactic or therapeutic strategy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—The gene encoding human parkin was amplified from a human brain cDNA library and inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The following primers were used: forward 5′-gtgcatatgatagtgtttgtcaggttcaactccagc-3′ and reverse 5′-tggctacacgtcgaaccagtggtccc-3′. Amino acid deletions and substitutions were introduced by PCR cloning techniques. The construct pEYFP-N1-Hsp70 encodes human Hsp70 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and was kindly provided by Richard I. Morimoto (11Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The construct pHsp40 was a gift of William J. Welch; it was generated by inserting the gene encoding human Hsp40 into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen).Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-parkin antiserum hP1 was raised against a recombinant N-terminal fragment of parkin (amino acids 1–210) that was expressed in and purified from bacteria. The mouse monoclonal antibody specific for inducible Hsp72 (C92) and the mouse monoclonal antibody N27, which identifies both the inducible (Hsp72) and the constitutive form (Hsp73) of Hsp70, have been described previously (12Welch W.J. Suhan J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2035-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfections—N2a cells and SH-SY5Y cells were cultivated as described (13Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by a liposome-mediated method using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Detergent Solubility Assay and Proteolysis Experiments—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped off the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in cold detergent buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then separated from the pellet. After adding Laemmli sample buffer to both fractions the samples were boiled for 10 min. To compare the relative distribution of parkin, equal percentages of the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. For proteolysis experiments, cells were lysed as described above and incubated with proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) at the concentrations indicated at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) and boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Residual parkin was detected by Western blotting.Stress Treatment and Proteasomal Inhibition—For the heat shock, cell culture dishes were placed into a water bath for the time and temperature indicated. For oxidative stress, cells were incubated in PBS containing 10 or 20 mm H2O2 for 30 min. ER stress was induced by exposing the cells to 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 30 min. For inhibition of the proteasome, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 16 h.Western Blot Analysis and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran BA 85, Schleicher & Schüll) by electroblotting. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody in PBST for 16 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min at room temperature. Following washing with PBST, the antigen was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as specified by the manufacturer. Quantification was performed using AIDA 3.26 image analysis software (Raytest). Indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described previously (14Winklhofer K.F. Reintjes A. Hoener M.C. Voellmy R. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45160-45167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells were grown on glass cover slides and fixed by immersion in cold methanol for 5 min. The fixed cells were incubated with the anti-parkin antiserum hP1 or the anti-Hsp72/73 antibody N27 (dilution 1:100) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, incubation with Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova) (dilution 1:200) followed at 37 °C for 30 min. The washed coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and examined by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope.Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and subsequently labeled for 30 min with 300 μCi/ml Pro-mix l-35S in vitro cell label mix (Amersham Biosciences, >37 TBq/mmol) in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium (pulse). For the chase, the labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice and then incubated in complete medium for the time indicated. Radiolabeled cells were lysed in detergent buffer and fractionated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions as described above. The supernatants were adjusted to 0.5% Sarkosyl. After pre-clearing with protein A beads (Pierce) for 30 min, the primary antibody hP1 was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complexes were captured by the addition of immobilized protein A and then washed 3 times with detergent buffer. Proteins present in the immunoprecipitates were released from the protein A-Sepharose by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% SDS and were heated at 100 °C for 5 min.Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Wild-type parkin and the W453Stop mutant were cloned into the pET-22b(+) vector (Novagen) by amplifying the open reading frame using the following primer pairs: forward 5′-ccg ccc tgg aag ctt cta cac gtc gaa cca gtg gtc cc-3′, reverse 5′-ccg ccc tgg aag ctt cac gtc gaa cca gtg gtc cc-3′ (wild-type), and forward 5′-ccg ccc tgg aag ctt cta cac gtc gaa cca gtg gtc cc-3′, reverse 5′-ccg ccc tgg aag ctt ctc gac gcc aca gtt cca gc-3′ (W453Stop), digesting the products with NdeI and HindIII, and ligating them into these sites in the vector. This produces the proteins without their terminal Stop codons and with C-terminal His6 epitope tags. The His-tagged proteins were expressed in the BL21 pLysS strain of Escherichia coli by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. The proteins were present in inclusion bodies and were purified under denaturing conditions in 6 m guanidinium chloride by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). The proteins were eluted from the beads at pH 4.0, again in 6 m guanidinium chloride. The concentrations of the eluted proteins were calculated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and dividing these values by the molar extinction coefficients. The eluted proteins were then diluted to 8 μm in elution buffer.Preparation of Mammalian Chaperones—Mammalian Hsp40 and Hsp70 were prepared as described previously. Briefly, human HDJ-1 (Hsp40) was purified as a recombinant protein from E. coli (15Minami Y. Hoehfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and bovine Hsc70 (Hsp73) was purified from bovine brain (16Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).In Vitro Aggregation Assay—8 μm parkin was diluted 1:100 with slow shaking into aggregation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mg/ml pyruvate kinase) with 0.2 μm Hsp40 and 0.4 μm Hsp70, 0.6 μm BSA or no additions. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 3 h and then ultracentrifuged at 50,000 × g for1hat4 °C. The supernatant was removed and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 0.1 m dithiothreitol. Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide), and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Parkin was then detected by immunoblotting using the hP1 antibody.Gel Filtration—Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and cell lysates were centrifuged at 27 × g for 5 min to remove cell nuclei. A 200-μl sample (∼500 μg of protein) was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.1% Triton X-100 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Proteins present in the eluted fractions were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. The gel filtration system was calibrated using the following standard proteins: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (168 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa).RESULTSThermal and Oxidative Stress Induces Misfolding of Wildtype Parkin—The metabolism of dopamine gives rise to various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; consequently, nigral dopaminergic neurons are particularly exposed to oxidative stress. To analyze the impact of cellular stress on the folding state of parkin, murine N2a and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells transiently transfected with wild-type (wt) parkin were subjected to thermal or oxidative stress. To monitor a possible conformational change of parkin, the cells were lysed in buffer containing non-ionic detergent (0.1% Triton X-100) and fractionated by centrifugation into the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fraction. Under physiological conditions parkin was found almost exclusively in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 1, A and B, S). However, under stressful conditions, be it thermal stress (46 °C for 10 min) or oxidative stress (10 and 20 mm H2O2 for 30 min), the majority of parkin adopted a detergent-insoluble conformation (Fig. 1, A and B, P). Of note, the parkin aggregates formed after proteotoxic stress were also insoluble in buffer containing the ionic detergent deoxycholate (data not shown). A quantitative analysis revealed that about 90% of parkin was soluble under physiological conditions. Depending on the severity of the cellular stress, up to 86% of parkin was converted into an insoluble form (Fig. 1D).We then examined the solubility of parkin in the presence of tunicamycin. This drug interferes with N-linked glycosylation leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins specifically in the ER. Under ER stress parkin remained in the detergent-soluble phase, indicating that the folding state of parkin was unaffected (Fig. 1C, TM). Of note, the stress conditions applied in our study did not cause protein aggregation in general; analysis of cellular proteins by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining did not show an obvious increase in the pool of detergent-insoluble proteins (Fig. 1E). Long-term effects of stress-induced parkin aggregation were investigated by a time course (Fig. 1F). Cells subjected to oxidative stress were either harvested directly afterward (0 h) or placed in fresh medium and analyzed after an additional 4 or 24 h. 4 h after the stress the pool of detergent-soluble parkin remained depleted, indicating that misfolded parkin was not resolubilized after the stress ceased. After 24 h, detergent-soluble parkin reappeared, most likely due to de novo synthesis. Moreover, detergent-insoluble parkin disappeared 24 h after H2O2 treatment, indicating cellular degradation. Indeed, inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 or lactacystin interfered with the clearance of parkin aggregates (data not shown).These experiments established that thermal and oxidative stress induces the formation of detergent-insoluble parkin, whereas ER stress has no impact on the folding state of parkin. Parkin aggregates do not accumulate, and 24 h after the stressful event insoluble parkin is no longer detectable.Spontaneous Misfolding of a Parkin Mutant Linked to AR-JP—Pathogenic parkin mutations linked to AR-JP are distributed throughout the parkin gene and include missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations as well as exon deletions and multiplications (1Kitada, T., Asakawa, S., Hattori, N., Matsumine, H., Yamamura, Y., Minoshima, S., Yokochi, M., Mizuno, Y., and Shimizu, N.

Some of the parkin mutants have been shown to interfere with the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity of parkin due to impaired protein interactions. This might be an interaction of parkin with a ubiquitin carrier protein with another component of the ubiquitin ligase complex, or with a parkin substrate destined for degradation (3Imai Y. Soda M.

We found this mutant particularly interesting because of the fact that the C-terminal truncation of 13 amino acids does not extend into the second RING finger motif. The expression analysis in transiently transfected N2a and SH-SY5Y cells revealed that the W453Stop mutant spontaneously adopted a misfolded conformation. Although the majority of wt-parkin was soluble, over 90% of the W453Stop mutant was found in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, the biochemical phenotype of the W453Stop mutant under physiological conditions was similar to that of wt-parkin subjected to thermal or oxidative stress. Notably, the W453Stop mutant was not only insoluble in Triton X-100 but also in the ionic detergent deoxycholate (Fig. 2D). Experimental evidence for the assumption that variant solubility profiles were the consequence of conformational differences between wt-parkin and the W453Stop mutant was provided by a limited proteolytic digestion. In contrast to wt-parkin, which was almost completely degraded at the highest proteinase K concentration, a significant resistance against proteinase K was observed for the W453Stop mutant (Fig. 2E).Fig. 2Spontaneous misfolding of the parkin mutant W453Stop.A, schematic representation of the parkin mutant W453Stop. Wild-type human parkin (wt-parkin) and the W453Stop mutant are shown with the following functional domains: UBL, ubiquitin-like domain; RING, RING finger motif; IBR, in-between RING fingers domain. B–D, in contrast to wt-parkin, the W453Stop mutant has a detergent-insoluble conformation. B, N2a cells were transiently transfected with wt-parkin (wt) or the parkin mutant W453Stop (mt). 24 h later the cells were lysed in detergent buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and fractionated by centrifugation, and parkin present in the detergent-soluble (S) and -insoluble (P) fraction was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-parkin antiserum hP1. C, quantitative analysis of the relative amount of wt-parkin and the W453Stop mutant present in the detergent-soluble (S) and -insoluble (P) fraction, determined from at least three independent experiments. The total amount of parkin present in both fractions was set as 100%. D, the W453Stop mutant is insoluble in non-ionic and ionic detergent buffer. Transiently transfected N2a cells expressing the parkin mutant W453Stop were lysed in buffer containing the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (Triton; 0.1% in PBS) or Triton X-100 and the ionic detergent deoxycholate (DOC; 0.5% in PBS) and fractionated by centrifugation. Parkin was analyzed by Western blotting as described under B. E, the W453Stop mutant shows an increased resistance to proteolytic digestion. Protein lysates from wt- or W453Stop-parkin-expressing cells were incubated with proteinase K (PK) at the concentrations indicated for 30 min on ice. Remaining parkin was analyzed by Western blotting. F, the parkin mutants T415N and G430D do not adopt a detergent-insoluble conformation. N2a cells transiently transfected with either wt-parkin or the parkin mutants T415N or G430N were analyzed as described under B. G and H, mutant parkin W453Stop is rapidly depleted from the detergent-soluble fraction. G, N2a cells expressing wild-type (wt-parkin) or mutant (W453Stop) parkin were metabolically labeled with medium containing [35S]methionine. One plate was harvested directly after the pulse (chase -); fresh medium was added to the other plates, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2, 6, and 24 h (wt-parkin) or 0.5, 2, and 6 h (W453Stop). The cells were lysed in detergent buffer (0.1% Triton X-100), and parkin present in the detergent-soluble fraction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using the anti-parkin antiserum hP1. H, quantitative analysis of the experiment presented in F. The relative amount of parkin present in the detergent-soluble fraction after the pulse was set as 100%. I and J, detergent-insoluble mutant parkin W453Stop is degraded by the proteasome. I, cells transiently transfected with W453Stop parkin were metabolically labeled for 30 min and chased for 2 h. Cells were incubated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (20 μm) or mock-treated during the pulse and the chase. Parkin present in the detergent-soluble fraction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation as described under G. J, N2a cells expressing the parkin mutant W453Stop were cultivated in the presence or absence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10 μm) for 16 h. Cells were lysed in detergent buffer, and parkin present in the detergent-insoluble fraction was analyzed by Western blotting as described under B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To answer the question if misfolding of parkin is a specific feature of the W453Stop mutant, we analyzed two pathogenic parkin mutants with a point mutation within (G430D) or close to (T415N) the second RING finger motif. As shown in Fig. 2F, the solubility in detergents of the two point mutants was comparable with that of wt-parkin, indicating that differences in the folding state might not generally account for a loss of parkin function.We next examined the stability of the W453Stop mutant in comparison to wt-parkin. Transiently transfected N2a cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and parkin was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Wt-parkin turned out to be a relatively stable protein; after a chase of 24 h about 60% of the protein was still detectable (Fig. 2, G and H). In contrast, the stability of the soluble fraction of the W453Stop mutant was significantly reduced; after 6 h less than 20% of the protein was left. We were not able to analyze the pellet fraction from metabolically labeled cells, because the conditions required to solubilize the pellet fraction did not permit antibody binding and hence immunoprecipitation. However, the soluble fraction of the W453Stop mutant was not increased in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 after a chase of 2 h, indicating that the short lifetime of detergent-soluble W453Stop was not due to proteasomal degradation but rather to a shift into the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2I). To analyze the impact of proteasomal degradation on the detergent-insoluble fraction of mutant parkin, we analyzed the pellet fraction by Western blotting. After proteasomal inhibition the amount of detergent-insoluble W453Stop was significantly increased (Fig. 2J).The biochemical characterization of the W453Stop parkin mutant revealed that in contrast to wt-parkin this mutant rapidly adopts a misfolded conformation under physiological conditions. Detergent-insoluble W453Stop does not accumulate in the cell but is degraded by the proteasome, similarly to the stress-induced misfolded wt-parkin.Misfolding of Parkin Interferes with Its Assembly into a Higher Molecular Weight Complex—Previous studies indicated that parkin functions in a multiprotein ubiquitin ligase complex; furthermore, parkin was identified as a component of a high molecular weight complex isolated from brain (7Staropoli J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2101454824,"Hyperglycemic conditions of diabetes accelerate protein modifications by glucose leading to the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). We have investigated the conversion of protein-Amadori intermediate to protein-AGE and the mechanism of its inhibition by pyridoxamine (PM), a potent AGE inhibitor that has been shown to prevent diabetic complications in animal models. During incubation of proteins with physiological diabetic concentrations of glucose, PM prevented the degradation of the protein glycation intermediate identified as fructosyllysine (Amadori) by 13C NMR using [2-13C]-enriched glucose. Subsequent removal of glucose and PM led to conversion of protein-Amadori to AGE Nϵ-carboxymethyllysine (CML). We utilized this inhibition of post-Amadori reactions by PM to isolate protein-Amadori intermediate and to study the inhibitory effect of PM on its degradation to protein-CML. We first tested the hypothesis that PM blocks Amadori-to-CML conversion by interfering with the catalytic role of redox metal ions that are required for this glycoxidative reaction. Support for this hypothesis was obtained by examining structural analogs of PM in which its known bidentate metal ion binding sites were modified and by determining the effect of endogenous metal ions on PM inhibition. We also tested the alternative hypothesis that the inhibitory mechanism involves formation of covalent adducts between PM and protein-Amadori. However, our 13C NMR studies demonstrated that PM does not react with the Amadori. Because the mechanism of interference with redox metal catalysis is operative under the conditions closely mimicking the diabetic state, it may contribute significantly to PM efficacy in preventing diabetic complications in vivo. Inhibition of protein-Amadori degradation by PM also provides a simple procedure for the isolation of protein-Amadori intermediate, prepared at physiological levels of glucose for relevancy, to study both the biological effects and the chemistry of post-Amadori pathways of AGE formation.

These modifications derive, in part, from glycation reactions, i.e. the reversible condensation of the aldehyde group of glucose with a protein amino group, forming a Schiff base followed by an essentially irreversible rearrangement to an Amadori intermediate (Fig. 1). This intermediate undergoes cycles of condensations with additional amines, dehydrations, and oxidative fragmentations to yield heterogeneous chemical compounds collectively referred to as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). 1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end-productBSAbovine serum albuminCMLNϵ-(carboxymethyl)lysineDTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acidPMpyridoxamineRNasebovine pancreatic ribonuclease AELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end-productBSAbovine serum albuminCMLNϵ-(carboxymethyl)lysineDTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acidPMpyridoxamineRNasebovine pancreatic ribonuclease AELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

CML is a major AGE modification associated with different human pathologic states. It can be derived either directly from the glycated protein (Fig. 1) or from protein modification by small reactive carbonyl and dicarbonyl compounds that are either metabolites or autoxidation products of glucose, ascorbate, Schiff bases, Amadori intermediates, or polyunsaturated lipids (14Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M.

CML-modified protein has also been reported to be a ligand for RAGE, an AGE receptor that mediates cellular pro-inflammatory responses (26Kislinger T. Fu C. Huber B. Qu W. Taguchi A. Yan S.D.

We earlier reported a novel way to isolate ribose-Amadori intermediate using a high concentration of ribose (27Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Booth A.A. Yang S.X. Mott J.D.

This ribose-derived intermediate, although not physiologically relevant, provided an experimental strategy to elucidate mechanisms of AGE formation and to search for inhibitors that block it. This led to the discovery that pyridoxamine, a natural intermediate of vitamin B6 metabolism, is an efficient in vitro inhibitor of conversion of the Amadori intermediate to AGEs, particularly CML (28Khalifah R.G.

Under in vivo conditions, pyridoxamine inhibited the accumulation of CML modifications in skin collagen and in retina, and prevented the development of early renal disease and retinopathy in the streptozotocin rat and db/db mouse models of diabetes (31Degenhardt T.P.

In non-diabetic Zucker obese (fa/fa) rats, the protection of PM against renal and vascular pathology was also accompanied by the inhibition of CML formation (34Alderson N.L. Chachich M.E.

Pyridoxamine can form moderately stable complexes with a number of transition metal ions (35Thompson D.M. Balenovich W. Hornich L.H.M. Richardson M.F. Inorg. Chim.

Recently, Baynes and co-workers (37Price D.L. Rhett P.M. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48967-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) reported that PM and other AGE inhibitors can inhibit copper-dependent oxidation of ascorbic acid and proposed that metal chelation may play a major role in the inhibition of glycoxidation reactions. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether or not the redox metal ion requirement and its inhibition by ligand binding are identical in these two reactions. It also has not been established whether other mechanisms of inhibition, such as covalent adduct formation of PM with the Amadori, could significantly contribute to AGE inhibition. In the present work, we demonstrate for the first time that PM can inhibit degradation of a glucose-derived protein-Amadori intermediate and have utilized this inhibition to isolate the glucose-derived Amadori at physiological glucose concentrations. The isolation of this intermediate enabled the study of the mechanism of PM inhibition of the post-Amadori pathway leading to CML formation, including demonstration by 13C NMR that no adducts are formed between PM and Amadori. Our overall results support the hypothesis that PM inhibits post-Amadori glycoxidation reactions by binding to required redox metal ions and interfering with their catalytic role in these reactions. Because this PM inhibition occurred in vitro under physiological diabetic concentrations of glucose, we propose that this PM mechanism contributes to inhibition of AGE formation by PM observed in diabetic animal models (31Degenhardt T.P.

Materials—d-Ribose, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride, 1-deoxy-1-morpholino-d-fructose, 3-hydroxypyridine, 4-aminomethylpyridine, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 5-Nitro-2-hydroxybenzylamine was synthesized by ChemSyn Laboratories (Lenexa, KS), and its structure and purity were confirmed by proton NMR and mass spectrometry. d-Glucose was purchased from Invitrogen. RNase A was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Co. d-[2-13C]Glucose (99 atom % 13C) was purchased from Omicron Biochemicals, Inc. Preparation of Glucose-derived and Ribose-derived Protein-Amadori—For the preparation of protein-Amadori intermediate under physiologically relevant conditions, BSA or RNase (20 mg/ml) was incubated with either 5 or 30 mm glucose and 20 mm pyridoxamine in 200 mm sodium-phosphate, pH 7.5, buffer, containing 0.02% sodium azide, at 37 °C for 80 days. In some cases, protein-Amadori intermediate was prepared using 100 mm glucose and the conditions described above. Accumulation of BSA-Amadori was followed using the nitroblue tetrazolium method described below. When the concentration of Amadori intermediate reached a maximum constant value, glucose and pyridoxamine were removed by dialysis against 100 volumes of the same sodium-phosphate buffer with 6 buffer changes over a 24 h period. The buffer was equilibrated at 4 °C, and dialysis was carried out at this temperature. The complete removal of PM was confirmed by the absence of PM fluorescence (Ex = 324 nm, Em = 393 nm). Ribose-Amadori-modified BSA was prepared as described previously (29Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was incubated in the presence of 500 mm ribose in 200 mm sodium-phosphate, pH 7.5, buffer at 37 °C for 24 h. Sodium azide (0.02%) was added to the incubations to prevent bacterial growth. At the end of the incubation, free and Schiff-base ribose was removed by dialysis at 4 °C. Detection of Protein-CML Using ELISA—Modifications of protein lysine residues to CML were measured by ELISA using polyclonal anti-AGE antibody R618 as described previously (28Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3397-3403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Quantitative Measurements of Protein-Amadori—The formation of protein-Amadori was analyzed using a Sigma Fructosamine kit. The assay is based on the ability of Amadori intermediates to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium leading to the formation of formazan that can be monitored spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. We modified the Sigma protocol by filtering the working solution prior to use in the assay. This modification significantly reduced the background signal and improved the reproducibility of the measurements. Aliquots (40 μl) of protein-Amadori (5 mg/ml) were mixed with 0.7 ml of Sigma Fructosamine assay working solution and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The absorbance of each sample was measured and incubation at 37 °C was resumed. After 10 min, a second absorbance measurement was taken. Amadori intermediate was quantified by comparing the differences in absorbance between two measurements for each sample with those of a 1-deoxy-1-morpholino-d-fructose standard. The protein concentration was determined using a second derivative analysis of the protein absorbance spectrum to minimize contributions from glycation-related spectral components (39Butler W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 505-515Google Scholar). Determination of pKa—The apparent pKa values for 5-nitro-2-hydroxybenzylamine were determined by spectrophotometric titration at 22 °C using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The value of pKa1 (phenolic group), obtained by least squares curve fitting of absorbance titration data, was 6.12 ± 0.01. These data indicate that at physiological pH, the phenolic group of 5-nitro-2-hydroxybenzylamine is present mostly in the deprotonated state, a condition favoring complex formation between PM and metal ions (35Thompson D.M. Balenovich W. Hornich L.H.M. Richardson M.F. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1980; 46: 199-203Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Solution13C NMR—Amadori-RNase was prepared using d-[2-13C]glucose under experimental conditions described above. After the removal of free and Schiff-base [2-13C]glucose and PM by dialysis at 4 °C, the buffer was replaced by 50 mm sodium-phosphate buffer prepared with D2O, pD 7.5, using a Centricon-3 centrifugation concentrator. NMR experiments were performed at 21 °C on a Varian UnityPlus 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 3 mm 13C/1H microprobe. Free induction decay transients (20,000) were collected over spectral widths of 225 ppm (Fig. 6, A and B) or 300 ppm (Fig. 6, C–E). Larger spectral widths were used in Fig. 6, C–E, to determine whether the adducts between PM and acyclic [2-13C]-labeled Amadori intermediate may have formed upon incubation with 20 mm PM for 8 days at 37 °C. No signals were detected at δ > 180 ppm in Fig. 6, D and E, compared with Fig. 6C. In all NMR experiments, the recycle time was 4.7 s, which was judged sufficient to ensure a return to magnetization equilibrium between pulses. All NMR experiments were performed under Waltz-16 decoupling conditions. The Free induction decays were zero-filled (final digital resolution 0.2 Hz/data point), apodized with an exponential window function (line broadening = 15 Hz), and Fourier transformed to give the spectra shown in Fig. 6. Reprocessing the Free induction decays with a Gaussian-to-Lorentzian window function showed that the apparent singlets at ∼97.7 and ∼95.5 ppm contained significant fine structure. At least 3 resonances were observed between 97.6 and 97.8 ppm, and at least 6 signals were observed between 95.3 and 95.6 ppm. Presumably this multiplicity is due to the small effect of protein site environments on Amadori chemical shifts. Absorbance Measurements—Single-wavelength absorbance measurements, absorbance spectra, and second derivative analyses were performed on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. Reversible Inhibition of CML Formation by Pyridoxamine—We initially described a method to prepare Amadori intermediate in the AGE pathways using high concentrations of ribose (27Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Booth A.A. Yang S.X. Mott J.D. Hudson B.G Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4645-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This ribose-derived intermediate provided an experimental strategy to search for inhibitors that block AGE formation and led to the discovery of PM inhibition of post-Amadori reactions (28Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 220: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have used PM to isolate and identify glucose-derived protein-Amadori intermediate. As shown in Fig. 2A, PM completely inhibited formation of immunoreactive BSA-CML during the initial 35 days of incubation of BSA with 200 mm glucose. When PM and glucose were removed, the formation of BSA-CML from the putative intermediate was observed (Fig. 2A, triangles). After 35 days of incubation with glucose, significant accumulation of fructosyllysine (Amadori) intermediate was detected only in the sample containing PM (Fig. 2B, bar graph). The structural identity of protein Amadori intermediate was confirmed using 13C NMR as described in Fig. 6. Upon removal of PM and glucose, BSA-Amadori degraded (Fig. 2B, inset) and converted to BSA-CML (Fig. 2A, triangles). It is noteworthy that CML is the major but not the only AGE product of degradation of Amadori intermediate. This complexity of post-Amadori reactions may account for the apparent differences in kinetics of Amadori degradation and formation of Amadori-derived CML (Fig. 2). The data in Fig. 2 present two important findings. 1) PM inhibits the formation of glucose-derived protein-CML by inhibiting degradation of protein-bound Amadori intermediate; 2) this PM property provides a strategy to specifically follow the formation and degradation of protein-Amadori intermediate. We utilized the isolation of the glucose Amadori by PM to determine the kinetics of formation and degradation of BSA-Amadori under physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose found in the plasma of diabetic patients (>5 mm and up to 30 mm). As shown in Fig. 3A, incubation of BSA with 30 mm glucose at 37 °C in the presence of PM resulted in a significant increase in the rate of accumulation of BSA-Amadori intermediate compared with that at 5 mm glucose. The kinetics was characterized by t1/2 ∼9 days, consistent with the notion that relatively short-lived proteins (t1/2 ∼ days) can be modified by glucose in vivo (40McFarland K.F. Catalano E.W. Day J.F. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 1011-1014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Bunn H.F. Gabbay K.H. Gallop P.M. Science. 1978; 4337: 21-27Crossref Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The degree of modification of protein lysine residues in the albumin-Amadori prepared with diabetic concentration of glucose was about 9% (Fig. 3A), or ∼5 lysine residues per molecule out of total 58 Lys. This result is in good agreement with preferential modification of 4 lysine residues found in albumin purified from diabetic patients (42Iberg N. Fluckiger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13542-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The removal of unreacted glucose and PM by extensive dialysis at 4 °C followed by incubation again at 37 °C led to the disappearance of ∼90% of protein-Amadori intermediate (fructosyllysine) after 80 days (Fig. 3A). This process was accompanied by formation of BSA-CML. Different concentrations of freshly added PM inhibited this CML formation (Fig. 3B). This inhibition of post-Amadori protein-CML formation is consistent with the results of our earlier experiments using ribose-derived protein-Amadori intermediate (28Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). At 1 mm PM (a 2.5-fold molar excess of PM over Amadori moiety), BSA-CML formation was completely inhibited (Fig. 3B). Even at the substoichiometric concentration of PM (0.1 mm), a significant inhibition was still evident (Fig. 3B). Importantly, this PM concentration is similar to a steady-state pyridoxamine level in plasma of PM-treated animals (31Degenhardt T.P. Alderson N.L. Arrington D.D. Beattie R.J. Basgen J.M. Steffes M.W. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3 establish that PM can inhibit CML formation under physiologically relevant solution conditions. Because PM prevented the degradation of protein-Amadori intermediate, the target of PM action must be post-Amadori steps in the CML pathway that lead to irreversible oxidation (Fig. 1). We set out to establish which of these steps is targeted by PM. Role of Metal Ions in Inhibition of the Post-Amadori CML Pathway by PM—Pyridoxamine is known to form complexes with transition metal ions such as Fe3+ and Cu2+ and to also inhibit copper-dependent oxidation of ascorbic acid (35Thompson D.M. Balenovich W. Hornich L.H.M. Richardson M.F. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1980; 46: 199-203Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Gustafson R.L. Martell A.E. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48967-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We checked if PM interferes with the oxidative steps in the CML pathway through binding catalytic metal ions (Fig. 1). The redox metal ion catalysts required for CML formation occur naturally in the sodium-phosphate buffer used in our experiments (43Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Electron pairs on oxygen and nitrogen of the aminomethyl and phenol moieties of PM participate in bidentate coordination with the metal ion (Fig. 4). If pyridoxamine-metal complex formation is critical for the inhibition of the conversion of protein-Amadori intermediate to protein-CML, then modification of these PM functional groups would abolish inhibition. We utilized ribose-derived BSA-Amadori, a model that exhibits a more rapid rate of Amadori-to-CML conversion due to the higher abundance of reactive acyclic form of ribose-Amadori compared with glucose-Amadori (28Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1965126735,"Previously we found that X11-like protein (X11L) associates with amyloid β-protein precursor (APP). X11L stabilizes APP metabolism and suppresses the secretion of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) that are the pathogenic agents of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we found that Alcadein (Alc), a novel membrane protein family that contains cadherin motifs and originally reported as calsyntenins, also interacted with X11L. Alc was abundant in the brain and occurred in the same areas of the brain as X11L. X11L could simultaneously associate with APP and Alc, resulting in the formation of a tripartite complex in brain. The tripartite complex stabilized intracellular APP metabolism and enhanced the X11L-mediated suppression of Aβ secretion that is due to the retardation of intracellular APP maturation. X11L and Alc also formed another complex with C99, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP cleaved at the β-site (CTFβ). The formation of the Alc·X11L·C99 complex inhibited the interaction of C99 with presenilin, which strongly suppressed the γ-cleavage of C99. In AD patient brains, Alc and APP were particularly colocalized in dystrophic neurites in senile plaques. Deficiencies in the X11L-mediated interaction between Alc and APP and/or CTFβ enhanced the production of Aβ, which may be related to the development or progression of AD. Previously we found that X11-like protein (X11L) associates with amyloid β-protein precursor (APP). X11L stabilizes APP metabolism and suppresses the secretion of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) that are the pathogenic agents of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we found that Alcadein (Alc), a novel membrane protein family that contains cadherin motifs and originally reported as calsyntenins, also interacted with X11L. Alc was abundant in the brain and occurred in the same areas of the brain as X11L. X11L could simultaneously associate with APP and Alc, resulting in the formation of a tripartite complex in brain. The tripartite complex stabilized intracellular APP metabolism and enhanced the X11L-mediated suppression of Aβ secretion that is due to the retardation of intracellular APP maturation. X11L and Alc also formed another complex with C99, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP cleaved at the β-site (CTFβ). The formation of the Alc·X11L·C99 complex inhibited the interaction of C99 with presenilin, which strongly suppressed the γ-cleavage of C99. In AD patient brains, Alc and APP were particularly colocalized in dystrophic neurites in senile plaques. Deficiencies in the X11L-mediated interaction between Alc and APP and/or CTFβ enhanced the production of Aβ, which may be related to the development or progression of AD.

Aβ is generated by the intracellular processing of amyloid β-protein precursor (APP). Major proteolytic processing of APP generates a large extracellular amino-terminal domain (sAPPα) and a truncated carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTFα) by the digestion of α-secretase, which cleaves APP at the α-site within the Aβ domain. Another form of proteolytic processing occurring at the β-site, by β-secretase (or BACE), gives rise to low levels of sAPPβ and a carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTFβ) including the entire Aβ domain. Both CTFα and CTFβ are further cleaved by γ-secretase (presenilin (PS) complex) and generate the p3 peptide and Aβ, respectively (1.Price D. Sissodia S.S. Borchelt D.R.

A minority of AD cases fall into the familial category in which the overproduction of Aβ appears to be due to mutations in genes encoding APP or PS (3.Hardy J. Gwinn-Hardy K. Science. 1998; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, most AD cases are of the sporadic type (SAD) in which mutations in APP- or PS-encoding genes do not occur. The mechanisms that lead to the overproduction of Aβ in SAD cases must therefore involve alternative mechanisms that cause the production, accumulation, and degradation of Aβ (4.Tomita S. Kirino Y.

X11-like protein (X11L) was originally isolated as a factor that interacts with APPcyt, and the interaction results in the suppression of Aβ production (14.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S.

The X11 was initially identified on the basis of its possible link to Friedreich ataxia (15.Duclos F. Boschert U. Sirugo G. Mandel J.L. Hen R. Koenig M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and was originally denoted as Mint (16.Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C.

They are neuron-specific adaptor proteins composed of a large amino-terminal region, a central phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domain, and two carboxyl-terminal PDZ domains. The 681GYENPTY687 motif of APPcyt (numbering is based on the APP695 isoform) interacts with the PI domain of X11L (14.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To understand how APP metabolism is regulated, including Aβ generation, it is of interest to isolate other proteins that interact with X11L. This will help elucidate the molecular mechanism by which X11L regulates APP metabolism. In the present study, we isolated novel human cDNAs encoding Alcadeins (Alcs), which are type I transmembrane proteins that interact with the PI domain of X11L. These genes are conserved in a wide variety of species, including D. melanogaster and C. elegans. We found that the cytoplasmic domain of Alc bound to the PI domain of X11L and initiated the formation of a tripartite complex comprised of Alc, X11L, and APP. This complex stabilized intracellular APP metabolism and significantly suppressed Aβ production by slowing APP maturation. We found that Alc and X11L also formed a tripartite complex with C99, a CTFβ. This complex inhibited the interaction of C99 with PS1, a component of γ-secretase that generates Aβ from C99. We could recover endogenous X11L·APP·Alc tripartite complexes from normal mouse brains, and normal mouse neurons displayed remarkable colocalization of these proteins. In AD brains, APP was found to colocalize with Alc in the dystrophic neurites of senile plaques. These observations indicate that APP exists in protein complexes composed of X11L and Alc that regulate APP metabolism, including Aβ production in neurons, and that this regulatory mechanism may be perturbed in AD. cDNA Cloning of Human Alcα1 and Plasmid Construction of Alcα Family cDNAs—The yeast two-hybrid system used in this study has been described previously (14.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, the human brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech) was screened with bait composed of cDNA encoding part of the human X11L (hX11L) protein (amino acids 129-555). This yielded a cDNA clone (X11L-binding protein clone number 31 (XB31α)) that contained a partial open reading frame of Alcα1. Using this clone, a clone encoding the full-length Alcα1 protein was isolated from a human brain λgt11 cDNA library (Clontech). This cDNA was designated as human Alcα1 (GenBank™ accession number AF438482, registered as XB31α). The full-length hAlcα1 open reading frame was subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). We identified two similar cDNA clones in the HUGE (Human Unidentified Gene-Encoded Large Proteins data base analyzed by the KAZUSA cDNA Project) Protein Database (21.Kikuno R. Nagase T. Suyama M. Waki M. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 331-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The HUGE cDNA clones were denoted as human Alcα2 (accession number KIAA0911) and Alcβ (accession number KIAA0726). We also found human Alcγ (accession number NM022131) in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank. Alcβ cDNA, a generous gift from Dr. Nagase (KAZUSA DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan), was recloned into pcDNA3 at HindIII and XbaI sites to produce pcDNA3-hAlcβ. The human Alcα1 and Alcβ cDNAs were also recloned via an XbaI site into pcDNA3 with a FLAG tag on the amino-terminal end of the insert so that pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcα1 and pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcβ could be produced. Protein Interaction Assays in Yeast—The MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (Clontech) with pGBT9 and pGAD424 was used as described previously (22.Tomita S. Fujita T. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13056-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity in the yeast two-hybrid system was measured in a liquid assay using o-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside and was expressed in Miller units. Antibodies—The anti-Alcα polyclonal rabbit antibody UT83 was raised against a peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 954 and 971 of human Alcα1. The anti-Alcβ polyclonal rabbit antibody BS7 was raised against a peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 954 and 968 of human Alcβ. The anti-hX11L polyclonal antibodies, UT29 and UT30, were obtained as described previously (14.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the anti-X11L monoclonal antibody mint2 was purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) and anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) monoclonal antibodies were purchased. The anti-APP cytoplasmic domain polyclonal antiserum, G369, has been described previously (23.Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-APP extracellular domain monoclonal (22C11, Roche Diagnostics, and LN27, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and polyclonal (Sigma) antibodies were purchased. The 4G8 monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody raised against the Aβ-(17-24) peptide was purchased from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA). All polyclonal antibodies except G369 were affinity-purified before use. Monoclonal antibodies specific for protein-disulfide isomerase (1D3, Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), 130-kDa Golgi matrix protein (GM-130) (clone no. 35, BD Biosciences), synaptotagmin (SYT) (clone no. 41, BD Biosciences), mouse kinesin heavy chain (KHC) (H2, Chemicon International; Temecula, CA), PS1 carboxyl-terminal fragment (PS1-CTF; Chemicon International), and PS1 amino-terminal fragment (PS1-NTF, Chemicon International) were purchased. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Assays—COS7 and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (∼1 × 107 cells) were transfected as described previously (14.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with the indicated amounts of various combinations of the pcDNA3-hX11L, pcDNA3-hAlcα1, pcDNA3-hAlcβ, pcDNA3APP695, and pcDNA3-PS1 plasmids. In another experiment, pcDNA3.1-HA-hX11, in which human X11 cDNA with an attached HA tag at the 5′-end was inserted into the NheI and EcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1, was transfected instead of pcDNA3-hX11L. pcDNA3-FLAG-hX11L and pcDNA3-FLAG-hX11, in which human X11L and X11 cDNA with an attached FLAG tag at the 5′-end, were also used in coimmunoprecipitation assay. Cells were harvested and lysed for 1 h on ice in CHAPS buffer, which consists of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl and 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)) containing 10 mm CHAPS, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, affinity-purified antibodies (indicated IgG amounts) or serum was added to the CHAPS lysate supernatant. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Subcellular Fractionation of Mouse Brain Proteins—The subcellular fractionation of mouse brains was performed as described previously (24.Graham J.M. Graham J.M. Rickwood D.

Briefly, five brains of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were homogenized on ice in 5 volumes of buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.32 m sucrose, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) by 10 strokes of a loose-fitting (0.12-μm clearance) Teflon homogenizer. The postnuclei supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting precipitate (membrane fraction) was resuspended and separated by centrifugation for 115 min at 41,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C on a 0-28% (w/v) iodixanol density gradient. The supernatants were then fractionated into 13 tubes (0.8 ml/tube), and the fractions (20 μl) were analyzed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Fraction 8 was solubilized by adding an equal amount of 2× CHAPS buffer consisting of 2× PBS (280 mm NaCl and 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)) plus 20 mm CHAPS. The mixture was allowed to rotate for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was used in the coimmunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous proteins. Pulse-Chase Study—Pulse-chase labeling of cells was performed with L-[35S] in vitro Cell Labeling Mix (0.4 mCi/ml; AGQ 0080, Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of the pcDNA3APP695, pcDNA3-hX11L, pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcα1, and pcDNA3 vector plasmids (transfection was performed with 9 μg of plasmids in total). After a 48-h transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled for 15 min. This was followed by a 0-8-h chase period, which was initiated by replacing the labeling medium containing excess amounts of unlabeled methionine. The cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with G369 (anti-APP cytoplasmic domain antibody) and protein G-Sepharose. The recovered APP was separated by SDS-PAGE (6% (w/v) polyacrylamide) and analyzed by Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer. Quantification of β-Amyloid—C99 protein was used as an intracellular γ-secretase substrate (26.Lichtenthaler S.F. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The construct containing Kozak sequence, first methionine, signal peptide sequence of APP, and CTFβ coding region was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) at NheI and ApaI sites and designated as pcDNA3.1APP-C99. The C99 protein is expressed as an artificial CTFβ once its signal sequence is cleaved off by signal peptidase (26.Lichtenthaler S.F. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neuro-2a cells (∼2 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected with the indicated combinations of pcDNA3APP695 or pcDNA3.1APP-C99, pcDNA3-hX11L, pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcα1, and pcDNA3 vector plasmids (transfection was performed with 9 μg of plasmids in total). Cells were supplied with fresh growth medium 5 h after the start of transfection, and conditioned medium was collected 48 h after the medium replacement. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were quantified with sandwich ELISA by using three types of Aβ-specific monoclonal antibodies (27.Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6277-6284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Intracellular Aβ40 and Aβ42 were also extracted (28.Sawamura N. Morishima-Kawashima M. Waki H.

Briefly, the cells were lysed by sonication in 40 μl of PBS containing 6 m guanidine chloride and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was diluted up to 12-fold by adding PBS and used in the ELISA. The single factor analysis of variance test followed by Tukey multiple comparisons was used to analyze differences among groups of data. Data were presented as means ± S.E. Immunological Staining of Mouse Brain Sections—Experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Studies Committee of Hokkaido University. Adult C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks, male) were perfused at 4 °C for 20 min with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The brains were excised and postfixed with the same fixative at 4 °C overnight followed by treatment with 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS for 2-3 days at 4 °C. Brains were embedded into OCT compound (Miles Scientific), and frozen sagittal sections (20 μm) were prepared. The sections were incubated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature followed by treatment with 0.3% (v/v) H2O2 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with antibodies in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS. After washing, the sections were further incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 568 in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were viewed using the confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss). Immunological Staining of AD Brains—We used paraffin sections of frontal and temporal cortices from five AD subjects. Tissues were fixed with Kryofix (a mixture of ethanol, polyethylene glycol, and water; Merck) for 1-7 days and embedded in paraffin. Dewaxed serial tissue sections (cut into 4-μm sections) were immunostained with the ABC elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Some sections were pretreated with a microwave antigen retrieval method for 10 min in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (29.Sherriff F.E. Bridges L.R. Jackson P. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1085-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated with antibodies specific for Alcα (UT83, 0.8 μg/ml), APP (22C11, 0.5 μg/ml), and Aβ (4G8, 1:1000 dilution). The peroxidase activity was visualized with diaminobenzidine-H2O2 solution. For control analyses, tissue sections were incubated with anti-Alcα antibody UT83 in the presence of the antigen peptide (40 nm) or non-immune rabbit IgG (0.8 μg/ml). For double immunofluorescence analyses, dewaxed sections were incubated with a mixture of UT83 and 22C11 or of UT83 and 4G8 at the same dilutions as above followed by incubation with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; 1:30 dilution) and Cy3-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:50 dilution). Prior to immunolabeling, the autofluorescence of the lipofuscin granules was blocked with Sudan black B staining (30.Schnell S.A. Staines W.A. Wessendorf M.W. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Isolation, Identification, and Characterization of Novel Cadherin-related Membrane Protein Genes—Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library with cDNA encoding a part of the hX11L protein resulted in the isolation of a novel cDNA denoted XB31α (GenBank™ accession number AF438482). The cDNA encoded a type I transmembrane protein composed of 971 amino acids. In this paper, this protein has been entitled human Alcadein (Alzheimer-related cadherin-like protein) α1 or Alcα1 (Fig. 1A). A thorough search of the human cDNA data base and genome data bases revealed three similar genes. These encode 981-, 968-, and 955-amino acid proteins, and we denoted these proteins as Alcα2, Alcβ, and Alcγ, respectively (Fig. 1A). Alcα2 is identical to human Alcα1 except for 10 additional amino acids between the Alcα1 residues at positions 71 and 72 (Fig. 1A, pink box). This extra sequence in Alcα2 is derived from one exon, and both proteins are spliced variants of the XB31α (Alcα) gene. The Alcβ and Alcγ proteins are both ∼50% homologous to Alcα. They are encoded by different genes and belong to the same gene family to which Alcα belongs. Further data base examinations revealed that there are Alc-like genes in D. melanogaster (GenBank™ accession number AAF59384) and C. elegans (GenBank™ accession number NP495189) as well. The Alc family members contain two cadherin motifs, a putative Ca2+-binding sequence in their amino-terminal halves, and a single cytoplasmic domain composed of ∼110 amino acids (Fig. 1A). This cytoplasmic domain includes the X11L-binding site (see Fig. 2), which is highly conserved among different species, and an acidic region at the carboxyl-terminal end of the X11L-binding site (Fig. 1, A and B). Expression and Distribution of Alcα—X11L is specifically expressed in neural tissue (14.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We examined which human tissues express Alcα and Alcβ by Northern blot analysis, and we found strong expression of the ∼5-kb Alcα transcript in the brain and weaker expression in the heart, while a probe specific for Alcβ revealed high levels of a 4.4-kb transcript in the brain (data not shown, please see Supplemental Fig. 1). Expression of Alc protein in mouse brain tissue was examined by Western blot analysis. The anti-Alcα antibody UT83 recognizes two endogenous proteins in mouse brain lysates (Fig. 1C) as well as recombinant human Alcα1 but not recombinant Alcβ (data not shown, please see Supplemental Fig. 2). The antigen peptide to which UT83 was raised competed with the endogenous proteins for binding to UT83 (Fig. 1C, +). Thus, the UT83 antibody specifically recognizes two endogenous Alcα proteins in the mouse brain. When UT83 was used to analyze Alcα expression in a variety of murine tissues, the highest levels were found in the brain, and small amounts were found in the lung (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Assessment of X11L expression with the UT30 X11L-specific antibody confirmed its brain-specific distribution (Fig. 1D, upper panel). These observations suggest that, like X11L, Alcα is abundant in neurons. This colocalization in the brain supports the notion that X11L and Alcα interact physiologically. This idea was further supported when we examined Alcα and X11L expression in various parts of the brain by dissecting adult mouse brains into various component regions and blotting them with UT83 and UT30. Relatively high levels of Alcα were detected in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus; moderate levels were found in the cerebellum; and low levels were observed in the olfactory bulb, midbrain, and pons (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Expression in the sciatic nerve fiber was not observed. X11L was distributed in a very similar pattern (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Thus, X11L and Alcα are both largely expressed in neural tissues apart from peripheral nervous system. Alc and X11L Interaction—We investigated the interactions between Alc and X11L by coimmunoprecipitation assays from COS7 cells expressing X11L together with Alcα1 or Alcβ followed by Western blot analysis. The immunoprecipitates resulting from incubating the lysates with anti-Alcα (UT83) or anti-Alcβ (BS7) antibodies included X11L as detected by the X11L antibody (UT30) (data not shown, please see Supplemental Fig. 3). Conversely the immunoprecipitates generated by the anti-X11L antibody contained Alcα1 and Alcβ. In contrast, non-immune antibody (control IgG) immunoprecipitates did not contain these proteins. Thus, both the Alcα and Alcβ proteins bind to X11L within cells. We identified the Alcα- and Alcβ-binding domain of X11L by assessing the in vitro binding of various X11L domain constructs to the putative cytoplasmic domains of Alcα and Alcβ. Cell lysates containing X11L protein constructs were incubated with beads coupled to the cytoplasmic domains of human Alcα or Alcβ fused to GST. GST alone was used as a negative control. The pull-downs were subjected to Western blot analysis with the anti-X11L amino-terminal antibody UT29. Full-length X11L and its construct encoding the X11L amino-terminal domain attached to the PI domain (N + PI) bound the GST-Alcα and GST-Alcβ fusion proteins (data not shown, please see Supplemental Fig. 4). However, the amino-terminal domain alone did not bind either protein. GST alone also did not bind to any of the X11L constructs. Thus,"

For several related proteases, normal folding and enzymatic latency depend on an NH2-terminal propeptide that is removed by proteolytic processing during biosynthesis. However, the ADAMTS13 propeptide is unusually short and poorly conserved, suggesting it may not perform these functions. ADAMTS13 was secreted from transfected HeLa cells with a half-time of 7 h and the rate-limiting step was exported from the endoplasmic reticulum. Deletion of the propeptide did not impair the secretion of active ADAMTS13, indicating that the propeptide is dispensable for folding. Furin was shown to be sufficient for ADAMTS13 propeptide processing in two ways. First, mutation of the furin consensus recognition site prevented propeptide cleavage in HeLa cells and resulted in secretion of pro-ADAMTS13. Second, furin-deficient LoVo cells secreted ADAMTS13 with the propeptide intact, and cotransfection with furin restored propeptide cleavage. In both cell lines, secreted pro-ADAMTS13 had normal proteolytic activity toward von Willebrand factor. In cells coexpressing both ADAMTS13 and von Willebrand factor, pro-ADAMTS13 cleaved pro-von Willebrand factor intracellularly. Therefore, the ADAMTS13 propeptide is not required for folding or secretion, and does not perform the common function of maintaining enzyme latency.

ADAMTS13 shares similarities in domain structure with other ADAMTS proteases but also has significant differences that make it the most divergent member of the group. The ADAMTS family belongs to the metzincin superfamily of zinc metalloproteases (9Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.-X. McKay D.B. Bode W.

Many ADAMTS proteases have additional thrombospondin-1 repeats after their spacer domain, and ADAMTS13 has 7 of them. But in contrast to any other family member, the carboxyl terminus of ADAMTS13 concludes with two CUB domains, which were first identified in the complement proteins C1r and C1s (14Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Members of the closely related ADAM family of membrane-associated proteases also have similar propeptide, metalloprotease, and disintegrin domains, but lack thrombospondin-1 repeats and have different characteristic domains appended to the carboxyl terminus (15Stone A.L. Kroeger M. Sang Q.X. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 447-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The more distantly related matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), also have similar propeptide and metalloprotease domains, although their COOH-terminal motifs are not conserved with ADAMTS proteases (17Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3671) Google Scholar). Compared with all other ADAMTS proteases and most ADAMs and MMPs, the ADAMTS13 propeptide is exceptionally short, containing ≈41 amino acids residues instead of a more typical ≈200 residues. In other metalloproteases, propeptides may assist protein folding as endogenous chaperones (18Loechel F. Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol.

Such metalloprotease zymogens may be activated by cleavage after a proprotein convertase site with the sequence RX(K/R)R, liberating the propeptide and exposing the protease active site. As in other ADAMTS proteases, the ADAMTS13 propeptide does terminate in a typical proprotein convertase site, RQRR, but unlike most other family members ADAMTS13 does not have a potential cysteine-switch motif (11Zheng X.

To determine whether the unique structural features of the ADAMTS13 propeptide reflect distinct functional properties, the role of the propeptide in biosynthesis and enzyme latency was investigated by mutagenesis. Materials—Anti-propeptide antibody was made in rabbits against the predicted ADAMTS13 propeptide amino acid sequence SPGAPLKGRPPSPGFQRQR (amino acid residues 51–69) with a Cys residue added to the NH2 terminus (Alpha Diagnostic Int., San Antonio, TX). Rabbit IgG was purified from serum by chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Corp.). The IgG fraction was affinity purified on a column of the immunizing peptide linked to Sulfo-Link Coupling Gel (Pierce). LoVo and HeLa cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Plasmid Constructs—A full-length cDNA encoding ADAMTS13 was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate plasmid pADAMTS13 as previously described (11Zheng X. Chung D. Takayama T.K.

Mutations were introduced using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. The predicted proprotein convertase cleavage site RQRR74 was changed to KQDR74 with primer 5′-CAGAGGCAGAGGCAGAAGCAGGACCGGGCTGCAGGCGGCATC-3′ and its complement, generating plasmid pADAMTS13-R-71K/R73D. The propeptide (amino acid residues Gln34-Arg74) was deleted with primer 5′-TGCTGGGGACCCTCCCATTTCGCTGCAGGCGGCATCCTACAC-3′ and its complement, generating plasmid pAD-AMTS13-delPro. Sequences were verified using dideoxy sequencing (Big Dye V3.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Plasmids encoding COOH-terminal truncations of ADAMTS13 were prepared as described previously (25Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These included constructs in which the V5 epitope and poly(His) tags were inserted after ADAMTS13 amino acid residues Gln289, Gly385, Glu429, Cys555, or Ala685 were cloned in pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen); or after Tyr745, Arg807, Ala894, Pro952, Arg1015, Arg1075, and Ala1191 were cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen).

A full-length cDNA insert was identified and cloned into plasmid pCMV, yielding plasmid pFurin. Plasmid pSVHVWF1.1 encodes full-length human VWF (28Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

Transient Transfection of HeLa and LoVo Cells—Cells were split into T25 flasks the day before transfection and replated at ∼50% confluence. They were transfected using 8 μl of LipofectAMINE and 12 μl pf Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and 5 μg of DNA in 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Media and cell lysates were collected at 48 h post-transfection. To prepare lysates, cells were washed and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Recombinant protein samples were concentrated by methanol-chloroform precipitation (29Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar) or by immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 antibody (LoVo cells). Equivalent fractions of the media and cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting onto Immobilon P (Millipore). ADAMTS13 proteins were detected with monoclonal peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:5000 or affinity purified anti-propeptide antibody diluted 1:100 followed by peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA), and the chemiluminescent ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). VWF was detected similarly with rabbit polyclonal horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-human VWF antibody P226 (Dako Corp.). Pulse-Chase Analysis of ADAMTS13 Synthesis—HeLa cells were transiently transfected as described above. At 48 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 60 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) without methionine or cysteine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum; 300 μCi/ml Tran35S-label™ (ICN) was added and the cells were incubated for another 60 min. The medium was then replaced with Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times of chase. Conditioned media and cell lysates were prepared and equivalent fractions were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (RepliGen, Cambridge, MA) in a total volume of 0.5 to 1.0 ml for 1 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of anti-V5 antibody and 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed sequentially with RIPA buffer and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5% SDS, 178 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25% bromphenol blue). The eluate was diluted with 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5 (for endoglycosidase H), or 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (for peptide N-glycosidase F), such that the SDS concentration was <0.2% and equal fractions were incubated without or with 1000 units of Streptomyces plicatus endoglycosidase H (endo H) or 1000 units of peptide: N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1–2 h. The products were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed in 25% 2-propanol, 10% acetic acid, incubated in Amplify™ (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at –70 °C. Assay of ADAMTS13 Activity—Activity was assayed based on modifications of the methods of Tsai (3Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Furlan et al. (2Furlan M. Robles R. Lamie B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were diluted into buffer such that the final concentration was 1 m urea, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with or without 5 mm EDTA. VWF was added to a final concentration of 1.5 μg/ml, and incubated at room temperature for 1–2 h. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, blotting onto Immobilon P, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-VWF (number P226, Dako), and chemiluminescent detection with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Films were scanned and densitometry was performed using NIH Image 1.62 (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). 2rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image. Protease activity was measured by comparing the intensity of the homodimeric 350-kDa product band for reactions performed in the absence and presence of EDTA. Time Course of ADAMTS13 Glycosylation and Secretion— ADAMTS13 biosynthesis was examined to provide a framework for understanding the effects of propeptide mutations. In previous studies, the stable expression of ADAMTS13 in several mammalian cell lines was associated with low levels of protease secretion compared with transiently transfected COS-7 or COS-1 cells (25Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, transient transfections were performed with several cell lines including HepG2, RFL6, COS-1, and HeLa. The highest expression levels were obtained with HeLa cells (data not shown), which then were used to assess the time course of ADAMTS13 glycosylation and secretion (Fig. 1). Pulse-labeled ADAMTS13 appeared in the medium within 3 h of chase with a half-time for secretion of ≈7 h. No radiolabeled ADAMTS13 could be detected within the cell after 35 h (data not shown), and secreted ADAMTS13 appeared to be stable in the culture medium. ADAMTS13 purified from plasma is a glycoprotein (23Fujikawa K. Suzuki H. McMullen B. Chung D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and recombinant ADAMTS13 contains peptide: N-glycosidase F (PNGase F)-sensitive N-linked oligosaccharides (30Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Soejima K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Funato M. Tamai H. Konno M. Kamide K. Kawano Y. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11902-11907Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The protein has 10 potential N-glycosylation sites, and to evaluate their status lysates from HeLa cells expressing full-length ADAMTS13 and COOH-terminal truncated variants were digested with endo H. The results indicate that the following sites are utilized: 2 in the metalloprotease domain, 1 in the Cys-rich domain, 2 or 3 in the spacer domain, and 1 in the second thrombospondin-1 repeat. A potential site in the fourth thrombospondin-1 repeat and one in each of the two CUB domains could not be assessed by this approach (data not shown). In addition, sialidase treatment increased the electrophoretic mobility of secreted ADAMTS13 (Fig. 2), but not if first digested with PNGase F (data not shown), suggesting that sialic acid is attached mainly to N-linked oligosaccharides. The N-linked oligosaccharides on secreted ADAMTS13 were resistant to endo H (Fig. 1, lanes 8, 12, and 17) suggesting that all or nearly all have a complex-type structure. In contrast, ADAMTS13 in cell lysates was sensitive to endo H digestion throughout the 24 h of chase (lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14), indicating that intracellular ADAMTS13 is predominately located in compartments of the secretory pathway prior to the cis-Golgi (31Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the rate-limiting step for ADAMTS13 secretion is protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum.

To determine whether propeptide cleavage is required for ADAMTS13 proteolytic activity, the potential cleavage site was mutated. Based on previous studies of furin specificity (32Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the sequence RQRR74 was changed to KQDR74. Upon expression in HeLa cells intracellular wild-type ADAMTS13 retained the propeptide, whereas secreted ADAMTS13 did not (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6), which is consistent with cleavage of the propeptide by furin. In contrast, secreted pro-ADAMTS13-R71K/R73D was detected in the media (Fig. 3, lane 4), demonstrating that the proprotein convertase consensus site is needed for propeptide cleavage and that removal of the propeptide is not necessary for secretion. As shown by reactivity with the anti-V5 antibody, ADAMTS13-R71K/R73D appeared to be secreted less efficiently than wild-type ADAMTS13 (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9), suggesting that the R71K/R73D mutations may delay exit from the endoplasmic reticulum in addition to preventing propeptide cleavage. Furin Cleaves the ADAMTS13 Propeptide—To obtain additional evidence that furin could be the responsible proprotein convertase, ADAMTS13 was expressed in the LoVo human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, which lacks furin activity (33Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T. Duguay S.J. Van de Ven W.J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26565-26569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ADAMTS13 was secreted with its propeptide intact, confirming that propeptide cleavage is not required for secretion (Fig. 4). When ADAMTS13 and furin were co-expressed the propeptide was no longer detected in secreted ADAMTS13, indicating that propeptide cleavage was restored. As observed for ADAMTS13-R71K/R73D in HeLa cells (Fig. 3), pro-ADAMTS13 appeared to be secreted slightly less efficiently than mature ADAMTS13 made in LoVo cells cotransfected with furin (Fig. 4, lanes 10 and 11). Intracellular pro-ADAMTS13 in LoVo cells remained sensitive to endoglycosidase H (data not shown), indicating that decreased secretion is not caused by retention in the trans-Golgi network. Secreted Pro-ADAMTS13 Is Proteolytically Active—The unusual structural features of the ADAMTS13 propeptide suggest it may not maintain enzyme latency. Therefore, pro-ADAMTS13 variants made in HeLa or LoVo cells were assayed for the ability to cleave VWF (Fig. 5). The VWF substrate consists of multimers that may exceed 20,000 kDa, which do not consistently enter polyacrylamide gels or transfer to membranes, but cleavage by ADAMTS13 results in the appearance of an easily monitored 350-kDa homodimeric fragment. LoVo cells transfected with ADAMTS13 secrete pro-ADAMTS13, and LoVo cells transfected with both ADAMTS13 and furin secrete mature ADAMTS13 lacking the propeptide (Fig. 4). In either case, the secreted pro-ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS13 cleaved VWF with equal efficiency and, as expected, activity was abolished by chelation of divalent metal ions with EDTA. No activity was detected in the medium of cells transfected with vector alone. To exclude the possibility that pro-ADAMTS13 was cleaved and activated during the assay, a sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody and shown to remain intact after incubation (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for wild-type ADAMTS13 (lacking propeptide) and ADAMTS13-R71K/R73D (with propeptide) expressed in HeLa cells; both proteins cleaved VWF (Fig. 5). Therefore, propeptide cleavage is not necessary for ADAMTS13 activity against VWF under these assay conditions. Propeptide Is Not Required for ADAMTS13 Intracellular Folding—The ADAMTS13 propeptide does not maintain enzyme latency, but might promote folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and enable secretion. To test this hypothesis, the nucleotides that encode the propeptide, amino acids 34–74, were deleted from the ADAMTS13 cDNA. In the expressed mutant protein, amino acid residues Met1-Phe33 comprising the signal peptide were juxtaposed to amino acid residue Ala75, which is the NH2 terminus of purified plasma ADAMTS13 (23Fujikawa K. Suzuki H. McMullen B. Chung D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 24Gerritsen H.E. Robles R. Lammle B. Furlan M. Blood. 2001; 98: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Both wild-type ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS13-delPro were secreted efficiently by HeLa cells (Fig. 6A) and were equally active in cleaving VWF (Fig. 6B); therefore, the propeptide is not necessary for folding and secretion of active ADAMTS13. Intracellular Pro-ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS13 Are Proteolytically Active—Proteases that require cleavage by furin for activation would become proteolytically competent only upon encountering furin in the trans-Golgi, whereas ADAMTS13 might be active from the time folding was completed in the endoplasmic reticulum. If so, then coexpression with ADAMTS13 could result in the intracellular proteolysis of a substrate protein such as VWF. This prediction was confirmed by transfection of HeLa cells (Fig. 7). Intracellular pro-VWF was cleaved to yield the expected 176-kDa COOH-terminal fragment by wild-type ADAMTS13, by ADAMTS13-R71K/R73D with a mutated furin cleavage site, and by ADAMTS13-delPro lacking the propeptide. The oligosaccharides of intracellular pro-VWF are endo H-sensitive, indicating that it is located within the endoplasmic reticulum (34Wagner D.D. Saffaripour S. Bonfanti R. Sadler J.E. Cramer E.M. Chapman B. Mayadas T.N. Cell. 1991; 64: 403-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In previous studies, secreted ADAMTS13-del6 truncated after the metalloprotease domain was inactive and ADAMTS13-del2 truncated after the spacer domain was active toward plasma VWF multimers. The intracellular forms of these ADAMTS13 mutant proteins had similar properties in HeLa cells: ADAMTS13-del6 was inactive and ADAMTS13-del2 was active toward pro-VWF (Fig. 7). Cells that expressed active ADAMTS13 and VWF also secreted reduced amounts of VWF that consisted only of small multimers (data not shown). As is the case for many other proteins, intracellular ADAMTS13 contains predominantly endo H-sensitive N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 1), suggesting that exit from the endoplasmic reticulum is relatively slow compared with transport through the Golgi and secretion. During biosynthesis, at least 6 of 10 potential N-glycosylation sites are modified with complex-type oligosaccharides, which are likely to be sialylated (Fig. 2). Consensus sequences also are present in several thrombospondin-1 repeats for C-mannosylation of Trp and O-fucosylation of certain Ser/Thr residues (11Zheng X. Chung D. Takayama T.K. Majerus E.M.

Here we demonstrate that the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells correlates with overexpression of PAR-1. We also provide evidence that an inverse correlation exists between the expression of activator protein-2α (AP-2) and the expression of PAR-1 in human melanoma cells. Reexpression of AP-2 in WM266-4 melanoma cells, which are AP-2-negative, resulted in decreased mRNA and protein expression of PAR-1. The promoter of the PAR-1 gene contains multiple putative consensus elements for the transcription factors AP-2 and specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the PAR-1 promoter regions bp –365 to –329 (complex 1) and bp –206 to –180 (complex 2) demonstrated that Sp1 was predominantly bound to the PAR-1 promoter in metastatic cells, whereas AP-2 was bound to the PAR-1 promoter in nonmetastatic cells. In vitro analysis of complex 1 demonstrated that AP-2 and Sp1 bound to this region in a mutually exclusive manner. Transfection experiments with full-length and progressive deletions of the PAR-1 promoter luciferase constructs demonstrated that metastatic melanoma cells had increased PAR-1 promoter activity compared with low and nonmetastatic melanoma cells. Our data show that exogenous AP-2 expression decreased promoter activity, whereas transient expression of Sp1 further increased expression of the reporter gene. Mutational analysis of complex 1 within PAR-1 luciferase constructs further demonstrated that the regulation of PAR-1 was mediated through interactions with AP-2 and Sp1. Our data suggest that loss of AP-2 in metastatic cells alters the AP-2/Sp1 ratio, resulting in overexpression of PAR-1. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that loss of AP-2 correlates with overexpression of PAR-1, which in turn contributes to the acquisition of the malignant phenotype of human melanoma.

These observations have been supported by several studies in human melanoma clinical specimens.We have previously demonstrated that loss of AP-2 is an important molecular event in melanoma progression, which results in deregulation of AP-2 target genes involved in tumor growth and metastasis. For example, loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells resulted in overexpression of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/MUC18) (2Jean D. Gershenwald J.E. Huang S. Luca M.

Increased expression of MUC18 allowed the metastatic cells to adhere to the endothelial cells in blood vessels and supported their migration to the metastatic site (5Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Jansen B.

In addition, inactivation of AP-2 in AP-2-positive primary cutaneous melanoma cells by means of transfection with a dominant negative AP-2 gene (AP-2B) led to deregulation of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 gene (4Gershenwald J.E.

Activation of PAR-1 involves proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular amino-terminal domain by thrombin to unmask a new amino terminus capable of serving as a tethered ligand for the receptor, which leads to downstream cell signaling events that evoke a variety of cellular responses (21Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PAR-1 has been detected in numerous human cancers, including colon (22Wojtukiewicz M.Z. Tang D.G. Ben-Josef E. Renaud C. Walz D.A. Honn K.V.

PAR-1 was reported to be a rate-limiting factor in thrombin-enhanced experimental pulmonary metastasis of a murine melanoma cell line, demonstrating a potential role for PAR-1 in metastasis of melanoma (28Nierodzik M.L.

Furthermore, thrombin acts as a growth factor in human melanoma cells, which suggests that PAR-1 signaling is involved in the biological responses of these cells (29Fischer E.G. Ruf W. Mueller B.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1629-1632PubMed Google Scholar).PAR-1 expression has been reported to be up-regulated in the human metastatic melanoma cell line A375SM (30Even-Ram S.C. Maoz M. Pokroy E.

However, the mechanism for up-regulation of PAR-1 expression in malignant melanoma is unknown. The regulatory region of the PAR-1 gene has been cloned, and DNA sequence analysis indicates the presence of multiple putative AP-2 and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) regulatory elements at the proximal 3′ region of the promoter (31Li F.

Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The genomic organization of the promoter shares remarkable similarities with other AP-2 target genes, such as a G + C-rich sequence, lack of conventional TATA and CAAT sequences, and multiple AP-2-binding elements. Previously, it has been shown that Sp1 transactivates the PAR-1 promoter in human endothelial cells (33Wu Y. Ruef J. Rao G.N. Patterson C. Runge M.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PAR-1 expression is regulated by AP-2 and that loss of AP-2 may contribute to PAR-1 up-regulation in malignant melanoma.Here we provide further evidence that AP-2 is involved in the etiology of malignant human melanoma. We observed a direct correlation between the expression of PAR-1 and the metastatic potential of human melanoma cell lines. Thus, we demonstrated that an inverse correlation exists between the levels of expression of AP-2 and PAR-1 in human melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, we found that enforced expression of AP-2 in the human metastatic melanoma cell line WM266-4, which is AP-2-negative, resulted in decreased expression of PAR-1. In determining the mechanisms of PAR-1 gene regulation, we analyzed specific DNA elements of its promoter. The nuclear proteins AP-2 and Sp1 were found to bind to elements of the PAR-1 promoter both in vivo and in vitro. Analysis of the DNA-binding and protein expression of AP-2 and Sp1 in a panel of melanoma cell lines revealed a marked decrease in the ratio of AP-2 to Sp1 expression, which correlated with an overexpression of PAR-1 in metastatic melanoma cells. These results provide strong evidence for an additional mechanism by which loss of AP-2 expression and overexpression of PAR-1, contributes to the malignant phenotype of human melanoma.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human melanoma cell line WM266-4, purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), is tumorigenic and metastatic in nude mice (34Luca M. Xie S. Gutman M. Huang S. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1399-1402PubMed Google Scholar). The highly metastatic A375SM human melanoma cell line was established from pooled lung metastases produced by A375-P cells injected intravenously into nude mice (35Li L. Price J.E. Fan D. Zhang R.D. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The SB2 cell line was isolated from a primary human cutaneous melanoma and was a gift from Dr. B. Giovanella (St. Joseph's Hospital, Houston, TX). In nude mice, SB2 cells are poorly tumorigenic and are nonmetastatic (36Luca M.R. Bar-Eli M. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 1225-1231PubMed Google Scholar). The human melanoma MeWo cell line was established in culture from a lymph node metastasis of a melanoma patient and was kindly provided by Dr. S. Ferrone (New York Medical College, New York, NY). In nude mice, MeWo cells are tumorigenic and have low metastatic potential (37Ishikawa M. Dennis J.W. Man S. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar). The human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were provided by Dr. J. E. Price (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). MDA-MB-231 cells are highly tumorigenic when injected into the mammary fat pad and are metastatic in nude mice (38Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells require estradiol supplementation for growth in vivo and are tumorigenic when injected into the mammary fat pad. However, sites such as the lung rarely support growth of MCF-7 tumors (39White A.C. Levy J.A. McGrath C.M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 906-912PubMed Google Scholar). The melanoma and breast cancer cell lines were maintained as adherent monolayers in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as previously described (3Huang S. Jean D. Luca M. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4358-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The stably transfected cell lines were maintained in the same medium, which contained 0.5 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen).Preparation of Total and Nuclear Cell Extracts—For total extracts, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of Triton lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF). For nuclear extracts, the cells were incubated on ice in 400 μl of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors, and then they were lysed with a Dounce tissue grinder until over 80% of the nuclei were released, as determined by trypan blue staining. The cytoplasmic fraction was separated by centrifugation. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μlof 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 25% glycerol, 450 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. For both extracts, the soluble proteins in the lysates were separated by centrifugation. The protein content was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay.Antibodies—Antibodies to AP-2 (C18), Sp1 (PEP2), and Sp3 (D-20), which were used in Western blot and gel shift analyses, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody for β-actin was purchased from Sigma, and the monoclonal antibody for PAR-1 (WEDE15) was purchased from Immunotech-Coulter (Miami, FL). The polyclonal antibodies used in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay for AP-2 and Sp1 were obtained from Geneka Biotechnology, Inc. (Montreal, Canada).Western Blot Analysis—PAR-1, AP-2, Sp1, and β-actin were detected in cell extracts by Western blot, as previously described (3Huang S. Jean D. Luca M. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4358-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins of total cell extracts (40 μg) and nuclear extracts (20 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Billenica, MA). The membranes were washed in Tris-HCl-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl) and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then probed overnight in Tris-HCl-buffered saline with the relevant antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The EMSA probes consisted of annealed synthetic complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to bp –365 to –329 and bp –206 to –180 of the published PAR-1 promoter sequence (31Li F. Baykal D. Horaist C. Yan C.N. Carr B.N. Rao G.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26320-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides (20,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min on ice with 5 μg of nuclear extract in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). The binding reaction was incubated on ice for 30 min. Competition reactions were performed with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded AP-2 and Sp1 competitor DNA (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For supershift analysis, the nuclear extracts were incubated with polyclonal anti-human Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 antibodies for 1 h following the binding reaction with labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer.RNase Protection Assay—PAR-1 mRNA levels were analyzed by RNase protection assay using the RiboQuant multiprobe set (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 5 μg of RNA was hybridized overnight to the 32P-labeled RNA probe, which had been previously synthesized from the supplied template set (hAngio-1). Single-stranded RNA and the free probe were digested by RNase A and T1. Subsequently, protected RNA was isolated by phenol extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The PAR-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts were identified by the lengths of the respective fragments. For quantitation, the protected RNA was determined using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad), and PAR-1 values were expressed as a percentage of the mean values of GAPDH expressed for each cell line.ChIP—The ChIP assay was performed as described by Yan et al. (40Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde, followed by the addition of 0.125 m glycine. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were then sonicated with a sonic dismembrator (Fisher) at 30% maximum power for six 20-s pulses on ice. Cell lysates were diluted 10-fold in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Chromatin solutions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-AP-2 and anti-Sp1 antibodies. The immune complexes were then mixed with 60 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose slurry containing 20 μg of single-stranded DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The immune complexes were eluted by adding 250 μl of 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3 to the pelleted beads and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added, and the complexes were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using 20 μg of glycogen as a carrier. The precipitated DNA was then dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer and analyzed by PCR. PAR-1 primer sequences (5′-ACT TCT AGG CCC GGC AGT G-3′ and 5′-GGT AAG ATC AGG GTC CAA GC-3′) were used. The PCR was subjected to an initial denaturation step (2 min at 96 °C), followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), annealing (1 min at 60 °C), and extension (1 min at 72 °C). Then reaction was subjected to a final extension time of 5 min at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed on a 3% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—One microgram of total RNA was reverse-primed with an oligo(dT) primer and extended with Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR was performed, using the Clontech Advantage cDNA PCR kit, in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1× PCR buffer, 5 μl of cDNA, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. For quantitation of AP-2, cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers for human AP-2 (sense, 5′-CTG CCA ACG TTA CCC TGC-3′; antisense, 5′-TAG TTC TGC AGG GCC GTG-3′) and the housekeeping gene GAPDH (sense 5′-GAG CCA CAT CGC TCA GAC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTT CTC ATG GTT CAC ACC C-3′). AP-2 and GAPDH cDNAs were amplified by PCR in the same reaction mixture as follows: an initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 27 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. For PAR-1 quantitation, specific primers (5′-GCA GAG CCC GGG ACA ATG GGG-3′ and 5′-AGA TGG CCA GAC AAG TGA AGG-3′) were used. The PCR was carried out by an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 63 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final elongation step was carried out at 72 °C for 5 min.Expression Constructs—pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) is a mammalian cell expression construct in which expression is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter and provides neomycin resistance. The pcDNA3.1-AP-2 construct was used for stable and transient transfections and was created by cloning the AP-2 cDNA into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1. The pcDNA3.1-Sp1 construct that contained the cDNA encoding for Sp1 was used for transient transfections.Construction of PAR-1 Luciferase Plasmids—DNA from human melanoma WM266-4 cells was prepared with a Qiagen genomic tip system (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide upstream of the translation start site was numbered –1. The 1400-, 890-, and 500-bp genomic fragments upstream of the translation start site were generated by PCR from genomic DNA using the Qiagen PCR kit. The underlined restriction sites in each primer were added to the 5′ ends to facilitate subcloning. PCR was used to generate the 1400-bp product with primers complementary to the regulatory region of the PAR-1 gene (sense 5′-GGT ACC GCC AGT GGC AAA GCA ACT TA-3′ and antisense 5′-GCT AGC CTC TCT CCT GAC TTC TGC GG-3′). The 890-bp product of the PAR-1 promoter was generated with the following primers: sense, 5′-GGT ACC CGC TCT TCC TAT TCC ACT C-3′; antisense, 5′-GCT AGC CTC TCT CCT GAC TTC TGC GG-3′. Similarly, the 500-bp region of the PAR-1 promoter was generated with the primers sense 5′-GGT ACC CGG TCC CAT TCC AAG GAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GCT AGC CTC TCT CCT GAC TTC TGC GG-3′. The PCR products were subcloned in the promoterless pGL3 basic vector (Promega) and digested with NheI and KpnI, generating the constructs –1400/PAR1-Luc, –890/PAR1-Luc, and –500/PAR1-Luc. The constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis.Reporter Constructs—The 3×AP-2-Luc luciferase reporter construct contains three AP-2 consensus elements from the human metallothionein gene IIA ligated in front of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter, as previously described (3Huang S. Jean D. Luca M. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4358-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmid 3×SP1-Luc contains three consensus Sp1-binding sites from the SV40 promoter.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides (single-stranded sense and antisense) were used as primers to introduce mutations within the AP-2- and Sp1-binding elements between bp –365 and –329 of the PAR-1 promoter (mutated nucleotides are indicated by underlined letters): M1 sense, 5′-CCA GTA GGG CAG TTC GGT TCG GGG CGG GGC GCA CAG A-3′; M1 antisense, 5′-GCG CCC CGC CCC GAA CCG AAC TGC CCT ACT GG-3′; M2 sense, 5′-CCA GTA GGG CAG GGC GGT TCG GGG CTT GGC GCA CAG A-3′; M2 antisense, 5′-CTG TGC GCC AAG CCC CGA ACC GCC CTG CCC-3′; M3 sense, 5′-CCA GTA GGG CAG TTC GGG GCG GGG CTT GGC GCA CAG A-3′; M3 antisense, 5′-CTG TGC GCC AAG CCC CGC CCC GAA CTG CCC TAC TGG-3′; M4 sense, 5′-CCA GTA GGG CAG TTC GGT TCG GGG CTT GGC GCA CAG A-3′; M4 antisense, 5′-CTG TGC GCC AAG CCC CGA ACC GAA CTG CCC TAC TGG-3′. PCRs were performed with the wild-type –500/PAR1-Luc reporter vector as a template. The newly synthesized PCR products were digested with DpnI and used for transformation. The presence of mutations was verified by sequencing. Reporter vectors containing mutations were selected for large scale DNA preparations and used in transfection experimentsTransient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—The cells were grown in 12-well plates to 60% confluence for at least 18 h and then were transiently transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) with 1.5 μg of a firefly luciferase reporter gene and 50 ng of the Renilla luciferase reporter gene, driven by the β-actin promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). Cotransfection was performed by adding 1 μg of expression constructs to the DNA solutions. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a microplate Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Labsystems Inc., Franklin, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Normalization of transfection efficiency was based on cotransfected β-actin Renilla luciferase activities.Densitometric Quantitation—Images were captu"

Although these receptors directly interact with β-catenin and can sequester it away from its transcription factor partner T-cell factor, it is not known if this is the mechanism of trans-repression. Using several different promoter constructs and nuclear receptors and mammalian two-hybrid and mutation analyses we now show that interaction with the co-activator, p300, underlies the trans-repression of β-catenin signaling by nuclear receptors and their ligands. The signaling/oncogenic activity of β-catenin can be repressed by the activation of nuclear receptors such as the vitamin A, vitamin D, and androgen receptors.

By definition, the term chemoprevention refers to the treatment of individuals with premalignant lesions, individuals who are predisposed to the development of malignant lesions, and individuals early in the process of carcinogenesis, with the intention of preventing the later stages of carcinogenesis from developing (1Sporn M.B. Suh N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although chemopreventative agents such as vitamins A and D are often effective in this context there is no de facto reason to assume that the same treatment would not be effective in more advanced stages of carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, this is often not the case because many advanced cancers in vivo and de-differentiated carcinoma cells in vitro are refractory to the anti-tumor, growth inhibitory activities of vitamins A and D. Thus, not only do more malignant tumors and cells have defects in the expression and function of several molecules characteristic of differentiated epithelial cells; they are also less responsive to differentiating agents. An obvious question arises from this realization; what are the molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to vitamins A and D? In some cases, resistance is because of a defect in particular nuclear receptor isoforms. However, some cells, which are not growth-inhibited by vitamin A, express normal retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RARretinoic acid (RA) receptorRARERAR elementVDRvitamin D receptorARandrogen receptorLEFlymphoid enhancer factorTCFT-cell factor9cRA9-cis-retinoic acidRXRretinoid X receptorAP-1activator protein-1SRFserum response factor.1The abbreviations used are: RARretinoic acid (RA) receptorRARERAR elementVDRvitamin D receptorARandrogen receptorLEFlymphoid enhancer factorTCFT-cell factor9cRA9-cis-retinoic acidRXRretinoid X receptorAP-1activator protein-1SRFserum response factor./RXRs and retain the ability to up-regulate retinoid-sensitive genes (2Waliszewski P. Waliszewska M.K. Gupta M. Milsom J.W. Hurst R.E. J. Surg. Oncol. 1997; 66: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These data indicate that other molecules such as components of the cadherin/β-catenin-based signaling and adhesion system may also need for retinoic acid to exert its anti-proliferative effects (3Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shah S. Pishvaian M.J. Easwaran V. Brown P.H. Byers S.W. J. Biol.

In addition to its role in cell-cell adhesion β-catenin acts as a co-activator for the TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) family of transcription factors. Although it is possible that all of these receptors directly interact with β-catenin and sequester it away from TCF, it is not known if this is the mechanism of trans-repression. Nuclear receptors also trans-repress AP-1, serum response factor (SRF), and NFκB activity by a mechanism likely involving interaction with a common pool of co-activators rather than a direct interaction with transcription factors (6Guberman A.S.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6638-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in contrast to AP-1, high levels of β-catenin markedly potentiate RARE, vitamin D receptor element, and androgen receptor element reporter activity as well as the expression of retinoid-sensitive genes, a phenomenon that is not likely to be a result of co-activator competition (3Easwaran V.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar). Using several different promoter constructs and nuclear receptors, mammalian two-hybrid analyses, and other biochemical methods we now show that interaction with the histone acetyl transferase, p300, underlies the trans-repression of β-catenin signaling by nuclear receptors. Taken together these data suggest that the failure of retinoic acid to inhibit the growth of some colon cancer cells is because of defects in trans-repression of β-catenin/TCF activity in addition to or instead of a failure to trans-activate retinoid-sensitive genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Vectors encoding either wild type or a degradation-resistant mutant of β-catenin (S37A) have been described previously (10Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Wild type and dominant negative c-Fos and c-Jun vectors were provided by Dr. Charles Vinson (11Olive M. Krylov D. Echlin D.R. Gardner K. Taparowsky E. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18586-18594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Wild type E1A and its mutant forms are described in Hecht et al. (12Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. Van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TCF reporter (TOPFLASH) and mutated TCF reporter (FOPFLASH) were provided by Marc van de Wetering (13van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Louriero J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H. Cell. 1997; 88: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The mammalian two-hybrid system was used to assay protein-protein interactions in transfected cells. To construct the VP16/β-catenin fusion protein expression vector, full-length β-catenin from pcDNA-β-catenin-FLAG was cloned into pCMX-VP16 vector using 5′-GAGCTCGGATCCAGCCCGATCGGTACCT-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTGGATCCTTAGGCGTAGTCGGGGA-3′ as forward and reverse primers with BamHI sites at both ends. The PCR-amplified β-catenin fragment was cloned into pCMX-VP16 at the BamHI site. The orientation and reading frame of the resultant vector was confirmed by sequencing. To generate Gal4/β-catenin and Gal4/ARM-β-catenin expression vectors, we used PCR to amplify the full-length and armadillo repeat regions of β-catenin using 5′-GAGCTCGGATCCACGCCCGATCGGTACCT-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTGGATCCTTAGGCGTAGTCGGGGA-3′ and 5′-ATCCCGGGAAACTATCAAGATGATGCAGAA-3′ and 5′-ATGGATCCTTGTGGCTTGTCCTCAGACATT-3′ forward and reverse primers, respectively. Both full-length β-catenin with the BamHI site and the ARM region of β-catenin with SmaI and BamHI sites were cloned downstream of Gal4 DNA binding sequences of pCMX-GAL4 vector (both pCMX VP16 and GAL4 vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Evans). To clone full-length RARα into pCMX-Gal4 and pCMX-VP16, a standard PCR procedure was followed using 5′-ACTGTCTGGATCCCATTCTGACT-3′ as forward and 5′-GCTTTAATAAGATCTGGATCCG-3′ as reverse primers. All the newly constructed vectors were sequenced using appropriate primers to confirm the reading frame. In addition, all vectors received from collaborators were sequenced before use in the experiments.Cell Culture, Treatments, and Antibodies—SKBR3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), SW480 cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FBS, and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% horse serum. To study the effects of retinoic acid (RA) cells were treated with 1 μm 9-cis-RA or ethanol for 48 h. Several experiments were repeated using all-trans-retinoic acid with similar results. An anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Labs) (1:1000), RARα (1:500) and RARβ (1:500) antibodies (Oncogene Research Products) were used for Western blotting. All antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline.Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For luciferase assays cells were transfected with 50 ng of the expression vectors along with 100 ng of TCF reporter or control and mutated TCF reporter, and 10 ng of pCMV-Renilla luciferase (Promega). RA treatment was initiated 24 h post-transfection. Luciferase activity was monitored using the DUAL-luciferase assay system (Promega). The experimental reporter activity was controlled for transfection efficiency by comparison with the constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase. For mammalian two-hybrid analyses, Gal4-RARα and VP16-β-catenin were transiently transfected along with Renilla luciferase as an internal control.Western Blot Assays—The Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit was used to measure protein content in the samples. 25 μg of protein were separated on a 4-10% reducing polyacrylamide mini-gel (Novex), transferred onto nitrocellulose (Protran), and blocked overnight in 5% skim milk. The blot was then probed with an appropriate antibody followed by a secondary peroxidase-labeled antibody (KPL, Inc.), and the bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were then stripped at 50 °C for 30 min (stripping solution, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 1.7% (v/v) mercaptoethanol), washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in 5% milk before re-probing.RESULTSDifferential Response of β-Catenin/TCF and Retinoic Acid-responsive Promoters to Retinoic Acid in Colon Cancer Cells—In earlier studies we showed that β-catenin/TCF signaling activity could be inhibited by RA in Caco2 and HT29 colon cancer cells and in β-catenin-transfected SKBR3 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (3Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these cell lines respond to retinoic acid by decreased proliferation and increased activation of retinoic acid-sensitive genes and RARE reporters (14Nicke B. Kaiser A. Wiedenmann B. Riecken E.O. Rosewicz S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15O'Dwyer P.J. Ravikuma T.S. McCabe D.P. Steele Jr., G. J. Surg. Res. 1987; 43: 550-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, not all colon cancer cells respond to retinoic acid by decreasing growth even though RA-treatment continues to activate RARE reporters in these cells (2Waliszewski P. Waliszewska M.K. Gupta M. Milsom J.W. Hurst R.E. J. Surg. Oncol. 1997; 66: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We wanted to investigate whether the failure of these cells to respond to RA by decreased proliferation was associated with loss of trans-repression of β-catenin signaling. We chose three colon cancer cell lines that had previously been shown to be only modestly responsive (SW480) or unresponsive (SW620, HCT116) to the growth inhibitory effects of RA (2Waliszewski P. Waliszewska M.K. Gupta M. Milsom J.W. Hurst R.E. J. Surg. Oncol. 1997; 66: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Like Caco-2 and HT29 cells, SW480 and SW620 cells make large amounts of β-catenin protein as a result of a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC); HCT116 cells have normal APC but an activating mutation of β-catenin. We first confirmed that all these cells did activate a RARE reporter after treatment with RA (Fig. 1A). SW480 and Caco-2 cells were somewhat more responsive than SW620 and HCT116 cells even though all four cell lines express similar levels of RARα and RARβ (Fig. 1, A and B, and see Sicinski and Weinberg (16Sicinski P. Weinberg R.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). β-Catenin signaling (TCF reporter activity) was also unaffected by RA treatment in HCT116 and SW620 cells; however, a small but consistent response was observed in SW480 cells (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that the reduced ability of these cells to stop cell growth in response to RA is associated with the failure of RA to trans-repress β-catenin signaling.The Ability of RAR/RA to Trans-repress β-Catenin Signaling Is Not Associated with Changes in β-Catenin or TCF4 Protein Levels—We showed earlier that trans-repression of β-catenin signaling by RA does not depend upon changes in the levels of β-catenin protein or on the phosphorylation status of the N-terminal serine residues important for targeting for ubiquitination (4Shah S. Pishvaian M.J. Easwaran V. Brown P.H. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although Western analysis did not reveal any effect of RA on TCF4 levels (not shown), it is possible that RA might affect the activity or localization of TCF4 and indirectly regulate β-catenin signaling. In addition, dominant negative TCF4 stimulates the ability of β-catenin to potentiate the activity of RARE reporters (Fig. 1D) and vitamin D reporters (5Palmer H.G. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Espada J. Berciano M.T. Puig I. Baulida J. Quintanilla M. Cano A. de Herreros A.G. Lafarga M. Munoz A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of TCF4 does not affect the ability of RAR or RA to trans-repress β-catenin signaling (Fig. 1E). These data show that in SW480 cells, the ability of RAR/RA to transrepress β-catenin signaling is not associated with changes in β-catenin or TCF4 protein levels.The Promoters of the β-Catenin-regulated Genes Cyclin D1 and siamois Are Also Regulated by RA in an RAR-dependent Manner—We next investigated the effects of RA and retinoid receptors on the activity of the β-catenin-sensitive cyclin D1 and siamois gene promoters. In a previous study we showed that RA-regulation of a cyclin D1 promoter fragment (-163 bp) was mediated through its TCF site in SW480 cells (4Shah S. Pishvaian M.J. Easwaran V. Brown P.H. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study we used a much larger cyclin D1 promoter reporter (-1745 bp). We transfected SW480 cells with RARα and then treated them with RA. The expression of RARα alone significantly reduced the activity of the cyclin D1 and siamois promoters (Fig. 2) but did not affect the activity of cytomegalovirus-Renilla luciferase (not shown). It is interesting to note in Fig. 2 that the exogenous expression of RARα could decrease β-catenin signaling even in the absence of added RA. This is probably because of the small amount of endogenous RA present in serum, which is difficult to remove even after charcoal stripping. However, both promoters exhibited a dramatic increase in sensitivity to RA after transfection with RARα. In the presence of exogenous RARα, cyclin D1 reporter activity was reduced to background levels by RA treatment, and the siamois promoter only became retinoid-sensitive after transfection with RARα. As was the case with the cyclin D1 promoter, the ability of the siamois reporter to be trans-repressed by RA/RAR depended on the presence of its TCF sites (Fig 2D). These data confirm that the trans-repressive effects of RA on β-catenin signaling are dependent upon RAR and are mediated through TCF binding elements.Fig. 2RA effects on β-catenin/TCF-responsive promoter activity.A and B, SW480 cells were transiently transfected with wt RARα, RARα-Δ403, siamois promoter-luc, or TCF site-mutated siamois promoter constructs.

C and D, SW480 cells were transiently transfected with wild type RARα, RARα-Δ403, cyclin D1 promoter-luc (-1745-bp CD1), or TCF site-mutated cyclin D1 promoter-luc promoter constructs.

Like RAR these receptors directly interact with β-catenin and can sequester it away from TCF, but it is not known if this is the mechanism of trans-repression. Nuclear receptors also trans-repress AP-1, SRF, and NFκB activity by a mechanism likely involving competition for a common pool of co-activators rather than or as well as a direct interaction with Fos or Jun (18Benkoussa M. Brand C. Delmotte M.H. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4522-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Lee S.K. Jung S.Y. Kim Y.S. Na S.Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In view of these observations we examined whether nuclear receptor trans-repression of β-catenin signaling involves structures that are required for co-activator recruitment. In most nuclear receptors, full transcriptional activity depends upon regions at their N-(AF-1 domain, A/B) and C-terminal (AF-2) domains. Deletion of either domain has a profound effect on the ability of the RAR, VDR, and AR to activate target genes (20Slagsvold T. Kraus I. Bentzen T. Palvimo J. Saatcioglu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1603-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y.Y. Nguyen C. Peleg S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Bommer M.

We transfected cells with RARα, RARαΔA/B, RARαΔF-2, and RARΔ403, a naturally occurring oncogenic mutant missing 60 amino acids at the C terminus (Fig. 3A). Unlike RARα, expression of RARα, RARαΔA/B, RARαΔF-2, and RARΔ403 did not reduce β-catenin signaling measured by TCF reporter activity (Fig. 3B). In addition none of these RAR mutants supported the trans-repressive effects of RA; rather, when compared with RAR, all mutants hyperactivated β-catenin signaling (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using the β-catenin-responsive cyclin D1 and siamois reporters (Fig. 2 A and C). These data indicate that the ability of RARα to inhibit β-catenin signaling is associated with trans-activation in general and with the regions that recruit co-activators such as members of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family and p300 (23van Wely K.H. Molijn A.C. Buijs A. Meester-Smoor M.A. Aarnoudse A.J. Hellemons A. den Besten P. Grosveld G.C. Zwarthoff E.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, this explanation is also consistent with hyper-activation of β-catenin signaling by mutants of RARα. It is known that the all RARα mutants used in this study are able to hetero-dimerize with RXR, which means when RARα mutants are overexpressed they can sequester much of RXR in the cell and can deprive other nuclear receptors from the formation of dimers with the RXR. The impairment of nuclear receptor activation, due to a limited amount of RXR, could free up components of transcriptional machinery, which in turn might be available to augment the β-catenin signaling. Other experiments performed using the VDR and AR also showed trans-repression of β-catenin signaling (Fig. 3, C and D). In these experiments the full-length receptor trans-repressed β-catenin signaling; however, the deletion of AF2 from VDR and A/B from AR completely impaired the trans-repression ability of these receptors. Taken together these data strongly indicate that the ability of nuclear receptors to bind co-activators and/or co-repressors is necessary for their effects on β-catenin signaling.Fig. 3Effects of nuclear receptor transactivation domains on β-catenin signaling in SW480 cells.A, schematic representation of the RARα constructs. WT, wild type. B, 50 ng of the indicated RARα constructs were transfected either with or without RA (10-6m). TCF reporter activity was measured as described above. C, control.

Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after treatment with the androgen receptor ligand, R1881.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RA-mediated Trans-repression of the Cyclin D1 Promoter Is Mediated via Changes in β-Catenin/TCF, Not AP-1, in Colon Cancer Cells—We showed recently that the trans-repressive effects of RA on a short fragment of the cyclin D1 promoter (-163-bp CD1) expressed in SW480 colon cancer cells required the presence of a TCF binding element (4Shah S. Pishvaian M.J. Easwaran V. Brown P.H. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, RA trans-repression of the same promoter expressed in SKBR3 breast cancer cells was independent of the TCF site. This promoter fragment contains adjacent AP-1 and TCF sites, and we reasoned that RA-mediated trans-repression of its activity was mediated by β-catenin/TCF in colon cancer cells, which have high levels of β-catenin signaling activity, and by the AP-1 site in SKBR3 cells, which have high AP-1 activity (4Shah S. Pishvaian M.J. Easwaran V. Brown P.H. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the basal activity of -163-bp CD1 was also markedly inhibited by mutation of the TCF site in SW480 cells but not in SKBR3 cells. To study this further we used another cyclin D1 promoter (-1745-bp CD1), which contains many potential regulatory elements including several AP-1 sites. The basal activity of -1745-bp CD1 is less dependent on the TCF site (Fig. 4). Expression of a dominant negative form of fos (to inhibit AP-1) actually increased the basal activity of -1745-bp CD1 but markedly reduced the basal activity of -1745-bp CD1ΔTCF. This experiment indicates that in the absence of TCF binding, the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter is regulated by AP-1. Nevertheless, like -163-bp D1, the ability of RA and RAR to trans-repress the activity of -1745-bp CD1 in SW480 cells depends on the TCF site.Fig. 4Role of AP-1 in RA-mediated trans-repression of cyclin D1 reporter.A, SW480 cells were transiently transfected with RARα, and dominant negative AP-1 (dnAP-1), and CD1-luciferase reporter activity was measure in the absence (-) and in the presence (+) of RA.

If interaction with a common co-activator is involved in the mechanism of trans-repression one would expect that the co-activator recruitment N- and/or C-terminal domains of β-catenin would also be necessary for trans-repression to occur. Other studies have demonstrated that β-catenin can activate heterologous promoters such as Gal-4 if it is fused to the appropriate DNA binding domain. However no studies have investigated whether the trans-repressive effects of nuclear receptor ligands can occur in this situation. To test this we made various β-catenin-Gal-4 fusion constructs and expressed them in 293 cells (Fig. 5). We first confirmed that 293 cells made RARs and were responsive to both the trans-repressor and trans-activation functions of RA in the context of TCF- and RARE-reporter activity (Fig. 5A). 293 cells make significant amounts of RARα and RARβ (Fig. 5B). Wild type, N-terminal-deleted, C-terminal-deleted and N- and C-terminal-deleted β-catenin were cloned in a Gal4 expression vector, and wild type LEF and ΔNLEF, which cannot bind β-catenin, were cloned in a VP16 expression vector (Fig. 5C). The ability of each of the β-catenin-Gal4 constructs to bind either VP16-LEF or VP16-ΔNLEF and activate the Gal4-promoter is demonstrated in Fig. 5D. We next tested the affects of RA/RAR on the ability of the various β-catenin-Gal4 fusion proteins to activate the Gal4 promoter (Fig. 6). The trans-repressive effects of RA/RAR on wild type β-catenin-Gal4 activation of the Gal-4 promoter was similar to that observed with TCF reporter (cf.Fig. 1C with Fig. 6A). Similarly, RARΔAF-2 hyperactivated β-catenin-Gal4 activation of the Gal-4 promoter and completely prevented RA-mediated trans-repression. These data show that RA/RAR effects on β-catenin signaling activity can be exerted on a heterologous promoter and confirm that neither TCF nor TCF binding elements are required for the trans-repressive effects of RA. Deletion of the N-terminal of β-catenin-Gal4 only reduced basal activity of the Gal4 promoter by ∼50% but completely abrogated response to RA/RAR (Fig. 6A). In contrast to β-catenin-Gal4, RARΔAF-2 did not hyperactivate N-terminal-deleted β-catenin-Gal4. Deletion of the C-terminal of β-catenin-Gal4 reduced basal activity of the Gal4 promoter by ∼80%, but this activity could be further reduced by the addition of RA/RAR (Fig. 6B). Although the degree of trans-repression was small (20-50%), it was consistently observed. In contrast to ΔN-β-catenin-Gal4, RARΔAF-2 potentiated the activity of ΔC-β-catenin-Gal4. Deletion of both the N and C termini of β-catenin-Gal4 (ARM-β-catenin Gal4) also reduced basal activity of the Gal4 promoter by ∼80% compared with wild type β-catenin. Although the basal activity of ARM-β-catenin-Gal4 was similar to the ΔC-β-catenin-Gal4, it was not trans-repressed by RA/RAR and was not hyperactivated by RARΔAF-2. Taken together these data show that although both N- and C-terminal regulatory domains of β-catenin-Gal4 are required, for full trans-activation of the Gal4 promoter and for the trans-repressive effects of RA/RAR, the N-terminal region is absolutely essential.Fig. 5Mammalian two-hybrid assays for protein-protein interactions.A, to perform mammalian two hybrid assay in 293 cells, we measured TCF and RARE reporter activity.

Cholesterol-loaded microsomes from transfected cells containing either ACAT1 or ACAT2 exhibited significantly more ACAT activity than their sitosterol-loaded counterparts. In sitosterol-loaded microsomes, both ACAT1 and ACAT2 were able to esterify sitosterol albeit with lower efficiencies than cholesterol. The mass ratios of cholesterol ester to sitosterol ester formed by ACAT1 and ACAT2 were 1.6 and 7.2, respectively. Compared with ACAT1, ACAT2 selectively esterified cholesterol even when sitosterol was loaded into the microsomes. To further characterize the difference in sterol specificity, ACAT1 and ACAT2 were compared in intact cells loaded with either cholesterol or sitosterol. Despite a lower level of ACAT activity, the ACAT1-expressing cells esterified 4-fold more sitosterol than the ACAT2 cells. The data showed that compared with ACAT1, ACAT2 displayed significantly greater selectively for cholesterol compared with sitosterol. The plasma cholesterol esterification enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase was also compared. With recombinant high density lipoprotein particles, the esterification rate of cholesterol by LCAT was only 15% greater than for sitosterol. Thus, LCAT was able to efficiently esterify both cholesterol and sitosterol. In contrast, ACAT2 demonstrated a strong preference for cholesterol rather than sitosterol.

On an average day, humans will consume 300–500 mg of dietary cholesterol and through the action of the small intestine will absorb 40–50% of this sterol (1Wilson M.D. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 943-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to cholesterol, 250–500 mg of plant and shellfish-derived sterols can be ingested daily and, depending upon their chemical structure, will be differentially absorbed by the intestine (2Heinemann T.

The most abundant of the dietary non-cholesterol sterols is sitosterol, which comes from plant and vegetable products. Even though sitosterol only differs from cholesterol by the presence of an ethyl group at the C-24 position of the side chain, the intestine will absorb only 5% of the sitosterol consumed on a daily basis (2Heinemann T.

The ATP binding cassette transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8, are one set of proteins that are essential in intestinal sterol sorting and absorption. Loss of function mutations in both alleles encoding either ABCG5 or ABCG8 results in sitosterolemia, a disorder in which sitosterol and all other dietary sterols are hyperabsorbed (6Berge K.E.

However, in many of the previous studies, the expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the experimental models should have limited, although to an unknown extent, the access of sitosterol to ACAT2. Moreover, several of the in vitro systems likely contained not only ACAT2 but also ACAT1. Therefore, in the current study, the ability of ACAT2 to esterify sitosterol was tested in AC29 cells expressing ACAT2 exclusively but not ABCG5 and ABCG8. AC29 cells expressing only ACAT1 were compared to ascertain whether ACAT1 and ACAT2 differ in their specificity toward sitosterol. Finally, it has been reported that 60–70% of the sitosterol in the plasma of patients with sitosterolemia is esterified (18Salen G. Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Horak I. Shore V.

[1-14C]Oleic acid (52.00 mCi/mmol) and unlabeled oleic acid were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Sigma, respectively. Isolation of Microsomes from ACAT1 and ACAT 2 Cells—AC29 cells stably transfected with African green monkey ACAT1 or ACAT2 (9Lee R.G. Willingham M.C. Davis M.A. Skinner K.A. Rudel L.L. J.

Upon reaching confluency, the cells were washed with balanced salt solution, scraped from the plates, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were resuspended in ACAT homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m K2HPO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and were lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a 13 × 51-mm polycarbonate tube (Beckman) and was centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C in a SW55Ti rotor. After removing the supernatant, the microsomal pellet was resuspended in ACAT reaction buffer (0.1 m K2HPO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The microsomal suspension was stored at –80 °C until used. Solubilization of Cholesterol or Sitosterol in a Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin Solution—A 308 mm hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) (Aldrich) solution was created by dissolving CD in distilled H2O. Into a 16 × 100-mm glass tube containing 5 ml of CD solution was placed either 8 mg of free cholesterol (NU Chek) or 10 mg sitosterol (ICN). To facilitate the solubilization of the sterol, the solutions were incubated at 60 °C and periodically vortexed. In addition, the sitosterol-containing solution was sonicated. After cooling to room temperature, the solutions were passed through a syringe filter with a 0.45-μm HT Tuffryn membrane (Gelman) and stored at 4 °C in 16 × 100-mm glass tubes. Using the Cholesterol/HP kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp.), the sterol concentrations of the cholesterol and sitosterol solutions were determined to be 4.9 and 4.6 nmol/μl, respectively. The molar ratios of CD to sterol for the cholesterol and sitosterol solutions were ∼63 and 67, respectively. ACAT Activity in Microsomes Loaded with Cholesterol or Sitosterol— [7(n)-3H]Cholesterol (Amersham Biosciences) in toluene or [22,23-3H]sitosterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in ethanol was dried in a 16 × 100-mm glass tube under N2 gas. The radiolabeled sterol was redissolved in ethanol and subsequently mixed with ACAT reaction buffer containing fatty acid-free human serum albumin (Miles). This solution was placed into a 16 × 100-mm glass tube containing either 100 μg of ACAT1 or 50 μg of ACAT2 microsomes. Cholesterol-CD, sitosterol-CD, or distilled H2O was added to the tube such that the final concentration of the exogenous sterol was 0.5 nmol/μg microsomal protein. The final volumes for the ACAT1 and ACAT2 reactions were 300 and 150 μl, respectively, whereas the final concentration of human serum albumin was 3.3 mg/ml, ethanol was 1.3% (v/v), and [3H]sterol was 1400–3000 dpm/μl. The tube containing the ACAT reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min in a shaking water bath set at 37 °C. After adding 30 nmol of [1-14C]oleoyl CoA (7885 dpm/nmol) (Amersham Biosciences), the tube was vortexed and placed back into the water bath for 5 min. To terminate the ACAT reaction, 6 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) was added to the tube. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, 1.2 ml of 0.88% KCl was added to the tube, and the phases were allowed to separate overnight at room temperature. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min, the upper, aqueous phase was aspirated from the tube, and 3 ml of the lower, organic phase was removed and dried at 60 °C under N2 gas. The lipid was resuspended in CHCl3 containing 1 mg/ml free cholesterol and 1 mg/ml cholesteryl oleate, was applied to a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate (EM Science), and was separated using 70:30:1 hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid as the running solvent. The separated lipids were visualized using I2 vapor, and the FC and CE bands were scraped from the plate into scintillation vials. To the vials was added 4 ml of Bio-Safe II scintillation fluid (Research Products International). The free sterol band was subjected to scintillation counting to determine [3H]sterol content, and the CE band was counted for both [14C]steryl ester and [3H]steryl ester content. To determine the specific activity of the [3H]cholesterol and [3H]sitosterol in the microsomes, ACAT1 and ACAT2 microsomes were sterol-loaded as described above. After the incubation at 37 °C, the microsomes were transferred to a 13 × 51-mm polycarbonate tube and were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor for 10 min at 20 °C. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was washed three times with saline (0.9% NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and was then resuspended in 1% SDS, 0.1 n NaOH. The protein concentration of the sample was determined by modified Lowry assay, and the [3H]sterol content was determined by scintillation counting. In addition, a Bligh-Dyer extraction was carried out on the microsomal lysates in the presence of 10 μg of 5 α-cholestane as an internal standard. Analysis of the extracted free sterol was conducted by injecting the sample on a ZB50 (0.53-mm inner diameter × 15 m × 1 μm) gas-liquid chromatography column (Phenomenex) at 250 °C and installed in a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 7673A automatic injector using on-column injection and a flame ionization detector. Esterification by ACAT1 or ACAT2 Cells of Cholesterol or Sitosterol Delivered by Cyclodextrin—On day 0, 0.75 × 106 ACAT1 or ACAT2 cells were seeded into a 6-well cluster (Costar) containing Medium A. On day 1, [3H]cholesterol (10–20 μCi) and [3H]sitosterol (25–50 μCi) were dried in glass vials to which were then added cholesterol-CD and sitosterol-CD, respectively. On day 2, the cholesterol-CD and sitosterol-CD was added to pre-heated medium A (37 °C) such that the final concentration of the CD was 2 mm, and the exogenous sterol was ∼30 nmol/ml. After allowing the medium plus sterol-CD to incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, the medium was passed through a sterile syringe filter with a 0.22-μm polyvinylidene difluoride Durpore membrane (Millipore). The specific activity of the [3H]sterol in the filtered medium was calculated by determining [3H]sterol concentration via scintillation spectroscopy and the sterol concentration by gas-liquid chromatography as described above. In addition, on day 2, the ACAT1 and ACAT2 cells were exposed to 1 ml of the filtered sterol-CD-containing medium or Medium A alone. After incubation at 37 °C for 22 h, 10 μlof[14C]oleate/albumin (17.1 mm oleate, 13935 dpm/nmol) or 10.5 μl of [14C]oleate/albumin (16.3 mm oleate, 1458 dpm/nmol) was added to each well containing the ACAT1 or ACAT2 cells, respectively. Following incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the cells were washed with balanced salt solution, lysed with 0.1 N NaOH, and homogenized by shearing through a 28-gauge needle. An aliquot of cell lysate was placed into a 16 × 100-mm glass tube, and the cellular lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described above. The protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined using a modified Lowry assay. In addition, an aliquot of cell lysate was Bligh-Dyer extracted in the presence of 20.6 μg of 5 α-cholestane. The isolated lipid was analyzed for free sterol mass by gasliquid chromatography as described above. The lipid sample was then saponified, and the non-saponifiable sterol was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography for total sterol mass. The difference between free and total sterol was multiplied by 1.67 to calculate the steryl ester mass. Creation of POPC:apoA-I Recombinant HDL Particles Containing Cholesterol or Sitosterol—POPC:cholesterol (or sitosterol):human apoA-I recombinant HDL particles with a 80:5:1 molar ratio were created as described previously (20Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A slightly modified protocol was used to make recombinant HDL with an 80:15:1 molar ratio. Briefly, into a 50-ml Pyrex tube was placed 13 mg of POPC (Sigma) and either 1.24 mg of cholesterol or 1.33 mg of sitosterol (all lipids were dissolved in CHCl3 at 1 mg/ml). In addition, 65 μCi of [3H]cholesterol or 100 μCi of [3H]sitosterol was added to the appropriate tube. After evaporating the CHCl3 under N2 at 60 °C, the tube was covered with parafilm, and its contents were lyophilized for 2 h. To the tube was added 118 μl of sodium cholate (312 mg/ml) and 600 μl of disc buffer (10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), which created a 5:1 molar ratio of sodium cholate:POPC. After vortexing the tube, it was flushed with argon and placed in a 37 °C shaking water bath for 20 min. To the tube was added 2.9 ml of human apoA-I (2.084 mg/ml) and 400 μl of 10× disc buffer. The tube was vortexed, flushed with argon, and placed in a 37 °C shaking water bath for 30 min. The recombinant HDL particles were dialyzed six times against 1 liter of argon purged disc buffer. The protein concentration of the HDL was determined by modified Lowry assay, and the sterol concentration was determined using the Cholesterol/HP reagent. To determine the diameters of the recombinant HDL, a volume of HDL containing 5 μg of apoA-I was diluted with 5× loading buffer (0.1% bromphenol blue, 40% sucrose). The HDL particles along with high molecular weight calibration proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were separated on a 4–30% non-denaturing gradient gel. After a pre-run at 125 V for 30 min, the samples were loaded onto the gel and run at 70 V for 20 min and then at 150 V for 20 h. The gel was washed for 5 min with water, and the apoA-I on the HDL was visualized using GelCode blue stain reagent (Pierce). Assay of LCAT Esterification of Cholesterol or Sitosterol—Using an established protocol, an exogenous LCAT assay was conducted using purified His-tagged human LCAT and the POPC:cholesterol (or sitosterol):human apoA-I recombinant HDL (21Parks J.S. Gebre A.K. Furbee J.W. Doolittle M. Reue K. Lipase and Phospholipase Protocols. Humana Press, Totawa, NJ1999: 123-131Google Scholar, 22Chisholm J.W. Gebre A.K. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1512-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one assay utilizing only the 80:5:1 recombinant particles, 3 nmol of HDL sterol was present in each reaction. In a second assay, employing both the 80:5:1 and 80:15:1 recombinant HDL, each reaction contained 17.5 μg of HDL apoA-I and the following amount of sterol: 80:5:1 HDL, 3.4 nmol of cholesterol, and 2.9 nmol of sitosterol; 80:15:1 HDL, 9.5 nmol of cholesterol, and 8.6 nmol of sitosterol. Statistical Evaluations—Using the StatView statistical package (version 5.0.1; SAS Institute Incorporate), statistically significant differences were determined by either unpaired t test or ANOVA with post hoc analysis by Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Statistical significance was considered at p ≤ 0.05. Statistically significant differences among the analyzed values are denoted by different letters. Esterification of Sitosterol by ACAT1 or ACAT2 in Microsomes—To determine whether ACAT1 and ACAT2 differ in their ability to esterify sitosterol, AC29 cells stably expressing African green monkey ACAT1 or ACAT2 were employed (9Lee R.G. Willingham M.C. Davis M.A. Skinner K.A. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1991-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cell lines have no endogenous ACAT protein expression or activity (23Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and their use allows ACAT1 and ACAT2 to be studied separately. For the initial experiments, microsomes isolated from the ACAT1 and ACAT2 cells were incubated with cholesterol or sitosterol solubilized in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin compared with buffer alone. The sterol concentrations in the microsomes are shown in Table I. When exposed to buffer alone, the cholesterol concentration of ACAT2 microsomes was consistently 15% lower than that in ACAT1 microsomes. Following exposure to cholesterol-cyclodextrin, the cholesterol concentration was increased to a similar extent in both ACAT1 and ACAT2 microsomes. In addition, the total sterol concentration was raised to an equivalent extent when sitosterol-loaded and cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin was used. In the former case, sitosterol represented the major sterol whereas the concentration of cholesterol was actually decreased significantly (about 15 to 20%) from control levels.Table ISterol content of ACAT1-and ACAT2-containing microsomes after loading with cholesterol or sitosterolMicrosome typeIncubation conditionsnmol cholesterol/mg proteinnmol sitosterol/mg proteinnmol total sterol/mg proteinACAT1Buffer only#201 (10)a201ACAT1Cholesterol-CD#452 (20)b452ACAT1Sitosterol-CD*169 (4)c289 (7)458ACAT2Buffer only#168 (6)c168ACAT2Cholesterol-CD#443 (16)b443ACAT2Sitosterol-CD+131 (3)d304 (9)435 Open table in a new tab The total ACAT activity in the microsomes was measured by incorporation of [14C]oleoyl CoA into [14C]steryl ester (Fig. 1). For ACAT1 microsomes, pre-incubation with cholesterol-cyclodextrin increased the activity ∼5-fold (0.18 versus 0.87 nmol/min·mg protein). The microsomes pre-incubated with sitosterol-cyclodextrin showed a doubling of ACAT1 activity even though the cholesterol concentration was decreased from 201 to 169 nmol/mg protein. For ACAT2 microsomes, pre-incubation with cholesterol-cyclodextrin increased the activity almost 39-fold (0.68 to 26.4 nmol/min·mg protein). Following enrichment of the membrane with sitosterol, the ACAT2 activity was increased by over 6-fold (0.68 to 4.65 nmol/min·mg protein), despite the fact that the microsomal cholesterol concentration was decreased from 168 to 131 nmol/mg protein. Compared with the ACAT1 microsomes with comparable sterol concentrations, the ACAT2 microsomes consistently displayed significantly higher activity; 4-fold with buffer only (0.18 versus 0.68 nmol/min·mg protein), 30-fold with cholesterol-cyclodextrin (0.87 versus 26.4 nmol/min·mg protein), and 12-fold with sitosterol-cyclodextrin (0.40 versus 4.65 nmol/min·mg protein). Higher ACAT2 activity in transfected cell lines has been a consistent observation. For comparison, sitosterol and cholesterol loaded microsomes were then incubated with tracer amounts of [3H]cholesterol or [3H]sitosterol. The inclusion of the radiolabeled sterols allowed direct assessment of the esterification efficiency of both sterols. For ACAT1 microsomes, the results were similar to those seen with the [14C]oleoyl CoA substrate (Fig. 2A). In the buffer control microsomes, the rate of [3H]cholesteryl ester formation was 2.6-fold less than the rate in microsomes loaded with cholesterol (0.49 versus 1.28 nmol/min·mg protein). After loading the microsomes with sitosterol, the esterification rates of cholesterol and sitosterol were 0.29 and 0.18 nmol/min·mg protein, so that the total sterol esterification rate of 0.47 nmol/min·mg protein was essentially equivalent to that in the nonloaded state. For the ACAT2 microsomes, the activities were again much higher than was seen with the ACAT1 microsomes, a difference similar to what was observed when [14C]oleoyl CoA was used as substrate (Fig. 2B). The rate of [3H]cholesterol esterification was some 18-fold higher in cholesterol-loaded microsomes compared with the buffer-treated control (36.5 versus 1.97 nmol/min·mg protein). When the ACAT2 microsomes were loaded with sitosterol, the total esterification rate was 5.38 nmol/min·mg protein, with only 0.66 nmol/min·mg protein of [3H]sitosteryl ester formation included in this number whereas the remainder, 4.72 nmol/min·mg protein, was [3H]cholesteryl ester formation. The data showed that when loaded into microsomes, sitosterol was esterified by both ACAT1 and ACAT2, albeit at a reduced efficiency compared with cholesterol (Fig. 2). In addition, the two ACATs in sitosterol-loaded microsomes displayed differing sterol substrate specificities. Although the rate of [3H]sitosteryl ester formation by ACAT2 microsomes was higher overall than for ACAT1 microsomes (0.66 versus 0.18 nmol/min·mg), the ratio of cholesterol to sitosterol products must be the benchmark for interpretation because of the much higher ACAT2 activities achieved in transfected cell lines. The ratio of cholesteryl ester to sitosteryl ester formed by ACAT1 and ACAT2 was 1.6 and 7.2, respectively (Fig. 2). In other words, the efficiency of ACAT1 for cholesterol esterification was modestly greater than for sitosterol esterification. In contrast, ACAT2 showed a much higher efficiency for esterification of cholesterol compared with sitosterol. The results demonstrate that ACAT1 and ACAT2 have distinctly different preferences for individual sterol substrates. Esterification of Sitosterol by ACAT1 and ACAT2 Expressed in Intact Cells—After finding that ACAT1 and ACAT2 in microsomes varied in their capacity to esterify sitosterol, the sterol specificity of the enzymes was studied in intact cells. To facilitate sterol loading of the cells, serum containing tissue culture medium (complete medium) was supplemented with cholesterol-cyclodextrin or sitosterol-cyclodextrin and trace amounts of [3H]cholesterol or [3H]sitosterol. The medium was placed onto the ACAT1 and ACAT2 cells for 24 h, and during the last 2 h of the incubation, the cells were pulsed with [14C]oleate conjugated to albumin. As determined by [14C]oleate incorporation into [14C]steryl ester (Fig. 3), the ACAT activities of ACAT1 cells exposed to complete medium plus or minus sterol-cyclodextrin were similar (∼5.5 nmol/h·mg protein). ACAT2 cells incubated with sitosterol-cyclodextrin had the highest activity (12 nmol/h·mg protein) whereas ACAT2 cells exposed to complete medium or cholesterol-cyclodextrin had significantly lower activities (10 and 8.8 nmol/h·mg protein). These results showed that ACAT2 cells consistently had more ACAT activity than ACAT1 cells and that incubation of cells with sitosterol-cyclodextrin significantly increased ACAT2 activity. At the same time, the sterol mass of the ACAT1 and ACAT2 cells was determined (Table II). ACAT1 cells treated with complete medium or sitosterol-cyclodextrin had similar free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester contents (73.0 versus 75.1 nmol FC/mg protein and 280 versus 275 nmol CE/mg protein) whereas the cells exposed to cholesterol-cyclodextrin showed a significant increase in free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester mass (89.5 nmol FC/mg protein and 325 nmol CE/mg protein).

Compartmentalization may be a homeostatic mechanism for isolating these biological reactants in cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we have undertaken a genetic analysis of the interaction between iron and oxygen metabolism in Drosophila. We show that Drosophila iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) registers cytosolic iron and oxidative stress through its labile iron sulfur cluster by switching between cytosolic aconitase and RNA-binding functions. IRP1 is strongly activated by silencing and genetic mutation of the cytosolic superoxide dismutase (Sod1), but is unaffected by silencing of mitochondrial Sod2. Conversely, mitochondrial aconitase activity is relatively insensitive to loss of Sod1 function, but drops dramatically if Sod2 activity is impaired. This strongly suggests that the mitochondrial boundary limits the range of superoxide reactivity in vivo. We also find that exposure of adults to paraquat converts cytosolic aconitase to IRP1 but has no affect on mitochondrial aconitase, indicating that paraquat generates superoxide in the cytosol but not in mitochondria. Accordingly, we find that transgene-mediated overexpression of Sod2 neither enhances paraquat resistance in Sod1+ flies nor compensates for lack of SOD1 activity in Sod1-null mutants. We conclude that in vivo, superoxide is confined to the subcellular compartment in which it is formed, and that the mitochondrial and cytosolic SODs provide independent protection to compartment-specific protein iron-sulfur clusters against attack by superoxide generated under oxidative stress within those compartments.

Iron and oxygen are indispensable but potentially harmful elements of aerobic life. Individually, their reactivity has been harnessed through association with a variety of proteins and the regulation of iron and oxygen metabolism constitutes one of the major triumphs of molecular evolution (1Rouault T.

The stability and functionality of IRP1 as a translation regulator is affected not only by iron levels, but also by oxidative stress, which induces IRP1 to bind iron responsive elements (IREs) located on the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of target genes (4Rouault T.A.

In addition to its function in the cytosol, SOD1 localizes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and appears to also contribute to mitochondrial superoxide scavenging (14Sturtz L.A. Diekert K.

Moreover, only recombinant bacterial FeSOD that is targeted to yeast mitochondria can rescue Sod2Δ, but it cannot rescue Sod2Δ if the mitochondrial targeting sequence is omitted and FeSOD is expressed in cytosol (17Balzan R.

RNA Mobility Shift Assay—Whole flies or cell pellets were homogenized directly in band shift buffer (40 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Extracts were centrifuged twice at >16000 × g on a bench-top centrifuge (4 °C), and the supernatant was immediately used for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Ten μg of total protein were added to a final volume of 12.5 μl of band shift buffer with or without 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, which activates IRP1 in vitro. The samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 12.5 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 units/μl Super RNAsine, 2 μg/μl yeast tRNA, 200 μm dithiothreitol, and 32P-labeled IRE from the human ferritin H chain gene (2000 counts/μl). Twenty μl of the reaction mixture were loaded onto a 10% acrylamide/Tris borate EDTA (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 gel, run at 200 V for 2 h, then the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. A single band was observed, which could be competed out by addition of 10-fold excess of cold IRE probe (data not shown). Aconitase Activity Assay—Mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activities were assayed jointly in whole-fly extracts after electrophoretic separation. Thirty adult males were homogenized in 120 μl of extraction buffer (0.6 mm MnCl2, 2 mm citric acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g. Aliquots were electrophoresed on Sepraphore III membranes (Pall). Aconitase activity was detected chromogenically by incubating the membrane in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm NADPH, 2 mmcis-aconitic acid, 1.2 mm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, 0.3 mm phenazine methosulfate, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 units/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. SOD2 Activity Assay—Adult males, 24–72 h old, were homogenized in buffer-1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA). The extract was sonicated for 10 s to rupture mitochondria and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated in 60 mm diethyldithiocarbamic acid for 1 h at room temperature to inactivate SOD1. SOD2 activity was then determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the autooxidation of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HD) at 490 nm and 37 °C in 500 μl buffer-1 containing 0.1 mm 6-HD (32Heikkila R.E. Cabbat F. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Paraquat Exposure—w1 or w1;UAS-Sod2/+;daG32Gal4/+ adult males were exposed to 0, 5, or 10 mm paraquat in 1% sucrose (Sigma) for 16 or 48 h. No lethality was observed at 16 h, when paraquat-exposed w1 flies were removed for aconitase and RNA mobility shift assays. Lifespan Measurements—Adult males were collected 1 day after eclosion, kept in groups of 10 per vial, and transferred to fresh food every second or third day. Drosophila Cells Interconvert IRP1 and Cytosolic Aconitase in Response to Iron—Drosophila melanogaster expresses two IRP1 homologues with 86% identity that are co-expressed during development (33Muckenthaler M. Gunkel N. Frishman D. Cyrklaff A. Tomancak P. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These IRP1 homologues can bind to iron responsive elements of succinate dehydrogenase B (34Kohler S.A. Henderson B.R. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30781-39786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and ferritin 1 heavy chain homologue (35Lind M.I. Ekengren S. Melefors O. Soderhall K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and, in this respect, are more similar to mammalian IRP1s than to the recently described Caenorhabditis elegans homologue (36Gourley B.L. Parker S.B. Jones B.J. Zumbrennen K.B. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3227-3234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We asked if conservation of this molecular interaction functionally extends to iron-dependent regulation of Drosophila IRP1 by performing RNA mobility shift assays on extracts of Drosophila Schneider-II cells cultured with varying concentrations of iron. Fig. 1 shows that chelation of iron by deferoxamine greatly enhances binding of IRP1 to radiolabelled IRE. In contrast, addition of ferric ammonium citrate, which reconstitutes the [4Fe-4S] cluster, converts IRP1 to its aconitase form. This assay does not discriminate between the two Drosophila IRP1 proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that the [4Fe-4S] cluster switch that mediates the functional interconversion between a translational regulator and a cytosolic aconitase in response to iron levels is evolutionarily conserved between Drosophila and mammals. IRP1 Binding Activity Is Enhanced in the Absence of SOD1— To determine whether cytosolic O2·¯ specifically reacts with the [4Fe-4S] cluster of IRP1, we used a Drosophila-null mutant for the cytosolic Sod1 (25Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) to generate a cytoplasmic environment of high constitutive oxidative stress. We predicted that this cytosolic environment would promote the enhanced binding of IRP1 to IRE through the O2·¯-mediated loss of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of IRP1 holoprotein. Indeed, extracts of flies lacking cytosolic Sod1 activity show markedly increased IRP1 binding activity in comparison to Sod1+ controls with an otherwise identical genetic background (Fig. 2A). IRP1 Binding Is Activated by Genetic Diminution of SOD1, but Not SOD2—We then asked whether O2·¯ that originates in mitochondria will react with IRP1 localized in the cytoplasm. As for other eukaryotes, Drosophila possess a form of SOD (SOD2) that is confined to mitochondria (30Duttaroy A. Parkes T. Emtage P. Kirby K. Boulianne G.L. Wang X. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, because no Sod2 mutant has been reported that could be used to create a mitochondrial environment of high oxidative stress, we utilized transgenic strains developed earlier in this laboratory that silence Sod2 by means of RNAi (27Kirby K. Hu J. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16162-16167Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For controls, we generated strains with transgenically silenced Sod1. 3J. Hu, K. Kirby, A. J. Hilliker, and J. P. Phillips, manuscript in preparation. If O2·¯ does not normally cross membrane boundaries, as suggested by its anionic properties and as supported by experiments in mammalian cells (8Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”), IRP1 is predicted to be unaffected when Sod2 expression is silenced. Fig. 2B shows that IRP1 binding to IREs is indeed unaffected when Sod2 is silenced. In contrast, silencing of Sod1 by the same mechanism leads to robust activation of IRP1 (Fig. 2C), in keeping with the activation of IRP1 seen in the Sod1—/— mutant (Fig. 2A). Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Aconitases Are Selectively Inactivated by Loss of SOD2 and SOD1, Respectively—Having established that IRP1 activity is unaffected by mitochondrial O2·¯, we asked if silencing Sod2 would exhibit any corresponding effect on cytosolic aconitase activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, (see also Ref. 27Kirby K. Hu J. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16162-16167Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) silencing of mitochondrial Sod2 has no discernible affect on cytosolic aconitase activity. In contrast, loss of SOD1 activity by mutation or RNAi-mediated silencing strongly inactivates cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, aconitase (Fig. 3, A and C). Collectively, the results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 argue strongly for a compartmentalized redox environment in which the reactivity of O2·¯ generated within either the mitochondrial or cytosolic compartment is limited to protein iron-sulfur substrates residing within the same respective compartment. Resistance to Paraquat Toxicity Is Unaffected by Augmentation of SOD2—In view of the compartmentalized effects conferred by selective diminution of SOD1 and SOD2 in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, respectively, we asked if the two enzymes function differentially in the context of whole organism biology as was previously shown for the thioredoxin antioxidant defense system of Drosophila (37Missirlis F. Ulschmid J.K. Hirosawa-Takamori M. Gronke S. Schafer U. Becker K. Phillips J.P. Jackle H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11521-11526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Missirlis F. Rahlfs S. Dimopoulos N. Bauer H. Becker K. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Jackle H. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To address this question, we produced UAS-Sod2 transformants that ectopically express Sod2 through use of the UAS/Gal4 system (29Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the daG32Gal4 driver to broadly overexpress Sod2 produces a 3-fold elevation of mitochondrial SOD2 activity (Fig. 4A). We then assessed the protective effect of Sod2 overexpression against the toxicity of paraquat, a widely used O2·¯-generating agent (25Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the robust paraquat-resistance conferred by augmentation of SOD1 (31Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 39Reveillaud I. Niedzwiecki A. Bensch K.G. Fleming J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 40Elia A.J. Parkes T.L. Kirby K. St George-Hyslop P. Boulianne G.L. Phillips J.P. Hilliker A.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), augmentation of SOD2 activity provided no increased protection against the toxicity of paraquat (Fig. 4B). This result was also seen with augmentation of SOD2 using motorneuron or muscle Gal4 drivers (data not shown) and is consistent with previously published results on the failure of Sod2 overexpression to provide resistance to hyperoxia, heat stress, and starvation (41Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Rahmandar J.J. Benes J.J. Radyuk S.N. Klichko V.I. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Paraquat Exposure Converts Cytosolic Aconitase to IRP1 but Has No Effect on Mitochondrial Aconitase—We then examined the compartment-specific impact of paraquat exposure on the cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases. Wild type flies (Sod1+, Sod2+) were exposed to the same concentrations of paraquat as in Fig. 4B, but for a shorter, non-lethal time (16 as opposed to 48 h), and IRP1 binding and aconitase activities were assayed. A decrease in cytosolic aconitase activity and a reciprocal increase in IRP1 binding activity confirmed that, as expected, paraquat exposure causes an increased flux of O2·¯ in the cytosol but not in mitochondria (Fig. 4, C and D). The failure of Sod2 overexpression to afford additional protection against paraquat toxicity (Fig. 4B) may thus result from the confinement of paraquat reactivity to the cytosol and the inaccessibility of SOD2 to this compartment. Augmentation of SOD2 Does Not Rescue the Sod1-null Mutant—Finally, we asked whether enhancing the capacity of mitochondria to detoxify O2·¯ through elevated SOD2 activity could rectify the debilitating and lifespan-shortening effects of the Sod1-null mutation. A negative answer to this question would reinforce the findings above that the cytosol and mitochondria represent functionally isolated O2·¯ compartments in Drosophila. To answer this question, we overexpressed Sod2 in the Sod1x39 genetic background using ubiquitous, motorneuron or muscle-specific Gal4 drivers and determined the lifespan of the resulting adults (Fig. 5). The results clearly demonstrate that, in striking contrast to Sod1, ectopic expression of Sod2 confers no discernible effect on the severely truncated lifespan of Sod1x39 adults (Fig. 5). Neither does it rectify the unusually high pupal mortality of Sod1x39 (data not shown). We thus conclude that the role of SOD2 in mitigating cytosolic oxidative stress in general and scavenging cytosolic O2·¯ in particular is negligible. These studies represent the first in vivo analysis in a higher eukaryote of the consequences of genetic modulation of cytosolic and mitochondrial SODs on the function of iron-sulfur proteins that reside within those respective compartments. These iron-sulfur proteins are both important cellular targets and sensitive indicators of superoxide-mediated oxidative stress. The distinct subcellular partitioning of the cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases and the availability of methods to assay these two activities concurrently in the same extract provided the opportunity to investigate whether superoxide generated in the mitochondrial compartment can affect an iron-sulfur protein in the cytosol and vice versa. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological methods to generate compartment-specific oxidative stress, we examined the responses of the cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases. The results are consistent with the interpretation that in Drosophila, cytosolic aconitase is unaffected by superoxide generated in mitochondria and conversely, that mitochondrial aconitase is unaffected by superoxide generated in the cytosol. We interpret these results to mean that containment of O2·¯ within the compartment of its origin along with the SOD specific to that compartment is a central feature of reactive oxygen homeostasis in Drosophila. How this homeostatic mechanism might relate to the severe debilitating phenotypes that characterize Sod1—/— mutants of Drosophila (25Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 26Phillips J.P. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Boulianne G.L. Kirby K. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8574-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as compared with the relatively benign phenotype of the corresponding Sod1—/— mutant in mice (42Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) is unclear at present. In principle, the liberation of intracellular iron resulting from the reaction of unscavenged O2·¯ with [4Fe-4S] clusters (12Srinivasan C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol.

Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting to note that mutations in iron-sulfur cluster assembly genes have been shown to suppress the Sod1 deficiency phenotype of S. cerevisiae (44Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced iron sulfur protein expression can abrogate O2·¯ toxicity. Whether mutations in homologous genes would have similar effects on Sod1—/— phenotypes in Drosophila remains an open question. The results described here contrast with a recent in vitro study of isolated mammalian mitochondria. Han et al. (21Han D. Antunes F. Canali R.D.R Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5557-5563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) present evidence that superoxide can be released from rat heart mitochondria cultured in vitro through voltage-dependent anion channels. Biological differences between Drosophila and rat heart mitochondria, the use of different methods used to detect and modulate superoxide flux, and in vivo versus in vitro conditions are all potential contributors to these differences. Further experiments will be required to clarify this matter. These studies set the stage for investigating of the role of Sod1, Sod2, and oxidative stress in iron metabolism in Drosophila. The results presented here underscore the importance of compartment boundaries in maintaining reactive oxygen homeostasis in Drosophila and could have therapeutic implications in relation to the oxidative stress component of inflammatory disease.

https://openalex.org/W2139929417,"IκBα is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters NF-κB dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation, NF-κB moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including IκBα. This newly synthesized IκBα also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated NF-κB from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of NF-κB activation. We show here that IκBα enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as HOXB7 and Pit-1 through a NF-κB-independent association with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and HDAC3 but not with HDAC2, -4, -5, and -6. IκBα bound both HDAC proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that IκBα acts by partially redirecting HDAC3 to the cytoplasm. At the same time, an IκBα mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with HDAC1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of Pit-1. Our results support the hypothesis that the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of HDAC1 and HDAC3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to IκBα.

The paradigm of NF-κB activation is based on its cytoplasmic sequestration by IκBα through the masking of its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization sequenceCBSconsensus-binding sequenceGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininHDAChistone deacetylasePRLprolactinGHgrowth hormoneTSHβthyroid-stimulating hormone β. in unstimulated cells (1Li Q. Verma I. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). Recent studies have challenged this hypothesis suggesting that IκBα constantly shuttles in and out of the nucleus via nuclear import (2Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and export sequences (3Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huang T.T. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4737-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because IκBα nuclear export is more efficient than its nuclear import process, the NF-κB·IκBα complex remains mainly in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines, viral infection, or bacterial pathogens, IκBα is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase complex and degraded through the proteasome pathway (5Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar). Then NF-κB enters into the nucleus and activates the expression of multiple genes including IκBα. This newly synthesized IκBα protein moves to the nucleus, removes NF-κB from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of NF-κB activation. IκBα is part of a family of ankyrin-containing proteins that also includes IκBβ and IκBϵ (6Whiteside S.T. Israël A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) as well as p100, p105, and BCL-3 (7Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. Nature. 1992; 358: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast to the IκB proteins, BCL-3 is mainly nuclear and harbors some transactivation potential through heterodimer formation with the NF-κB proteins p50 or p52 (8Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Bron K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and recruitment of co-activators such as JAB1 and BARD1 (9Dechend R. Hirano F.

We previously demonstrated that IκBα enhances the transactivation potential of HOXB7, a homeodomain-containing protein (10Chariot A. Princen F. Gielen J. Merville M.-P. Franzoso G. Brown K.

In this study, we elucidated further the underlying mechanism and showed that cytoplasmic IκBα enhances the transactivation potential of other homeodomain-containing proteins such as Pit-1 and PAX8 through binding to some but not all HDAC proteins, a family of proteins sharing the ability to deacetylate their substrates and to repress transcription (11Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results therefore suggest that IκBα may have new and NF-κB-independent roles.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitations of overexpressed proteins, 293 cells (3 × 106) were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) and expression vectors as indicated. Subsequent lysis and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (19Chariot A. Leonardi A. Müller J. Bonif M. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37029-37036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as were the immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins. For identification of ternary complexes by immunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (107) were transfected with FLAG-IκBα as described above. 24 h after transfection, ectopically expressed IκBα was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Anti-HA immunoprecipitations were performed in parallel as negative controls. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with the lysis buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the FLAG peptide (Sigma) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The supernatants were subsequently incubated for 2 h with anti-HA (negative control), anti-p50, or anti-HDAC3 antibodies and overnight with protein A-agarose conjugate. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed with the lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE for anti-p65 Western blot analysis. Indirect Immunofluorescence—293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and subsequently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids. 24 h later, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with ethanol for 6 min at –20 °C. Fixed cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-IκBα antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by a 60-min incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako). Coverslips were then mounted with Fluoprep (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy (Nikon). Reporter Assays—HCT116, MDA-MB231, or 293 cells (4 × 105) were transfected in 6-well plates with various amounts of expression vectors as indicated. Total amounts of transfected DNAs were kept constant throughout by the addition of appropriate amounts of pcDNA3 empty vector. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured and normalized as described previously (10Chariot A. Princen F. Gielen J. Merville M.-P. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Bours V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5318-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). IκBα Enhances Transactivation by Multiple Homeodomain-containing Proteins—We previously established that IκBα enhances the transactivation potential of HOXB7, a homeodomain-containing protein (Fig. 1A and Ref. 10Chariot A. Princen F. Gielen J. Merville M.-P. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Bours V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5318-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether this effect also occurred in another cell line and performed identical luciferase assays in 293 cells. Again, IκBα enhanced HOXB7 transactivation potential in this cell line. To determine whether IκBα regulates the transcriptional activity of other homeodomain-containing proteins, we selected PAX8, a member of the Paired domain (PAX) family known to transactivate the bcl-2 promoter (20Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. Monarres A. Kottical L.V. Saunders G.F. McDonnell T.J. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 3211-3216PubMed Google Scholar) and used a small fragment of this promoter as reporter plasmid. IκBα weakly transactivated this promoter in 293 or HCT116 cells but strongly enhanced PAX8-mediated transactivation in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). The homeodomain-containing protein Pit-1 is known to regulate the expression of GH, TSHβ, and PRL. We therefore performed similar luciferase assays by transfecting 293 or HCT116 cells with corresponding reporter plasmids either alone or with Pit-1 and/or IκBα. We again detected a strong synergistic effect on the PRL promoter in both cell lines (Fig. 2A) and to a lesser extent on the TSHβ promoter, especially in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2B, right panel). A weaker effect was observed on the GH promoter in 293 cells, whereas no significant synergistic effect was detected in HCT116 cells when the GH promoter was used (Fig. 2C, left and right panel, respectively). Therefore, our results indicate that IκBα enhances transactivation by several homeodomain-containing proteins on multiple but not all promoters. Moreover this ability of IκBα to enhance the transactivation potential of the homeodomain-containing proteins does not appear to be cell-specific. Therefore, it is likely that a general mechanism is involved.Fig. 2IκBα enhances the transactivating activity of Pit-1 on distinct promoters.A–C, 293 cells or HCT116 cells (black and white histograms, respectively) were transfected with the indicated reporter plasmid alone or with the indicated expression plasmids as mentioned, and luciferase activities were measured.

Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), we examined whether the IκBα-mediated gene activation could be mediated through IκBα physical interactions with HDAC proteins. 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors coding for IκBα and for various FLAG-tagged HDAC members. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by either anti-IκBα or -HA (negative control) antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to an anti-FLAG Western blot (Fig. 3A). Ectopically expressed IκBα was associated with FLAG-tagged HDAC1 and HDAC3 (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 6, respectively) but not with HDAC2, -4, and -5 (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 4, 8, and 10, respectively) or with HDAC6 (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 3). Similar experiments performed with extracts from untransfected cells showed that this complex occurs physiologically since endogenous HDAC1 or HDAC3 proteins interacted with endogenous IκBα (Fig. 3C, upper panels, lanes 2). Therefore, our results suggest that IκBα associates with some, but not all, histone deacetylase complexes in vivo. To identify the IκBα domain mediating the interaction with the HDAC proteins, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to test the ability of IκBα mutants (Fig. 4A) to interact with HDAC3. 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-HDAC3 as well as either IκBα or IκBαΔN, and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation experiments followed by anti-IκBα Western blots were carried out on the cell extracts. As expected, FLAG-HDAC3 was found to be associated with IκBα (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lane 2) and also with IκBαΔN (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lane 4). Moreover, when IκBα or IκBαΔC were transfected with HDAC3, both proteins were detected in the anti-HDAC3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lanes 2 and 4, respectively) but not in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lanes 1 and 4). Finally, an IκBα mutant in which the ankyrin repeats were replaced by a GST cassette and named “N+C GST” failed to interact with FLAG-HDAC3 in 293 cells (Fig. 4D, upper panel, lane 4), whereas the wild type IκBα protein was again found in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates despite a lower level of expression compared with the N+C GST mutant (Fig. 4D, upper panel, compare lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the ankyrin repeats of IκBα are critical in mediating the interaction with HDAC3. This conclusion is supported by the ability of a GST-ankyrin fusion protein to interact with in vitro translated HDAC3 (data not shown). p65 Disrupts the Interaction between IκBα and HDAC3—We next determined the ability of IκBα to bind HDAC3 in the presence of increasing amounts of p65 by immunoprecipitating IκBα from transfected 293 cells and by performing anti-HDAC3 Western blots on the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5A). Increasing amounts of p65 interfered with the ability of FLAG-HDAC3 to bind IκBα (Fig. 5A, upper panel, lanes 2–4). These results suggest that p65 and HDAC3 compete to bind a common domain of IκBα, most likely its ankyrin repeats. We then performed double immunoprecipitation experiments to investigate whether p65, HDAC3, and IκBα are part of a common complex. 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-IκBα, and total cell extracts were subsequently subjected to anti-FLAG or anti-HA immunoprecipitations. The immunoprecipitates were then released from the beads by incubation with the FLAG peptide, and the released material was subsequently immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or with antibodies to endogenous HDAC3 or p50 proteins. Anti-p65 immunoblots were carried out on the resulting immunoprecipitates. As expected, the p50·p65·IκBα ternary complex was detected (Fig. 5B, upper panel, lane 3). On the other hand, no ternary complex including p65, HDAC3, and IκBα was detectable (Fig. 5B, upper panel, lane 6). These results suggest that IκBα binds HDAC3 independently of p65. HDAC3, but Not HDAC2, Attenuates IκBα-mediated Positive Effect on Pit-1 and HOXB7 Transactivation Potential—We next examined the biological relevance of the interaction of IκBα with some HDAC proteins and noticed that FLAG-HDAC3 strongly decreased IκBα-mediated enhancement of Pit-1-dependent transcription on the PRL 164-bp reporter plasmid, whereas similar amounts of FLAG-HDAC2, which does not interact with IκBα (see Fig. 3A), had a much weaker effect (Fig. 6A). An anti-FLAG Western blot was carried out on the cell extracts to make sure that similar amounts of both FLAG-tagged HDAC proteins were expressed (Fig. 6A). We next investigated whether NF-κB is somehow involved in the IκBα-mediated positive effect on the homeodomain-containing protein transactivation potential by using a reporter plasmid that does not harbor any κB binding site and is therefore not induced by p50/p65. Because the PRL 164-bp luciferase reporter plasmid turned out to harbor a functional κB site (data not shown), we selected the pTCBS reporter plasmid, which contains an eightfold multimerized form of a homeodomain CBS and whose activity is not induced by p50/p65 (10Chariot A. Princen F. Gielen J. Merville M.-P. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Bours V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5318-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and tested the effect of FLAG-HDAC3 on such reporter plasmid. A similar dose-dependent decrease of the luciferase activity was detected when the pTCBS reporter plasmid was cotransfected with HOXB7, IκBα, and increasing amounts of FLAG-HDAC3 as compared with the luciferase activity measured in the absence of FLAG-HDAC3 (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the HDAC proteins differentially modulate IκBα-mediated enhancement of gene transcription, and this is correlated with their ability to physically interact with IκBα. This newly described IκBα function is NF-κB-independent since it also occurs on promoters lacking any κB binding site. IκBα Sequesters a Pool of HDAC3 Proteins in the Cytoplasm—The possibility that IκBα causes HDAC3 cytoplasmic sequestration was investigated by studying the subcellular localization of ectopically expressed HDAC3 in HeLa cells either transfected or not with an IκBα expression vector. Transfected HDAC3 is found in the nucleus in most cells, although some cytoplasmic staining was observed in some cases, whereas ectopically expressed IκBα can be found in both cell compartments. In the absence of ectopically expressed IκBα, HDAC3 was nuclear in 47% of the counted cells, and only 13% of the cells showed a predominant cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, a greater amount of cells (47%) showed a cytoplasmic staining of HDAC3 when both HDAC3 and IκBα were co-expressed (data not shown). Therefore, these results demonstrate that ectopic expression of IκBα increases the cytoplasmic localization of HDAC3. Recent studies have demonstrated that IκBα constantly shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. To explore whether this shuttling affects the ability of IκBα to interact with HDAC3, we examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments whether an IκBα mutant (IκBα NLS-MT) lacking a functional NLS (2Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could still interact with HDAC3. As expected, this mutant was mainly localized in the cytoplasm when transfected into 293 cells, whereas the wild type IκBα protein was also found in the nucleus (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, despite low expression levels as compared with wild type IκBα (Fig. 7B, lower panel, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2), IκBα NLS-MT strongly interacted with HDAC3 or HDAC1 as judged by immunoprecipitation experiments of cells transfected with IκBα (lanes 1 and 2) or IκBα NLS-MT (lanes 3 and 4) and with either FLAG-HDAC1 or FLAG-HDAC3 (Fig. 7B, upper panels on the left and right, compare lanes 2 and 4). Moreover IκBα NLS-MT efficiently enhanced Pit-1-mediated transcription through the PRL promoter (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results therefore suggest that IκBα enhances Pit-1 transactivating activity through cytoplasmic sequestration of transcriptional repressors such as HDAC1 and -3. The IκBα protein is ubiquitously expressed as an NF-κB cytoplasmic inhibitor. In response to various stimuli, IκBα is rapidly degraded to allow NF-κB nuclear translocation and NF-κB target gene transcription. As IκBα itself is the product of an NF-κB-regulated gene, it is rapidly resynthesized and can then migrate to the nucleus to terminate the first phase of NF-κB activation. Our present data demonstrate that this IκBα inhibitor can also associate with HDAC proteins and sequester them in the cytoplasm. Although we do not have any direct evidence that newly synthesized IκBα binds to HDACs in response to NF-κB-activating stimuli and brings them to the cytoplasm, it is possible that such activity participates in NF-κB target gene transcription. Indeed, upon stimulation, two waves of NF-κB recruitment to its target genes occur (22Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The first wave involves immediately accessible genes and appears to be terminated through IκBα-mediated removal of NF-κB from its binding sequences (23Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar), whereas the second wave involves genes whose promoter accessibility requires stimulus-dependent modification of chromatin structure (22Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This second wave appears to rely on IκBβ and IκBϵ, which stabilize NF-κB responses during longer stimulations (23Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) and, as suggested by the present data, could possibly be favored by IκBα-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration of HDACs. We previously demonstrated that IκBα physically interacts with HOXB7, and this interaction was required to mediate IκBα positive effect on HOXB7-driven transcription (10Chariot A. Princen F. Gielen J. Merville M.-P. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Bours V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5318-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This mechanism presumably relies on a nuclear localization of IκBα, which has been clearly established and would imply that IκBα is capable of recruiting some coactivators in the vicinity of HOXB7 as does the transactivating protein BCL-3, another ankyrin-containing protein of the same family, with the coactivators BARD1 and JAB1 (9Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We indeed detected physical interactions of IκBα with BARD1 and JAB1, supporting this hypothesis (data not shown). However, our present report demonstrates that a cytoplasmic IκBα mutant could still strongly induce Pit-1 transactivation potential, therefore suggesting that sequestration of HDACs is the predominant mechanism that accounts for the observed effects. Such a statement, however, does not rule out the ability of IκBα to harbor some transactivating potential in the nucleus through physical interactions with some transcription factors and recruitment of co-activators. Evidently HDAC sequestration indicates that IκBα also exerts NF-κB-independent activities. Indeed the positive effect of IκBα occurs on promoters limited to the CBS, which lacks any κB binding site, and we previously showed that the heterodimer p50/p65 does not enhance the IκBα effect on the pTCBS reporter but rather attenuates it (10Chariot A. Princen F. Gielen J. Merville M.-P. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Bours V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5318-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have no evidence for a ternary complex that includes p65, HDAC3, and IκBα occurring. Rather IκBα binds HDAC3 independently of p65, supporting the hypothesis that IκBα harbors NF-κB-independent functions. Most NF-κB-activating stimuli (proinflammatory cytokines, viruses, DNA damage, etc.) also activate other transcription factors. Our data therefore suggest that IκBα could favor the transcription of genes controlled by these regulating complexes through the maintenance of histone acetylation and promoter accessibility. In other words, once the first round of NF-κB-dependent transcription is over, HDAC/IκBα interactions would favor the activity of other induced transcription factors. However, our data demonstrated that endogenous IκBα and HDACs physically interact in the absence of any stimulus. Therefore, the ubiquitous IκBα cytoplasmic pool could sequester some HDACs and thus favor either basal cellular transcription or transcription in various conditions where NF-κB is not activated. It is currently unclear whether IκBα brings HDAC1 and -3 back to the cytoplasm along with NF-κB proteins after stimulation or whether a pool of these HDACs is sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding to molecules such as IκBα prior to their shuttling to the nucleus. Whether or not nuclear IκBα brings some HDAC proteins along with p65 back in the cytoplasm remains to be investigated. HDAC molecules regulate histone deacetylation and can thus influence the activity of many transcription factors. However, IκBα interacts specifically with HDAC1 and -3 and leaves the other HDACs unaffected. Among the candidate transcription factors whose activity could be influenced by HDAC1 and -3 sequestration, we demonstrated that transcriptional activity of HOX proteins is enhanced by IκBα expression. Several experiments suggest putative functional interactions between NF-κB and HOX proteins. IκBα knock-out mice are smaller than their wild type littermates, but it remains unclear whether this size difference is due to hormonal defect (GH for instance) or to inflammatory reactions. Moreover, NF-κB and several HOX proteins are simultaneously expressed at various developmental stages, and local NF-κB inhibition following expression of a mutated IκBα has been demonstrated to interfere with limb development (24Bushdid P.B. Brantley D.M. Yull F.E. Blaeuer G.L. Hooman L.H. Niswander L. Kerr L.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As the present report demonstrates a novel NF-κB-independent function for IκBα, it will be most important to identify the genes whose expression is regulated by IκBα and by the interaction of IκBα with HDACs. These genes are probably highly cell-specific according to the expressed transcription factors and to promoter accessibility. The identification of the IκBα-regulated transcription factors and genes will open a new field of investigation related to a novel and unexpected IκBα activity. We are grateful to M. Muller, M. Hanning, S. Emiliani, L. Boxer, V. Zappavigna, and M. Zannini for the generous gifts of plasmids and to R. Hay for providing the monoclonal anti-IκBα antibody."

Using mass spectrometry, we have mapped 11 sites in Cas that are phosphorylated by Src. These sites are all located between residues 132 and 414 of Cas, in a region that is required for binding to a number of other proteins including Crk. We tested synthetic peptides modeled on Cas phosphorylation sites, and found that the sequence containing tyrosine 253 was phosphorylated by Src most efficiently. Using cells derived from Cas-deficient mice, we confirmed that Cas greatly enhanced the ability of Src to transform cells. Phosphorylation of Cas on tyrosine 253 was not required for Src to increase growth rate, suppress contact inhibition, or suppress anchorage dependence. Yet, in contrast to these growth characteristics, phosphorylation of Cas on tyrosine 253 was required for Src to promote cell migration. Thus, a single phosphorylation site on this focal adhesion adaptor protein can effectively separate cell migration from other transformed growth characteristics.

Normal cells have intrinsic controls that limit their movement and growth, such as restraints imposed by cell cycle checkpoints. Cells must receive cues from their surrounding environment to override these restraints. Thus, cell growth normally relies on signals mediated from the extracellular matrix through integrins (1Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 2Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin.

In contrast to normal cells, tumor cells ignore their surrounding environment, which allows them to overcome contact growth inhibition, lose anchorage dependence, and migrate to foreign tissues and organs. The degree to which tumor cells grow and migrate correlates with their aggressive potential (1Frisch S.M. Francis H. J.

Therefore, it is important to understand how extracellular signals guide cell behavior and how transformation ablates the need for integrin signaling. Integrins transmit signals from the extracellular matrix to inside of the cell.

Therefore, understanding the mechanistic relationship between Cas and Src should help elucidate mechanisms that underlie fundamental aspects of tumor cell growth. To better understand the role of Cas in cell transformation, we have identified residues that are phosphorylated by Src. We then examined the effects of these phosphorylation events on cell behavior. We report here that a single phosphorylation site on Cas, tyrosine 253, can effectively separate the effects of transformation on cell migration from other hallmarks of transformation including anchorage-independent growth. Production of Cas and Src in Sf9 Cells—Wild type Cas (8Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

Briefly, cells were grown at 27 °C, infected with baculovirus expression vectors, collected and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, and lysed in a French pressure cell in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and applied to blue nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin to purify histidine-tagged Cas or Src according to the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen) as described (16Pellicena P.

Mutagenesis and Production of Cas in Bacteria—A BamHI/NotI fragment containing Cas cDNA was subcloned into the complementary sites of the bacterial expression vector pET28A to produce the entire coding region of Cas with an amino-terminal polyhistidine tag as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). This construct was used as a template to produce site directed mutants with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Stratagene), which were verified by sequencing on an ABI373 automated DNA sequencer as described (16Pellicena P.

The tyrosine residue at position 253 was mutated to phenylalanine to produce CasY253F with the forward primer 5′-GCTCCAGGTTCCCAGGACATCTTTGATGTGCCCCCTGTTCG-3′ and a complementary reverse primer. The amino acids between residues 118 and 423 were deleted to produce Cas118Δ423. EcoRI sites were introduced at the nucleotides encoding amino acids 118 and 423 with forward primers 5′-CCCCAACCTGACAATGAATTCCTGGTACCCACTCCC-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCGAGCGAGAATTCCCAACAGATGGCAAGCGC-3′, respectively, and complementary reverse primers. The construct was religated after excising the resulting EcoRI fragment, which contains the entire substrate binding region of the protein. Wild type and mutant Cas proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3RP codon+ (Stratagene) and purified as done for Sf9 cells described above. Expression of Cas and Src in Mammalian Cells—To examine the effects of Cas and Src on a blank background, fibroblasts from homozygous null Cas knockout cells were used as described previously (20Honda H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). For controls, cells were transfected with empty vectors (pBABEhygro and/or pBABEpuro) as appropriate so that all transfectants were selected for hygromycin resistance and puromycin resistance conferred by the transfection vectors. All cells were transfected with equal concentrations of both plasmids (1 μg/well of 6-well plate), and clones were not taken from the resultant cells, thus avoiding potential consequences of clonal variation. In Vitro Kinase Reactions—In vitro kinase reactions on full-length Cas proteins were performed as described previously (16Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Basically, 1 μg of Cas protein was incubated at 30 °C in 10 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP) in the presence or absence of 0.15 μg of Src for varying lengths of time. After incubation with Src, some reactions were treated with 1 μgof Yersinia phosphatase for an additional 5 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (to achieve a final concentration of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue). A continuous spectrophotometric assay was also used to measure kinase activity on synthetic peptides shown in Table II as described by Porter el al. (27Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mm NADH, 89 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 124 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and varying concentrations of peptide substrates (75–2000 μm). The reactions were carried out in duplicate at 30 °C and were initiated by the addition of Src.

Cells were quickly aspirated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted by a brief spin (1 min at 8000 × g), aspirated, lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mm tris-HCl (pH 6.8)), sheared through a 26-gauge needle, boiled for 5 min, and cooled on ice.

Crk was immunoprecipitated to evaluate its association with wild type Cas and CasY253F in mammalian cells as described by Klemke et al. (23Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with a solution containing 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340), and 1% Nonidet P-40, and clarified by centrifugation. 4 mg of total protein was precleared with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences, catalog no. 17-0618-01), incubated overnight with monoclonal antibody against Crk (Transduction Laboratories, catalog no. 610035), immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads, eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting with antiserum against Crk and Cas as described above. Phosphorylation Site Identification by MALDI-TOF—Cas protein (1 μg) produced by Sf9 cells was subjected to in an in vitro kinase reaction for 1 h either in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP alone or with ATP plus 0.15 μg of purified v-Src. Cas was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and examined by MALDI-TOF MS as described previously (28Goldberg G.S. Bechberger J.F. Tajima Y. Merritt M. Omori Y. Gawinowicz M.A. Narayanan R. Tan Y. Sanai Y. Yamasaki H. Naus C.C. Tsuda H. Nicholson B.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6018-6026PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was detected by Coomassie staining, excised, rehydrated, washed with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50% acetonitrile, dried, and completely digested with trypsin in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.5). Peptides were then extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetate, dried, suspended in 10 mg/ml 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetate containing bovine insulin and human angiotensin as internal standards, and applied to a MALDI sample plate. MALDI mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a PerSeptive Voyager DE-RP mass spectrometer in the linear mode. Profiles were queried against the expected Cas peptide products, and phosphorylated residues were apparent by an increase in molecular mass of 80 daltons (relative to the Cas + ATP samples). Sequencing and Identification of Phosphorylation Sites by LC-MS-MS—Protein bands were subjected to in-gel digestion as for MALDI-MS. Peptide extracts were desalted using a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) followed by elution from the tip with 10 ml of 50% acetonitrile. Immediately prior to injection the acetonitrile was removed on a Speed-vac concentrator, and the volume was brought to ∼2 ml. Analysis was done on a Micromass Q-Tof hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a nanoelectrospray source. A fused silica tip mounting adapter from New Objective was fitted with a 75-mm inner dimension fused silica tip, also from New Objective, connected through 50-mm inner dimension fused silica tubing to the LC detector outlet. Nano-LC was performed with an LC Packings Ultimate micro pump and solvent organizer, and an Ultimate detector with a 10-nl flow cell and 214-nm wavelength. Sample was resolved through an LC Packings C18 PepMap column (5 mm, 75-mm ID, 15-cm length) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min and an injection volume of 1 ml (Solvent A: 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; Solvent B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; loading solvent: 0.1% formic acid). Cell Growth Assays—For all assays, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 100% humidity. All comparisons were done in parallel to avoid any changes in culture conditions between experiments. 20,000 cells were seeded in 1 ml in each well of tissue culture-treated 12-well cluster plates (Falcon, catalog no. 3043) to examine anchored growth or in ultra low attachment 24-well cluster plates (Corning, catalog no. 3473) to examine nonanchored growth. Cell numbers were obtained by Coulter counter at the time points indicated in the Fig. 7. To examine cell migration, 200,000 cells were plated in 6-well cluster plates on cell culture inserts with a 3-μm pore size as directed by the manufacturer (Transwell clear, Costar) and grown for 72 h. Cells were then separately released from the top of the membrane, the bottom of the membrane, and well beneath the membrane. Migration was then quantitated as the percent of cells found in the well over the total cell number. Identification of Src Phosphorylation Sites in Cas—Src and Cas were purified from Sf9 cells and utilized for in vitro kinase assays. Phosphorylation of Cas by Src was evident in these experiments. The apparent molecular mass of Cas was shifted by Src phosphorylation from 130 to 170 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This effect was reversed by treatment with a tyrosine phosphatase (Fig. 1). To identify sites phosphorylated by Src, Cas was incubated with Src and ATP or with ATP alone, resolved by SDS-PAGE, cleaved with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Fig. 2, several tryptic fragments were found in the unphosphorylated state in the ATP-treated sample, but these were shifted by the mass of a phosphate (+80) in the Src-phosphorylated sample. Based on these data, 11 tyrosine residues (132, 169, 183, 196, 238, 253, 271, 291, 301, 391, and 414) were phosphorylated by Src (Table I).Table IIdentification of tyrosine residues in Cas that are phosphorylated by SrcSiteaSites are indicated by residue number in primary sequence.SequencebSequence of tryptic peptide fragments with phosphorylation sites indicated by asterisks; pound signs indicate sites verified by LC-MS-MS.MWcMolecular weights of fragments after incubation with ATP alone or with ATP and Src, as indicated.ATPSrcTyr132127TQQGLY*QAPGPNPQFQSPPAK14722552335Tyr169-Tyr183-Tyr196155QTPHHSFPSPATDLY*QVPPGPGSPAQDIY*QVPPSAGTGHDIY*QVPPSLDTR20554235583, 5663Tyr238222VGQGYVYEASQAEQDEY*DTPR24224062486Tyr253243HLLAPGSQDIY*#DVPPVR25918771957Tyr271260GLLPNQYGQEVY*DTPPMAVK27922212301Tyr291280GPNGRDPLLDVY*DVPPSVEK29921682248Tyr310300GLPPSNHHSVY*#DVPPSVSK31820182098Tyr391384RPGPGTLY*#DVPR39513281408Tyr414398VLPPEVADGSVIDDGVY*AVPPPAER42225642644a Sites are indicated by residue number in primary sequence.b Sequence of tryptic peptide fragments with phosphorylation sites indicated by asterisks; pound signs indicate sites verified by LC-MS-MS.c Molecular weights of fragments after incubation with ATP alone or with ATP and Src, as indicated. Open table in a new tab Src Preferentially Phosphorylates Cas on Tyrosine 253— Quantitative kinase assays were performed on peptides harboring several of the phosphorylation sites identified by MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Table II, the peptide based on tyrosine 253 was the most efficient substrate of those tested, in terms of kcat/Km. Although individual sites might be phosphorylated differently in the context of the folded three-dimensional structure of Cas, the mass spectrometry and peptide data collectively point to tyrosine 253 on Cas as a primary target of Src phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of full-length Cas on tyrosine 253 by Src was verified by LC-MS-MS. The calculated mass of the peptide sequence between residues 243 and 259 (HLLAPGSQDIYDVPPVR) is 1877 daltons. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 253 increased the mass of this fragment by 80 daltons to 1957 daltons (Fig. 2 and Table I). The carboxyl-terminal portion of this fragment, containing tyrosine 253, was clearly detected by LC-MS-MS in Fig. 3. The pattern of fragment ions confirmed the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine 253, with a mass of 243 daltons. Src Phosphorylation Sites Reside in the “Src Substrate Region” of Cas—The phosphorylation sites identified in this study were all located between amino acids 132 and 414 of Cas. Expression vectors were created to produce full-length wild type Cas, a site mutant with tyrosine 253 changed to phenylalanine (Y253F), or a deletion mutant missing the entire substrate for Src substrate region between amino acids 118 and 423 (118Δ423). As shown in Fig. 4, wild type Cas and CasY253F were both phosphorylated by Src in vitro, whereas Cas118Δ423 was not. Thus, Src phosphorylated Cas at sites in addition to tyrosine 253, but they all resided within the Src substrate region as presented in Fig. 5.Fig. 5Diagram of Src phosphorylation sites and Cas transfection constructs. Tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Src are numbered over a schematic representation of Cas. Positions of the SH3 domain, proline-rich region (Pro), kinase substrate region, serine rich-region (Ser), Src binding sequence (SBS), and helix-loop-helix (HLH) motifs are indicated. Schematic diagrams of two mutants made for further testing are also shown. Tyrosine 253 was changed to phenylalanine to create CasY253F, and the entire substrate for the Src kinase region between residues 118 and 423 was deleted to create Cas118Δ423.

An impairment of energy metabolism plays a key role in the pathophysiology of this disease, resulting in neurodegeneration of the basal ganglia and renal failure. It has become the subject of intense debates whether methylmalonic acid is the major toxin, inhibiting respiratory chain complex II. To elucidate whether methylmalonic acid is a respiratory chain inhibitor, we used spectrophotometric analysis of complex II activity in submitochondrial particles from bovine heart, radiometric analysis of 14C-labeled substrates (pyruvate, malate, succinate), and analysis of ATP production in muscle from mice. Methylmalonic acid revealed no direct effects on the respiratory chain function, i.e. on single electron transferring complexes I-IV, ATPase, and mitochondrial transporters. However, we identified a variety of variables that must be carefully controlled to avoid an artificial inhibition of complex II activity. In summary, the study verifies our hypothesis that methylmalonic acid is not the major toxic metabolite in methylmalonic acidurias.

A recent study has supported this hypothesis, demonstrating restricted diffusion and elevated amounts of lactate in the globus pallidus of affected patients signaling mitochondrial dysfunction (8Trinh B.C. Melhem E.R. Barker P.B. Am. J. Neuroradiol. 2001; 22: 831-833PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, symmetrical lesions in globus pallidus are also found in patients with inherited complex II deficiency and other respiratory chain disorders (9Martin J.J. van de Vyver F.L. Scholte H.R.

Although a contribution of toxic organic acids to the neuropathogenesis of methylmalonic acidurias was suggested more than a decade ago, it remains unclear which is the main neurotoxic metabolite in this condition.

It has been hypothesized that MMA induced inhibition of complex II (synonym, succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), a multiprotein assembly imparted in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has become a focus of interest (12Wajner M.

Consequently, MMA has been suggested to induce so-called “secondary” or “weak” excitotoxicity (12Wajner M. Coelho J.C. J. Inherited Metab.

However, recently we have demonstrated in striatal neuronal cultures from rat embryos that MMA-induced neuronal damage involves intracellular formation of the competitive complex II inhibitor malonate (MA) and 2-methylcitrate, a compound with multiple inhibitory properties on the tricarboxylic acid cycle (15Okun J.G. Hörster F. Farkas L.M. Feyh P. Hinz A. Sauer S. Hoffmann G.F. Unsicker K. Mayatepek E. Kölker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14674-14680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that neuronal damage is mainly driven via metabolites that derive from alternative oxidation pathways of propionyl-CoA rather than by MMA itself. In the present study we investigated whether MMA exerted any direct effects on mitochondrial energy metabolism and have investigated in detail the susceptibility of respiratory activity measurements to distinct artifacts. By this approach we can provide further evidence for our previous hypothesis that inhibition of the respiratory chain is not directly induced by MMA. Spectrophotometric Assay for Complex II Activity in Submitochondrial Particles—Submitochondrial particles from bovine heart were prepared as previously described (20Okun J.G. Lümmen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Roseborough N.R. Farr A.J. J.

Chem. 1972; 247: 3656-3661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The catalytic activity of respiratory chain complex II was investigated in submitochondrial particles (SMPs) from bovine heart as previously described using decylubiquinone as the electron mediator (15Okun J.G. Hörster F. Farkas L.M. Feyh P. Hinz A. Sauer S. Hoffmann G.F. Unsicker K. Mayatepek E. Kölker S. J. Biol.

In brief, steady state activities of mitochondrial complex II were recorded using a computer tunable spectrophotometer (SPECTRAmax Plus 384 Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) operating in the dual wavelength mode. Reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol was detected at 610–750 nm (ϵ = 22.0 mmol/liter–1 × cm–1) in thermostatted 96-well plates in a final volume of 300 μl (n = 8–16 experiments). Measurements were performed at standard conditions, which are defined as follows: SMPs were diluted to a final protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm TRIS/HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm NaN3, and 20 mm sodium succinate. SMP dilution was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, 15 μg of SMPs were added into each well. The reaction was started by the addition of a 300-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm TRIS/HCl (adjusted to pH 7.4), 20 mm sodium succinate, 2 mm NaN3, 60 mm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol with 0.01% Triton X-100, and 40 μm decylubiquinone. SMP dilution was kept on ice between measurements. In each experimental series, the specificity of the measured complex II activity was determined by using the specific inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (8 mm). In analogy, the effects of the competitive complex II inhibitor malonate (MA) and the structurally related compound MMA were investigated using concentrations of up to 10 mm. To examine competition between these compounds with succinate at complex II, MA and MMA were incubated with different succinate concentrations (up to 20 mm) in the reaction mixture. Furthermore, we compared the effect of MMA on complex II activity after a 30-min incubation with 3-nitropropionic acid, a well known “suicide” inhibitor of complex II (24Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex II activity is modulated by a variety of variables, probably resulting in an artificial inhibition of this mitochondrial complex under non-standardized conditions. Because oxaloacetate inhibits complex II, we investigated the effects of “aging” on complex II activity in our assay, determining complex II activity during a period of up to 140 min. The effects of non-standardized conditions were tested by varying succinate concentrations, time points of measurement, and temperature at which SMP dilution was kept. Furthermore, we investigated the pH dependence of complex II activity at pH 5–10, replacing TRIS/HCl by 50 mm concentrations of a multi-buffer mixture, containing 10 mm of CAPS, MES, CHES, EPPS, and MOPS. pH optimum was determined according to Brandt and Okun (25Brandt U. Okun J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of buffered and unbuffered MMA on complex II activity were tested. Preparation of 600 × g Supernatants from Muscle—Adult C57Bl/6 mice of both sexes (n = 6) were sacrificed for the experiments. Immediately after death, muscle specimens (muscle quadriceps) were removed and homogenized (10% w/v). 600 × g supernatants were prepared according to Fisher et al. (26Fisher J.C. Ruitenbeek W.

Immediately after centrifugation, oxidation rates of [1-14C]pyruvate, [U-14C]malate, and [1,4-14C]succinate and ATP production of unlabeled pyruvate, malate, and succinate were determined (27Trijbels J.M.F.

Aliquots of the supernatants were frozen and kept at –80 °C until measurement of protein concentrations (21Lowry O.H. Roseborough N.R. Farr A.J. J. Biol.

Radiometric Analysis of Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation— Analysis of single respiratory chain complexes does not allow detection effects of toxic compounds on associated proteins and transporters of the mitochondrial respiratory chain but can be detected by radiometric analysis of 14C-labeled substrates. Radiometric analysis of oxidation rates of [1-14C]pyruvate, [U-14C]malate, and [1,4-14C]succinate were determined as previously described (27Trijbels J.M.F. Sengers R.C.A. Ruitenbeek W. Fischer J.C.

We investigated whether mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation was influenced by MMA (1 mm).

Spectrophotometric measurement of ATP production is coupled to the formation of NADPH (λ = 320–400 nm, 25 °C). The test principle consists of two enzyme reactions. In the first step, glucose (30.3 mm) and ATP are catalyzed to glucose 6-phosphate and ADP by hexokinase. Subsequently, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+ to 6-phosphoglucolacton and NADPH. The production of NADPH was normalized to the protein concentration and citrate synthase activity of each sample. An overview on the experiments performed is shown in Table II.Table IIExperimental protocol for the analysis of pyruvate- and succinate-stimulated ATP production in 600 × g supernatants from muscle tissue of adult C57Bl/6 miceWithout MMAWith MMA (1 mm)Pyruvate Pyruvate+ Malate+ malate+ Malate + arsenite+ Malate + CCCP+ malate + CCCPSuccinate Succinate+ Acetylcarnitine + DQA + antimycin A+ Acetylcamitine + DQA - antimycin A+ acetylcarnitine + DQA - antimycin A+ acetylcamitine - antimycin A Open table in a new tab Data Analysis—Data were normalized to citrate synthase activity and protein concentrations of the same sample. If not explicitly mentioned, MMA-induced effects on complex II activity were normalized to simultaneously measured controls. This procedure was compared with a different normalization procedure using a control group that was measured at the beginning of each experimental series (see Fig. 4A). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Experiments were performed 6–8-fold. One-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test (for three or more groups), or Student's t test (for two groups) were calculated using SPSS for Windows 10.0 software. p < 0.05 was considered significant. pH dependence of complex II activity was analyzed using the Psiplot software 5.02a. Methylmalonic Acid Does Not Inhibit Complex II Activity in SMPs—In SMP complex II revealed a high activity (Vmax, 1.02 units/mg of protein, n = 8), a high affinity for the substrate succinate (Km: 40 μm, n = 8), and a good inhibitory response to the standard inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (8 mm; 10% of control activity, n = 8). Varying the absolute and relative concentrations of MMA (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 mm) and succinate (0, 0.04, 0.4, 4, 20 mm), no inhibitory effect of MMA on complex II activity was detected (n = 8, Fig. 1A). In addition, we could exclude any inhibitory effect of MMA (concentration range, 0.01–10 mm) on the electron-transferring complexes I, III, and IV as well as on ATP synthase (data not shown). Furthermore, we found no effect of propionic acid (up to 10 mm), the decarboxylation product of MMA, on complex II activity. In contrast, the competitive complex II inhibitor MA (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 mm) revealed an inhibition of complex II activity at varying succinate concentrations (0, 0.04, 0.4, 4, 20 mm), confirming the reliability of our assay (n = 8, Fig. 1B). Next, we investigated whether prolonged incubation with MMA would induce complex II inhibition, in analogy to the suicide inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid inactivating complex II by covalent binding. However, incubation with MMA (1–10 mm) for 30 min did not decrease complex II activity, whereas 3-nitropropionic acid induced a strong inhibition of this enzyme (n = 8, Fig. 2). A further prolongation of the incubation period (up to 120 min) showed similar results for MMA (data not shown). Evaluation of Artificial Inhibition of Complex II Activity; Relevance of pH Effects and Aging—The pH optimum for complex II activity was determined in SMPs at a range from pH 5 to pH 10 (n = 8). Complex II activity reached a maximum at pH 7.4, whereas pH changes dramatically reduced Vmax (Fig. 3A). The pH dependence of complex II activity was described according to Brandt and Okun (25Brandt U. Okun J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), revealing a pKA of 6.7 and a pKB of 7.9 (Fig. 3B). Simultaneous experiments with buffered MMA (adjusted to pH 7.4) and unbuffered MMA (0.01 mm (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm (pH 7.4), 1 mm (pH 7.2), 5 mm (pH 5.7), 10 mm (pH 5.1)) revealed a strong decrease in complex II activity at concentrations of 1–10 mm due to a concentration-dependent pH shift (n = 8, Fig. 3C). The concentrations of succinate and oxaloacetate in the test system is of relevance for Vmax. Whereas increasing succinate concentrations have been shown to increase Vmax (see also Fig. 1), oxaloacetate has the opposite effect. Because the relation of these two compounds changes in the SMP dilution in a time-dependent fashion, we investigated whether aging effects would result in a decrease of Vmax. In fact, we found a decrease in complex II activity if the SMP dilution was kept at room temperature for a period of 140 min (n = 8, Fig. 4A). If kept on ice (0 °C, i.e. our standard condition), complex II activity remained stable during this time period (n = 8, Fig. 4A). Because complex II activity correlates with the concentrations of its substrate succinate, we investigated the influence of different succinate concentrations (SMP dilutions kept on ice). At 4 and 20 mm succinate (i.e. 100- and 500-fold Km), complex II activity remained stable for 80 min, whereas at 0.04 and 0.4 mm succinate it rapidly decreased, most likely due to a decrease in succinate and an increase in oxaloacetate concentrations (n = 8, Fig. 4B). Because time-dependent changes in Vmax necessitate a simultaneous measurement of controls, we investigated whether a normalization of complex II activity to (a) simultaneous controls or to (b) non-simultaneous controls (determined at the beginning of each experimental series of 3 h) would result in a misinterpretation of complex II activity measurements at low succinate concentrations. If normalized to simultaneous controls, MMA revealed no inhibitory effect on complex II activity using 0.4 mm succinate (n = 8, Fig. 4c). In contrast, using the same set of data normalization to a non-simultaneous control group, which would not detect aging effects of the control group, resulted in an apparent concentration-dependent decrease of complex II activity by MMA (n = 8, Fig. 4C). Methylmalonic Acid Does Not Affect Mitochondrial Respiration and Oxidative Phosphorylation—Activity measurement of single respiratory chain complexes could not exclude that MMA has an inhibitory effect on associated proteins of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, e.g. on transporter systems. Such effects could be determined by radiometric analysis of the oxidation rate of 14C-labeled substrates and of pyruvate- and succinate-induced ATP production in coupled mitochondria. For this purpose we used 600 × g supernatants from muscle tissue of adult C57Bl/6 mice (n = 6). MMA (1 mm) revealed no effect on the mitochondrial respiration of [1-14C]pyruvate (Fig. 5A), [U-14C]malate (Fig. 5B), or [1,4-14C]succinate (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, ATP production stimulated by pyruvate (Fig. 5D) or succinate (Fig. 5E) was not affected by MMA (1 mm). The same system revealed a good inhibitory response to standard inhibitors of respiratory chain (2-n-decylquinazoline-4-yl-a-mine, antimycin A, malonate, arsenite, atractyloside) and carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone (data not shown), confirming the reliability of our data. The biochemical hallmark of methylmalonic acidurias is an accumulation and increased urinary excretion of the organic acid MMA. MMA is structurally similar to the competitive complex II inhibitor MA (31Greene J.G. Porter R.H. Eller R.V. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Neurodegeneration in methylmalonic acidurias in particular affects the globus pallidus, which is also affected in inherited or acquired inhibition of complex II (9Martin J.J. van de Vyver F.L.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed reasonable to suggest MMA as an endogenous toxic metabolite inducing neurodegenerative changes via impairment of energy metabolism (7Heidenreich R. Natowicz M. Hainline B.E. Berman P.

Dis. 1997; 20: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In fact, administration of MMA in vitro and in vivo induced neuronal cell damage involving ionotropic glutamate receptors and oxidative stress (13McLaughlin B.A. Nelson D. Silver J.A. Erecinska M.

Although two previous studies from the same group demonstrated inhibition of complex II activity by MMA (10Dutra J.C. Dutra-Filho C.S. Cardozo S.E.C. Wannmacher C.M.D. Sarkis J.J.F. Wajner M. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Brusque A.M. Borba Rosa R. Schluck P.F. Dalcin K.B. Ribeiro C.A. Silva C.G. Wannmacher C.M. Dutra-Filho C.S. Wyse A.T. Briones P. Wajner M. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we could not confirm this finding in a recent study (15Okun J.G. Hörster F. Farkas L.M. Feyh P. Hinz A. Sauer S. Hoffmann G.F. Unsicker K. Mayatepek E. Kölker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14674-14680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, we showed that MMA-induced effects are likely to be indirect, involving the intracellular formation of the competitive complex II inhibitor MA and 2-methylcitric acid, a compound with multiple inhibitory effects on the tricarboxylic acid cycle (32Cheema-Dhadli S. Leznoff C.C. Halperin M.L. Pediatr. Res. 1975; 9: 905-908PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that MMA-induced inhibition of complex II activity in the previous studies might have been the result of intracellular formation of MA and 2-methylcitrate. To confirm our hypothesis that MMA has no direct effects on the mitochondrial respiratory chain, we investigated MMA using spectrophotometric analysis of complex II activity in SMPs and radiometric analysis of the mitochondrial respiration of 14C-labeled substrates (pyruvate, malate, succinate). Furthermore, we studied under which experimental conditions complex II inhibition by MMA could be artificially induced. In fact, we could exclude any direct effects of MMA on single complex II activity and [1,4-14C]succinate respiration. Furthermore, succinate-stimulated ATP production was not affected by MMA. Thus, these results exclude any relevant effects of MMA on complex II activity. It has been suggested that MMA inhibited the transmitochondrial malate carrier at millimolar concentrations in rat liver mitochondria (33Halperin M.L. Schiller C.M. Fritz I.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, radiometric analysis of [U-14C]malate respiration in 600 × g supernatants from mice muscle revealed only a small, but insignificant decrease by 1 mm MMA. An effect on the malate carrier at higher concentrations might be theoretically interesting; however, it is questionable whether this effect has any relevance for the pathophysiology of methylmalonic acidurias. Apart from this, MMA was shown to inhibit pyruvate carboxylase (34Oberholzer V.G. Levin B. Burgess E.A. Young W.F. Arch. Dis. Child. 1967; 42: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and Na+/K+-ATPases (35Wyse E.L Streck A.T. Barros S.V. Brusque A.M. Zugno A.I. Wajner M. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2331-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). MMA has no inhibitory effect on the respiratory chain function, in particular complex II activity, under the standardized conditions used in this study. However, we could identify some important variables of this enzymatic assay that must be carefully controlled to avoid false-positive inhibitory responses. First of all, the pH should be kept at the optimum for this method (pH 7.4), and all compounds tested should be adequately buffered to avoid pH shifts and, concomitantly, changes in complex II activity. Furthermore, simultaneous measurements of controls and subsequent normalization of the data to these control groups must be performed during the experimental series, in particular if low succinate concentrations are used. To prevent a time-dependent decrease in Vmax during the experiments, saturating concentrations of succinate (4–20 mm) should be used, and the SMP dilution should be kept on ice. It cannot be excluded that additional variables have an important influence on complex II activity. However, if complex II activity is standardized using the standard procedure described above, the reliability of this assay is very high. In conclusion, we could confirm the hypothesis that MMA exerts no direct effects on the mitochondrial respiratory chain and seemingly is not the major toxic metabolite in methylmalonic acidurias. The recent study stresses our previous concept of a synergistic inhibition of respiratory chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle by propionyl-CoA and its alternative products, in particular 2-methylcitrate and MA (15Okun J.G.

https://openalex.org/W2006601156,"Cpc2/RACK1 is a highly conserved WD domain protein found in all eucaryotes. Cpc2/RACK1 functions on mammalian signal transduction pathways most notably as an adaptor protein for the βII protein kinase C isozyme. In single cell eucaryotes, Cpc2/RACK1 regulates growth, differentiation, and entry into G0 stationary phase. The exact biochemical function of Cpc2/RACK1 is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that Cpc2 is associated with the ribosome. Using immunoaffinity purification, we isolated ribosomal proteins in association with Cpc2/RACK1. Polysome and ribosomal subunit analysis using velocity gradient centrifugation of cell lysates demonstrated that Cpc2 co-sediments with the 40 S ribosomal subunit and with polysomes. Conditions known to disrupt ribosome structure alter sedimentation of the ribosome and of Cpc2/RACK1 coordinately. Loss of cpc2 does not dramatically alter the rate of cellular protein synthesis but causes a decrease in the steady state level of numerous proteins, some of which regulate methionine metabolism. Whereas real time PCR analysis demonstrated that transcriptional mechanisms are responsible for down-regulation of some of these proteins, one protein, ribosomal protein L25, is probably regulated at the level of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2070271970,"Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a genetic disorder associated with short stature, fertility defects, and a predisposition to the development of cancer. BS cells are characterized by genomic instability; in particular, a high rate of reciprocal exchanges between sister-chromatids and homologous chromosomes. The BS gene product, BLM, is a helicase belonging to the highly conserved RecQ family. BLM is known to form a complex with the RAD51 recombinase, and to act upon DNA intermediates that form during homologous recombination, including D-loops and Holliday junctions. Here, we show that BLM also makes a direct physical association with the RAD51L3 protein (also known as RAD51D), a so-called RAD51 paralog that shows limited sequence similarity to RAD51 itself. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal domain of BLM. To analyze functional interactions between BLM and RAD51L3, we have purified a heteromeric complex comprising RAD51L3 and a second RAD51 paralog, XRCC2. We show that the RAD51L3-XRCC2 complex stimulates BLM to disrupt synthetic 4-way junctions that model the Holliday junction. We also show that a truncated form of BLM, which retains helicase activity but is unable to bind RAD51L3, is not stimulated by the RAD51L3-XRCC2 complex. Our data indicate that the activity of BLM is modulated through an interaction with the RAD51L3-XRCC2 complex, and that this stimulatory effect on BLM is dependent upon a direct physical association between the BLM and RAD51L3 proteins. We propose that BLM co-operates with RAD51 paralogs during the late stages of homologous recombination processes that serve to restore productive DNA replication at sites of damaged or stalled replication forks.

Genet. 2000; 1: 409-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cell lines derived from individuals with BS display a number of abnormalities, including poor growth and plating, and a strikingly high level of chromosomal instability (3Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The characteristic feature of BS cells, which is used in diagnosis of the disorder, is an elevated frequency of genetic recombination events, particularly sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) (5Chaganti R.S. Schonberg S. German J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). However, this hyper-recombination is not limited to exchanges between sister-chromatids, because interchromosomal homologous recombination also occurs at an elevated rate in BS cells (1German J. Dermatol. Clin. 1995; 13: 7-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2van Brabant A.J. Stan R. Ellis N.A. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

The gene mutated in BS, which is designated BLM, is located on chromosome 15q26.1, and encodes a protein comprising 1417 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 159,000 (6Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). BLM belongs to the highly conserved RecQ family of DNA helicases (3Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Because members of the RecQ family have been identified in all organisms, it seems likely that they perform an important and conserved cellular function. There is a single family member in bacterial and yeast species, but at least five in human cells. Of the five human RecQ-related proteins, defects in three are associated with established genetic disorders. In addition to inactivation of BLM in BS, defects in WRN cause Werner's syndrome (7Yu C. Oshima J. Fu Y. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Najura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar), and defects in RECQ4 cause Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (8Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Miller R.W. Smithson W.A. Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Like BS, both of these disorders are associated with a high incidence of cancers, although the primary manifestations of Werner's syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome are premature aging, and skin and skeletal abnormalities, respectively. Where studied, all RecQ helicases unwind simple, partial-duplex DNA molecules in a 3′-5′ direction but are notable for their atypical profile of preferred DNA substrates (9Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr Jr., V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). For example, RecQ helicases, including BLM, are apparently unique among helicases in their ability to efficiently disrupt “alternative” (non-Watson-Crick) DNA structures, including G-quadruplexes, that can form in guanine-rich sequences such as telomeric repeat DNA (9Mohaghegh P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Moreover, RecQ helicases selectively bind to at least two DNA structures that arise during the process of homologous recombination. BLM can disrupt synthetic oligonucleotides that mimic the DNA displacement loop (D-loop) structure generated by DNA strand invasion of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into an homologous duplex (14van Brabant A.J. Ye T. Sanz M. German I.J. Ellis N.A. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14617-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). BLM, WRN, and RecQ also unwind synthetic 4-way junctions (X-junctions) that model the Holliday junction recombination intermediate (9Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr Jr., V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 15Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The process of homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells requires several proteins, of which the central player is RAD51, the eukaryotic ortholog of Escherichia coli RecA (18Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). RAD51 forms helical filaments on DNA and catalyzes DNA strand invasion and exchange. It is assisted in these processes by the actions of several proteins, including RAD52, RAD54, and replication protein A. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a heterodimer of the Rad55 and Rad57 proteins acts as a ScRad51 accessory factor, and stimulates ScRad51-mediated DNA strand transfer activity in vitro (20Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Rad55 and Rad57 are so-called Rad51 paralogs, because they show limited sequence similarity to Rad51, but do not appear to form nucleoprotein filaments or directly catalyze DNA strand invasion/exchange. In human cells, there are five RAD51 paralogs, although it is unclear whether any of these can strictly be considered as the direct counterpart of yeast Rad55 or Rad57. The human RAD51 paralogs are termed RAD51L1 (also known as RAD51B), RAD51L2 (RAD51C), RAD51L3 (RAD51D), XRCC2, and XRCC3 (22Cartwright R. Dunn A.M. Simpson P.J. Tambini C.E. Thacker J.

Various complexes have been purified, including RAD51L2-XRCC3, RAD51L3-XRCC2, RAD51L1/L2, and a larger complex containing RAD51L1/L2/L3-XRCC2 (35Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Enomoto R. Kagawa W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of these complexes have not been characterized in detail, and it still remains unclear why five RAD51 paralogs exist in human cells and what their respective functions might be. Apart from an ATPase activity that is stimulated by DNA, little is known about the catalytic activities displayed by the human RAD51 paralogs. One possible role, identified through an analysis of the RAD51L1/L2 complex, is to assist RAD51 in the assembly of a nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA through modulating the action of replication protein A (38Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Bussen W. Schild D. Albala J.S. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3308-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although there is no conclusive evidence for a direct interaction between human RAD51 and the human RAD51 paralogs, it is clear that the action of RAD51 in vivo is influenced by the presence of the paralogs. The most striking manifestation of this is the failure of RAD51 to localize normally to discrete nuclear foci (thought to be sites of ongoing DNA repair) following exposure to ionizing radiation in the irs1, irs1SF, and irs3 cell lines discussed above (40Bishop D.K.

In addition to their promotion of DNA transactions associated with homologous recombination (such as Holliday junction branch migration), RecQ helicases interact physically with components of the homologous recombination machinery. For example, several RecQ helicases associate with and are stimulated by replication protein A (43Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1424-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether this is relevant to a role for the complex in DNA recombination or replication. More specifically for recombination, there is a conserved interaction between RecQ helicases and RAD51; both between the human BLM and RAD51 proteins, and between the sole RecQ helicase in S. cerevisiae, Sgs1p, and the ScRad51 protein (46Wu L. Davies S.L. Levitt N.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19375-19381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated by the same domain of the RecQ helicase protein (the extreme C-terminal region in each case) (46Wu L. Davies S.L. Levitt N.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19375-19381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) despite a lack of obvious sequence similarity between the C-terminal regions of the BLM and Sgs1 proteins. In view of the numerous biochemical and genetic connections between RecQ helicases and components of the homologous recombination machinery, we have analyzed whether BLM might interact with the human RAD51 paralogs. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of BLM binds to the RAD51L3 protein. To address whether this interaction has functional effects on the catalytic activity of BLM, we have purified RAD51L3 in complex with its RAD51 paralog partner, XRCC2. We show that the RAD51L3-XRCC2 heteromeric complex can stimulate the ability of BLM to disrupt model Holliday junction structures, and that this stimulatory effect requires that BLM be capable of interacting physically with the RAD51L3-XRCC2 complex. We present a model whereby BLM cooperates with the homologous recombination machinery to process DNA structures that arise at sites of blocked replication forks in human cells. Construction of Plasmids—The plasmids pJB1.1, pJB1.2, pJB3.1, and pJB3.2 have been described previously (47Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These plasmids, respectively, contain the full-length XRCC2 open reading frame (ORF) cloned into pGEX4T-1 and pET30a, or the full-length RAD51L3 ORF cloned into pET30a and pGEX4T-1. pJB3.21 was generated by cloning the full-length open reading frame for RAD51L3 into pET21a using EcoRI and NotI sites. The 3′ primer contained an in-frame stop codon. For two-hybrid analyses, previously reported 3′ constructs of the BLM cDNA were utilized (48Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F.

These encode the C-terminal domain of BLM from residues 966 to 1417. The RAD51L3 and XRCC2 ORFs were cloned directionally (using 5′ EcoRI and 3′ NotI sites) into the pEG202 yeast two-hybrid “bait” plasmid, to generate pEG3.1 and pEG1.1, respectively. The same ORFs were also cloned into the EcoRI site of the 2-hybrid “prey” plasmid, pJG45, to generate pJG3.1 and pJG1.1, respectively. The oligonucleotides used in the PCR amplification of the ORFs can be obtained upon request. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid screens were conducted essentially as described by Wu et al. (46Wu L. Davies S.L. Levitt N.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

Brent) to allow expression of XRCC2 or RAD51L3 bait protein as a fusion to LexA under control of the ADH promoter. RAD51L3 or XRCC2 were also cloned into plasmid pJG45 (a gift from Dr. R.

Cell. 1985; 43: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into yeast strain EGY48, containing the reporter plasmid pSH1834, using the lithium acetate method, as published previously (50Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected at 30 °C on SD-agar lacking histidine, tryptophan, and uracil. Colonies were streaked onto YPD agar plates, which were incubated at 30 °C overnight, before colonies were replica plated onto SD-agar containing galactose, raffinose, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), but lacking histidine, tryptophan, uracil, and leucine. Colonies were considered positive if they grew and turned blue, after overnight incubation at 30 °C. Control proteins, including hRAD51, LexMax, and HM12, were used as preys to assess the specificity of the interaction (51Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Further two-hybrid experiments were performed, using fragments of BLM (see Fig. 1) as either bait or prey proteins. Quantitative β-galactosidase assays on liquid cultures were performed as described previously (47Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Preparation of Extracts from Human Cell Lines—Whole cell extracts from human cells were prepared by washing cells in PBSA and then boiling in SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells in suspension. Approximately 2 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation, the pellet was washed in PBSA, and the cells were lysed in 5 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glucose 1-phosphate, 10 nm microcystin, 0.1 mmpara-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions) on ice for 45 min. Nuclei were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and the remaining supernatant designated as the “cytoplasmic” fraction. The nuclear pellet was re-suspended in 0.3 ml of TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above), to which 0.6 ml of buffer D (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 530 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above) was added, before incubation on ice for 30 min. The nuclear extract was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and used on the day of preparation. Co-immunoprecipitations—All steps were performed at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were made as described above. IHIC42 (anti-RAD51L3), IHIC48 (anti-XRCC2) (47Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), or appropriate preimmune sera were added to the extract at a dilution of 1:100, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. 100 μl of a 50% (w/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose (in TKM/buffer D; ratio 1:2) was added, and the mixture was rotated end over end for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were harvested in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 s, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of TKM/buffer D (ratio 1:2). The pellet was washed a further five times in the same buffer, before being boiled in protein loading buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blotted using conventional methods. GST “Pull-down” Experiments—Purified RAD51L3-GST or XRCC2-GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose columns as described previously (46Wu L. Davies S.L. Levitt N.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

All constructs for expression of GST fusion proteins have been described previously (47Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, purified recombinant protein or nuclear extracts were loaded onto the column at 4 °C, and the resin was washed with 15 ml of TKM/buffer D. The column matrix was boiled in protein sample loading buffer and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE before Western blotting. Far Western Blotting Analysis—Typically, 0.2–0.5 μg of each polypeptide was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membranes using a TE 70 semi-dry transfer unit (Hoeffer). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Filters were immersed twice in denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine HCl in PBSA) for 10 min, and then incubated for 6 × 10 min in serial dilutions (1:1) of denaturation buffer with PBSA supplemented with 1 mm DTT. Filters were blocked in PBSA containing 10% (w/v) powdered low fat milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 30 min before being incubated with purified recombinant RAD51L3 protein (47Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in PBSA supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 60 min. Filters were washed for 4 × 10 min in PBSA containing 0.25% (w/v) powdered low fat milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The second wash contained 0.00001% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. Conventional Western analysis was then performed to detect the presence of RAD51L3 using IHIC42 as the primary antibody. An otherwise identically treated negative control blot was processed, but without any incubation with RAD51L3. Purification of the RAD51L3-XRCC2 Complex—BL21(DE3) bacteria were transformed simultaneously with pJB3.21 and pJB1.2, and transformants were selected on LB agar containing ampicillin and kanamycin. Cultures of the doubly transformed bacteria were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin and kanamycin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 before addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 2 h of incubation with shaking, the culture was cooled to 4 °C in iced water for 15 min, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl (1 ml of buffer per 40 ml of original bacterial culture volume), and the suspension was frozen at -80 °C. Following thawing of the suspension, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics) were added and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the final concentration of 1 mm immediately prior to lysis by sonication (4 × 15 s at maximum amplitude with cooling on ice between bursts). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 25 min (70 Ti rotor; Beckman) and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 45% to precipitate proteins. Following incubation on ice for 30 min, precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation, the pellet was re-suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and the solution was dialyzed for 2 h against nickel binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 450 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The solution was then subjected to nickel chelate chro"
https://openalex.org/W2047998400,"Replicative DNA helicases are ring-shaped hexamers that play an essential role in DNA synthesis by separating the two strands of chromosomal DNA to provide the single-stranded (ss) substrate for replicative polymerases. Biochemical and structural studies suggest that these helicases translocate along one strand of the duplex, which passes through and interacts with the central channel of these ring-shaped hexamers, and displace the complementary strand. A number of these helicases were shown to also encircle both strands simultaneously and then translocate along double-stranded (ds)DNA. In this report it is shown that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mcm4,6,7 complex and archaeal minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus move along duplex DNA. These two helicases, however, differ in the substrate required to support dsDNA translocation. Although the S. pombe Mcm4,6,7 complex required a 3′-overhang ssDNA region to initiate its association with the duplex, the archaeal protein initiated its transit along dsDNA in the absence of a 3′-overhang region, as well. Furthermore, DNA substrates containing a streptavidin-biotin steric block inhibited the movement of the eukaryotic helicase along ss and dsDNAs but not of the archaeal enzyme. The M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase, however, was shown to displace a streptavidin-biotin complex from ss, as well as dsDNAs. The possible roles of dsDNA translocation by the MCM proteins during the initiation and elongation phases of chromosomal replication are discussed.

The possible roles of dsDNA translocation by the MCM proteins during the initiation and elongation phases of chromosomal replication are discussed. Biochemical studies of replicative helicases of bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya, viruses, and bacteriophages revealed that they all form ring-shaped hexamers that encircle and translocate along one strand of the duplex and displace the other strand, utilizing the energy derived from NTP hydrolysis to drive the reaction (1.Patel S.S.

These proteins, in addition to their role as viral DNA replicative helicases, also bind to viral origins of replication acting as origin recognition proteins needed for the initiation of DNA replication. Nevertheless, it was shown that following initiation these hexameric viral proteins (9.Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol.

The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is believed to function as the replicative helicase of Eukarya and Archaea, suggesting that it is the functional homologue of the bacterial DnaB protein (12.Ishimi Y.

In Eukarya, MCM is a family of six proteins (Mcm2–7) with highly conserved amino acid sequences between the six different polypeptides (13.Tye B.K. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In addition to forming a heterohexamer, in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed the presence of additional MCM complexes composed of different combinations of the MCM proteins (12.Ishimi Y. J.

Biochemical studies with the various complexes in yeast and mammals have shown that a dimeric complex of the Mcm4,6,7 heterotrimer contains 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase, ssDNA binding, and DNA-dependent ATPase activities, whereas its interactions with either Mcm2 or Mcm3,5 inhibit the helicase activity (12.Ishimi Y.

Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and mutational analyses have shown that physical interactions between specific members of the two subgroups (Mcm4,6,7 and Mcm2,3,5) are required for efficient ATPase activity (19.Schwacha A.

The mtMCM has been shown to exist as a double hexamer in solution (4.Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several in vivo observations made with the eukaryotic MCM complexes suggest that these proteins may bind dsDNA in addition to ssDNA. It was shown that the MCM proteins preferentially bind to unreplicated DNA (27.Dimitrova D.S. Todorov I.T. Melendy T. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28.Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the complex is distributed over large regions of DNA surrounding origins (29.Edwards M.C. Tutter A.V. Cvetic C. Gilbert C.H. Prokhorova T.A. Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33049-33057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The majority of the MCM proteins are not localized at replication forks where DNA synthesis takes place and where ssDNA regions are available (27.Dimitrova D.S. Todorov I.T. Melendy T. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 30.Madine M.A. Khoo C.Y. Mills A.D. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1270-1279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These and other observations prompted a proposal that the MCM complex may translocate along duplex DNA following loading at the origin (31.Laskey R.A. Madine M.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To date, however, dsDNA translocation by MCM has not been reported. Support for the possible translocation of the MCM complex along duplex DNA comes from studies with the bacterial DnaB and phage-T7 gp4 helicases. Using Thermus aquaticus and Escherichia coli DnaB proteins (32.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33.Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that in the presence of dsDNA containing a 5′-ssDNA tail, the helicases encircle both strands of the duplex and translocate along the duplex. Their transit along dsDNA, similar to the unwinding reactions, requires NTP hydrolysis. The diameter of the central channel of these helicases, including the mtMCM complex, varies between ∼20 and 45 Å, large enough to accommodate the passage of dsDNA (1.Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 34.Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we examined the ability of the spMcm4,6,7 complex and the mtMCM protein to encircle and translocate along duplex DNA. The data presented here demonstrate that both helicases can translocate along dsDNA. The study also shows that during its movement along DNA the archaeal protein, but not the eukaryal complex, can displace streptavidin linked to biotinylated oligonucleotides present in either single-stranded or duplex regions. ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and oligonucleotides and biotinylated oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology DNA synthesis facilities. Biotin was obtained from Sigma, streptavidin was from Rockland Inc., and Biotin-dT (5′-dimethoxytrityloxy-5-[N-(((4-t-butylbenzoyl)-biotinyl)-aminohexyl)-3-acrylimido]-2′-deoxyuridine-3′-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite) was obtained from Glen Research. The proteins, mtMCM, mtMCM K325A mutant, and the spMcm2–7 and spMcm4,6,7 complexes were purified as described previously (4.Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15.Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Preparation of Substrates for Helicase Assays—Oligonucleotides used for the preparation of the different helicase substrates are listed in Table I. The helicase substrates were made by labeling one or two of the oligonucleotides (as indicated in the figure legends) at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeling reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The labeled oligonucleotide(s) were hybridized to the other oligonucleotides (usually at a 1:1 molar ratio) in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl by heating to 100 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP and unannealed oligonucleotides were removed using the following procedure. After hybridization, a 6× loading buffer (0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 50% glycerol) was added to a final concentration of 1×, and the mixture was electrophoresed through an 8% native polyacrylamide gel for 1 h at 100 V in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 4.5 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA). The desired substrates were located by autoradiography, and the products were excised from the gel, which was sliced into small pieces and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in 3 volumes of an elution buffer containing 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0).

Panels I-A model for the role of dsDNA movement by the eukaryal and archaeal MCM helicases on encountering a nick on the leading strand. When either helicase encounters a nick on the leading (translocating) strand, they will either abort strand displacement by falling off the template or translocate along the duplex. Panel J, model of translocation of the eukaryal and archaeal helicase on encountering a nick on the lagging strand. When encountering a nick on the lagging (non-translocating) strand the eukaryal helicase can switch from ssDNA translocation (resulting in DNA unwinding) to dsDNA movement (resulting in no unwinding). In contrast, the archaeal enzyme upon encountering a nick can either displace the downstream duplex structure or switch to dsDNA translocation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Streptavidin Displacement Assay—Biotinylated oligonucleotides were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase at their 5′ end and purified as described above for the preparation of helicase substrates.

After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C (spMCM4,6,7) or 60 °C (mtMCM), 5 μl of 5× loading buffer was added to each sample, followed by electrophoretic analysis on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. The gels were analyzed using phosphorimaging. All experiments described below in Fig. 3 were repeated five times with almost identical results. Representative gels are shown in the figure. spMcm4,6,7 Complex Can Translocate along dsDNA—It was demonstrated previously (12.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 37.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that the spMcm4,6,7 complex is unable to displace a duplex region of 20 bp or more in DNA substrates containing only a 3′-ssDNA overhang. This property, together with the 3′ → 5′ polarity of the enzyme, was used to design various substrates to examine whether the spMcm4,6,7 complex translocates along dsDNA. Oligonucleotides were constructed and hybridized together to produce the desired ss and dsDNA regions as shown below. All DNA substrates used in these studies contained duplex regions of 25 bp in length. The substrate shown in Fig. 1A, consisting of three oligonucleotides hybridized together, contained two 25-bp dsDNA regions separated by a nick on the bottom strand, whereas the top strand was hybridized contiguously to both duplexes. The left dsDNA region contained a 24-nt 3′-ssDNA overhang whereas the duplex region on the right had a 24-nt 5′-ssDNA overhang. The two bottom strands were labeled at their 5′ ends. Because spMcm4,6,7, which moves in the 3′ → 5′ direction, cannot displace a 25-bp duplex in the absence of a fork structure (37.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), an unwinding reaction carried out with the substrate shown in Fig. 1A could yield several products. (i) The protein complex binds to the 3′-ssDNA overhang region and translocates until it reaches the duplex region and stops, resulting in no strand displacement. (ii) Upon encountering the left duplex, the protein translocates along this duplex region by encircling both strands within its central channel and continues moving through the duplex until it reaches the right duplex, which it then displaces. (iii) The complex assembles at the fork-like structure of the right duplex and displaces the duplex region. In this scenario, the helicase may dimerize so that one hexamer encircles the duplex whereas the other hexamer encircles the ssDNA region, as demonstrated previously (37.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) for forked DNA structures. In the second and third alternatives the right duplex region is displaced, whereas the left duplex region remains associated with the top strand. Experimentally, in the presence of increasing levels of the spMcm4,6,7 complex, only the right duplex was displaced with the accumulation of the product containing the top strand hybridized to the left duplex region (Fig. 1A). However, no product containing only the right duplex region hybridized to the top strand was detected (if formed it would be located where indicated on the figure). Similar results were observed with a substrate in which the 5′-ssDNA overhang in the right duplex region was 36 bp long (data not shown). These results can be explained by either the second or third possibility described above. To distinguish between these two, the substrate shown in Fig. 1B was constructed. This substrate is similar to that used in Fig. 1A, but the 3′-ssDNA overhang in front of the left duplex region was removed, leaving only the 5′-ssDNA overhang. As shown, no displacement of either duplex region was detected (Fig. 1B). To determine whether a longer duplex region was needed to assemble the helicase on DNA, a substrate in which the left duplex region was extended to 50 bp was analyzed. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 1B, no displacement of either duplex was observed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the spMcm4,6,7 complex does not assemble at the fork and that the enzyme does not translocate from dsDNA ends. The results also suggest that the enzyme required a 3′-overhang region to initiate movement along dsDNA. To further test the need for the 3′-ssDNA overhang region, the substrate shown in Fig. 1C was made. This substrate is similar to that used in Fig. 1A but contained a 5′-ssDNA overhang region instead of a 3′-ssDNA overhang. No helicase activity was observed with this substrate, substantiating the conclusion that a 3′-ssDNA overhang is required to support the displacement of the right duplex. The results presented in Fig. 1, A–C suggest that the spMcm4,6,7 complex assembled at the 3′-ssDNA overhang and then translocated along the left duplex region until it reached the right duplex with its fork-like structure. To test this hypothesis, DNA substrates containing biotin-streptavidin blocks were used (Fig. 1, D–I). First, the ability of streptavidin to block the movement of the spMcm4,6,7 complex along ssDNA regions was examined, and the results are shown in Fig. 1, D and E. This substrate contained a single 25-bp duplex and both 3′ and 5′-ssDNA overhang regions. A biotinylated nucleotide was incorporated at the 3′-overhang region (the strand on which the helicase binds and translocates). Upon binding streptavidin, the biotin could block the movement of the helicase. In this DNA substrate, the oligonucleotide strand devoid of biotin was labeled. As shown in Fig. 1D, the substrate containing only the biotinylated nucleotide did not block helicase activity. In contrast, when streptavidin was bound to the biotinylated oligonucleotide, helicase activity was not detected (Fig. 1E). When the biotin-streptavidin was placed on the complementary strand (the strand on which the helicase does not bind and move), the helicase displaced this strand (Fig. 1F). Thus, the presence of a large protein complex on the translocating strand prevents helicase activity, presumably by blocking helicase movement. A similar approach was used to determine whether the results shown in Fig. 1A were because of translocation of the helicase through the left duplex region. For this purpose, the substrate used in Fig. 1A was modified so that the bottom strand of the left duplex contained the biotinylated nucleotide. If dsDNA translocation were required then the presence of the streptavidin-biotin complex could block the movement of the spMcm4,6,7 complex. As shown in Fig. 1G, the presence of biotin alone did not affect the displacement of the right duplex region whereas the streptavidin-biotin complex prevented its displacement (Fig. 1H). As expected, the presence of the biotin-streptavidi"

In this process, Rho GTPases-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics control cell movement and organization of cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell contacts. Time course analysis of RhoA and Rac1 activation matches specific morphological aspects of nascent pattern. RhoA-GTP increases early during EC adhesion and accumulates at sites of membrane ruffling.

When ECs stretch and remodel to form capillary structures, RhoA-GTP increases again and associates with stress fibers running along the major cell axis. N17Rac1 and N19RhoA mutants impair pattern formation. Cell-to-cell contacts and myosin light chains (MLC) are targets of Rac1 and RhoA, respectively. N17Rac1 reduces the shift of β-catenin and vascular endothelial cadherin to Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and impairs β-catenin distribution at adherens junctions, suggesting that Rac1 controls the dynamics of cadherin-catenin complex with F-actin. During the remodeling phase of network formation, ECs show an intense staining for phosphorylated MLC along the plasma membrane; in contrast, MLC is less phosphorylated and widely diffused in N19RhoA ECs.

To distribute nutrients throughout the body, vertebrates have evolved a branching blood vascular system that terminates in a network of size-invariant units, namely capillaries. The development of capillary networks characterized by typical intercapillary distances ranging from 50 to 300 μm is instrumental for optimal metabolic exchange (1.Guyton A.C. Hall J.E. Textbook of Medical Physiology, 10th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000Google Scholar).

The ability to form networking capillary tubes is a cell autonomous property of ECs and requires permissive extracellular cues such as growth factors, autacoids, signals coming from the extracellular matrix, and physical forces (2.Risau W.

For immunofluorescence studies of localization of Rac1-GTP, RhoA-GTP, and Cdc42-GTP, GST-PBD and GST-WBD were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 20 mm reduced glutathione, and protease inhibitors. GST-RBD was eluted with the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. GST fusion proteins were stored at -80 °C.All indicated monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal antibody (Ab) were provided by Pharmingen (BD Biosciences) (mAb anti-Rac1, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) conjugated-secondary Abs) and by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (mAb and Ab anti-RhoA, Ab anti-Cdc42, mAb and Ab anti-GST, mAb anti-β-catenin, Ab anti-α-catenin, Ab anti-IQGAP1, mAb anti-β-tubulin). mAbs anti-phosphorylated-MLC (MLC-P) and anti-vascular endothelial (Ve)-cadherin were obtained from Dr. S. Komatsu (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) and Prof. E. Dejana (Institute of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy), respectively. Other products were purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture—Human dermal capillary ECs (Biotech, BD Biosciences) were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. EC infection was performed as described previously (38.Primo L. Roca C. Ferrandi C. Lanfrancone L. Bussolino F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3632-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, N17Rac1, N17Cdc42, N19RhoA, RhoAQL, and Rac1QL cDNAs subcloned into Pinco vector were transiently transfected into Phoenix packaging cells, and the supernatants were used to infect ECs. As control of infection, GFP analysis was performed both through fluorescence microscope and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS Advantage SE, Biotech, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) giving 85–90% of positive ECs. The expression of transgene molecules was evaluated by Western blot analysis and always gave an increase of proteins recognized by specific mAbs anti-Rac1, anti-RhoA, and Ab anti-Cdc42 or as compared with ECs infected with vector alone (not shown). Infection conditions per se were without effect on EC morphology and on cell cycle analyzed by propidium iodide fluorescence by FACS flow cytometer.In Vitro Angiogenesis—To analyze in vitro angiogenesis, glass coverslips (2 cm2 growth area) were coated with 0.25 ml of Matrigel (8.8 mg/ml; Biotech, BD Biosciences), which was immediately aspirated, and the remaining film was allowed to solidify. ECs (125 cells/mm2) were incubated at 37 °Cina5%CO2 humidified atmosphere for 14 h on glass coverslips and observed with an inverted photomicroscope (model DM IRB HC; Leica Microsystems, Solms, Germany). Phase contrast snap photographs and 12–14-h long movies (one frame every 5 min) were taken with a cooled digital CCD Hamamatsu ORCA camera (Hamamatsu Photonics Italy, Milano, Italy), recorded, and analyzed with ImageProPlus 4.0 imaging software to count the number of capillaries/mm2 (Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA) (39.Roca C. Primo L. Valdembri D. Cividalli A. Declerck P. Carmeliet P. Gabriele P. Bussolino F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1500-1507PubMed Google Scholar).In the sprouting assay capillary ECs carrying vector alone or N17Rac1 or N19RhoA were suspended at a density of 4 cells/μl in culture medium containing 20% of Methocel stock (6 g of carboxymethylcellulose in 500 ml of M199) in M199 containing 20% FCS, 0.1 mg/ml porcine heparin. Eight hundred cells were seeded into non-adherent round-bottomed 96-well plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences), and cultured overnight at 37 °C (5% CO2, 100% humidity). The spheroids were harvested by gently pipetting them and were centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min. The EC spheroids were suspended in 200 μl of M199 medium containing 40% FCS, 1.2% (v/w) methylcellulose with or without 30 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and mixed with an equal volume of diluted collagen solution (7 volumes of collagen from rat tail, 1 volume of 10× M199, 1 volume of 0.1 n NaOH, and 1 volume of 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.3) (39.Roca C. Primo L. Valdembri D. Cividalli A. Declerck P. Carmeliet P. Gabriele P. Bussolino F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1500-1507PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h spheroid photographs were taken with digital CCD Hamamatsu ORCA camera linked to an inverted photomicroscope (model DM IRB HC, Leica).Biochemical Assays during in Vitro Angiogenesis—Capillary ECs, ECs carrying vector alone, N17Rac1, or N19RhoA (9 × 106) were seeded on 100-mm Petri dishes coated with 9 ml of Matrigel, which was immediately aspirated. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and after washing with cold PBS, pH 7.4, cells were treated with 8 ml of MatriSperse Cell Recovery Solution (Biotech, BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. After complete release from the gel, ECs were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.To analyze the GTP-bound form of Rho GTPases, cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g, and equal amounts of proteins (500 μg) were incubated with 30 μg of GST-RBD, GST-PBD, or GST-WBD G-Sepharose beads coupled for 60 min at 4 °C. At the end of incubation, beads were washed with the same buffer, and solubilized proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE (12%), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), probed with mAbs anti-RhoA, anti-Rac1, or Ab anti-Cdc42, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence techniques (Amersham Biosciences). Total cell lysates were treated in the same conditions to evaluate the total amounts of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.To detect phosphorylated MLC (MLC-P), ECs were washed twice with cold PBS containing 1 mm NaOV4 and then immediately boiled in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, 22 mm glycine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and immunoblotted with mAb anti-MLC-P.To analyze Ve-cadherin-catenin complexes, ECs were washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing PBS and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors for 20 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and a mAb anti-β-catenin for 2 h at 4 °C. Then beads were washed with lysis buffer. Pellets were solved in SDS buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS in Ca2+ -and Mg2+-containing PBS) and boiled for 5 min. Solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Nitrocellulose was blocked with 10% BSA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing PBS and immunoblotted with mAbs anti-Ve-cadherin or anti-β-catenin, or Abs anti-α-catenin, or anti-IQGAP1. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V staining as described (40.Strasly M. Cavallo F. Geuna M. Mitola S. Colombo M.P. Forni G. Bussolino F. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3890-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Where shown, densitometry was performed with Phoretix 1D software (Nonlinear USA Inc., Durham, NC).Adhesion Assay—96-Well plates were coated with 1.28 μg/μl Matrigel for 3 h at 37 °C, washed, and blocked with 3% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. 1 × 104 capillary ECs carrying vector alone or N17Rac1 or N19RhoA were plated to adhere for 30 min. Attached cells were fixed and stained by crystal violet, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm in microtiter plate spectrophotometer (HT6 7000 Bio Assay Reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Motility Assay—24-Well transwell chambers (Falcon, BD Bioscience Biotech) containing polycarbonate filters with 8-mm pores were used. The underside of the filters were coated with 1.28 μg/μl Matrigel for 1 h at 37 °C and saturated in 3% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Two hundred microliters of cell suspension containing 3 × 104 capillary ECs carrying vector alone or N17Rac1 or N19RhoA were plated in the upper chambers of transwell apparatus, and M199 supplemented with 10% FCS was added to the lower chamber. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. After washing with PBS, the cells migrated to the bottom side of the transwell membrane were fixed with 3.7% glutaraldehyde, and cells on the upper side of the filter were carefully removed by scraping with the edge of a cotton swab. Migrated cells were stained with crystal violet, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm in microtiter plate spectrophotometer. Absorbance values were linear from 1 × 102 to 2 × 104 cells.Gel Contraction—Gel contraction assay was performed as described previously (41.Kolodney M.S. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Capillary ECs (200 cells/mm2) carrying vector alone or N17Rac1 or N19RhoA were plated as detailed above. Cells were incubated at 37 °Cina5%CO2 humidified atmosphere until they spread. In some experiments 100 nm cytochalasin D or 5 μm Y-27632 (Calbiochem) were added from the beginning of incubation. To control the numbers of cell spread on Matrigel, ECs were recovered by using of MatriSperse Cell Recovery Solution and counted. To initiate Matrigel contraction, polymerized gels were gently released from the underlying culture dish. The degree of Matrigel contraction was determined after 14 h by recording pictures with a digital camera (½ inch CCD, JVC) connected to a Stereomicroscope Olympus SZX9 (Olympus Europe, Hamburg, Germany). The gel area was calculated by Image Pro Plus 4x software.Cell Dissociation Assay—Confluent cultured ECs were treated with 0.01% trypsin in Hepes-buffered saline (1 mm CaCl2, 1.3 m NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 3.3 mm Na2HPO4-7H2O, 55 mm glucose, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) (TC treatment) or in Hepes-buffered saline without Ca2+ supplemented with 1 mm EGTA (TE treatment) for 15 min at 37 °C and dissociated through 10 times pipetting. The extent of dissociation cells was represented by the index NTC/NTE, where NTC and NTE are the number of clusters and single cells, respectively (42.Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 464-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—Cells cultured on glass coverslips coated with Matrigel were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.5, quenched with 20 mm NH4Cl for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 30 min on ice, and rinsed twice in PBS. Blocking incubations were performed in PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.25% fish skin gelatin (1 h, at room temperature). GST-PBD, GSTRBD, or GST-WBD (30 μg) were diluted in 10% of blocking solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were extensively washed with PBS and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with a mAb anti-GST. After washes they were incubated with the secondary FITC-conjugated Ab. In order to exclude interferences of cell fixation on the GTP-bound state of Rho GTPases, pull-down assay was performed on cells fixed, permeabilized, and isolated from Matrigel as detailed above.Fixed and permeabilized cells were also incubated with mAbs antiVe-cadherin, anti-β-catenin, anti-MLC-P, and anti-GST or Abs anti-RhoA or anti-Rac1, and then visualized with secondary TRITC-conjugated and FITC-conjugated Abs.For F-actin staining, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. ECs infected with a modified Pinco vector without GFP were used for double staining experiments.RESULTSMorphological Events of Capillary EC Morphogenesis—Time-lapse video microscopy over a period of 14 h shows that in vitro vascular network formation by capillary ECs follows specific and peculiar morphological phases (Fig. 1). During the first 30 min, ECs randomly plated on Matrigel spread, moved, and started to form small and seldom interconnected clusters. After 1 h, ECs were completely spread and clusters increased in size and highly connecting among them. These changes became more evident after 2 h, when discrete Matrigel areas were empty and surrounded by EC islets or chains. Four hours after plating, endothelial chains begun stretching and ECs appeared very elongated. This process continued for another 2 h and was accompanied by a reduction in size of cell clusters and the delineation of polygonal spaces whose dimensions were similar to those observed at the end of the process. During the last 8 h EC chains became progressively thinner, and by 14 h these chains gave rise to EC cords interconnected with nodes that originated from the reduction in size of clusters and their compression.Activation and Cellular Localization of Rho GTPases during Capillary EC Morphogenesis—Because cell motility largely depends on the control of the actin cytoskeletal dynamics by the Rho GTPase family (14.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5184) Google Scholar), we studied the time courses of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activation and their intracellular localization in ECs during vascular network formation Matrigel. To analyze the enzyme GTP-bound state of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 in capillary EC lysates (27.Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), pull-down experiments were performed by using fusion proteins between GST and the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain of human PAK1B (GST-PBD), or the Rho binding domain of the Rho effector rhotekin (GSTRBD), or the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (GST-WBD), which binds specifically to active Cdc42 (31.Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar).When ECs were put in suspension the amount of RhoA-GTP was very low. Thirty min after plating ECs on Matrigel, RhoAGTP markedly increased and remained elevated up to 1 h (Fig. 2A). After 2 and 4 h, RhoA-GTP decreased, but it was again detectable at 6 h, reaching its maximum at 10 h and subsequently declining again (Fig. 2A). Rac1-GTP was detected in suspended cells and increased 2 h after plating, remaining elevated up to 4 h (Fig. 3A). Then Rac-GTP progressively decreased and was lower than the basal level after 14 h. The amount of Cdc42-GTP slightly increased in adhering cells as compared with suspended cells but did not change over the time of network formation, including the early step when Rac1 was activated (Fig. 3C). This observation suggested that modulation of Cdc42 activation was not essential in our experimental model.Fig. 2Activation of RhoA during capillary EC morphogenesis.A, RhoAGTP amount was evaluated by pull-down experiments with GST-RBD along the capillary network formation. At the indicated stage of the morphogenetic process on Petri dishes (100 mm diameter; 9 × 106 cells), ECs were dispersed with MatriSperse Cell recovery solution, lysed, and incubated with GST-RBD. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and then analyzed for bound RhoA molecules by Western blotting. An aliquot of lysate was used for analyzing the total amounts of RhoA. The time courses from 30 min to 4 h and from 6 to 14 h have been performed in separated experiments. Densitometric analysis of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± S.D. Bars correspond to time points of the pull-down experiment. Data were analyzed by oneway analysis of variance (p < 0.0002) and Student-Newman-Keuls test (* indicates p < 0.05 versus suspended cells).

Acyl-CoA synthetases comprise numerous proteins with diverse substrate specificities, tissue expression patterns, and subcellular localizations, suggesting that each enzyme directs fatty acids toward a specific metabolic fate. We reported that hBG1, the human homolog of the acyl-CoA synthetase mutated in the Drosophila mutant “bubblegum,” belongs to a previously unidentified enzyme family and is capable of activating both long- and very long-chain fatty acid substrates. We now report that when overexpressed, hBG1 can activate diverse saturated, monosaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we detected expression of mBG1, the mouse homolog of hBG1, in cerebral cortical and cerebellar neurons and in steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland, testis, and ovary. The expression pattern and ability of BG1 to activate very long-chain fatty acids implicates this enzyme in the pathogenesis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. In neuron-derived Neuro2a cells, mBG1 co-sedimented with mitochondria and was found in small vesicular structures located in close proximity to mitochondria. RNA interference was used to decrease mBG1 expression in Neuro2a cells and led to a 30-35% decrease in activation and β-oxidation of the long-chain fatty acid, palmitate. These results suggest that in Neuro2a cells, mBG1-activated long-chain fatty acids are directed toward mitochondrial degradation. mBG1 appears to play a minor role in very long-chain fatty acid activation in these cells, indicating that other acyl-CoA synthetases are necessary for very long-chain fatty acid metabolism in Neuro2a cells.

Activation of fatty acids to their CoA derivatives by these enzymes is generally required for further metabolism, whether it be anabolic (e.g. triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesterol ester synthesis, or chain elongation), catabolic (e.g. β-oxidation in either mitochondria or peroxisomes), or regulatory (e.g. protein acylation) (1Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Numerous enzymes with ACS activity have been described. All contain an AMP-binding domain (Prosite PS00455; us.expasy.org/prosite/) (2Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.H. Liang P.H. Dunawaymariano D.

Using these motifs, we classified ACSs into several distinct families, each comprised of multiple members within a given species (5Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A.

Although most ACSs differ in their tissue distribution, subcellular location, and substrate specificity, information on the specific role in metabolism of each individual enzyme is generally lacking.Min and Benzer (6Min K.T.

Science. 1999; 284: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) described a Drosophila melanogaster mutant, “bubblegum,” that was characterized by neurodegeneration and elevated levels of saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) (6Min K.T. Benzer S. Science. 1999; 284: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by the gene defective in this mutant had amino acid sequence homology to other ACSs, but inspection of the region containing the second conserved motif revealed that it belonged to a previously unreported ACS family (5Steinberg S.J.

These observations, along with those of Min and Benzer (6Min K.T. Benzer S. Science. 1999; 284: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggest a potential role for BG1 in the biochemical pathology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD). XALD is a severe, often fatal, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by elevated plasma and tissue levels of saturated VLCFA (9Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. Powers J. Moser A.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3257-3301Google Scholar). Organs primarily affected in the childhood cerebral form of XALD are brain, adrenal glands, and testes (9Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. Powers J. Moser A.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3257-3301Google Scholar). Furthermore, decreased peroxisomal VLACS activity has been implicated in the biochemical pathology of this disorder (10Wanders R.J. van Roermund C.W. van Wijland M.J. Schutgens R.B. van den Bosch H.

Therefore, we sought to identify specific cell types that endogenously express BG1 in order to investigate the role of this enzyme in cellular fatty acid metabolism and to determine whether BG1 plays a role in the biochemical pathology of XALD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and General Methods—[1-14C]Palmitic acid (C16:0), [1-14C]arachidonic acid (C20:4), [1-14C]docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6), and [1-14C]lignoceric acid (C24:0) were obtained from Moravek, Inc. [1-14C]Myristic acid (C14:0), [1-14C]stearic acid (C18:0), [1-14C]oleic acid (C18:1), and [1-14C]linoleic acid (C18:2) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Unlabeled fatty acids were from either Sigma or Cayman Chemicals. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells, U373 glioma cells, rat astrocytes, and Neuro2a cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. MA-10 cells were maintained in Weymouth's medium containing 15% horse serum, and Y-1 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA sequencing was performed at the Johns Hopkins University, Department of Biological Chemistry Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility using the fluorescent dideoxy terminator method of cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 377 automated DNA sequencer following ABI protocols. General conditions for PCR were as reported previously (13Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (13Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed at the Microscope Facility, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test.cDNA Cloning and Expression—Full-length cDNA encoding hBG1 (GenBank™ accession number AF179481) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (5Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To obtain full-length cDNA encoding mBG1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_053178), we used the nucleotide sequence of hBG1 to search the mouse-expressed sequence tag data base and identified a single clone (GenBank™ accession number AA111606) that contained a full-length cDNA insert. The predicted amino acid sequence of this clone had 87% identity to hBG1. A 2740-bp insert containing 20-bp 3′-untranslated region, the 2115-bp open reading frame, and 545 bp of 5′-untranslated region was transferred to pcDNA3 after digestion with EcoRI and NotI, and the clone was resequenced.For purification of the hBG1 C-terminal polyclonal antibody, a maltose-binding protein/hBG1 (MBP-hBG1) fusion construct was prepared by excising a 1472-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment from the hBG1/pcDNA3 clone and transferring it to pMalC2 (New England Biolabs). The fusion construct, encoding the C-terminal 472 amino acids of hBG1, was then transferred to Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue.Antibody Generation and Purification—A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 amino acids of hBG1 was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and then used to immunize rabbits. These services were performed by a commercial contractor (Sigma-Genosys). For affinity purification, MBP-hBG1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was lysed by sonication, and proteins were solubilized using 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, MBP-hBG1 was found in the insoluble fraction. This insoluble fraction was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel to resolve MBP-hBG1 protein from other bacterial proteins. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and detected with Ponceau S, and a strip containing the MBG-hBG1 protein was cut from the membrane. Crude antiserum was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the MBP-hBG1-containing membrane for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, bound antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and the eluate was immediately neutralized by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The buffer was exchanged back to phosphate-buffered saline using a Centricon 30 (Millipore).Animals and Their Care—Wild type 129SvEv mice were obtained from Taconic, Inc. (Germantown, NY) and housed in facilities of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Animals were housed under controlled conditions between 22 and 27 °C on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national and international laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609,OJ L 358, 1 DEC.12, 1987 and National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996), U. S. National Research Council).In situ Hybridization—The method of Giger et al. (14Giger R.J. Wolfer D.P. De Wit G.M. Verhaagen J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 375: 378-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was used with modification as described previously (15Mihalik S.J. Steinberg S.J. Pei Z. Park J. Kim D.G. Heinzer A.K.

Gould S.J. Smith M.A. Braiterman L.T. Wei H.-M. Kok F. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 292-301PubMed Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, tissues from 3-month-old mice were harvested, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Tissue sections were cut using a cryostat and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as described previously (15Mihalik S.J. Steinberg S.J. Pei Z. Park J. Kim D.G. Heinzer A.K. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Cuebas D.A. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24771-24779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Brain sections were 20-μm-thick. Sections of liver, adrenal gland, testis, and ovary were 5-8-μm-thick. After fixation, sections were incubated for 30 min with 0.6% H2O2 in methanol followed by 20 min with 5% normal goat serum. Sections were then incubated sequentially with Avidin D and biotin for 15 min each (Avidin/Biotin blocking kit, Vector Laboratories). Incubation with primary rabbit antibody (affinity-purified anti-peptide antibody, 1:100) was for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Peroxidase-based detection was done using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). After counterstaining with hematoxylin-Harris stain for 30 s, sections were dehydrated and mounted with DPX-mounting solution (Fluka Biochemika).Acyl-CoA Synthetase and Fatty Acid β-Oxidation Assays—Acyl-CoA synthetase assays utilizing radiolabeled substrates and fatty acid β-oxidation studies of labeled palmitic and lignoceric acids were performed as described previously (17Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Mihalik S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fluorometric assay of acyl-CoA synthetase activity was a coupled assay in which the acyl-CoA product was subsequently oxidized by acyl-CoA oxidase. H2O2 generated in the latter reaction was quantitated using a modification of the method of Guilbault et al. (19Guilbault G.G. Brignac Jr., P.J. Juneau M. Anal. Chem. 1968; 40: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Each reaction tube contained, in a total volume of 250 μl, 10 nmol of unlabeled fatty acid (solubilized with α-cyclodextrin (18Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), 40 mm Tris(Cl-), pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CoA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 units of acyl-CoA oxidase (Sigma), 7.4 units of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), 0.8 mm homovanillic acid (Sigma), and 15 μg of COS-1 cell protein. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 700 μl of 0.83 m Na2CO3, pH 10.7, containing 12.5 mm EDTA. Fluorescence was detected using an Eppendorf Model 1020 fluorometer. For quantitation of fluorescence, a standard curve was created by incubating known amounts of H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C in reaction mixtures lacking fatty acids and cellular protein.Northern Blot and RNA Dot Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from either fresh mouse tissues or tissues that were harvested, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C for less than two months. Twenty nanograms of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel at 4 V/cm for 2.5 h and then transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA probe for detection of mBG1 mRNA was prepared by PCR amplification of a 450-bp fragment using 5′-AGAGTCTCCAAGTCACGGTC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTAGATGCCAGTGACAAT-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and mouse brain cDNA as template. For control, a 528-bp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was similarly prepared using 5′-ACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGTGTAGCCCAGGATGC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Conditions for probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were as described previously (20Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A human multiple tissue expression membrane containing 76 tissues was obtained from Clontech. A cDNA probe for detection of hBG1 mRNA was prepared by PCR amplification of a 1138-bp fragment using 5′-CACGATGGAGGAATTCATGG-3′ and 5′-CACTCTGACCAGACTGATA-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and hBG1 cDNA (5Steinberg S.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) as template.Subcellular Fractionation—Neuro2a cells and mouse tissues were fractionated essentially as described by de Duve et al. (21de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). Three confluent 10-cm dishes of Neuro2a cells were harvested by gentle trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1.3 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris (Cl-), pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and disrupted on ice using three passes through a precision ball-bearing homogenizer (22Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mouse tissue (brain or liver) was homogenized in 5 volumes of the same buffer with a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (3 passes). Homogenates were centrifuged (4 °C) for 30 s at 1500 × g to pellet nuclei (N). The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 × g to sediment a crude mitochondrial fraction (M). The post-mitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g to obtain the peroxisome-enriched “light mitochondrial” fraction (L). The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 435,000 × g to obtain a microsomal pellet (P) and a cytosolic supernatant (S). In some experiments, the crude mitochondrial fraction was further separated into a purified mitochondrial fraction and the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) fraction by centrifugation through a Percoll gradient as described by Vance and co-workers (23Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stone S.J. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34534-34540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).RNA Interference—Three pairs of cDNA oligonucleotides containing complementary sense and antisense mBG1 sequences were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Each 29-mer oligonucleotide contained an upstream AA dinucleotide, 19 bp of mBG1 sequence, and a downstream T7 promoter sequence (CCTGTCTC). Targeted sequences corresponded to bp 19-37, 633-651, and 1766-1784 of the mBG1-coding region. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) 21-mers were synthesized using the Silencer kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. As a control, siRNA corresponding to bp 4-24 of the mouse serum albumin (mSA) coding region was also synthesized. Neuro2a cells (in 100-mm culture dishes, ∼35% confluent) were transfected with a mixture of the three mBG1-specific siRNAs or the mSA-specific siRNA using the siPORT Amine reagent (Ambion). 30 μl of siPORT amine was mixed with 560 μl of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. siRNAs were added to a final concentration of 50 nm, and the incubation was continued for 10 min. This mixture was then added at a final concentration of 5 nm to cells in 2.4 ml of Opti-MEM I. After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator, 7 ml of usual culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum) was added and incubation at 37 °C was continued for up to 6 days.RESULTSSubstrate Specificity of hBG1 Expressed in COS-1 Cells— COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with hBG1 cDNA, and the increase in cellular ACS activity due to expression of hBG1 protein was measured. We previously demonstrated that hBG1 had both LACS and VLACS activity using, respectively, radiolabeled palmitic acid (C16:0) and lignoceric acid (C24:0) substrates (5Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To extend our knowledge of the substrate specificity of this enzyme, we examined the ACS activity toward several saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids using a coupled fluorometric assay. Compared with vector-transfected control COS-1 cells, hBG1-expressing cells activated several saturated fatty acids (C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0), the ω9 monounsaturated fatty acids oleic (C18:1), erucic (C22: 1), and nervonic (C24:1), the ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic (C18:2) and arachidonic (C20:4), and the ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids α-linoleic (C18:3), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5), and docosahexaenoic (C22:6) (Fig. 1). In contrast, hBG1 failed to activate either the β-methyl branched-chain fatty acid phytanic acid or the α-methyl branched-chain fatty acid pristanic acid (data not shown). Thus, when overexpressed in COS-1 cells, hBG1 appears to have a diverse substrate specificity and is able to activate a broad spectrum of unbranched fatty acids. The fluorometric assay was not sensitive enough to detect activation of lignoceric acid (data not shown).Identification of Cell Types Endogenously Expressing mBG1—Previously, using a human multiple tissue Northern blot containing only eight different tissues, we reported that hBG1 was expressed primarily in brain (5Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Moriya-Sato et al. (7Moriya-Sato A. Hida A. Inagawa-Ogashiwa M. Wada M.R. Sugiyama K. Shimizu J. Yabuki T. Seyama Y. Hashimoto N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that in the mouse, BG1 was expressed in adrenal gland and testis as well and Tang et al. (8Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6581-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) noted that rat BG1 was also expressed in ovary. A Northern blot prepared using total RNA from tissues of 3-month-old 129SvEv mice and probed with an mBG1-specific probe indicated that mBG1 was expressed in brain, adrenal gland, testis, ovary, and spleen (Fig. 2A). An RNA dot blot representing 76 different human tissues was also examined with an hBG1-specific antisense probe (Fig. 2B). All of the regions of human brain with the exception of pituitary gland highly expressed hBG1. Modest expression was detected in human testis and adrenal gland, but hBG1 message was not very abundant in ovary or spleenFig. 2Expression of BG1 in mouse and human tissues.A, a Northern blot of mouse tissues was prepared and hybridized with an mBG1-specific probe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mBG1 transcript (upper panel) was ∼3.3 kb in all of the tissues in which it was expressed. The blot was also hybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-specific probe (lower panel) as a loading control. B, a human Multiple Tissue Expression (Clontech) RNA dot blot was probed with an hBG1-specific probe. All of the regions of the brain (columns A, B, and C) with the exception of pituitary gland (C4) had the strongest signals. Brain regions included whole brain, cerebral cortex, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, precentral gyrus, pons (column A, rows 1-8, respectively), left cerebellum, right cerebellum, corpus callosum, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, medulla oblongata, putamen (column B, rows 1-8, respectively), substantia nigra, accumbens nucleus, thalamus (column C, rows 1-3, respectively), and spinal cord (C5).

Lipoproteins are also known to initiate both innate and adaptative immune responses. However, their role in the pathogenicity of intracellular microorganisms is yet poorly understood. In Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive facultative intracellular human pathogen, surface proteins have important roles in the interactions of the microorganism with the host cells. Among the putative surface proteins of L. monocytogenes, lipoproteins constitute the largest family. Here, we addressed the role of the signal peptidase (SPase II), responsible for the maturation of lipoproteins in listerial pathogenesis. We identified a gene, lsp, encoding a SPase II in the genome of L. monocytogenes and constructed a Δlsp chromosomal deletion mutant. The mutant strain fails to process several lipoproteins demonstrating that lsp encodes a genuine SPase II. This defect is accompanied by a reduced efficiency of phagosomal escape during infection of eucaryotic cells, and leads to an attenuated virulence. We show that lsp gene expression is strongly induced when bacteria are still entrapped inside phagosomes of infected macrophages. The data presented establish, thus, that maturation of lipoproteins is critical for efficient phagosomal escape of L. monocytogenes, a process temporally controlled by the regulation of Lsp production in infected cells.

The data presented establish, thus, that maturation of lipoproteins is critical for efficient phagosomal escape of L. monocytogenes, a process temporally controlled by the regulation of Lsp production in infected cells. Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous food-borne Gram-positive bacterium, responsible for life threatening infections in humans and animals (1.Farber J.M. Peterkin P.I. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 476-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a facultative intracellular pathogen able to enter and multiply in both professional (2.Mackaness G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 116: 381-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) and non-professional phagocytes such as epithelial cells (3.Gaillard J.L. Berche P. Mounier J. Richard S. Sansonetti P. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2822-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or hepatocytes (4.Wood S. Maroushek N. Czuprynski C.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3068-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After entry, bacteria rapidly lyse the phagosomal membranes and gain access to the cytosol where they spread to adjacent cells by an actin-based motility process (5.Vazquez-Boland J.A. Kuhn M. Berche P. Chakraborty T. Dominguez-Bernal G. Goebel W. Gonzalez-Zorn B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 584-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Most of the virulence factors of L. monocytogenes, identified to date, are either secreted or surface-associated proteins (6.Cossart P. Bierne H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several distinct mechanisms of cell wall attachment and display of surface proteins have been described in Gram-positive bacteria (7.Cabanes D. Dehoux P. Dussurget O. Frangeul L. Cossart P. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 238-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Among them, bacterial lipoproteins form a subclass of exported proteins that are involved in a broad range of functions such as: (i) substrate-binding proteins, in ABC transporter systems; (ii) antibiotic resistance; (iii) cell signaling; (iv) protein export and folding; and (v) sporulation, germination, and conjugation (8.Sutcliffe I.C. Russell R.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, lipoproteins are known to initiate both innate and adaptative immune responses in activating nuclear factor-κB, cytokine production, and B-cell expansion through the interaction with human Toll-like receptor-2 (9.Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). However, the role of lipoproteins in the pathogenicity of intracellular bacteria is yet poorly understood. Two main genetic approaches can be undertaken to address the role of lipoproteins in pathogenesis. The first one consists of inactivating individually each of the genes encoding putative lipoproteins and study the properties of the mutant strains. This approach requires extensive work because the number of genes to inactivate is important (20 to >100) and may prove inefficient in the case of proteins with overlapping functions. The second approach consists of inactivating the gene encoding the signal peptidase responsible for their maturation. Indeed, the NH2-terminal signal sequences of lipoproteins are specifically processed by a unique signal peptidase, named type II signal peptidase (or SPase II). 1The abbreviations used are: SPase IIsignal peptidase type IIBHIbrain heart infusionBMbone marrow.1The abbreviations used are: SPase IIsignal peptidase type IIBHIbrain heart infusionBMbone marrow. Maturation of lipoproteins by SPase II, initially described in Gram-negative bacteria (10.Tokunaga M. Loranger J.M. Chang S.Y. Regue M. Chang S. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5610-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been recently studied in Gram-positive bacteria, and especially in Bacillus subtilis (11.Leskela S. Wahlstrom E. Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12.Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SPases II remove signal peptides from the lipoproteins first modified by a diacylglyceryltransferase (Lgt). This step could be inhibited by globomycin, a reversible and non-competitive peptide inhibitor (13.Giam C.Z. Hayashi S. Wu H.C. J. Biol.

After cleavage, the step of N-acylation of the cysteine observed in Escherichia coli was not described in B. subtilis, probably because of the absence of the lnt gene responsible of the lipoprotein aminoacyltransferase. signal peptidase type II brain heart infusion bone marrow. signal peptidase type II brain heart infusion bone marrow.

Immun. 2000; 68: 7069-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); and (ii) LpeA an adhesin-like protein favoring entry of L. monocytogenes into non-professional phagocytes (17.Reglier-Poupet H. Pellegrini E. Charbit A. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Individual inactivation of these genes had no effect on bacterial virulence. Here, we focused on a gene, designated lsp, encoding a potential SPase II in the genome of L. monocytogenes. We constructed a Δlsp chromosomal deletion mutant and studied its characteristics. Our analyses demonstrate that the lsp gene product is a genuine SPase II involved in the processing of lipoproteins, and that this process is critical for efficient phagosomal escape and intracellular survival of L. monocytogenes. We also monitored the expression of lsp during the infectious process. The data suggest that maturation of lipoproteins might be temporally controlled by the regulation of Lsp production inside infected cells. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—We used the reference strain of L. monocytogenes EGD-e belonging to serovar 1/2a recently sequenced (15.Glaser P. Frangeul L. Buchrieser C. Rusniok C. Amend A. Baquero F. Berche P. Bloecker H. Brandt P. Chakraborty T. Charbit A. Chetouani F. Couve E. de Daruvar A. Dehoux P. Domann E. Dominguez-Bernal G. Duchaud E. Durant L. Dussurget O.

Science. 2001; 294: 849-852PubMed Google Scholar). Brain heart infusion (BHI; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) and Luria-Bertani (LB, Difco) broth and agar were used to grow L. monocytogenes and E. coli strains, respectively. Strains harboring plasmids were grown in the presence of the following antibiotics: pCR™ derivatives, kanamycin (Km) 50 μg/ml; pAUL-A derivatives, erythromycin (Em) 150 (E. coli) and 5 μg/ml (L. monocytogenes). To analyze mutant bacteria, we studied 50 metabolic characters on API-50 strips (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Genetic Manipulations—Chromosomal DNA, plasmid extraction, electrophoresis, restriction enzyme analysis, and amplification by PCR were performed according to standard protocols (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan, C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.37-17.41Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs and used as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA was amplified with the AmpliTaq DNA polymerase of Thermus aquaticus from PerkinElmer, in a Gene Amp System 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nucleotide sequencing was carried out with Taq dideoxy terminators and the DyePrimer Cycling Sequence protocol developed by Applied Biosystems with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides and primers, respectively (Invitrogen). Labeled extension products were analyzed on an ABI Prism 310 apparatus (Applied Biosystems). Construction of a Δlsp Mutant of L. monocytogenes—A lsp mutant was constructed by deletion of a 200-bp internal fragment of lsp. We inserted a 1,022-bp EcoRI-BamHI EGD-e DNA fragment (-800 to +200) and a 922-bp BamHI-HindIII EGD-e DNA fragment (+400 to +1,300), between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the thermosensitive shuttle vector pAUL-A, as previously described (19.Lingnau A. Domann E. Hudel M. Bock M. Nichterlein T. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to give pAUL-Δlsp. These two DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from the EGD-e genomic DNA using the following primers pairs: Ecolsp5′ (5′-GGAATTCCTTATTCGGAAAATTCCAGGCGCTTTCTTATGG-3′) and Bamlsp3′ (5′-CGCGGATCCGCGACAACAACAGTAATAAGATAGAAAAACC-3′); Bamlsp5′ (5′-CGCGGATCCGCGTTGGTGTCGTACTAATGCTCGTGTATG-3′) and HIIIlsp3′ (5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTCATTCGTTGTCGGATGATCAAATCCTA-3′). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genset (Paris, France). The 2 amplified double-stranded DNA fragments were first cloned into the pCR™ cloning vector using the Invitrogen TA Cloning™ kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid pAUL-Δlsp was electroporated into EGD-e and transformants were selected for Em resistance at 30 °C. Allelic exchange was obtained by homologous recombination using a two-step procedure: at 40 °C, a single crossing-over event integrated the entire plasmid into the chromosome; the plasmid was then excised by subculture at 30 °C. The deletion was confirmed by PCR sequence analysis of chromosomal DNA from the mutant. RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative PCR Assays—To extract RNA of L. monocytogenes grown in Caco-2 cell or bone marrow (BM) macrophages from BALB/c mice, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10, for 30 min, 30 min, and 1 h, respectively. Cells were lysed with 4 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100, the supernatant containing the bacteria was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 × g and the pellet was washed twice with saline buffer. Bacteria were broken in a solution of Trizol (1 ml) (Invitrogen) with miniglass beads using a Bead Beater apparatus (Polylabo) set at maximum speed. RNA was extracted with 300 μl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,000 × g, the aqueous phase was transferred to a tube containing 270 μl of isopropyl alcohol. Total RNA was then precipitated overnight at 4 °C and washed with 1 μl of a 75% ethanol solution before suspension in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Contaminating DNA was removed by digestion with DNase I, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). As a negative control, the same experiment was performed on non-infected cells. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system using Taqman Universal PCR master mixture (PE Applied Biosystems). The primers were designed using the Primer Express software and obtained from PE Applied Biosystems. Sequences were as follows: lsp primers, forward, TATGCCAAAGGAAAGCGACTATT; and reverse, ACCCGGTCGATAAAATTACCAA; gyrA primers, forward, AAATGCGGACATCATTCCTAGACT, and reverse, TTTAACCCGTCACGAACATCAG. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments were carried out with 1 μg of RNA and 2.5 pmol of specific primers for lsp, gyrA, in a volume of 8 μl. After denaturation at 65 °C for 10 min, 12 μl of the mixture containing 2 μl of dNTP (25 mm), 4 μlof4× buffer, 2 μl of dithiothreitol, 1 μl of RNasin (Promega), and 1.5 μl of Superscript II (Invitrogen) was added. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 42 °C, heated at 75 °C for 15 min, and then chilled on ice. Samples were diluted with 40 μl of H2O and stored at -20 °C. PCR conditions were identical for all reactions. The 25-μl reactions consisted of 12.5 μl of PCR master mixture (PE Applied Biosystems) containing Sybr Green, 4 μl of template, 5 pmol of each primer. The reactions were carried out in sealed tubes. Results were normalized to the amount of gyrA mRNA (31.Autret N. Raynaud C. Dubail I. Trieu-Cuot P. Berche P. Charbit A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 4463-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The gene gyrA was chosen because its expression remained constant under the different experimental conditions used here. Each assay was performed in triplicate. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analyses—Protein extracts were prepared from cultures of bacteria grown in BHI broth at 37 °C (at A600 of 0.6 for exponential phase; and after overnight incubation, at A600 of 1.2 for stationary phase). The bacterial pellets were suspended in Tris (10 mm)/EDTA (1 mm) and bacteria were disrupted using a Fastprep FP120 apparatus (BIO 101 Inc., Ozyme) by 2 pulses of 30 s at a speed of 6.5. Lysates were centrifuged and the pellet suspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Electrophoresis and Western blotting were carried out as described previously in SDS-10% polyacrylamide minigels (Mini Protean II; Bio-Rad). Nitrocellulose sheets were probed with anti-ScaA antibody, kindly provided by Dr. Kolenbrander (Bethesda) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibodies were used at a final dilution of 1:1,000. Antibody binding was revealed by adding 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma). Protein Sequencing—Wild-type EGD-e and EGDΔlsp were grown in BHI overnight with agitation at 37 °C. The bacterial pellets were suspended in Tris (10 mm)/EDTA (1 mm) and bacteria were disrupted using a Fastprep FP120 apparatus (BIO 101 Inc., Ozyme) by 2 pulses of 30 s at a speed of 6.5. Denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Protein bands were visualized by staining the membrane with Coomassie Blue. For NH2-terminal sequencing, the two major unknown protein bands observed in the EGDΔlsp were cut from the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer (J. d'Alayer, Laboratoire de Séquencage des Protéines, Institut Pasteur, Paris). Intracellular Growth in Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages from BALB/c mice (IFFA-CREDO, Grenoble, France) were cultured and infected for growth curves at a cell/bacterium ratio of 10:1. Macrophages were exposed for 15 min at 37 °C and non-ingested bacteria were removed by several washings. Infected cells were re-fed with fresh medium (time 0). Confocal Microscopy—Infected cells were examined at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h post-infection. Double fluorescence labeling of F-actin and bacteria was performed as described (20.Lety M.A. Frehel C. Dubail I. Beretti J.L. Kayal S. Berche P. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1124-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using phalloidin coupled to Oregon Green 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and a rabbit anti-Listeria serum (J. Rocourt, Institut Pasteur, Paris), revealed with an anti-IgG antibody coupled to Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes). Images were scanned on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The percentage of phagosomal escape was calculated as described previously (20.Lety M.A. Frehel C. Dubail I. Beretti J.L. Kayal S. Berche P. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1124-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of bacteria per infected cell and the number of infected cells containing bacteria surrounded by polymerized actin were quantified on a mean of 50-100 infected cells, at 1, 2, and 4 h of the infection. Electron Microscopy—At selected intervals following infection (0, 1, 2, and 4 h), BM macrophages were fixed and processed as described previously (20.Lety M.A. Frehel C. Dubail I. Beretti J.L. Kayal S. Berche P. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1124-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. We quantified the percentage of bacteria surrounded by: (i) an intact phagosomal membrane; (ii) a partially damaged membrane; or (iii) polymerized actin. For this purpose, BM macrophages were infected at a ratio of 100:1, to have a sufficient number of bacteria per thin section. Fifty to 100 phagosomes were studied, corresponding to about 50 infected cells. Infection of Caco-2 Cells—We also used the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 (ATCC HTB37) from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The invasion assays were carried out as described previously (17.Reglier-Poupet H. Pellegrini E. Charbit A. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Viable bacteria released from the cells were plated onto BHI plates. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, repeated three times and expressed as mean ± S.D. Mouse Virulence Assays—Six- to eight-week-old female Swiss mice (Janvier, Le Geneset St-Isle, France) were inoculated intravenously (iv) with various doses of bacteria. Mortality was followed over a 14-day period on groups of 5 mice. The lethal doses 50 (LD50) were determined by the Probit method. Bacterial growth was followed in organs (spleen and liver) of mice infected intravenously with 105 bacteria, as previously described (21.Autret N. Dubail I. Trieu-Cuot P. Berche P. Charbit A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2054-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the oral infections, 5-6-week-old-female BALB/c mice were starved for 24 h (water allowed) and were inoculated orally with 4 × 1010 bacteria (in 0.2 ml). This dose was chosen based on previous studies (22.Barbour A.H. Rampling A. Hormaeche C.E. Microbiol. Pathog. 1996; 20: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the small intestines were recovered and rinsed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) to remove the intestinal content. Intestines were then incubated at 20 °C for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 mg/liter gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria from the intestinal lumen and rinsed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Intestinal tissues were finally homogenized in 0.15 m NaCl and plated on BHI agar. The lsp Gene of L. monocytogenes Encodes a Lipoprotein-specific Signal Peptidase—We identified an orf, designated lsp, in the genome of L. monocytogenes EGD-e (15.Glaser P. Frangeul L. Buchrieser C. Rusniok C. Amend A. Baquero F. Berche P. Bloecker H. Brandt P. Chakraborty T. Charbit A. Chetouani F. Couve E. de Daruvar A. Dehoux P. Domann E. Dominguez-Bernal G. Duchaud E. Durant L. Dussurget O.

Science. 2001; 294: 849-852PubMed Google Scholar), encoding a putative SPase II. The protein has 57.5% amino acid identity with Lsp of B. subtilis and is of identical size (154 amino acids in length). Lsp is highly conserved in L. monocytogenes serovar 4b, as well as in the non-pathogenic species Listeria innocua, with 99 and 98.1% amino acid identity, respectively (preliminary sequence data on the 4b strain was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website). 2www.tigr.org. Lsp of EGD-e contains the five conserved domains present in all other known SPases II. In particular, the Asn, Asp, and Ala residues, in domains III and V, which are critical for the activity of B. subtilis SPase II (Ref. 23.Tjalsma H. Zanen G. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28191-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and references therein) are conserved (not shown). An lsp transcript was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR in bacteria grown in broth (“Experimental Procedures”), suggesting that lsp encodes a functional protein. Construction of a Chromosomal Δlsp Deletion—We constructed an lsp knockout mutant of L. monocytogenes (EGDΔlsp) by deletion of a 200-bp internal fragment of lsp, and chromosomal integration by allelic replacement (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The deletion had no effect on bacterial viability in BHI, at all the temperatures tested (i.e. 4, 30, 37, and 42 °C). No difference between the mutant and wild-type strain was observed with respect to microscopic morphology, motility, colony aspect, hemolysis on blood agar plates, metabolic profiles on API strips, or antibiotic resistance profiles (not shown). These data indicate that the lsp gene product of L. monocytogenes is not essential for viability and not required for normal growth in broth. Processing of the Lipoprotein LpeA—We first tested the expression of LpeA, a recently identified lipoprotein of L. monocytogenes (17.Reglier-Poupet H. Pellegrini E. Charbit A. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in wild-type EGD-e and in the Δlsp mutant. For Western blot analyses, we used an antibody directed against ScaA of Streptococcus gordonii (a protein sharing 57% amino acid identity with LpeA of L. monocytogenes) shown to cross-react with LpeA (17.Reglier-Poupet H. Pellegrini E. Charbit A. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two bands were detected in the Δlsp mutant: a minor band with the same apparent molecular weight as that of the single band detected in the wild-type strain; and a major band with a slightly higher apparent Mr (Fig. 1A). This upper band, which likely to corresponds to the precursor form of LpeA, was detected both in the exponential and stationary phases of growth. This assumption was confirmed by testing the expression of LpeA in the wild-type strain, grown in rich medium containing globomycin, an inhibitor of SPases II (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two forms of LpeA were detected after globomycin treatment: a lower band corresponding to mature LpeA; and an upper band corresponding to the unprocessed form of LpeA, with the same apparent Mr as the upper band of the Δlsp mutant. In agreement with these observations, previous studies have shown that B. subtilis cells lacking SPase II accumulate not only the precursor form, but also alternatively processed mature-like forms of lipoproteins PrsA (12.Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). L. monocytogenes Expresses a PrsA-like Protein Processed by Lsp—In B. subtilis, the folding catalyst PrsA is a major lipoprotein that is essential for life (24.Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The chromosome of L. monocytogenes encodes a putative PrsA-like protein (Lmo2219) sharing 45% identity with PrsA of B. subtilis. We tested whether an anti-B. subtilis PrsA antibody (kindly provided by Vesa Kontinen), could cross-react with PrsA of L. monocytogenes in Western blot. A single band was detected in wild-type EGD-e. One band with a slightly higher apparent Mr, likely to correspond to the unprocessed precursor form of PrsA, was detected in the Δlsp mutant (Fig. 1B). As with LpeA, two forms of PrsA were detected after globomycin treatment of the wild-type strain. As expected, the detection of PrsA from B. subtilis extracts (used as a control) was significantly stronger. These results show, thus that: (i) L. monocytogenes expresses a PrsA-like protein antigenically related to PrsA of B. subtilis; and (ii) Lsp is responsible for the maturation of this PrsA homolog. Together, the Western blot analyses demonstrate that the protein encoded by lsp is a genuine SPase II involved in the maturation of lipoproteins, including LpeA and PrsA. Variations in Envelope Protein Composition—The total protein composition was monitored in envelope fractions and culture supernatants, by Bradford protein assay. It was similar in EGD-e and in the Δlsp mutant, in both fractions. To visualize specific effects of lsp inactivation on protein expression, we compared the envelope fractions of the two strains by SDS-PAGE. The two protein patterns were globally similar (Fig. 2), except in the 30-kDa range where several differences were clearly visible. In particular, two major protein bands were detected in the Δlsp mutant extract, and missing in the wild-type extract. NH2-terminal protein sequence analyses (“Experimental Procedures”) revealed that the upper band corresponded to the precursor form of a conserved lipoprotein of as yet unknown function (encoded by lmo2637). Notably, this 299-amino acid long lipoprotein shows significant similarity to a 15-kDa lipoprotein precursor of Treponema pallidum (25.Centurion-Lara A. Arroll T. Castillo R. Shaffer J.M. Castro C. Van Voorhis W.C. Lukehart S.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1440-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a major membrane immunogen in syphilis infection. Peptidic alignment of the two sequences suggests that Lmo2637 is a duplicated form of the 15-kDa antigen (with 44% identity between residues 50 to 168 of Lmo2637 and 22 to 138 of T. pallidum lipoprotein; and 50% identity between residues 184-290 of Lmo2637 and 31-138 of T. pallidum lipoprotein). Lmo2637 also h"

Tetrapyrroles, like the porphyrins heme and chlorophyll, are essential compounds of the metabolism of almost all organisms on earth. They are integral parts of the electron transport chains utilized during photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, various enzymes utilize tetrapyrrole cofactors.

In Escherichia coli two structurally unrelated CPOs, one oxygen-dependent (HemF) and one oxygen-independent (HemN), catalyze this reaction (1Troup B. Jahn M. Hungerer C. Jahn D. J.

The enzymatic mechanisms for both reactions are subjects of controversy. Initial reports on the path of coprogen decarboxylation was obtained using deuterium- and tritium-labeled propionate side chains of the substrate (3Seehra J.S. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The enzymatic decarboxylation of ring A always occurs prior to that of ring B, which was shown through the isolation of the intermediate harderoporphyrinogen (4Jackson A.H. Jones D.M. Philip G. Lash T.D. Batlle A.M. Smith S.G. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 12: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These experiments suggested an antiperiplanar elimination as part of the mechanism for the formation of the two vinyl groups. Three possible mechanisms for the oxygen-dependent vinyl group formation were proposed. One mechanism involves an oxygen-dependent hydroxylation step. The other two mechanisms are variants of the same basic idea, in that formation of the vinyl groups results in the simultaneous hydride abstraction and decarboxylation (5Akhtar M. Jordan P.M. The Biosynthesis of the Tetrapyrrole Pigments. Wiley, Chichester, United Kingdom1994: 131-155Google Scholar). A radical based mechanism was recently elucidated for the oxygen-independent CPO HemN from E. coli (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32507-32510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no significant influence of the various found metal ions on the activity of the different analyzed CPOs was detected. HemF proteins from plant, animal, and bacterial sources possess an amazingly high conserved amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). First results from site-directed mutagenesis approaches using mouse HemF indicated an involvement of one highly conserved histidine residue in catalysis (8Kohno H. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, the importance of tyrosine residues was proposed as potential location for a hypothetical tyrosyl radical (12Yoshinaga T. Sano S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4727-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, common structural properties were proposed for the oxygen-dependent CPO and urate oxidase (13Colloc'h N. Mornon J.P. Camadro J.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Both enzymes utilize oxygen. Based on the assumption that HemF performs a cofactor- and metal ion-independent catalysis a hypothetical enzyme structure was modeled that places HemF into the new family of T-fold proteins. Here we describe the biochemical and biophysical characterization of purified recombinant E. coli CPO. The activity of the enzyme is stimulated by manganese. Molecular oxygen serves as an electron acceptor with results in the generation of H2O2. Catalytically important amino acid residues were identified using site-directed mutagenesis. Construction of the E. coli hemF Expression Vector pCalhemF—A DNA fragment encoding all amino acid residues of E. coli HemF was generated by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA using primer 1 (5′-GAAAAAGGGATCCGTTATGAAACC-3′) and primer 2 (5′-AGCGGATCCTCGAGTGGGGG-3′). The resulting DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI (recognition sequences underlined in the primer sequences) and ligated in the appropriately digested vector pCal-n (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) to generate pCalhemF, which is under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promotor. The integrity of the plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting fusion protein with a calculated molecular mass of 38,325 Da consists of the N-terminal calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) of 4,000 Da fused via a thrombin recognition sequence to E. coli HemF of 34,325 Da. After proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin, three additional amino acids (VPR) instead of the original methionine are localized at the N terminus of HemF. Site-directed Mutagenesis of E. coli hemF—Mutant pCalhemF plasmids encoding E. coli hemF with amino acid exchanges H96L, H106L, H145L, H175L, C167S, Y135F, Y160F, Y170F, Y213F, Y240F, W36L, W123L, W166L, W274L, W298L, W124R, G127V, T132A, and P133A were constructed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The primer used to generate the mutations were: H96L forward, 5′-GGCGTTTCACTGGTAGTGCTTCCGCATAACCCG-3′; H106L forward, 5′-CCCACCAGCCTCGCGAATGTGCGG-3′; H145L forward, 5′-GCTATTCACTGGCTTCGCACCGCC3′; H175L forward, 5′-CTTCTACCTCAAACTTCGCAACGAACAGCG3′; C167S forward, 5′-CCCCGTTACAAAAAGTGGTCCGACGAATACTTCTAC-3′; Y135F forward, 5′-CGACTTAACCCCATTCTTTGGTTTTGAAGAAGAT-3′; Y160F forward, 5′-CCATTTGGCGAAGACGTTTTTCCCCGTTACAAAAAG-3′; Y170F forward, 5′-GTTGTGCGACGAATTCTTCTACCTCAAACATCGC-3′; Y213F forward, 5′-GCTACACCGACGCTTTTTTACCAATTGTCGAGCG-3′; Y240F forward, 5′-CGCGGTCGTTTTGTCGAGTTCAATCTGGTCTGG-3′; Y276F forward, 5′-CTGGTACGCTGGGAATTTGATTATCAGCCAAAAGATG-3′; W36L forward, 5′-GTCGAAGATAGTTTGCAGCGCGAAGCTG-3′; W123L forward, 5′CGATCCCGTCTTGTGGTTTGGCGGTG-3′; W124R forward, 5′-GATCCCGTCTGGAGGTTTGGCGGTGGC-3′; W166L forward, 5′-CCCCGTTACAAAAAGTTGTGCGACGAATACTTC-3′; W274L forward, 5′-GCCACTGGTACGCTTGGAATATGATTATCAGC-3′; W298L forward, 5′-GGTCAGGGATTTGGTGTAACTCCCTCAC-3′; G127V forward, 5′-CTGGTGGTTTGGCGTTGGCTTCGACTTAACC-3′; T132A forward, 5′-GCTTCGACTTAGCCCCATTCTATGG-3′, P133A forward, 5′-GCTTCGACTTAACCGCATTCTATGGTTTTG-3′. All mutated hemF genes were subjected to complete DNA sequence determination. Overexpression of E. coli hemF and Purification of HemF—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the wild type or mutated pCalhemF were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). When the cultures reached an A578 of 0.7 protein production was induced by addition of 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were further cultivated at 30 °C overnight, harvested, washed three times using buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100), and resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer A. Cells were broken by sonification (Bandelin HD 2070, 0.3 s sound, 0.7 s paused, MS73 tipp, 50% amplitude) and cleared by centrifugation at 175,000 × g for 45 min. Proteins of the supernatant were incubated with calmodulin affinity material (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C with rigorous shaking overnight for efficient CBP-HemF binding. After washing three times with buffer A the bound CBP-HemF fusion protein was eluted in 10 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 0,1% Triton X-100 including 10 mm calmodulin inhibitor W7, obtained from Sigma). After concentration and desalting of the CBP-HemF solution the CBP tag was cleaved off using 50–70 units of thrombin protease per 4 mg of fusion protein in buffer C (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 200 mm NaCl). The CBP of 3,646 Da was removed from E. coli HemF via dialysis using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of 20,000. The homogeneity and integrity of the purified HemF was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, N-terminal protein sequencing, and mass spectrometry. Determination of Protein Concentration—The BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. N-terminal Protein Sequencing and Mass Spectrometry—The N terminus of the purified enzyme was determined by Edman degradation as described before (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The molecular mass was determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as outlined before (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Determination of the Native Molecular Mass of HemF—The relative native molecular mass of HemF was determined using gel permeation chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation as previously described (15Frankenberg N. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13968-13975Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis was performed as outlined before (15Frankenberg N. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13968-13975Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). UV-Visible Light Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra (190 to 730 nm) were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer as described before (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Assay Using Recombinant HemF— The substrate coprogen was generated as described previously (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In a total volume of 500 μl of 334 nm HemF, 20 μm coprogen, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm MES/HCl, pH 6.0, were incubated at 37 °C for 10–20 min under rigorous shaking at 1000 rpm in the dark. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of H2O2 to oxidize generated protogen and residual coprogen. After 10–20 min oxidation the fluorescence of the produced proto was measured as described before (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For kinetic HemF characterization a total reaction volume of 5 ml was employed, 500-μl samples were taken at the indicated time points and processed as outlined above. Anaerobic HemF Preparation and Testing—Growth conditions for E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pCalhemF, enzyme production and purification were identical to what is outlined above with the exception of the following introduced modifications. For strict anaerobic conditions E. coli BL21 carrying pCalhemF were grown anaerobically in anaerobic flasks with shaking at 100 rpm. Induction of protein production by the addition of 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was performed at an A578 of 0.2. Cells were broken under strict anaerobic conditions using a French press (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The preparation of the cell-free extract and chromatographic enzyme purification were performed in an anaerobic chamber under nitrogen atmosphere (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed up to 48 h under strict anaerobic conditions as outlined above. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis—Enzyme assays were performed as outlined above. HPLC analysis of HemF product formation was performed as described previously (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using separation on a ODS Hypersil C18 reversed phase column (5 μm, 120 Å pore width, 25-cm length, 4.6-mm inner diameter). Detection of H2O2 Produced during the Enzyme Reaction—Enzyme assays were performed as outlined above without adding H2O2 to stop the reaction. Detection of hydrogen peroxide produced during the enzyme reaction was performed using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase assay kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). Metal Ion Analysis—Metal analysis was performed by flame ionization atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer 3100 atomic absorption spectrometer. Manganese was measured at 279.5 nm, iron at 248.3 nm, and copper at 327.4 nm using a manganese, iron, or copper hollow cathode lamp. The metal standards were purchased from Merck (Germany). Production, Purification, and Initial Biochemical Characterization of Recombinant E. coli HemF—A T7 RNA polymerase driven system was used to produce E. coli HemF as a N-terminal fusion protein with the CBP. Affinity chromatography on a calmodulin affinity matrix resulted in apparent homogenous fusion protein as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3). Usually, the employed affinity chromatography material is eluted using the metal chelator EGTA for the removal of the Ca2+ ions that mediate CBP binding to the calmodulin affinity resin. However, we soon discovered significant HemF inactivation by EGTA treatment because of the complexation of the obviously required metal ions. Alternatively, we established a purification scheme in which the affinity column was eluted with the calmodulin inhibitor W7. Subsequently, the CBP tag was removed from recombinant purified HemF using thrombin cleavage and dialysis. The apparent homogeneity and integrity of E. coli HemF was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing. The N-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme determined by Edman degradation (VPRMKPDAHQVKQFLLNLQDT) was found identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from E. coli HemF plus three additional N-terminal amino acids left from the cleavage of the fusion protein. Recombinant purified E. coli HemF showed a dimeric structure when analyzed by gel permeation chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation (data not shown). This is in good agreement with the mainly dimeric CPOs isolated from animal, yeast, and plant sources (16Yoshinaga T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Labbe P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Catalytic and Spectral Properties of E. coli HemF—Two different enzymatic test systems were previously employed for the determination of HemF activity. One test uses a fluorimetric and the other test a radiochemical detection. As a consequence of the different sensitivities of both test systems significant discrepancies in the measured kinetic parameters for various HemFs from various organisms were observed. The Km values for coproporphyrinogen III obtained for eukaryotic CPOs varied from <1 to >10 μm depending on the employed assay. In this investigation a fast and sensitive fluorimetric assay was employed (17Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Planta. 1995; 196: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The product of the enzymatic reaction (protogen) was first chemically oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to proto, which was subsequently quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy. Using this method a Km value of 2.6 μm, a kcat value of 0.17 min-1, and a Vmax value of 1.3 μm min-1 mg-1 was determined for E. coli HemF and its substrate coproporphyrinogen III. Identification of the enzymatic reaction product protogen was achieved using HPLC (Fig. 4). The pH optimum of the enzyme was localized at 6. This value is much lower compared with values obtained for eukaryotic CPOs that showed pH optima between 6.8 and 8.6. Recombinant HemF was unable to convert protogen to proto, which is in contrast to an earlier publication (18Narita S. Taketani S. Inokuchi H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that describes this oxidation for E. coli CPOs. In addition no inhibition by coprogen and protogen was observed as it had been described for eukaryotic CPO (19Jones M.A. He J. Lash T.D. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Mamet R. Scharf R. Keller N. Zimmels Y. Schoenfeld N. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1994; 19: 173-178Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Only the addition of 20 μm proto significantly inhibited HemF activity, whereas all other compounds including coproporphyrin and deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4-disulfuric acid revealed no effect (see Table II). The UV-visible spectrum of purified E. coli HemF showed a Soret band at 410 nm besides the classic protein band at 283 nm. Together with 4 smaller peaks at 503, 540, 570, and 630 nm this spectrum is typical for enzymebound porphyrin compounds (Fig. 5, spectrum A), (21Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. 2nd Ed. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1976Google Scholar). Control experiments including the spectral analysis of HemF incubated with various known porphyrins indicated the presence of bound protoporphyrin. The physiological relevance of this observation remains to be determined.Table IIInfluence of chelating reagents, metalions, nucleotides, and possible inhibitors on enzyme activityTreatmentaPurified recombinant E. coli HemF was preincubated with additions listed above for 60 min at 37 °C.

Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Later enzyme requires an aerobic activation by oxygen for the formation of a protein radical. After radical formation it is able to perform multiple rounds of catalysis even under strict anaerobic conditions because of the regeneration of the enzyme radical. In this context it is important to remember that oxygen-independent CPO HemN is an enzyme generating the catalytically required radical via the homolytic cleavage of reduced S-adenosylmethionine (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To discriminate between a function of oxygen in radical formation or a possible single turnover function as electron acceptor purified recombinant HemF was analyzed under anaerobic conditions. HemF enzyme was anaerobically produced and purified to prevent the contact to molecular oxygen. As expected, this enzyme preparation failed to catalyze coprogen conversion under anaerobic conditions. This observation confirms the absolute oxygen requirement for HemF function. However, if HemF is exposed to oxygen during the recombinant protein production, but purified and tested anaerobically, a single turnover reaction can be monitored (Table I). These observations support an electron acceptor function for oxygen.Table ISubstrate turnovers catalyzed by HemF prepared and tested in the presence and absence of oxygenPrecultureMain cultureProtein purificationEnzyme assaya334 nmol of HemF were incubated at 37 °C under standard assay conditions under aerobic or strict anaerobic conditions as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction was started by the addition of 20 μmol of substrate.

Open table in a new tab Hydrogen Peroxide Development during E. coli HemF Catalysis—To follow oxygen reduction during coprogen oxidation, hydrogen peroxide formation was determined using a sensitive commercial detection system. After calibration of the system hydrogen peroxide generation during HemF catalysis was observed (data not shown). E. coli HemF Is a Manganese-dependent CPO—The involvement of molecular oxygen during the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by E. coli HemF made the participation of metal ions very likely. Enzyme assays employing HemF pretreated with various metal chelators were performed. EGTA treatment resulted in a significant loss of CPO activity of HemF. Different metal ions in concentrations between 0.25 and 20 mm were added to the enzyme assay. Only the presence of manganese ions restored CPO activity with a maximum enzyme activity at a concentration of 10 mm. Other divalent metal ions including copper, iron, magnesium, cobalt, and nickel failed to reactivate HemF (Table II). In agreement with the observed metal dependence the enzyme was inhibited by low concentrations of heavy metal ions (Table II). To investigate for a structural function of the bound manganese, gel permeation chromatography analysis was performed. Both native HemF and EGTA-treated enzyme showed a dimeric structure (data not shown). CD spectroscopy revealed no detectable difference between EGTA-treated and native HemF (data not shown). Therefore, a possible role of manganese for the maintenance of its dimeric structure was ruled out. Alternatively, participation of manganese in catalysis seemed to be possible. Identification of Histidine and Tryptophan Residues Essential for E. coli HemF Activity—To initially analyze E. coli HemF for the participation of specific amino acid residues in catalysis and metal binding, chemical protein modification experiments were carried out. Previous studies using eukaryotic CPOs pointed toward a possible involvement of tyrosine (12Yoshinaga T. Sano S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4727-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and histidine residues (8Kohno H. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in enzyme activity. In agreement with these observations, treatment of HemF with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenylbromide, N-chlorosuccinimide, diethylpyrocarbonate, iodoacetamide, and tetranitromethane indicated the importance of histidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan residues for E. coli HemF activity (data not shown). To directly identify amino acid residues required for enzyme activity we mutated the codons for 6 highly conserved tyrosine residues in positions 135, 160, 170, 213, 240, and 276, for the conserved cysteine residue in position 167, for 6 tryptophan residues in positions 36, 123, 124, 166, 274, and 298, and for 4 histidine residues in positions 96, 106, 145, and 175 (Fig. 2). The purified recombinant E. coli HemFs bearing a mutated amino acid residue were first kinetically analyzed. Table III shows that mutation of each one of the four highly conserved histidine residues and of one tryptophan residue resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity. Interestingly, the same histidine residues were mutated in the mouse enzyme (8Kohno H. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), where only the mutation H158L, which corresponds to H106L in E. coli, abolished enzyme activity. None of the mutated tyrosine residues were found to be essential for enzyme activity. CD spectroscopy of the various mutated enzymes showed that none of the introduced mutations caused a significant change in protein structure (data not shown). A short conserved sequence motif (GGGXXTP) was also found in oxygen-independent CPOs (HemN) and some other nucleotide-binding enzymes (6Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). We introduced four mutations of this sequence motif, each introducing a single amino acid residue exchange. However, none of these amino acid exchanges influenced enzyme activity (Table III, last four rows). In agreement, addition of several different nucleotides to the oxygen-dependent CPO activity assay did not change enzyme activity (Table II).Table IIIKinetic parameters of produced HemF mutantsHemF enzymeaHemF mutant enzymes were produced and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ActivitybEnzymatic assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”KmVmaxBound manganesecManganese detection was performed via atomic absorption spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.”%μmnm/minWild type1002.61.3+C167S1001.63NTdNT, not tested.H96LNDeND, not detectable.NDND-H106LNDNDND-H145LNDNDND(-)fParentheses indicate varying manganese content (see text for details).H175LNDNDND(-)Y135F1003.82.6NTY160F1053.52.4NTY170F954.12.8NTY213F9732.3NTY240F9924NTY276F1004.33NTW36L984.33NTW123L1033.32.7NTW166L10032NTW274LNDNDND+W298L1023.22.2NTW124R1003.61NTG127V1052.11.7NTT132A11032NTP133A983.52.5NTa HemF mutant enzymes were produced and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Enzymatic assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c Manganese detection was performed via atomic absorption spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.”d NT, not tested.e ND, not detectable.f Parentheses indicate varying manganese content (see text for details). Open table in a new tab Histidine Residues Potentially Involved in Manganese and Porphyrin Binding—The essential histidine residues could be involved in metal binding or in other important catalytic processes. Interestingly, the UV-visible spectra of HemF-H96L, HemF-H106L, and HemF-H145L were identical to the spectrum of the wild type enzyme, whereas the HemF mutant H175L showed no absorbance related to bound porphyrins (Fig. 5). This observation might indicate a possible role of histidine 175 in substrate or product binding. The wild type enzyme and various inactive HemF mutant enzymes were subjected to metal analysis using atomic absorption spectroscopy. No significant amounts of iron or copper were detected. Because of the incomplete manganese insertion into recombinant wild type HemF, indicated by the strong stimulation of enzyme activity by the addition of manganese to the purified protein, only 0.2 to 0.6 mol of manganese/mol of HemF were measured. In contrast to that, mutant HemF H106L did not contain detectable amounts of manganese, whereas H96L showed a significantly reduced manganese content. However, the manganese content of H145L and H175L varied between different preparations within a range of 0.04 to 0.4 mol of manganese/mol of subunit (H145L) and 0.005 to 0.5 mol of manganese/mol of subunit (H175L). This observation points toward a potential, however, not essential role of this residues in metal chelation. Nevertheless, all investigated mutations of histidine residues lead to a complete inactivation of HemF. The potential double function of His-175 in substrate/product binding and manganese coordination is subject to ongoing work. The Role of Manganese in E. coli HemF Activity—In nature manganese is found to coordinate and activate oxygen. One example for such a manganese containing enzyme is oxalate oxidase, which converts oxalic acid using oxygen to CO2 and H2O2 (25Lane B.G. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Biochemical and spectroscopic studies demonstrated that barley oxalate oxidase utilizes a mononuclear manganese center for catalysis (26Requena L. Bornemann S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Woo E.J. Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism for the barley enzyme includes the involvement of a Mn(III)-superoxo form in catalysis (28Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In light of the radical enzyme mechanism elucidated for the oxygen-independent CPO HemN a possible role of HemF-bound manganese could lay in the binding of O2 to produce a Mn(III)-superoxo species. The formed radical leads to the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the β-C atom of the propionate side chain of the substrate and the formation of a substrate radical (Fig. 6A). During the final formation of the vinyl group with the elimination of CO2, oxygen could function as electron acceptor leading to hydrogen peroxide formation. Alternatively, a purely structural but essential role of manganese without any participation in the enzymatic mechanism is a second possibility (Fig. 6B). To our knowledge currently there is no proven model available for an oxygen-dependent enzyme mechanism without cofactor or metal participation. Nevertheless, at this state we cannot experimentally distinguish between these two possible roles of manganese in HemF function. We thank Dr. E. Schiltz (University Freiburg, Germany) for protein sequencing, Dr. Igloi (University Freiburg, Germany) for DNA sequencing, and C. Warth for the mass spectrometry analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2055988483,"We used an RNA interference (RNAi) library in a forward genetic selection to study the mechanism of toxicity of tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) to procyclic Trypanosoma brucei. Following transfection of cells with an RNAi-based genomic library, we used 5 μm tubercidin to select a drug-resistant cell line. Surprisingly, we found in these resistant cells that the hexose transporters had been silenced. We subsequently found that silencing of hexokinase, a glycolytic enzyme, also yielded tubercidin-resistant parasites. These observations suggested that glycolysis could be a target of tubercidin action and that RNAi silencing of glycolytic enzymes was gradual enough to allow the parasites to adapt to alternative sources of energy. Indeed, adaptation of procyclic trypanosomes to a glucose-independent metabolism by reduction of glucose in the culture medium caused tubercidin resistance. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of glycolytic intermediates from parasites treated with tubercidin showed a dose-dependent increase in concentration of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a substrate of phosphoglycerate kinase. Furthermore, tubercidin triphosphate inhibited recombinant T. brucei phosphoglycerate kinase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 7.5 μm. We conclude that 5 μm tubercidin kills trypanosomes by targeting glycolysis, especially by inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2119261703,"Endogenous interferon γ (IFNγ) promotes the host response to primary tumors, and IFNγ-insensitive tumors display increased tumorigenicity and can evade tumor surveillance mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that activating mutations of Ki-ras are sufficient to inhibit the expression of STAT1 and STAT2, transcription factors required for signaling by IFNs, providing a potential mechanism for the insensitivity of tumors to IFNs. We demonstrated that colon cancer cell lines with Ki-ras mutations display reduced expression of IFN-responsive genes compared with the cell lines that have retained wild type Ras and that inactivation of the mutant Ki-ras allele in the HCT116 colon cancer cell line is sufficient to restore the expression of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-9. Accordingly, the expression of 27 interferon-inducible genes was reduced in HCT116 cells compared with the isogenic clones with targeted deletion of the mutant Ki-ras allele, Hkh2 and Hke-3. The expression of IFNγ receptors did not differ among the isogenic cell lines. IFNγ stimulated transcription of a STAT1-dependent reporter gene was impaired by RasV12, demonstrating a transmodulation of IFN/STAT signaling by activated Ras. Finally, we demonstrated that the expression of RasV12 in 293T cells is sufficient to inhibit the endogenous expression of STAT1 and STAT2, confirming the negative regulation of IFN signaling by oncogenic Ras. Our data demonstrate that the signaling initiated by activated Ki-ras interferes with the IFN/STAT signaling pathway and modulates the responsiveness of cancer cells to interferons. Furthermore, the data suggest that tumors harboring activating Ki-ras mutations may escape tumor surveillance mechanisms due to reduced responsiveness to IFNγ. Endogenous interferon γ (IFNγ) promotes the host response to primary tumors, and IFNγ-insensitive tumors display increased tumorigenicity and can evade tumor surveillance mechanisms.

Our data demonstrate that the signaling initiated by activated Ki-ras interferes with the IFN/STAT signaling pathway and modulates the responsiveness of cancer cells to interferons. Furthermore, the data suggest that tumors harboring activating Ki-ras mutations may escape tumor surveillance mechanisms due to reduced responsiveness to IFNγ. Point mutations that activate the Ki-ras protooncogene are present in up to 50% of sporadic colorectal tumors (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4260) Google Scholar). The majority of the Ki-ras mutations are gain-of-function mutations at codon 12 and 13, and activated Ki-ras has been shown to synergize with both APC (2D'Abaco G.M. Whitehead R.H. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and p53 mutations (3Sevignani C. Wlodarski P. Kirillova J. Mercer W.E. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. Calabretta B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in the transformation of colonic epithelial cells. In addition, recent reports suggested that the acquisition of an activated Ki-ras mutation may be sufficient for transformation of epithelial cells (4Janssen K.P. el-Marjou F. Pinto D. Sastre X. Rouillard D. Fouquet C. Soussi T. Louvard D. Robine S. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 492-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Smith G. Carey F.A. Beattie J.

Oncogenic forms of Ras are locked in their active state and thereby transduce signals for transformation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in the absence of extracellular stimuli (6Rebollo A. Martinez A.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Signaling transmitted through Ras results in activation of several downstream effectors, with the Raf-ERK1/ERK2, PI3/AKT, and RalGDS pathways playing crucial roles in the modulation of target gene expression (8Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In addition, activated Ras has been shown to positively regulate signaling by several transcription factors, such as ELK-1, serum response factor (SRF), members of the AP-1 family, and NF-κB (9Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d887-d912Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ras signaling has been shown to inhibit nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of Smad2 and Smad3 and thereby represses signaling by TGF-β, an important negative regulator of epithelial cell proliferation (10Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To identify additional effectors of Ras signaling, we performed a genome-wide survey of Ras target genes utilizing the system of isogenic cell lines, HCT116, Hkh2, and Hke-3, which differ only in the presence of the activated Ki-ras allele. In the HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line targeted deletion of the activated Ki-ras resulted in reduced proliferation, accompanied by reduced expression of c-myc, loss of the capacity for anchorage independent growth, and reduced tumorigenicity of cells in vivo (11Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In accord with published data (12Zuber J. Tchernitsa O.I. Hinzmann B. Schmitz A.C. Grips M. Hellriegel M. Sers C. Rosenthal A. Schafer R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), target genes of activated Ki-Ras included signaling molecules, transcription factors, and proteins modulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Among the genes whose expression was inhibited in cells that harbor Ki-ras mutation were several IFN target genes, including STAT1, STAT2, and p48 (interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-9), transcription factors which themselves mediate signaling by both type I (α/β) and type II (γ) IFNs. 1The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonRTreverse transcriptaseβ2Mβ2-microglobulinWTwild typeMTmutantMHCmajor histocompatibility complexIRFinterferon regulatory factorPI3Kphosphatidylinostiol 3-kinaseCBPcAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonRTreverse transcriptaseβ2Mβ2-microglobulinWTwild typeMTmutantMHCmajor histocompatibility complexIRFinterferon regulatory factorPI3Kphosphatidylinostiol 3-kinaseCBPcAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein. interferon reverse transcriptase β2-microglobulin wild type mutant major histocompatibility complex interferon regulatory factor phosphatidylinostiol 3-kinase cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein. interferon reverse transcriptase β2-microglobulin wild type mutant major histocompatibility complex interferon regulatory factor phosphatidylinostiol 3-kinase cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein. IFNγ initiates signaling by binding to its receptor, which results in transphosphorylation and activation of JAK1/JAK2 and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT1. Upon phosphorylation at Tyr701, STAT1 is released from the IFNγ receptor and forms STAT1 homodimers. Dimers translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of target genes which harbor GAS (gamma-activated site) sites in their promoter region (reviewed in Refs. 13Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar and 14Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). Binding of IFN α/β to the type I receptor results in transphosphorylation and activation of the Jak1/Tyk 2 kinase (15Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 16Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2466-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activated kinases elicit tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT1 and STAT2, which subsequently recruit the DNA-binding protein subunit, p48 (IRF-9) (17Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Bluyssen H.A. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). STAT1, STAT2, and p48 form a heterotrimeric transcription factor complex, ISGF-3, which activates genes that contain an ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) site (19Dale T.C. Rosen J.M. Guille M.J. Lewin A.R. Porter A.G. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although STAT1 was thought to be required for the expression of the IFNγ target genes, IFNγ has recently been shown to modulate the expression of its target genes in STAT1 deficient cells (21Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 22Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Han Y. Ransohoff R.M. Schreiber R.D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), demonstrating that IFNγ modulates the expression of a subset of its target genes in the absence of functional STAT1. The importance of intact IFNγ signaling and STAT1 in tumor surveillance has been established also in vivo. Mice with a targeted deletion of the IFNγ receptor and STAT1–/– mice display increased incidence of tumor formation in response to methylcholanthrene, and STAT-1 deficiency accelerated spontaneous tumor formation in mice with a p53 null background (24Kaplan D.H. Shankaran V. Dighe A.S. Stockert E. Aguet M. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7556-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Similarly, mouse embryonal fibroblasts with a targeted deletion of the IFNαR1 undergo spontaneous transformation, and mutant mice develop papilloma of the skin at a high incidence when treated with a chemical carcinogen (25Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanai H. Stoiber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shibue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2003; 424: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The ability of IFNs to regulate cell cycle progression, to induce cell differentiation, and to modulate the immune response has also led to intensive investigation of interferons as potential antitumor agents (26Vilcek J. Science. 1970; 168: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 27Sun M. Science. 1981; 212: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 28Marx J.L. Science. 1979; 204: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The majority of cancer cell lines and primary tumors, however, are resistant to IFNs (24Kaplan D.H. Shankaran V. Dighe A.S. Stockert E. Aguet M. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7556-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Cancer cells have been shown to acquire resistance to IFN through deletion of the IFNα/β locus (29Colamonici O.R. Domanski P. Platanias L.C. Diaz M.O. Blood. 1992; 80: 744-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or down-regulation or alterations of the IFNα receptor (30Billard C. Sigaux F. Castaigne S. Valensi F. Flandrin G. Degos L. Falcoff E. Aguet M. Blood. 1986; 67: 821-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several cancers resistant to the anti-proliferative action of IFNs have been shown to have defects in the expression of transcription factors required for IFN signaling (31Abril E. Real L.M. Serrano A. Jimenez P. Garcia A. Canton J. Trigo I. Garrido F. Ruiz-Cabello F. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1998; 47: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Clifford J.L. Walch E. Yang X.

Devenish R.J. Ralph S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28779-28785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of the expression of these transcription factors in cancer cells have not been elucidated. The reconstitution of STAT1 suppressed the tumorigenicity of RAD-105 cells in vivo, which correlated with decreased expression of proangiogenic molecules such as bFGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9, demonstrating that STAT1 acts as an important inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and therefore negatively regulates tumor growth and metastasis (35Huang S. Bucana C.D. Van Arsdall M. Fidler I.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the expression of STAT1 and STAT2 is negatively regulated by an activating Ki-ras mutation, suggesting that tumors harboring activating Ki-ras mutations may escape tumor surveillance mechanisms due to reduced IFNγ sensitivity. Cells and Western Blot Analysis—The HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell line, and its two clonal derivatives Hkh2 and Hke-3 that lack the mutant Ki-ras allele (11Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), were cultured under standard conditions in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cell lysates were prepared and Western blot analysis performed using standard procedures. Briefly, 50 μg of total cell lysates were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was incubated with antibodies for 3 h at room temperature and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for visualization of immune complexes. The surface expression of the IFNγRα chain was determined by immunofluorescence. Cells were incubated with an anti IFNγRα antibody for 30 min on ice and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum. After incubation, cells were stained with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate for 30 min. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assay—Plasmid 8×GAS-p36LUC was kindly provided to us by Dr. C. Glass. It contains eight GAS sites cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA per 12-well plate using the calcium phosphate method. Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with pTK-renilla (Promega, dual-luciferase reporter assay system). Cells were either left untreated or were treated with IFNγ (100 ng/ml) or IFNβ (100 units/ml). The basal transcriptional activity of STAT1, as well as IFN inducible activity, was determined 48 h after transfection (e.g. 24 h after treatment). The expression vector CMV-RASV12 was purchased from Clontech. cDNA Microarray Analysis—We used microarray slides produced by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, containing 9216 or 27,224 sequences and identified sequences that are differentially expressed in HCT116 cells compared with the two clones with a disrupted mutant Ki-Ras allele. Only genes with a signal/background ratio > 1.25 were further analyzed. Using these criteria, on average 70% of sequences were included in the analysis. We considered sequences as potential Ki-Ras target genes if the ratio of the signals between HCT116 and either Hkh2 or Hke-3 cells was greater than 1.5 (Ki-Ras up-regulated genes) or less than 0.6 (Ki-Ras down-regulated genes). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Midi kit (Quiagen) as suggested by the manufacturer. 100 μg of RNA from HCT116 cells was labeled with Cy3 (channel 1) and RNA from Hke-3 or Hkh2 cells with Cy5 (channel 2) fluorescent dye. After hybridization and washing (36Mariadason J.M. Corner G.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4561-4572PubMed Google Scholar), slides were scanned (532 nm/Cy3 and 633 nm/Cy5), and the two images were superimposed and quantified using Scanalyze 1.41 software. Data were imported into an Access data base for further analysis. The expression profile for HCT116 cells is presented as the intensity of channel 1 corrected for the background (ch1I/B), and expression data for Hkh2 or Hke-3 cells as the intensity of channel 2 corrected for the background (ch2I/B). Only genes with a signal/background ratio > 1.25 in both Hkh2 and Hke-3 clones were further analyzed. Results are expressed as the ratio between intensity of signal in HCT116 and Hke-3 cells or between HCT116 and Hkh2 cells. The expression level of the IFN target genes was similarly assayed by array analysis in a panel of 12 colon carcinoma cell lines and compared with reference RNA, representing a pool of RNA isolated from a panel of 12 colorectal cancer cell lines. cDNA microarray analysis was performed using microarray slides comprising 9216 cloned sequences produced by the Microarray Facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Microarray experiments were repeated twice and the data shown in Table II represent the average gene expression. For detailed analysis of the entire data base, see Mariadason et al. (79Mariadason J.

Primer sequences were as follows: IFN/TETRA1 (forward), 5′-TTCCACTATGGTCGGTTTCA-3′; IFN/TETRA1 (reverse), 5′-GAGGCTCAAGCTTTCCAGAT-3′; β2M (forward), 5′-TGTGCTCGCGCTACTCTCTCT-3′; β2M (reverse), 5′-GTCAACTTCAATGTCGGATGGA-3′; IRF-9 (forward), 5′-CCGTGATAATCGTGTCCTGAAA-3′; IRF-9 (reverse), 5′-CCTGGGTTCACACCATTTGG-3′; PKR (forward), 5′-ATGATGGAAAGCGAACAAGGA-3′; PKR (reverse), 5′-GTTTCAAAAGCAGTGTCACATACATG-3′; c-myc (forward), 5′-CGTCTCCACACATCAGAGCACAA-3′; c-myc (reverse), 5′-TTGGCAGCAGGATAGTCCTT-3′. Experiments were done in triplicate and the expression of each gene was standardized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a reference. Amplification reactions were run using a 7900HT real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The results were expressed as the ratio between the expression of the IFN target gene and the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Expression of IFN-responsive Genes Is Repressed in a Panel of Colon Cancer Cell Lines That Harbor a Ki-Ras Mutation—To identify profiles of gene expression that predict the response of colon cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, we performed genome-wide analysis of 30 colorectal cell lines. A detailed statistical analysis of the entire data base has been published elsewhere (79Mariadason J. Arango D. Wilson A.J. Corner G.A. Nicholas C. Aranes M.J. Schwartz E.L. Shi Q. Lesser M.

To study the mechanism whereby activating mutations of Ki-ras promote tumorigenesis we selected from the data base 12 cells lines with diverse Ki-ras status and compared their gene expression profile. Six of these cell lines harbor an oncogenic mutation in the Ki-ras protooncogene (Dld1 (G13D), HCT15 (G13D), HCT116 (G13D), LoVo (G12D), SW480 (G12V), and SW620 (G12V)) and six cell lines have wild type (WT) Ki-ras (Caco-2, Colo201, HT29, RKO, T84, and WiDr). cDNA microarray analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the expression of IFN-dependent genes was compared with reference RNA, prepared from a panel of 12 colon carcinoma cell lines. The experiments were performed twice and the average level of gene expression was used to present the data in Table I. The data for the 12 arrays were analyzed by unsupervised clustering, using the Cluster and Treeview programs. The duplicates clustered together, illustrating the high degree of reproducibility of the microarray data. In addition, Dld1 and HCT15, cell lines derived from the same colon carcinoma by two independent laboratories, clustered closely together. Likewise, SW480 and SW620, cell lines generated from a primary and metastatic cancer from the same patient, also clustered together, demonstrating a high degree of sensitivity and reproducibility of the gene expression profiling (79Mariadason J.

Open table in a new tab When we analyzed the data base generated from the 12 cell lines with diverse Ki-ras status, we noticed that the expression of 20 IFN-responsive genes was reduced in six cell lines that harbor activating mutation of Ki-ras, compared with the six cell lines with WT Ki-ras. 20 genes were included in our analysis based on two criteria: 1) the gene had to be described as an IFN-responsive gene, 2) the signal from the microarray experiment had to be larger than the background + 1 S.D. in at least 11 of the 12 cell lines examined. The expression of IFN-responsive genes varied among the cell lines. Cell lines used in the experiment were grouped based solely on the Ki-ras status; however, they also differ in other genetic markers, such as mutations in p53, Apc, β-catenin. Such changes are likely to contribute to heterogeneity in the expression of these genes. However, despite the heterogeneity in the genetic background, the mean expression of the IFN-responsive genes in the six cell lines harboring mutant (MT) Ki-ras was significantly lower than in the cell lines with wt Ki-ras. The average ratio between the expression of all 20 IFN-responsive genes and the reference RNA in the six cell lines with WT Ki-ras was 2.27, compared with 0.78 in the six cell lines with a mutant Ki-ras, a highly statistically significant difference (p = 0.0002, Mann-Whitney test). In addition, the mean expression of individual IFN-dependent genes was markedly lower in cell lines containing MT Ki-ras than in cell lines containing WT Ki-ras. The differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test) for 35% of the individual genes examined (Table I). When we compared the expression of the 20 IFN-dependent genes in cell lines with WT p53 (HCT116, Lovo, LS174T, RKO, and SW48) and MT p53 (16E, 19A, Colo205, HCT15, HT29, KM12, SW480, and SW620), we did not detect any significant differences in the expression of IFN-responsive genes between the two groups (ratio MTp53/WTp53 = 1.1, p = 0.42, data not shown), suggesting that the expression of IFN-dependent genes is not under major regulatory control of p53. These results demonstrated that the effect of mutant Ras on the expression of interferon responsive genes is sufficiently strong to be detected in a population of cell lines that differ in a number of other genetic determinants. In addition, they suggested that oncogenic Ki-Ras interferes with the expression of IFN-responsive genes. Targeted Inactivation of Mutant Ki-ras in Colon Cancer Cells Is Sufficient to Restore the Expression of IFN-responsive Genes—To further determine the role of oncogenic Ras in IFN signaling, we utilized a well defined system of isogenic cell lines that differ only in the presence of the mutant Ki-ras allele. The HCT116 cell line harbors an activating mutation in codon 13 of the Ki-ras protooncogene, and the Hkh2 and Hke-3 clones were generated by the targeted deletion of the mutant Ki-ras allele (11Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the mutant Ki-ras allele in HCT116 cells resulted in reduced proliferation of cells, reduced tumorigenicity in vivo, and reduced capacity for anchorage-independent growth (11Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We performed cDNA microarray analysis on the isogenic cell lines as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experiments were performed twice in Hke-3 cells and twice in Hkh2 cells (Table II). The genes shown in Table I and Table II overlap only partially, because different cDNA microarray slides were used in the experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with our hypothesis that mutant Ras interferes with the expression of IFN responsive genes, we found that a cluster of IFN-responsive genes included on the array was down-regulated in HCT116 cells, compared with the two isogenic clones with a targeted deletion of the mutant Ki-ras allele, Hkh2 and Hke-3 (Table II). The expression of IFN-responsive genes is normally induced in response to IFNs and several of them harbor a STAT1 binding site in their regulatory regions (37Ramana C.V. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Nguyen H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Their basal level of expression may be due to production of low endogenous levels of IFN (38Taniguchi T. Takaoka A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

They establish the initial part of the electron transfer (ET) chain through the RC. Despite their chemical identity, their midpoint potentials cover an interval of 440 mV. The individual heme midpoint potentials determine the ET kinetics and are therefore tuned by specific interactions with the protein environment. Here, we use an electrostatic approach based on the solution of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation to evaluate the determinants of individual heme redox potentials. Our calculated redox potentials agree within 25 meV with the experimentally measured values.

In contrast to earlier computations on this system, we used quantum chemically derived atomic charges, considered an equilibrium-distributed protonation pattern, and accounted for interdependencies of site-site interactions. We provide values for the working potentials of all hemes as a function of the solution redox potential, which are crucial for calculations of ET rates.

It comprises two membrane-spanning L and M subunits, a cytoplasmic H subunit, and the periplasmic tetraheme cytochrome (cyt) c subunit, which is tightly bound to the RC (Fig. 1). The structure of the RC is known in atomic detail from crystallographic studies (1Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber H. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar, 2Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Sinning I. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The 14 cofactors bound to the RC subunits are involved in light-driven proton-coupled ET through the membrane protein complex, leading to reduction and protonation of the membrane-soluble quinone (3Lancaster C.R. Michel H. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom2001: 119-135Google Scholar). Quinone oxidation taking place at the cyt bc1 membrane protein complex establishes a proton gradient across the membrane, which is converted to chemical energy at the ATP synthase complex. The electrons are returned back to the RC by the periplasmic soluble electron carrier cyt c2 that is supposed to bind to the C chain of the RC, probably close to the outermost heme group to reduce the oxidized hemes (4Osyczka A.

In the cyt c complex of the R. viridis RC, electrons are transferred through a linear chain of low-high-low-high potential cyt c hemes (heme number 4-3—2-1) to the special pair chlorophyll dimer where photo-oxidation takes place (5Nitschke W.

Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the midpoint potentials of hemes 1 to 4 are at 370, 20, 300, and -60 mV, respectively (7Fritzsch G. Buchanan S. Michel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 157-162Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All midpoint values are considerably shifted to higher potentials compared with the values obtained for equivalently coordinated heme model systems in aqueous solution (-220 mV for bis-histidine ligated hemes as heme 2, -70 mV for methionine-histidine ligated hemes as hemes 1, 3, and 4; see Ref. 9Wilson G.S. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1983; 1: 172-179Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Heme proteins can be found in a diverse array of enzyme families. This is because of the ability of the heme system to function as a binding and transport site for small molecules or electrons or as a catalytic principle of an enzyme active site. Hemes are redox active groups that are particularly versatile and challenging in the understanding of function. Their central iron atom can be coordinated by a variety of different axial ligands. Hemes may change their redox and protonation state in a concerted way involving the two covalently attached propionic acids (PR). This widens the scope to tune heme redox potentials in proteins enormously and opens the possibility that heme can play an active part in coupled electron and proton translocation processes. A prominent system where it is likely that heme catalyzes such processes is cyt c oxidase (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

Several features of protein architecture give rise to modified redox cofactor properties. Most of them rely on electrostatic interactions. These are investigated intensively by structural analysis and mutational studies, as well as by theoretical approaches based on electrostatic models (13Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 533-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 14Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Theoretical work on heme proteins was performed before by several groups (see for example Refs. 15Gunner M.R. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) calculated the redox potentials of the hemes in the R. viridis RC. Using a crude heme charge model and two conversion factors to adjust the redox potentials calculated for model systems in aqueous solution to the respective experimental values, they achieved acceptable agreement with the redox potentials measured for the hemes in the RC (see Table I). Furthermore, they calculated the protonation pattern of the RC protein side chains but did not consider it in the calculation of the heme redox potentials and also neglected the influence of the solution redox potential.

Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 628-637Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this paper, we first present our computational results concerning the heme redox potentials and the protonation pattern of the titratable groups and discuss differences in the results obtained with different crystallographic structures of the RC. In the second part, we focused on the interactions between heme groups, giving values for the so-called working potentials (i.e. the actual midpoint potential at a given solution redox potential) of the hemes as a function of the solution redox potential. Next, we investigated general factors of the protein environment that influence the heme redox potentials, followed by a detailed analysis of the interactions of specific charged protein side chains with the porphyrin ring system and the heme PR groups. Thus, the outstanding role of the PR in these interactions was revealed. Finally, we generated a model structure of a mutant RC (25Chen I.-P. Mathis P. Koepke J. Michel H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3592-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and reproduced the measured redox potentials to further validate our approach. Coordinates—For most calculations, the crystal structure of the R. viridis RC at 2.3-Å resolution was used as reported by Deisenhofer et al. (1, 2; Protein Data Bank number 1prc). In that crystal structure the QB binding pocket, which lies within the lower part of the L chain, does show a low occupancy, but that was considered to be uncritical in our application, which focuses on features confined to the cyt c part of the RC. All water molecules and sulfate ions were removed from the structure. The four missing C-terminal amino acids of chain C (Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys) were added. Hydrogens were placed using the HBUILD (26Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1988; 4: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) routine of CHARMM22 (20Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E.

The resulting structure was energetically minimized keeping all atoms that are defined by the crystal structure in fixed positions. After a first titration procedure, the energy minimization was repeated considering the actual average protonation pattern by using fractional degrees of protonation and the resulting net charges for the titratable groups where necessary. The resulting structure (termed 1prc-H-titrated) was used for all further calculations unless noted otherwise. For reasons of comparison the crystal structure reported by Lancaster et al. (27Lancaster C.R. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank number 2prc) was also used and subjected to the same procedure as described for the 1prc structure. This crystal structure was solved at 2.45-Å resolution but shows a markedly higher occupancy within the QB binding pocket. Atom positions within the cyt c part are nearly identical in both structures, except for a few solvent-exposed side chain atoms. These have zero occupancy in both structures and have been placed in the model building process to complete the respective side chains. Inspection of these side chains in the 2prc structure showed some geometrically unfavorable peculiarities (see “Results and Discussion”). Therefore, we decided to use the 1prc structure for the main body of our study. To use the 2prc structure in a more sensible way, a restrained simulated annealing molecular dynamics simulation was performed to optimize the positions of the crystallographically undefined side chain atoms within and close to the C chain in the 2prc structure (see Supplemental Material for details). The structure of the RC mutant C264-RK (25Chen I.-P. Mathis P. Koepke J. Michel H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3592-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was modeled by replacing the arginine side chain at position 264 of the C chain with that of lysine in the 1prc structure. The positions of the Lys-C264 side chain atoms and all hydrogens within 5 Å of these atoms were energetically optimized whereas all other atom positions were kept fixed. The atomic coordinates (including hydrogens) of all structures used for our computations can be found on our web server (agknapp.chemie.fu-berlin.de) as 1prc-H, 1prc-H-titrated, 2prc-H, 2prc-H-titrated, 2prc-H-annealed, and 1prc-C264-RK-H. Atomic Partial Charges—Amino acid partial charges were taken from the CHARMM22 parameter set (21MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott R.L. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S.

Fractional degrees of protonation needed for the optimization of hydrogen positions after a first titration procedure were accounted for by using atomic partial charges that were obtained by linear interpolation between the charges for the fully protonated and fully deprotonated state of the corresponding molecular groups. Redox active cofactors of the RC, which are positioned downstream of the special pair (i.e. accessory bacteriochlorophylls, pheophytins, quinones, and non-heme iron center) were only accounted for by using the neutral (reduced) charge set as calculated by Rabenstein et al. (28Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2488-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These were treated as non-titratable (charge invariant) groups during the electrostatic calculations, because they are located too far away from the hemes to influence their redox behavior significantly. Charges for the special pair bacteriochlorophyll dimer in its oxidized and reduced state were calculated using the program GAUSSIAN98 (29Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E.

Wong M.W. Andres J.L. Gonzalez C. Head-Gordon M. Replogle E.S. Pople J.A. Gaussian 98 Revision A.7. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1998Google Scholar). The quantum chemical calculations were performed in Hartree-Fock approximation with an STO-3G basis set for all atoms, considering the isoprene tails only as methyl ester groups. For the special pair, charges derived from Mulliken population analysis (30Mulliken R.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1955; 23: 1833-1840Crossref Scopus (9678) Google Scholar) were used, except for isoprene tail atoms, which were assigned to have zero atomic partial charge each. A detailed protocol for the derivation of the heme charges can be found in the Supplemental Material. In brief, the PR were treated as separate titratable groups that interact only electrostatically with the heme pyrrole ring system. Charges for the PR were assigned using the partial charges of the Glu side chain from the CHARMM22 force field. The wave functions of the hemes and their axial ligands were calculated with the program JAGUAR (31Jaguar 4.2. Schrodinger, Inc., Portland, OR2000Google Scholar), using the Hartree-Fock method and a 6-31G* basis set for all atoms except iron, whose transition metal identity was taken into account by using the LAVCP basis set. The program RESP (18Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5540) Google Scholar, 19Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9620-9631Crossref Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) was used to derive atomic partial charges that reproduce the electrostatic potential obtained from the quantum chemical wave functions on grid points in the neighborhood of the considered molecular group. The general properties of the cyt c heme system were considered for each heme in an equivalent way by using appropriate constraints in the RESP computation. The total charge of the reduced state of heme was zero, whereas the oxidized heme charge set had a total charge of one positive charge unit. Of that charge difference, 0.23 charge units were confined to the heme iron, whereas the remainder was allowed to be delocalized within the ring system and the axial ligands. The quantum chemical and RESP calculations were performed for each heme individually, using the heme coordinates of the 1prc structure. The atomic partial charges that we used for the four heme groups are given in Supplemental Table S1 of the Supplemental Material. Theoretical Framework for the Computation of Protonation and Redox Patterns—Because the derivation of the formalism is equivalent for protonation and redox reactions, the respective terms for redox reactions are given in parentheses. The probability 〈xμ〉 that a specific titratable (redox active) group say μ is protonated (oxidized) in a molecular system with a total of N variably charged molecular groups where each one can adopt two different charge states is given by a thermodynamic average over all 2N different states (charge patterns) (13Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 533-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) according to Equation 1, shown below, where T is the absolute temperature and R the universal gas constant.〈xμ〉=1Z∑n=12Nxμ(n)exp(-G(n)/RT),withZ=∑n=12Nexp(-G(n)/RT)(Eq. 1) In the charge pattern (n), the individual charge state of the titratable (redox active) group μ is denoted by the integer x(n)μ, which adopts the value 0 for unprotonated (reduced) state and 1 for protonated (oxidized) state. The total free energy G(n) of the charge pattern (n) of the considered molecular system is expressed as sum over self-energies Gintμ and pair interactions Wμν, shown in Equation 2G(n)=∑μ=1Nxμ(n)Gμint+∑v>μ=1Nxμ(n)xv(n)Wμv(Eq. 2) where for a titratable group μGμint(pH)=RTln10(pH-(pKa,μexp+pKa,μint-pKa,μmodel))(Eq. 3) or for a redox active group μGμint(Esol,Ebias)=F(Esol+Ebias-(Eμexp+Eμint-Eμmodel))(Eq. 4) with solution pH, solution redox potential Esol, bias potential Ebias, and Faraday constant F. The self-energy terms account for the experimental pKa,μexp value (redox potential Eμexp) of group μ and the difference of the computed pKa (Eμ) in the model system pKa,μmodel (Eμmodel) and the intrinsic pKa,μint (Eμint) in a specific molecular environment. The intrinsic pKa,μint (Eμint) of group μ refers to the reference charge state in a specific molecular environment. This charge state corresponds to the charge pattern where all variably charged groups are deprotonated (reduced). The pair interaction Wμν contributes only if both variably charged groups (μ and ν) are protonated (oxidized) whereas all other groups are in the reference charge state. The intrinsic pKa,μint (Eμint) values are formal expressions and do not correspond to measurable quantities. They provide the pKa (Eμ) of the variably charged group μ in the fictitious reference charge state, which differs significantly from a realistic charge state, whereas the ensemble average obtained from Equation 1 involving the energy function G(n) that includes also the pair interactions Wμν leads to meaningful charge states. The procedure to compute the intrinsic pKa,μint, and (Eμint) values and the pair interactions Wμν is discussed in more detail elsewhere (13Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 533-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A simple method to obtain an estimate of pKa,μ values (redox potentials Eμ) of a particular variably charged group μ is to consider the midpoint values pK½ (E½), which are defined as the solution pH value (solution redox potential Esol), where group μ is with probability 0.5 protonated (oxidized), i.e.〈xμ〉 = 0.5. Note that this definition of pK½ and E½ is formally different from that of pK and Em. One can also probe the redox potential of redox active groups individually while keeping all other redox active groups exposed to the solution redox potential. To enforce this non-equilibrium situation a bias potential Ebias is used in Equation 4, and the E½ of that particular redox active group is obtained as E½ = Ebias + Esol, whereas 〈xμ〉 = 0.5. Computation of Protonation and Redox Patterns—The electrostatic energies represented by the intrinsic pKa,μint, and (Eμint) values and the Wμν interaction energies were calculated from the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the program MULTIFLEX (22Bashford D. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 9557-9561Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Bashford D. Gerwert K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The respective experimental pKa values of the model compounds in aqueous solution were used as reported before (16Popović D.M. Zarić S.D. Rabenstein B. Knapp E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6040-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The only redox active groups treated as such were the hemes considered together with their axial and cysteine ligands but without the PR, which were treated separately as independent titratable groups. The bis-histidinyl heme model compound (Em = -220 mV in water; see Ref. 9Wilson G.S. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1983; 1: 172-179Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the histidinyl-methionyl heme model compound (Em = -70 mV in water; see Ref. 9Wilson G.S. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1983; 1: 172-179Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were used as reference model systems. All other redox active groups were kept in their reduced state. To compute heme redox potentials that can be compared with the experimental values, the special pair was fixed in the reduced state. Heme redox potentials relevant for ET processes are calculated with the special pair fixed in the oxidized state, because that is the state it adopts under conditions of ET from the cyt c complex to the special pair. All residues of the types Arg, Asp, Glu, Lys, Tyr, Cys, and His (except for residues coordinating cofactors), all N and C termini (except for the formylated H chain N terminus), and the PR were considered titratable. The interior of the protein was assigned a dielectric constant of ϵP = 4. The solvent was modeled as a medium with a dielectric constant of ϵS = 80 and an ionic strength of 100 mm. An ion exclusion layer of 2 Å and a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å were used to define the volume of the protein. The membrane embedding of the M and L chain was not taken into account, because the cyt c unit is entirely in the aqueous phase where it should experience little influences form the membrane, as has been shown before (15Gunner M.R. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 28Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2488-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because of the large dimensions of the protein, the electrostatic potential was calculated by a three step focusing procedure using a grid spacing of 2.5, 1, and 0.25 Å, respectively. Th"

The structure is overall very similar to the glutathione S-transferase proteins and contains a pocket with architecture highly homologous to what is observed in glutathione S-transferase enzymes. The TEF3-encoded form of eEF1Bγ has no obvious catalytic residue. However, the second form of eEF1Bγ encoded by the TEF4 gene contains serine 11, which may act catalytically. Based on the x-ray structure and gel filtration studies, we suggest that the yeast eEF1 complex is organized as an [eEF1A·eEF1Bα·eEF1Bγ]2 complex.

The protein biosynthesis process is divided into initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation Met-tRNAiMet is bound to the ribosomal P-site and base-paired with an initiator AUG codon on the mRNA. In the elongation cycle, the aminoacylated tRNA is brought to the ribosomal A-site by eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 1The abbreviations used are: eEFeukaryotic elongation factorGSTglutathione S-transferasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolCDNB1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzeneMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidSADsingle anomalous dispersion. 1A (eEF1A), a 50-kDa G-protein. The ribosome acts as a GTPase activator for eEF1A in the presence of a correct codon-anticodon match between the aminoacylated tRNA and the A-site codon of mRNA. eEF1A hydrolyzes its bound GTP, and eEF1A·GDP leaves the ribosome (reviewed in Ref. 1Merrick W.C.

The yeast elongation factor 1 complex (eEF1) consists of eEF1A and elongation factor 1B (eEF1B), which is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eEF1A. In all eukaryotes eEF1B contains at least two subunits, α and γ. In metazoans a third subunit, eEF1Bβ, which shares high sequence similarity to eEF1Bα, is present (2Saha S.K. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12599-12603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Morales J. Cormier P. Mulner-Lorillon O. Poulhe R. Belle R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). eEF1Bα and eEF1Bβ are catalytic subunits of the exchange factor, and eEF1Bα is essential for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Hiraga K. Suzuki K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The interaction between eEF1Bγ and eEF1Bα involves the N-terminal portion of both proteins (5van Damme H. Amons R. Janssen G. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The eEF1Bγ subunit in Artemia salina enhances the activity of the eEF1Bα subunit by 100% when added in a 1:1 molar ratio in vitro (6Janssen G.M. Moller W. Eur. J.

There are unique aspects of eEF1Bγ function other than association with eEF1Bα. In A. salina 5% of the eEF1Bα· eEF1Bγ complex in the cell is associated with membranes, and eEF1Bγ can associate with tubulin (6Janssen G.M. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Studies in human fibroblasts indicated that the eEF1 complex is predominantly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, possibly anchored via eEF1Bγ (7Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M. Dijk J. Moller W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Association between eEF1Bγ and mRNA has also been reported (8Al-Maghrebi M. Brule H. Padkina M. Allen C. Holmes W.M. Zehner Z.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5017-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). eEF1Bγ in S. cerevisiae was identified through a screen for calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins (9Kambouris N.G. Burke D.J. Creutz C.E. Yeast. 1993; 9: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). From the protein sequence a gene was identified named CAM1 (calcium and membrane binding), and its disruption does not affect the viability of the cell. The same gene was later identified as acting as a dosage extragenic suppressor of a cold-sensitive mutant, and named drs2 (deficient for ribosomal subunits), which is deficient in the assembly of 40 S ribosomal subunits (10Ripmaster T.L. Vaughn G.P. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7901-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The gene identified was named TEF3 and the protein it encodes Tef3p. A second isoform of eEF1Bγ encoded by the TEF4 gene in S. cerevisiae has also been identified (11Kinzy T.G. Ripmaster T.L. Woolford Jr., J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between Tef3p and Tef4p is only 64.5%, with the highest conservation in the C terminus. It is further believed that protein synthesis is under the control of the cell cycle during meiosis and mitosis. eEF1Bγ from Xenopus laevis and Carassius auratus was found to be a substrate both in vivo and in vitro for the cell division control M-phase promoting factor (12Janssen G.M.

DNA Seq. 2002; 13: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Taken together these results may indicate additional functions for this protein. Very recently Tef3p has been identified in a complex binding to the msrA promoter suggesting a function in regulation of expression of methionine sulfoxide reductase (14Hanbauer I. Boja E.S. Moskovitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8199-8204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of eEF1Bγ has sequence motifs characteristic of the Theta class glutathione transferases (GST) and, in accordance with this, was suggested to form homodimers and be enzymatically active (15Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, GST activity was observed toward the model substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) with the recombinant eEF1Bγ subunit from Oryza sativa expressed in Escherichia coli and for the full native eEF1B complex (16Kobayashi S. Kidou S. Ejiri S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Likewise, the silk worm (Bombyx mori) eEF1Bγ has been observed to bind to GSH-Sepharose (17Kamiie K. Nomura Y. Kobayashi S. Taira H. Kobayashi K. Yamashita T. Kidou S. Ejiri S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Soluble GSTs (EC 2.5.1.18) are proteins involved in the cellular three-phase metabolism of exogenous and endogenous xenobiotics (18Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 19Ishikawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 463-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The GSTs belong to the phase II system of proteins and catalyze the conjugation of the nucleophilic sulfhydryl group of GSH to a number of electrophilic compounds. The GSTs function by decreasing the pKa of GSH, thereby allowing its deprotonation and the formation of a more reactive thiolate anion. In the Alpha, Mu, Pi, and Sigma GST classes, this anion is maintained in the active site through an interaction with a tyrosine residue. In contrast, Theta and Theta-like GSTs utilize a conserved serine residue as the primary catalytic active site residue (20Wilce M.C. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Two GST enzymes, Gtt1p and Gtt2p, have been identified and characterized in S. cerevisiae (21Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein expressed in E. coli exhibited GST activity toward CDNB. Limited proteolysis demonstrates that yeast and human eEF1Bγ consist of two structural domains connected by a flexible linker (this article and see Ref. 22van Wetswinkel S. Kriek J. Andersen G.R.

We here present the first crystallographic structure of the eEF1Bγ N-terminal domain 1 (residues 1–219) from the yeast S. cerevisiae determined by the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) technique at 3.0 Å resolution. Consistent with predictions of a GSH-binding motif (15Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the structure of domain 1 is very similar to those of GST enzymes. Importantly, structural details of the catalytic site are conserved in the yeast eEF1Bγ domain 1. Both domain 1 and the slightly longer domain 1′ (residues 1–242) were not able to bind to a GSH matrix, nor did they show any activity toward the GST model substrate CDNB. A model for the eEF1 complex in S. cerevisiae is suggested based on this structure and the previously reported structure of eEF1A in complex with the catalytically active fragment of eEF1Bα (23Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Expression of Full-length eEF1Bγ—Plasmid pTKB532 containing the full-length S. cerevisiae TEF3 gene with an N-terminal histidine tag and inserted into a pET9d plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. The cells were grown in LB media containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until an A600 value of 0.6–0.8, and protein was expressed with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation. The following purification steps were performed at 0–6 °C. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (250 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 75 min, and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to at least 7.6 and loaded on a 5-ml charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed and protein eluted with lysis buffer containing 50 and 120 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.8, respectively. The eluted protein was concentrated in a YM-30 Centricon (Millipore) and loaded on a 120-ml (2 × 60 cm) Superdex 200 Prep Grade gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 250 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. Limited Proteolysis of Full-length eEF1Bγ—Full-length eEF1Bγ was mixed with trypsin (Sigma) in a 640:1 weight ratio and kept on ice for 16 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mm PMSF, and the result was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The salt concentration was lowered to ∼100 mm by mixing with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Ion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Mono-S column (Amersham Biosciences) led to the isolation of two distinct domains of eEF1Bγ. The column was equilibrated in buffer A (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and 0.5 mm DTT) and eluted with a gradient from buffer A to buffer B (700 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and 0.5 mm DTT). In agreement with the predicted high pI of 9.1 for residues 1–219, the N-terminal basic fragment bound to the column, although the acidic C-terminal fragment was in the flow-through. Subcloning—Plasmid pTKB176 containing the S. cerevisiae TEF3 gene encoding eEF1Bγ was used as a template for PCR amplification of the eEF1Bγ-(1–219) fragment by using primers 5′-CATGCCATGGCACATCACCATCACCATCACTCTCAAGGTACTTTATATGCT-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTTATTATTGAGGGGGACTCAATGG-3′. The primers introduce a His6 tag and an NcoI restriction site at the AUG and a BglII restriction site 3′ of the new stop codon. Boldface letters indicate the restriction sites, and the His6 tag is underlined. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BglII and cloned into plasmid pET11d digested with NcoI and BamHI producing plasmid pTKB588. Based on the observations made with the eEF1Bγ-(1–219) construct, a second construct containing residues 1–242 of eEF1Bγ was made with the same 5′ primer and the 3′ primer 5′-GAAGATCTTTATTATGGCTTGGCTTCCTCCTT-3′, producing plasmid pTKB611. Expression and Purification of SeMet-substituted Protein—Plasmids were transformed into electrocompetent BL21(DE3)B834 E. coli cells. The SeMet media contained 1 mg/liter vitamins (riboflavin, niacinamide, pyridoxine monohydrochloride, and thiamine), 40 mg/liter of all amino acids except methionine, 40 mg/liter of seleno-l-methionine, 25 mg/liter FeSO4, 4 g/liter glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 g/liter NH4Cl, 6 g/liter KH2PO4, 25.6 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. All amino acids, vitamins, and glucose were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Sartorius). The rest of the ingredients were autoclaved prior to mixing (24Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). An overnight bacterial culture was used to inoculate SeMet media, and after 24 h of growth at 37 °C, an A600 of ∼1.0 was achieved. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 6 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. All purification steps were performed at 0–6 °C. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (250 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm PMSF) and sonicated. The rest of the protocol is identical to that of the full-length protein, except that gel filtration was omitted. Gel Filtration Assay—A 24-ml (0.8 × 30 cm) Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (250 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1.0 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF). Samples with 200–300 μg of protein were centrifuged before loading on the column. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. GST Activity Assay—The proteins to be used in the assay were dialyzed overnight against PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). The absorbance was recorded at 1-min intervals for 5 min on an LKB Biochrom Ultrospec II spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 340 nm. The reaction mixture consisted of a total volume of 1 ml containing 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5, or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm of CDNB, and GSH and a given amount of protein. As a reference, the absorbance at 340 nm was measured using the reaction mixture and a volume of phosphate-buffered saline equal to the volume of protein sample used in the other sample mixtures. The activity of the proteins were compared with the activity of GST from Schistosoma japonicum (Sj26) encoded in a pGEX-1 vector (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Crystallization—The SeMet-substituted protein was crystallized at 6 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 4 μl of reservoir solution (2.36–2.4 m (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm reduced GSH, 3 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6, and 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7) with 4 μl of protein solution at 8.4 mg/ml. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a bovine serum albumin standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Crystals appeared within 2 days and had dimensions of ∼500 × 500 × 500 μm. Data Collection and Processing—Crystals were transferred to stabilization buffer (2.48 m (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm reduced GSH, 3 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm Mes-NaOH buffer, pH 6, and 25 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7) and stored for 2 days. The crystals were then transferred to cryobuffer (stabilization buffer + 20% glycerol) and frozen immediately in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected at the selenium K-edge on the beamline ID29 ESRF, France. The data were processed and reduced with MOSFLM and SCALA (27Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; Vol. 26Google Scholar). The selenium sites were located with SHELXD (28Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), and SAD phases to 3 Å resolution were calculated with CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

After density modification an initial model was constructed with O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). An initial refinement with a model containing residues 2–210 in CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Iterative cycles of manual model building and refinement with the experimental phases as restraints resulted in a structure with all 219 amino acids (Table I). Due to the presence of selenomethionine, and the use of MAD phases as restraints, anomalous pairs were used for refinement. The quality of the structure was inspected during rebuilding with OOPS2 (31Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 56: 249-265Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and finally with PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The secondary structure was assigned with DSSP (33Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar). All figures were made with PyMOL (34DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual.

However, this protein showed undesirable properties for structural studies such as a strong tendency to aggregate at physiological salt conditions (results not shown). Based on limited trypsin digestion and sequence alignment, we constructed two deletion mutants. The smallest consisted of residues 1–219, domain 1, which has clear sequence homology to GST proteins (15Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignment with the human GST T2-2 sequence, we also expressed residues 1–242, domain 1′. Both recombinant fragments of eEF1Bγ were highly soluble (data not shown). In gel filtration assays domain 1 eluted at a position similar to carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) indicating a monomer, whereas domain 1′ eluted at a position similar to bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) indicating a dimer (Fig. 1). These results suggest that residues 220–242 are required for the stable dimerization of Tef3p eEF1Bγ in S. cerevisiae. Proteolytic studies of the full-length S. cerevisiae Tef3p showed that the protein could be cleaved into two stable fragments of 26 and 21 kDa, respectively, as assessed by SDS-PAGE. The C-terminal domain 2, residues 237–415, elutes as a monomer from a gel filtration column (Fig. 1). Domain 2 does not interact with eEF1Bα and can be separated from the N-terminal fragment by ion exchange (data not shown). Both domain 1 and 1′ were able to form stable complexes with eEF1Bα (data not shown). Although the amino acid sequence suggests homology to the GSH-binding motif of GST proteins, no such enzymatic activity was observed with domain 1 or 1′ toward the GST marker substrate CDNB, whereas activity was demonstrated for a recombinant GST (data not shown). The Structure of Domain 1—Although large single crystals of domain 1′ were obtained, they diffracted only weakly to ∼4.5 Å. Crystals of selenomethionated domain 1 diffracted better, and a three wavelength data set was collected at 3 Å resolution. The density map obtained from SAD phases was superior to that obtained from MAD phases, most likely due to radiation damage during data collection at the remote and inflection wavelengths. Initially the crystals were believed to be tetragonal, and 100 degrees of data were collected for each wavelength. Radiation damage was observed already within the peak wavelength collected first, and only the first 50 degrees of data were used, but due to the high symmetry this was sufficient to obtain a redundancy of 10.7 (Table I). The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of domain 1 and a sulfate ion and has a solvent content of 63%. The experimental map obtained after density modification was easily interpretable over almost the full length of the protein (Fig. 2). The mean residue real space correlation calculated with O between the refined model and the experimental map is 0.83. For comparison the correlation is 0.91 between the model and the final 2Fo - Fc map, but this map inevitably suffers to some degree from model bias, so the correlation to this map is likely to be artificially high. Visually, there is rather little difference between the two maps indicating a very high quality of the input SAD phases. These phases were used as MLHL restraints in all cycles of refinement. Although the same test sets were used in all refinement steps, there is an unusual small difference between R and Rfree (Table I). However, it has been demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between Rfree and the phase error, and with good experimental phases the MLHL target is superior for refinement (35Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our structure fully confirms the power of using good experimental phases as restraints with respect to obtaining low values of Rfree. The refined crystal structure of S. cerevisiae eEF1Bγ domain 1 contains all 219 amino acids and a sulfate ion (Fig. 3A). The structure shows striking similarity to GST proteins, and one of the crystallographic dimers is organized as a known GST dimer (Fig. 3). Like GST enzymes the monomer consists of two subdomains. Subdomain 1N, residues 1–74, has a central four-stranded β-sheet flanked on one side by the parallel helices α1 and α3 and on the other solvent-exposed side by the α2 helix. A linker of 15 residues (75–89), of which residues 77–83 forms a helix, connects subdomain 1N to subdomain 1C containing residues 90–219. As in GST structures we named the helix in the linker α3B. This helix formation is not seen in the human Theta class GST T2-2 structure, the Arabidopsis thaliana GST Theta class structure, nor the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina GST structure (20Wilce M.C.

Koelln I. Bartunik H.D. Bieseler B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, a short 310 helix is found in the linker connecting subdomains 1N and 1C in the structures of maize GST 1–3 and GST 1–4 from the mosquito Anopheles dirus (38Neuefeind T. Huber R. Dasenbrock H. Prade L. Bieseler B. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 39Oakley A.J. Harnnoi T. Udomsinprasert R. Jirajaroenrat K. Ketterman A.J. Wilce M.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2176-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subdomain 1C contains five helices: α4, α5, α6, α6B,and α7 (Figs. 3 and 4). As in the human GST T2-2 structure, helix α4 is irregular and is more accurately described as three helices α4A, α4B, and α4C. The three helices of eEF1Bγ, however, are almost coaxial. Helix α5 runs antiparallel with almost the full length of α4 and is slightly bent. Helix α6 contains at its start the N-capping box ((S/T)XXD) and a hydrophobic staple motif, both of which are highly conserved among GSTs and appear to greatly stabilize their fold (40Stenberg G. Dragani B. Cocco R. Mannervik B. Aceto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10421-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This helix runs parallel to helix α4 and bends away from the subdomain 1N of the protein at its C-terminal end. Compared with the human GST T2-2 structure, there is an additional 310 helix between helices α6 and α7, termed α6B. A similar helix is seen in the A. thaliana GST Theta class structure (37Reinemer P. Prade L. Hof P. Neuefeind T. Huber R. Zettl R. Palme K. Schell J. Koelln I. Bartunik H.D. Bieseler B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Subdomain 1C has a hydrophobic core created by an intricate ring stacking of the side chains of residues Trp-99(α4A), Phe-143(α5), Phe-169(α6), Phe-173(α6), Trp-181(α6B), Trp-191(α7), and Phe-192(α7). Although present in the crystallization solution and in the cryobuffer, no electron density for GSH was observed in the electron density maps. A large spherical piece of electron density surrounded by Arg-11, Arg-13, and Arg-171 was observed at the N terminus of helix α1, which cannot be attributed to protein. Given the fact that the protein was crystallized in ammonium sulfate, the basic environment, and that the human GST T2-2 and the maleylacetoacetate isomerase/glutathione transferase ζ, MAAI/GST Z1-1 structures have a sulfate ion in a similar position (36Rossjohn J.

One FMN and up to 9 iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters participate in the redox reaction. There is discussion that the EPR-detectable Fe/S cluster N2 is involved in proton pumping. However, the assignment of this cluster to a distinct subunit of the complex as well as the number of Fe/S clusters giving rise to the EPR signal are still under debate. Complex I from Escherichia coli consists of 13 polypetides called NuoA to N. Either subunit NuoB or NuoI could harbor Fe/S cluster N2. Whereas NuoB contains a unique motif for the binding of one Fe/S cluster, NuoI contains a typical ferredoxin motif for the binding of two Fe/S clusters. Individual mutation of all four conserved cysteine residues in NuoB resulted in a loss of complex I activity and of the EPR signal of N2 in the cytoplasmic membrane as well as in the isolated complex. Individual mutations of all eight conserved cysteine residues of NuoI revealed a variable phenotype. Whereas cluster N2 was lost in most NuoI mutants, it was still present in the cytoplasmic membranes of the mutants NuoI C63A and NuoI C102A. N2 was also detected in the complex isolated from the mutant NuoI C102A. From this we conclude that the Fe/S cluster N2 is located on subunit NuoB.

In general, the bacterial complex I consists of 14 different subunits that add up to a molecular mass of ∼530 kDa (3Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 4Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Seven subunits are peripheral proteins including the subunits that bear all known redox groups of complex I, namely one FMN and up to 9 iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. The remaining 7 subunits are hydrophobic proteins. Little is known about their function, but they are most likely involved in ubiquinone reduction and proton translocation (3Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition to the homologues of the 14 procaryotic complex I subunits the mitochondrial complex I of eucaryotes contains up to 32 extra proteins (5Hirst J. Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). They add up to a molecular mass of ∼1 MDa.

The electron input part of the complex is made up of the FMN and Fe/S clusters N1b, N3, N4, N5, N6a, and N6b. Because of their similar midpoint potential they are called isopotential Fe/S clusters (6Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Ohnishi T.

From the isopotential clusters the electrons are transferred to cluster N2, which exhibits a more positive midpoint potential. The respective value, however, depends strongly on the organism from which complex I has been isolated. Cluster N2 has also been considered playing an important role in energy conservation, because its midpoint potential is pH-dependent (10Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is a prerequisite for an energy coupling device. It is believed to transfer electrons directly to the substrate ubiquinone and was thus proposed to be located close to the membrane (11Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys.

Whereas most of the Fe/S clusters have been attributed to individual subunits, the location of cluster N2 is still under debate. The Escherichia coli complex I is made up of 13 subunits called NuoA to NuoN (14Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). As a special case, the gene nuoCD is fused to one gene giving rise to 13 nuo genes (15Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys.

The preparation of E. coli complex I contains one non-covalently bound FMN, and two binuclear (N1a and N1b, Nomenclature according to Ohnishi and co-workers (14Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar)) and three tetranuclear (N2, N3, and N4) Fe/S clusters have been detected by means of EPR spectroscopy. Two Fe/S clusters, N6a and N6b, have been detected by means of UV-visible spectroscopy (8Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Brors B. Kintscher L. Weiss H. Friedrich T.

Upon treatment with salt, E. coli complex I is cleaved yielding a soluble NADH dehydrogenase fragment with three subunits containing the FMN and the Fe/S clusters N1a, N1b, N3, and N4, an amphipathic connecting fragment with three subunits and cluster N2, N6a, and N6b, and a hydrophobic membrane fragment with 7 subunits containing a chromophore with a yet unknown chemical structure (16Friedrich T.

The connecting fragment contains subunits NuoB and NuoI (the homologues of the bovine PSST and TYKY, respectively), which contain binding motifs for three Fe/S clusters (Fig. 1) (20Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). NuoB contains a unique binding motif with two of the four cysteines comprising that motif being sequentially located (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal cysteine residue is followed by a proline suggesting that NuoB harbors a [4Fe/4S] cluster. NuoI contains a typical 2× [4Fe/4S] ferredoxin binding motif made up of eight conserved cysteine residues with regular spacing (Fig. 1B). It has been shown that the overproduced subunits NuoB and NuoI from Paracoccus denitrificans are indeed Fe/S proteins (21Ohnishi T. Magnitsky S. Toulokhonova L. Yano T. Yagi T. Burbaev D.S.

Whereas mutations in the fourth cysteine of each binding motif in NuoI resulted in a disturbed assembly of the complex, mutagenesis of the residual cysteines did not affect the phenotype, but the amplitude of the N2 signals was diminished (24Chevallet M.

From this data it was proposed that complex I contains two clusters N2 that should both be located on NuoI. However, site-directed mutagenesis using the mitochondrial complex I from Neurospora crassa and Yarrowia lipolytica pointed to NuoB as the subunit binding N2 (19Duarte M. Populo H. Videira A.

All mutations in NuoB resulted in a loss of the EPR signals of N2, whereas mutations of two of the eight conserved cysteine residues on NuoI resulted in a complex still equipped with cluster N2. From this we conclude that the Fe/S cluster N2 is located on NuoB. Materials and Strains—E. coli B wild type, the E. coli strains AN387 (26Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys.

When required for maintenance of the plasmids, spectinomycin was added to 20 μg/ml, chloramphenicol to 20 μg/ml, kanamycin to 50 μg/ml, and ampicillin to 100 μg/ml. All enzymes used for recombinant DNA techniques were from Amersham Biosciences or Roche Applied Science. [α-32P]dATP (600 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt), Riedel de Haen (Hannover), Serva (Heidelberg), or Sigma.

For construction of the transformation vector pVS3sacRB, pT7T3-19U was restricted with KpnI and religated after the sticky ends were digested with Klenow fragment. This vector was linearizied with BamHI/ClaI and ligated with a 2.2-kb fragment from pNUO-13 containing the nuoI gene that had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting vector was called pVS3 and cut with KpnI. A 1.3-kb BamHI fragment containing nptI of plasmid pCHK20 was filled in using Klenow enzyme and cloned into Klenow-treated pVS3. NptI was inserted in the same direction as nuoI. This vector was called pVS3Kan and restricted with SphI/XbaI. After treatment with Klenow and religation, a 3.7-kb SalI fragment containing the sacR, sacB, and nptI genes was excised from plasmid pUM24 and cloned into the SalI site of pVS3Kan. The resulting vector was called pVS3sacRB. It contained an in-frame deletion of 510 bp of nuoI corresponding to 94% of the coding region. For the construction of plasmid pVS5sacRB, a 2.3-kb PstI fragment containing the nuoB gene was excised from pNUO-2.3 and cloned into the PstI site of pT7T3-19U prepared as described above. The resulting vector was called pVS5. A 3.7-kb BamHI fragment containing the sacR, sacB, and nptI genes was excised from plasmid pUM24 (33Ried J.L. Collmer A. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), filled in using Klenow, and cloned into SmaI-digested pVS5. The resulting vector was called pVS5sacRB. In addition, pVS5 was cut with AvaI and incubated with exonucleases according to the Nested Deletion kit (Pharmacia) for 6 min. The resulting plasmid contained a nuoB in-frame deletion of ∼70% and was called pTB4. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations NuoB C63A, NuoB C63S, and NuoB C158A were created using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using plasmid pBAD-nuoB as described (35Flemming D.

Strain JC7623 was transformed with pVS3sacRB or pVS5sacRB resulting in strains, designated JCN022 (nuoB::nptI-sacRB) and JCN092 (nuoI::nptI-sacRB). Selection was made for the kanamycin resistance. Strains ANN022 and ANN092 were constructed from AN387 (26Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, washed with 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, and stored at –80 °C. Complex I was isolated from the mutants as described (35Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In principal, the membrane proteins were extracted with 3% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside in 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, and applied to a first anion-exchange chromatography on Source Q-15 material (Pharmacia). Fractions containing NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were combined, concentrated by precipitation with 9% (w/v; final concentration) poly(ethylene glycol) 4,000, and dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0. The protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 34 (Serva) in the same buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and applied to Source 15-Q material (Pharmacia). Fractions with NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were pooled and stored at –80 °C. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were conducted with a Bruker EMX 1/6 spectrometer operating at X-band (9.2 GHz). The sample temperature was controlled with an Oxford instrument ESR-9 helium flow cryostat. The magnetic field was calibrated using a strong or a weak pitch standard. The isolated complex I (2–5 mg/ml) was reduced with a few grains of dithionite in the presence of redox mediators. Cytoplasmic membranes from the mutants were isolated as described (42Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 300 μl of aliquots (30 mg/ml) were either reduced with 2 mm NADH plus 5 mm succinate or with 5 mm succinate, both in the presence of redox mediators. The difference of spectra from the (NADH plus succinate reduced) samples minus spectra of the succinate reduced samples reflect the EPR signals of the Fe/S clusters of complex I (42Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The following redox mediators were used: indigotetrasulfonate, indigodisulfonate, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphtoquinone, safranine T, Neutral Red (all 50 μm), methylviologen and benzylviologen (both 40 μm). Other Analytical Procedures—Deamino (d-)NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity, (d-)NADH oxidase activity, and NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity were measured as described (43Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R. Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Höfle G. Reichenbach H. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 44Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Ise W. Nehls U. Schmitz B. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the biuret method. Sucrose-gradient centrifugation in the presence of 0.2% dodecyl maltoside was performed as described (14Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed in 16% gels according to Laemmli (70Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE protein bands were either stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher und Schüll) according to Towbin et al. (45Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 1320: 217-234Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the isolated subunits were used for detection. Characterization of the Deletion Strains—The E. coli nuoB is made up of 660 bp (20Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Positions 201 to 654 were deleted from the chromosome of wild type strain AN387 without interrupting the reading frame. The resulting strain ANN023 (Table II) contained a nuoB fragment coding for amino acids 1–67 and 219–220. Subunit NuoB was not detectable in the membranes of strain ANN023 by a Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised specifically against NuoB (Fig. 2). It was shown that this strain did not contain an assembled or functional complex I (35Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In strain ANN093 positions 18–528 of the 537 bp of nuoI (20Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) were deleted from the chromosome accordingly. Subunit NuoI was not detectable in the membranes of strain ANN093 by a Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised specifically against NuoI (Fig. 2). However, NuoI was detectable in strain ANN023 in wild type amounts, whereas the amount of NuoB in strain ANN093 was reduced (Fig. 2). The ability of strain ANN093 to assemble an intact complex I was determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation (14Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 35Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins from strains AN387 and ANN093 were extracted with 3% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside and centrifuged for 30 min at 250,000 × g. Solubilized proteins were separated on a 5–25% (w/v) sucrose gradient by centrifugation for 16 h at 160,000 × g. Under the chosen conditions wild type complex I sedimented two-thirds of the way through the gradient as indicated by its NADH/ferricyanide activity (Fig. 3). No NADH/ferricyanide activity was detectable in the corresponding fractions of the deletion strains, indicating that complex I was not assembled in the absence of either NuoB or NuoI (Fig. 3). Instead, fractions in the first third of the gradient exhibited NADH/ferricyanide activity that stemmed from the alternative, non-proton pumping NADH dehydrogenase. The expression of this alternative NADH dehydrogenase is increased in the absence of complex I.Fig. 3Sucrose gradient centrifugation of detergent extracts of cytoplasmic membranes of strains AN387 (diamonds), ANN093 (squares), and ANN095 (circles). Cytoplasmic membranes were extracted with 3% dodecyl maltoside (w/v) and separated by means of gradients of 5–25% (w/v) sucrose in 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.2% dodecyl maltoside. The gradient with the extract from wild type membranes was loaded with 4 mg of protein and the gradients with the extract from the mutant membranes with 8 mg of protein each. Fractions of the gradients (numbered 1–20 from top to bottom) were collected and analyzed for NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity. Strain ANN023 showed a sedimentation profile comparable with strain ANN093 (35Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All mutant strains carrying a point mutation in either NuoB or NuoI showed a sedimentation profile comparable with that of strain ANN095, although the activity of the peak fraction varied between 1.8 and 2.2 μmol of NADH/min ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The amount of complex I in the cytoplasmic membranes of the deletion strains was estimated from the (d-)NADH/ferricyanide activity (Table III). The physiological activity of complex I in the cytoplasmic membranes of the deletion strains was determined by the (d-)NADH oxidase activity (Table III). The artificial substrate d-NADH was used in both assays to distinguish between the two membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenases of E. coli (43Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R. Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Höfle G. Reichenbach H. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 46Matsushita K. Ohnishi T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Whereas NADH can be used by both NADH dehydrogenases, d-NADH preferentially reacts with complex I. The d-NADH/ferricyanide activity was strongly reduced in both strains and the d-NADH oxidase activity was completely abolished (Table III). The activity measured with NADH as substrate was because of the alternative NADH dehydrogenase. The residual NADH oxidase activity of both deletion strains was not sensitive to 10 μm piericidin A, a concentration that inhibited 69% of the NADH oxidase activity in the parental strain AN387. Thus, complex I was missing in strains ANN023 and ANN093, demonstrating that both NuoB as well as NuoI are essential for the assembly of complex I.Table IIIEnzyme"

The ETA receptor is a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor whose precise subcellular localization in cardiac muscle is unknown. Here we used fluorescein ET-1 and 125I-ET-1 to provide evidence for ET-1 receptors in cardiac transverse tubules (T-tubules). Moreover, the ETA receptor and downstream effector phospholipase C-β1 were co-localized within T-tubules using standard immunofluorescence techniques, and protein kinase C (PKC)-ϵ-enhanced green fluorescent protein bound reversibly to T-tubules upon activation. Localized photorelease of diacylglycerol further suggested compartmentation of PKC signaling, with release at the myocyte “surface” mimicking the negative inotropic effects of bath-applied PKC activators and “deep” release mimicking the positive inotropic effect of ET-1. The functional significance of T-tubular ET-1 receptors was further tested by rendering the T-tubule lumen inaccessible to bath-applied ET-1. Such “detubulated” cardiac myocytes showed no positive inotropic response to 20 nm ET-1, despite retaining both a nearly normal twitch response to field stimulation and a robust positive inotropic response to 20 nm isoproterenol. We propose that ET-1 enhances myocyte contractility by activating ETA receptor-phospholipase C-β1-PKC-ϵ signaling complexes preferentially localized in cardiac T-tubules. Compartmentation of ET-1 signaling complexes may explain the discordant effects of ET-1 versus bath applied PKC activators and may contribute to both the specificity and diversity of the cardiac actions of ET-1.

PKC is normally activated by the lipid messenger diacylglycerol produced in response to neurohumoral stress factors such as angiotensin II, opiates, and endothelin-1 (ET-1). ET-1 profoundly influences many aspects of myocardial function, including ventricular contractility, intracellular Ca2+ handling, myocyte survival, and myocyte growth (1Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M.

Ladner M.B. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9605-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This specialized membrane compartment promotes functionally relevant interactions between cardiac sarcolemma containing L-type Ca2+ channels and the sarcoplasmic reticulum containing ryanodine receptors (14Cannell M.B. Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 15Parker I. Zang W.J. Wier W.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This membrane architecture develops as ventricular myocytes mature in parallel with development of the electrical and regulatory properties of adult myocytes (16Protasi F. Sun X.H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, T-tubules can degenerate in cardiac disease, resulting in compromised Ca2+ mobilization, particularly deep within the myocyte cross-section (17He J. Conklin M.W. Foell J.D. Wolff M.R. Haworth R.A. Coronado R. Kamp T.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cardiac T-tubules display a unique composition of membrane lipids and proteins (e.g. high in phosphoinositides (18Asotra K. Lagos N. Vergara J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), certain ion channels (19Dobrzynski H. Marples D.D. Musa H. Yamanushi T.T. Henderson Z. Takagishi Y. Honjo H. Kodama I.

Sreekumar R. Huang X. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6He J.Q. Pi Y. Walker J.W. Kamp T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 807-820Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, other activators of PKC, notably phorbol esters, inhibit these same processes (5Pi Y. Sreekumar R. Huang X. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Pi Y.Q. Walker J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H26-H34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand this dichotomy, we employed a combination of techniques including photorelease of a caged compound, fluorescence imaging, and functional analyses of cardiac myocyte contractility to provide support for the hypothesis that PKC can stimulate or inhibit cardiac function depending upon where PKC is activated. Moreover, we present evidence that functional ETA receptors and the associated signaling proteins PLC-β1 and PKC-ϵ are preferentially co-localized within cardiac T-tubules, where they mediate a positive inotropic response. We further suggest that PKC signaling mechanisms localized to T-tubules may not be readily mimicked by bath application of cell-permeable PKC activators such as phorbol esters. Some of this work has been presented in preliminary form (28Robu V.G. Balijepalli R.C. Pfieffer E.S. Robia S.L. Kamp T.J. Walker J.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 348Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[125I]ET-1 and ET-1 were from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA), collagenase was from Worthington, ETA receptor mouse polyclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and PLC-β1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) Alexa-660 conjugate and Alexa-488 signal amplification kit for fluorescein probes were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Unless otherwise noted, all other reagents were from Sigma.Rat Cardiac Myocyte Preparation—All experiments were performed on freshly isolated ventricular myocytes from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats prepared as described previously (5Pi Y. Sreekumar R. Huang X. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Myocytes were maintained in 1 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 21–23 °C for up to 6 h after isolation. Twitch measurements were performed as described (5Pi Y. Sreekumar R. Huang X. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence imaging, myocytes were permeabilized with 100 μg/ml saponin for 5 min at 20 °C in relaxing solution of the following composition: 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 4.5 mm ATP, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. Cells were washed and resuspended in relaxing solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific binding of applied probes.Caged Dioctanoylglycerol Synthesis—The bromohydroxymethyl coumarin (BHC) chromophore was synthesized and purified as described (29Furuta T. Wang S.S. Dantzker J.L. Dore T.M. Bybee W.J. Callaway E.M. Denk W. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The BHC chromophore was coupled through its aliphatic hydroxyl group to dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) to give BHC-caged diC8 (structure in Fig. 1B). A detailed synthesis and characterization will be presented elsewhere. Briefly, to 2 ml of dry acetonitrile was added 90 μmol of BHC, 100 μmol of 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate and 180 μmol of 4-dimethylaminopyridine. After 7 h at room temperature under nitrogen, 100 μmol of diC8 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and 200 μmol of 4-dimethylaminopyridine were added in 2 ml of dry chloroform. Twelve hours later, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 25 ml of 15% citric acid, extracted with chloroform, dried over MgSO4, and purified by silica gel flash chromatography in methylene chloride/ethyl acetate. Final purification was accomplished by reverse phase HPLC in acetonitrile/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid. The structure of BHC-caged diC8 was confirmed by 1H NMR (CDCl3; coumarin protons: δ7.8 (s, 1H), 7.0 (s, 1H), 6.4 (s, 1H), 5.2 (s, 2H); diC8 protons: δ6.1 (m, 1H), 4.6–4.1 (m, 4H), 2.3 (m, 2H), 1.6 (m, 6H), 1.3 (m, 16H), 0.9 (m, 6H)). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (theoretical 641, found 641.4) and UV-visible spectroscopy (in ethanol: ϵ = 21,000 m-1 cm-1 at λmax = 330 nm; in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 50% ethanol: ϵ = 15,000 m-1 cm-1 at λmax = 380 nm). The photochemical quantum yield for BHC-caged diC8 was 0.4 by direct comparison with α-carboxyl-caged diC8 (with a quantum yield of 0.2) using a continuous wave xenon arc lamp filtered to pass 350–400-nm light followed by HPLC analysis as described (30Huang X.P. Sreekumar R. Patel J.R. Walker J.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2448-2457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescence Labeling—ET-1 was synthesized on an ABI 432A automated peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and a Wang resin. The crude peptide was purified by reverse phase HPLC, folded, and oxidized as described (31Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). Quantities were determined by mass and by UV absorbance using ϵ = 6,000 m-1 cm-1 at 270 nm. Synthetic ET-1 was indistinguishable from commercial ET-1 by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (theoretical 2492, found 2492) and by its ability to compete with 125I-ET-1 for receptor sites on rat or dog ventricular membranes. Amine-directed N-hydroxysuccimide fluorophores were coupled to ET-1 via lysine 9 in 50% dimethyl formamide and aqueous 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.3, as described (31Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein ET-1 contained an ϵ-aminocaproate linker between lysine 9 and fluorescein, which facilitated retention of biological activity. Fluorescein ET-1 displayed an IC50 of 2.4 ± 0.4 nm in the 125I-ET-1 competition assay and at 10 nm gave a normal positive inotropic response in the myocyte twitch assay.Two-photon Microscopy—Myocytes were imaged with a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a ×40 oil immersion 1.4 numerical aperture lens and a pulsed titanium-sapphire laser (32Wokosin D.L. Squirrell J.M. Eliceiri K.W. White J.G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2003; 74: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The laser was tuned to 780 nm for experiments involving BHC-caged diC8 and to 960 nm for experiments involving fluorescein ET-1. Myocytes were loaded with 200 μm BHC-caged diC8 in Ringer's solution containing 0.1% Me2SO and then perfused to remove Me2SO. Imaging was carried out by raster scanning the laser beam under the control of Bio-Rad software at a laser power of 3–10 milliwatts. For photolysis of BHC-caged diC8, the laser power was increased to 20–25 milliwatts, and the selected cell dimensions were scanned 10–30 times. Twitch amplitudes initiated by standard electrical field stimulation (40 V, 0.4 Hz) were monitored before and after photolysis by a 30-ms line scan of the myocyte edge.The amount of diC8 generated during two-photon photolysis was estimated to be in the range of 1–5 fmol/cell. This is based on earlier one-photon photolysis studies of α-carboxyl-caged diC8 in which the effective threshold dose (i.e. minimum required for an effect on twitches) of photoreleased diC8 was measured to be 2–3 fmol/cell or 1 diC8/300 cellular phospholipids (30Huang X.P. Sreekumar R. Patel J.R. Walker J.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2448-2457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BHC-caged diC8 possesses a larger molar absorptivity and a 2-fold higher photochemical quantum yield than α-carboxyl-caged diC8, so it was used at a 4-fold lower initial concentration. Using a standard xenon arc lamp for photolysis, the twitch responses to 800 μm α-carboxyl-caged diC8 and 200 μm BHC-caged diC8 were similar, including a threshold at a similar exposure time. The two-photon photolysis experiments described here showed the same threshold phenomenon (i.e. no response if the scan time or laser power were reduced by 3-fold or more), consistent with photorelease of diC8 in the 1–5-fmol range.Western Blotting—Rat myocyte extracts were prepared by mixing freshly isolated myocytes for 30 min on ice with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer of the following composition: 9.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Igepal Ca-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 30 μl/ml aprotinin. Myocytes were passed through a 21-gauge needle, incubated 30 min on ice in radioimmune precipitation buffer with freshly added 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Blotto (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% powdered milk), and Western analysis was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence detection as described (33Huang X.P. Pi Y. Lokuta A.J. Greaser M.L. Walker J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1625-1634PubMed Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Labeling—Myocytes skinned in 100 μg/ml saponin were washed extensively and then incubated with primary antibody (diluted 1:50 or 1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Following extensive washing with 2% bovine serum albumin in relaxing solution, myocytes were incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Highly cross-adsorbed Alexa-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-568 goat anti-mouse IgG were used at 1:100 dilutions. After extensive washing, images were acquired with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser controlled by 24-bit LaserSharp software. For double labeling, 50 μg/ml WGA Alexa-660 conjugate was added together with primary antibody. For fluorescein-ET-1 binding, rat cardiac cells were incubated with 10 nm fluorescein-ET-1 overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, an Alexa 488-based signal amplification kit for fluorescein (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.Canine Left Ventricular Membrane Fractionation—Sarcolemmal, T-tubular, and dyadic membrane fractions were prepared as previously described (34Balijepalli R.C. Lokuta A.J. Maertz N.A. Buck J.M. Haworth R.A. Valdivia H.H. Kamp T.J. Cardiovas. Res. 2003; 59: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30–35 g of canine left ventricle was homogenized, and a total membrane fraction (free of myofilaments and soluble proteins) was obtained by differential centrifugation. This crude membrane fraction was loaded onto discontinuous sucrose density gradients composed of 21, 31, 40, and 55% (w/v) sucrose and centrifuged for 2 h at 141,000 × g. Membranes were recovered from three distinct interfaces (Fraction I, 10/21% sucrose; Fraction II, 21/31% sucrose; Fraction III, 31/40% sucrose), diluted, pelleted at 141,000 × g, and stored at -80 °C.Binding Studies—Radioligand-binding assays were performed in triplicate. 50 μg of membranes were incubated with 0.025–1 nm [125I]ET-1 for 1 h at 32 °C in 0.2 ml containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 0.0015% aprotinin, 2% bovine serum albumin. Preincubation in 1 μm unlabeled ET-1 was used to assess nonspecific [125I]ET-1 binding. Membrane-bound ligand was separated from free ligand by rapid vacuum filtration over GF/C filters on a 24-well harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) with three washes of ice-cold incubation buffer. Data were fit to a single-site binding model by nonlinear regression analysis using SigmaPlot software.RESULTSInotropic Responses to ET-1 and Diacylglycerol—Twitch responses after treatment of rat ventricular myocytes with ET-1 and diacylglycerol are illustrated in Fig. 1. Perfusion of electrically paced myocytes with 10 nm ET-1 increased twitch amplitude by 60–90% over 10 min (Fig. 1A). Perfusion of 20 μm diC8 did not mimic this positive inotropic response but instead showed two distinct types of inhibitory response: a 30–40% decrease in twitch amplitude and an abrupt loss of excitability (Fig. 1A). A BHC-caged diC8 compound (structure in Fig. 1B) was then used to photorelease diC8 in different subdomains of myocytes. First, two-photon microscopy showed that the intrinsically fluorescent BHC-caged diC8 compound was incorporated into virtually all intracellular membranes of ventricular myocytes (Fig. 1B). Photorelease of BHC-caged diC8 was then accomplished in selected optical sections by raster scanning the cell with the two-photon laser at a 3-fold higher laser power. The x-y dimensions of the scan were matched to the cell dimensions by the laser scanning software. The z dimension was dictated by the point spread function of the titanium sapphire laser (measured to be ≤2 μm through the 40 × 1.4 numerical aperture objective) (32Wokosin D.L. Squirrell J.M. Eliceiri K.W. White J.G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2003; 74: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).“Deep photolysis” was accomplished by scanning an optical section at mid-cell depth (typically a plane with visible nuclei; estimated distance from cell surface ≥ 4 μm), giving rise to a positive inotropic response (Fig. 1C). This response developed within 10 min after uncaging. In contrast, “surface photolysis” was performed by centering the upper membrane surface (the surface not in contact with the glass floor) within the scanned optical plane (estimated distance from cell surface ≤ 1 μm). In this case, twitch amplitudes were inhibited within 5 min of uncaging (Fig. 1C), sometimes changing quite abruptly from twitch to twitch as observed with perfusion of diC8. This sudden loss of twitch amplitude induced by diC8 was not due to nonspecific cell toxicity, because it could be reversed by washing or by increasing stimulation voltage (Fig. 1C). These data show that generation of diC8 at the surface sarcolemma produced a fundamentally different effect (twitch inhibition or negative inotropy) than did generation of diC8 within deeper membrane compartments (positive inotropy). Importantly, only the deep photolysis protocol mimicked the response to 10 nm ET-1.Localization of ET-1 Receptors in Rat Myocytes—To explore localization of receptors capable of binding ET-1, rat myocytes were stained with biologically active fluorescein-ET-1 (Fig. 2A). An anti-fluorescein immunological amplification kit (see “Experimental Procedures”) was employed to obtain this pattern, reflecting a relatively low ET-1 receptor density in these cells. Fluorescein-ET-1 binding to receptors gave a striated pattern, which was greatly reduced by preincubation of myocytes with unlabeled ET-1 (Fig. 2B) or with the ETA receptor-selective antagonist BQ123 (not shown). The pronounced striation pattern is reminiscent of T-tubule staining and provides support for a preferential localization of active ET-1 receptors (capable of binding ET-1) in T-tubules compared with non-T-tubular surface sarcolemma.Fig. 2Localization of ETA receptors in T-tubules of rat myocytes.A, two-photon image of a myocyte treated with 10 nm fluorescein-ET-1 and then with Alexa 488 anti-fluorescein antibody. Bar, 10 μm. B, two-photon image of a myocyte pretreated with 1 μm unlabeled ET-1 and then with 10 nm fluorescein-ET-1 and Alexa 488 anti-fluorescein antibody.

F, merged images of D and E with yellow/orange indicating regions of overlap and green indicating WGA alone (arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A more traditional immunofluorescence approach was then used to examine the localization of the ETA receptor subtype on rat ventricular myocytes using confocal microscopy. Fig. 2C shows that the commercial polyclonal antibody used for receptor localization recognized a single band on a Western blot of rat myoycte extracts with the expected molecular weight for ETA receptor (Mr 50,000). Fig. 2D illustrates the confocal fluorescence pattern observed in a rat myocyte stained with this anti-ETA receptor antibody. Like the fluorescein ET-1 probe, the ETA receptor antibody gave a striated pattern. An epitope peptide for this antibody was not available because the antibody was raised against a 120-amino acid domain on the receptor. However, no staining was observed in anti-ETA receptor antibody experiments with secondary antibodies alone (not shown). Fluorescent WGA, a marker of glycoproteins on the extracellular membrane leaflet, strongly stained surface sarcolemma and T-tubules (Fig. 2E). Co-staining of myocytes with anti-ETA and WGA revealed similar striated patterns with overlap (and hence co-localization) predominantly in the T-tubules (Fig. 2F).125I-ET-1 Binding to Cardiac Receptors—A quantitative ET-1 binding assay was employed to determine the density and affinity of ET-1 receptors in cardiac myocytes and cardiac membrane extracts. The assay was used to characterize synthetic fluorescein ET-1 and commercial ET-1 receptor antagonists used in our experiments and afforded another opportunity to examine the subcellular localization of ET-1 binding sites.Receptors on the surface of cardiac myocytes were characterized by their EC50 values in a “competition assay,” where unlabeled ligands competed with 125I-ET-1 binding. In isolated rat ventricular myocytes, we found an EC50 of 170 ± 11 pm for unlabeled ET-1 (commercial and synthetic ET-1 were similar), an EC50 of 2.4 ± 0.4 nm for fluorescein ET-1, and for receptor antagonists BQ123 (ETA-selective) and BQ788 (ETB-selective) EC50 values of 7 and 800 nm, respectively. Nonlinear least squares analysis of direct 125I-ET-1 binding in rat ventricular myocytes revealed an apparent Kd of 610 ± 174 pm and a Bmax of 2 ± 1 × 105 receptors/myocyte.For localization of 125I-ET-1 binding sites by subcellular fractionation, dog heart homogenates were used instead of rat heart homogenates to obtain sufficient membrane material for fractionation. Dog heart appeared to be a reasonable surrogate, since dog ventricular myocytes displayed similar 125I-ET-1 binding properties to rat ventricular myocytes (EC50 = 180 ± 50 pm; 105 ET-1 receptors/myocyte). Dog heart membranes were obtained by homogenization of whole hearts, followed by sucrose density centrifugation to separate membranes into three fractions by buoyant density (33Huang X.P. Pi Y. Lokuta A.J. Greaser M.L. Walker J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1625-1634PubMed Google Scholar). Fraction I at the 21/31% sucrose interface was enriched in surface sarcolemma as indicated by a high oubain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 3A). Fraction II at the 31/40% sucrose interface was enriched in T-tubules as indicated by low oubain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase activity and a high density of dihydropyridine binding sites. Fraction III at the 40/55% sucrose interface contained dyads and sarcoplasmic reticulum and was relatively low both in Na+/K+-ATPase activity and dihydropyridine binding. As shown"
https://openalex.org/W2152597714,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the integral membrane protein Mmm1p is required for maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and retention of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mmm1p localizes to discrete foci on mitochondria that are adjacent to mtDNA nucleoids in the matrix, raising the possibility that this protein plays a direct role in organizing, replicating, or segregating mtDNA. Although Mmm1p has been shown to cross the outer membrane with its C terminus facing the cytoplasm, the location of the N terminus has not been resolved. Here we show that Mmm1p spans both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, exposing its N terminus to the matrix. Surprisingly, deletion of the N-terminal extension decreased steady-state levels of the Mmm1 protein but did not affect mitochondrial morphology or mtDNA maintenance. Moreover, expression of Neurospora crassa MMM1, which naturally lacks a long N-terminal extension, substituted for loss of Mmm1p in budding yeast. These results indicate that the matrix-exposed portion of Mmm1p is not essential for mtDNA nucleoid maintenance. Additional studies revealed that the transmembrane segment and C-terminal domain of Mmm1p are required for foci formation and mitochondrial targeting, respectively.

In the examples cited above, mtDNA loss is thought to be a secondary consequence of changes in mitochondrial shape, because there is currently no evidence that these proteins interact directly or indirectly with mtDNA nucleoids (mtDNA-protein complexes). A second class of mutations that converts tubular mitochondria into large spheres also leads to mtDNA loss. These mutations affect three integral OM proteins, called Mdm10p (25.Sogo L.F. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), Mdm12p (26.Berger K.H. Sogo L.F. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and Mmm1p (27.Burgess S.M. Delannoy M. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1375-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which are thought to form a complex. Roles for this complex in cytoskeletal attachment and mtDNA nucleoid maintenance have been proposed. mitochondrial DNA outer membrane intermembrane space inner membrane transmembrane green fluorescent protein N. crassa MMM1 untranslated region tobacco etch virus TEV cleavage site hemagglutinin proteinase K endoplasmic reticulum. The function of the Mmm1 protein has been studied in some detail. S. cerevisiae Mmm1p is predicted to have a single transmembrane (TM) segment of ∼25 residues (amino acids 92–116) (27.Burgess S.M. Delannoy M. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1375-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cells lacking functional Mmm1p display defects in mitochondrial motility and inheritance, and mitochondria isolated from these cells are defective in ATP-sensitive actin binding activity in vitro (28.Boldogh I. Vojtov N. Karmon S. Pon L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 29.Yang H.-C. Palazzo A. Swayne T.C. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1111-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it was proposed that Mmm1p is required for interactions of mitochondria with the actin cytoskeleton. When tagged at the C terminus with the green fluorescent protein (GFP), Mmm1p-GFP localizes as discrete foci on the surface of mitochondria (30.Aiken Hobbs A.E. Srinivasan M. McCaffery J.M. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Strikingly, these Mmm1p-GFP foci appear adjacent to mtDNA nucleoids in the matrix (30.Aiken Hobbs A.E. Srinivasan M. McCaffery J.M. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Additional biochemical data suggest that Mmm1p resides at contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (30.Aiken Hobbs A.E. Srinivasan M. McCaffery J.M. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that Mmm1p is connected either directly or indirectly to mtDNA nucleoids. Studies of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa MMM1 (NcMMM1) suggest that the cellular role of this protein varies in different cell types. In N. crassa, mitochondria form tubular arrays that co-align with microtubules rather than actin filaments (31.Steinberg G. Schliwa M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 555-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike S. cerevisiae, N. crassa cannot survive in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, and loss of mtDNA results in lethality. Although NcMMM1 is also required for maintenance of normal mitochondrial morphology, it is dispensable for interactions with microtubules (32.Prokisch H. Neupert W. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2961-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33.Fuchs F. Prokisch H. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the Mmm1 protein is not essential for mtDNA stability in N. crassa, because loss-of-function mutations are not lethal (32.Prokisch H. Neupert W. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2961-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, although the role of Mmm1p in mitochondrial morphology maintenance has been conserved during evolution, its roles in cytoskeletal association and/or mtDNA retention may have been altered or lost. The phenotypes observed in mmm1 mutants suggest that Mmm1p contains distinct domains with different functions. A better understanding of Mmm1p structure, topology, and domain function may reveal how this protein carries out activities within the cell. S. cerevisiae Mmm1p contains one predicted TM segment that spans the outer mitochondrial membrane leaving the C-terminal domain in the cytoplasm (27.Burgess S.M. Delannoy M. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1375-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although the N terminus faces the interior of the organelle, its exact location (IMS or matrix) has not been determined. In addition, the specific functions of the Mmm1p N-terminal extension, TM segment, and C-terminal domain have not been explored. In this study, we determined the submitochondrial location of the Mmm1p N terminus and identified domains important for mitochondrial targeting and foci formation. In vivo site-specific cleavage and in vitro protease protection assays revealed that the N terminus of Mmm1p is exposed to the matrix, a topology that requires the protein to span both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Although deletion of the N-terminal extension resulted in reduction of steady-state Mmm1p protein levels, it did not affect protein targeting to the organelle, maintenance of mitochondrial morphology, or mtDNA retention. Moreover, the mtDNA loss phenotype of the S. cerevisiae mmm1 null (mmm1Δ) mutant could be rescued by expressing NcMMM1, which naturally lacks a long N-terminal extension. These findings indicate that the matrix-exposed, N-terminal extension of Mmm1p does not play a direct role in mtDNA maintenance. We further show that the TM segment and C-terminal domain play essential roles in Mmm1p foci formation and mitochondrial targeting, respectively. These combined results suggest that the double membrane-spanning topology of Mmm1p at the membrane contact site is crucial for establishment and maintenance of tubular mitochondrial morphology. Implications of these findings with respect to mtDNA maintenance and cytoskeletal attachment are discussed. Models for the double membrane-spanning topology of Mmm1p are also presented.

The fragment was cloned into the BamHI-BglII sites of pYX142-mtGFP (the BamHI site was converted to blunt ends using DNA polymerase I, Large Fragment) (37.Westermann B. Neupert W.

All clones used in this study were verified by DNA sequencing. Site-specific TEV Cleavage Assay—Yeast cells harboring two plasmids encoding a TEV protease and a substrate protein were pregrown to an A600 of 1.5–3 in SD media. To induce TEV protease expression, cells were washed three times with 1 ml of SGalR media, resuspended to an A600 of 0.4–1, and grown to an A600 of 1–2 in SGalR media. 2 A600 units of cells were collected 3 h (for Su9-TCS-GFP), 6 h (for b2-TCS-GFP), or 16 h (for TCS-Mmm1p-His, TCSmut-Mmm1p-His, and TCS-Mmm1p-GFP) after induction, resuspended in 1 ml of H2O, and lysed by adding 160 μl of 1.85 m NaOH, 7.4% 2-mercaptoethanol on ice for 10 min. The protein extracts were precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 10 min. The precipitates were rinsed with 1 ml of 1 m Tris base, resuspended in 60 μl of SDS gel-loading buffer, and boiled for 3 min. 15 μl of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protease Protection Assay—Yeast cells expressing TCS-Mmm1p-His or TCS-Mmm1-GFP were grown in SR media, and the mitochondria were isolated as described previously (38.Diekert K. de Kroon A.I. Kispal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that oxalyticase (Enzogenetics) was used for spheroplast formation (6 × 104 units in 30-ml suspension containing 2 × 103A600 units of cells). Mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were resuspended in 1 ml of HS buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.6 m sorbitol), H buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4), or HT buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100). If indicated, the samples were treated with proteinase K at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, and kept on ice for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 5 min. For the samples in HS and H buffers, centrifugation was performed at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of HS and H buffers containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in SDS gel-loading buffer. The sample in HT buffer was directly added to SDS gel-loading buffer. The samples corresponding to 30 μg of mitochondria were boiled for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoblot Analysis—Western blots were decorated with mouse monoclonal antibodies generated against HA (1:1,000; University of Utah Core Facility), GFP (1:1000; Covance), or 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (1:2,000; Molecular Probes) and rabbit antisera raised against the N-terminal domain of Fzo1p (1:2,000; Shaw laboratory), Cyb2p (1:2,000; Carla Koehler), or Ssc1p (1:1,000; Elizabeth Craig) in TBS buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h and washed three times with TBS buffer for 10 min. The blots were decorated with the goat anti-mouse or -rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:8,000; Sigma) in TBS buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h and washed three times with TBS buffer for 10 min. Proteins were detected using ECL Plus and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). All steps were performed at room temperature. Microscopy and Imaging—Cells were visualized by a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics, epifluorescence capabilities, and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×100 (numerical aperture 1.4) objective. Filter sets (excitation/beamsplitter/emission) for GFP and red fluorescent protein fluorescence were BP 470 ± 20/FT 495/LP 525 ± 25, and BP 546 ± 6/FT 560/BP 575–640, respectively. Images were captured using a Zeiss AxioCam Mm monochrome digital camera and Zeiss AxioVision 3.1 software and assembled using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Plasmids encoding organelle marker proteins and a staining probe used in this study were pVT100U-mtGFP (37.Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), pRS424ADH-mtRFP (Shaw laboratory), and MitoFluor Red 589 (Molecular Probes) for mitochondria and pJK59 (Sec63p-GFP) (39.Prinz W.A.

The N Terminus of Mmm1p Is Exposed to the Mitochondrial Matrix—To investigate whether the N terminus of Mmm1p resides in the mitochondrial matrix or the IMS, we performed an in vivo site-specific cleavage assay using TEV protease (40.Dougherty W.G. Semler B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 781-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) targeted to either the matrix or the IMS. This protease recognizes the seven-amino acid consensus sequence, EXXYXQ(S/G). Cleavage occurs between the conserved glutamine and serine or glycine residues (41.Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In vivo processing by TEV protease in budding yeast has been applied successfully to examine localization and topology of peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins tagged with TCS (42.Faber K.N.

Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We constructed plasmids encoding TEV proteases fused to the C termini of different mitochondrial presequences including Su9 (amino acids 1–69) from ATPase subunit 9 of N. crassa and b2 (amino acids 1–220) from cytochrome b2 of S. cerevisiae (Su9-TEV and b2-TEV, respectively). Su9 and b2 are well characterized presequences that specifically target various passenger polypeptides, including TEV protease, to the matrix and the IMS, respectively (37.Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 43.Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J.

A. 1999; 96: 11770-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 2J. W. Thatcher and J. M. Shaw, unpublished data. To determine the location of the N terminus, Mmm1p-His was fused to the C terminus of a wild-type TCS (TCS-Mmm1p-His) or a mutated TCS (TCSmut-Mmm1p-His) sequence (Fig. 1A). In addition, GFP was fused to the C terminus of TCS-Mmm1p (TCS-Mmm1p-GFP) (Fig. 1A). Each construct also contained a 1x–3x HA epitope tag, allowing recognition by immunoblot analysis. The TCS-Mmm1p-His, TCSmut-Mmm1p-His, and TCS-Mmm1p-GFP constructs were fully functional and restored normal mitochondrial networks and glycerol growth when expressed in mmm1Δ cells (data not shown). In addition, TCS-Mmm1p-GFP formed mitochondrial foci (data not shown). Processing of the TCS-tagged Mmm1p variants by TEV protease is predicted to generate proteins reduced in size by ∼5 kDa that can be detected with anti-HA antibodies. When TCS-Mmm1p-His was coexpressed with Su9-TEV, low levels of the ∼5-kDa shorter form were detected (Fig. 1B, lane 2, arrow; for each substrate, Su9-TEV and b2-TEV were expressed under identical conditions and for identical times). In contrast, very little of the ∼5-kDa shorter form of TCS-Mmm1p-His was produced by the coexpression of b2-TEV (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In time course experiments, the amount of cleavage product produced by expression of Su9-TEV protease was consistently larger than that produced by b2-TEV expression (data not shown). The cleavage of TCS-Mmm1p-His by Su9-TEV occurred within the TCS, because Su9-TEV did not generate the ∼5-kDa shorter form of the TCSmut-Mmm1p-His substrate (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Moreover, specific Su9-TEV-dependent processing was observed in cells expressing TCS-Mmm1p-GFP (Fig. 1B, lane 2, open arrowhead). Although the processing of TCS-Mmm1p-His and TCS-Mmm1p-GFP was not complete, additional control experiments indicated that it was specific to Su9-TEV. In particular, the substrates Su9-TCS-GFP and b2-TCS-GFP were processed only by Su9-TEV and b2-TEV, respectively (Fig. 1B, lane 2, closed arrowhead and lane 4, closed circle). The latter results demonstrate that TEV proteases are active in the matrix and IMS and that the processing occurs only when both a TEV protease and a substrate are localized in the same mitochondrial subcompartment. Together, these results suggest that the N terminus of Mmm1p is exposed in the matrix. To further examine the topology of Mmm1p, we carried out a conventional protease protection assay in vitro. Mitochondria were isolated from mmm1Δ cells expressing TCS-Mmm1p-His or TCS-Mmm1p-GFP and incubated in the presence or absence of proteinase K (PK) with no treatment (to keep the organelle intact), osmotic shock treatment (to expose the IMS), or Triton X-100 treatment (to solubilize the organelle). As shown in Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 5, anti-HA antibodies decorated the full-length ∼80-kDa TCS-Mmm1p-His and ∼107-kDa TCS-Mmm1p-GFP polypeptides in mitochondrial samples that were not treated with protease. In contrast, when intact mitochondria were exposed to PK (200 μg/ml), an ∼40-kDa proteolytic fragment was detected (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 6). The apparent molecular weight of the protected polypeptide was larger than predicted for this substrate (a cleavage product consisting of 3xMyc-TCS-3xHA plus the first 120-amino acid residues of Mmm1p should migrate at ∼22 kDa). This size increase was not because o"
https://openalex.org/W2001289686,"Comamonas testosteroni 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSD/CR) is a key enzyme in the degradation of steroid compounds in soil and may therefore play a significant role in the bioremediation of hormonally active compounds in the environment. The enzyme is also involved in the degradation of the steroid antibiotic fusidic acid. In addition, 3α-HSD/CR mediates the carbonyl reduction of non-steroidal aldehydes and ketones. Because the gene of 3α-HSD/CR (hsdA) is inducible by steroids, we were interested in the mode of its molecular regulation. Recently, we could identify the first molecular determinant in procaryotic steroid signaling, i.e. a repressor protein (RepA), which acts as a negative regulator by binding to upstream operator sequences of hsdA, thereby blocking hsdA transcription. In this work, we identified and cloned a second novel regulator gene that we named repB. The gene locates 932 bp downstream from hsdA on the C. testosteroni chromosome with an orientation opposite to that of hsdA. The open reading frame of repB consists of 237 bp and translates into a protein of 78 amino acids that was found to act as a repressor that regulates hsdA expression on the translational level. Northern blot analysis, UV-cross linking, gel-shift assays, and competition experiments proved that RepB binds to a 16-nucleotide sequence downstream of AUG at the 5′ end of the 3α-HSD/CR mRNA, thereby blocking hsdA translation. Testosterone, on the other hand, was shown to specifically bind to RepB, thereby yielding the release of RepB from the 3α-HSD/CR mRNA such that hsdA translation could proceed. Data bank searches with the RepB primary structure yielded a 46.2% identity to the regulator of nucleoside diphosphate kinase, a formerly unknown protein from Escherichia coli that can restore a growth defect in alginate production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In conclusion, the induction of hsdA by steroids in fact is a derepression where steroidal inducers bind to two repressor proteins, RepA and RepB, thereby preventing blocking of hsdA transcription and translation, respectively.

Microorganisms capable of utilizing various naturally occurring steroids, including cholesterol and the phytosterols β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campestrol, as carbon and energy sources are relatively widespread in nature (1Mahato S.B.

Complete assimilation of these substrates is achieved through an adaptive complex metabolic pathway involving many enzymatic steps of oxidation responsible for the breakdown of the steroid nucleus (3Kieslich K.

Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since the pioneering work of Talalay and co-workers (7Talalay P. Dobson M.M. Tapley D.F. Nature. 1952; 170: 620-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Marcus P.I. Talalay P. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 661-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is well known that 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is one of the first enzymes of the steroid-catabolic pathway and therefore plays a central role in steroid metabolism. However, the exact mechanism of regulation of this important enzyme by steroids has long been unknown. In previous investigations, the gene encoding 3α-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSD/CR) 1The abbreviations used are: 3α-HSD/CR3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyOLoligonucleotideOpoperatorRepArepressor ARepBrepressor BNdknucleoside diphosphate kinase. (hsdA) was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli (18Möbus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). According to its primary structure, the enzyme was classified as belonging to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (18Möbus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The enzyme was found to be functional as oxidoreductase toward a variety of steroid substrates including the steroid antibiotic fusidic acid (19Oppermann U.C.T. Belai I. Maser E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The enzyme also catalyzes the carbonyl reduction of non-steroidal aldehydes and ketones such as a novel insecticide (NKI 42255) and has therefore been named 3α-HSD/CR (19Oppermann U.C.T. Belai I. Maser E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is suggested that 3α-HSD/CR contributes to important defense strategies of C. testosteroni against natural and synthetic toxicants in addition to its functional role in the steroid degradation pathway for carbon supply (19Oppermann U.C.T. Belai I. Maser E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of 3α-HSD/CR has been solved (20Grimm C. Maser E. Mobus E. Klebe G. Reuter K. Ficner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41333-41339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), revealing that the enzyme is active as a homodimer, which shows an unusual dimerization pattern among the short chain dehydrogenase/reductases (21Ghosh D.

Interestingly, 3α-HSD/CR from C. testosteroni has been found to be inducible by testosterone and progesterone (24Oppermann C.T. Netter K.J. Maser E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of steroid-dependent gene regulation in procaryotes remained obscure. Recently, we reported the first molecular determinant of steroid signaling in C. testosteroni. By investigating the cis- and trans-acting elements of hsdA expression in C. testosteroni, we characterized two palindromic operator domains upstream of hsdA and identified a new gene coding for a trans-acting negative regulator (repressor A, RepA) of hsdA expression (25Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We proved the specific interaction among RepA, testosterone, and the operator domain and found that hsdA is under negative transcriptional control by RepA (25Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present work, we identified and cloned a second regulator gene, which we named repB. We show that the novel regulator protein RepB under non-induced conditions acts as a repressor by binding to the 3α-HSD/CR mRNA, thereby blocking 3α-HSD/CR translation. The presence of testosterone resulted in the liberation of the 3α-HSD/CR mRNA such that translation could proceed. According to our results, the induction of hsdA by steroids in fact is a derepression where steroidal inducers bind to two repressor proteins, RepA and RepB, thereby preventing the blocking of hsdA transcription and translation, respectively. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Host strains E. coli HB101 (Promega) and C. testosteroni ATCC 11996 (Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen) were used for cloning and gene expression. Subcloning of fragments was carried out in plasmids pBBR1MCS-2 (containing the kanamycin resistance gene, a gift from Peterson and co-workers (26Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop II, R.M. Peterson K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar)) and pUC18 (containing the ampicillin resistance gene and obtained from Invitrogen). Plasmid pK18 containing the kanamycin resistance gene was a gift from Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Department of Biotechnology (Basel, Switzerland). The plasmid copy numbers determined were 80 copies of pK18 and pUC18 and 5 copies of pBBR1MCS-2/cell in E. coli. For overexpression and purification of RepB, E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS together with plasmid pET15b from Novagen was used. For 3α-HSD/CR mRNA preparation, plasmid pSPT18 from Roche Applied Science was employed. The tac promoter (280 bp) was obtained by BamHI digestion from plasmid pHA10, which was a gift from H. Arai et. al. (27Arai H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2431-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Growth Media and Growth Conditions—Bacterial cells were grown in a shaker (180 rpm) in Standard I Nutrient broth medium (Merck) or LB medium at 37 °C (E. coli) or at 30 °C (C. testosteroni). Growth media contained 60 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Restriction Enzymes and Other Reagents—Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, S1 nuclease, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Roche Applied Science, New England Biolabs, MBI, Promega, and Amersham Biosciences, respectively, and used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Ampicillin and kanamycin were from AGS (Heidelberg, Germany). DNA Manipulations—Recombinant DNA work was carried out following standard techniques according to Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The fragments cloned in this work are shown in Fig. 1. All of the primers and oligonucleotides were prepared by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Transformation of Bacteria—All of the constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis of the resulting band patterns. Plasmids were purified with the Tip-100 kit from Qiagen. Ligated constructs were transferred into competent E. coli or C. testosteroni cells prepared by the calcium chloride or electroporation method. Double plasmid cotransformations were performed by exploiting the kanamycin resistance gene of pBBR1MCS-2 or pK18 and the ampicillin resistance gene of pUC18. In these cases, both antibiotics were added to the culture medium. Plasmid isolation and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed to prove successful double transformations. Generation and Subcloning of hsdA Gene Regulatory Elements—To localize the coding region and to determine the orientation of the novel repressor gene, restriction fragments were prepared as shown in Fig. 1. A 5.257-kb EcoRI fragment of C. testosteroni chromosomal DNA was subcloned into pBBR1MCS-2 with pairwise XmaI and EcoRI or AvrII and EcoRI digestions, resulting in the generation of pBBX1 and pBBAX7. Corresponding fragments with AvrII and EcoRI or NdeI and EcoRI pairwise digestions were subcloned into pUC18 to produce pAX1, p6N4, and p1N3. Digestion of p6N4 with PstI yielded p6NP1. Kpn2I and NdeI were used to subclone the repA gene fragment into pK18. For silencing repressor RepA, a frameshift mutation was performed by insertion of an additional base at the translational start point of repB to yield pRM4. The generation of pKAN10 was performed as described previously (25Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Subcloning of the repB Repressor Gene—Subcloning of the translational repressor gene repB and the preparation of respective plasmids is shown in Fig. 1. Standard PCR was used to prepare a repB-containing fragment. For transforming C. testosteroni cells with repB, plasmids pBB6N5 and pBB6NP1 were generated from pBBR1MCS-2. The cultures were incubated in 3 ml of kanamycin Standard I Nutrient medium with 27 μg/ml testosterone at 30 °C overnight. The fragment was cloned into pET15b (Novagen) with XhoI and BamHI to yield pETrepB. The repB sequence was checked by MWG. For preparing mRNA of 3α-HSD/CR, the fragment was digested with AvrII and EcoRI and was cloned into pSPT18 (Roche Applied Science) to yield pSPT8 (Fig. 1). Protein Extraction—The probes for 3α-HSD/CR ELISA detection were prepared by lysozyme digestion of 3 ml of bacterial culture and subsequent centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 s. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 1 μg/ml lysozyme. To complete cell lysis, the suspension was frozen (–20 °C, three times). Finally, the samples were centrifuged again at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was diluted to 1 mg/ml protein and used for ELISA and protein determinations. Protein solutions for gel-shift mobility assays were prepared as follows. 2 ml of culture were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 s, and the resulting pellet was washed with 1 ml of TEN (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.001 m EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.0) buffer (three times). After resuspending the cell pellet in 100 μl of TEN buffer, the samples were frozen (–20 °C, three times) and finally centrifuged (13,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant was used for gel-shift mobility assays. Activity Determination of 3α-HSD/CR by HPLC—3α-HSD/CR enzyme activity was assessed by HPLC as described previously (16Oppermann U.C.T. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ELISA of 3α-HSD/CR—To quantify 3α-HSD/CR protein expression, an ELISA was established and respective antibodies were generated (25Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies directed against 3α-HSD/CR from C. testosteroni were prepared according to standard methods. ELISA plates were coated with protein extracts containing 3α-HSD/CR in coating buffer. After washing, antibodies against 3α-HSD/CR were added in a 1:10,000 dilution. The further procedure corresponded to that of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ELISA kit from Roche Diagnostics. Comparison of the signals detected by ELISA and 3α-HSD/CR activity measured by HPLC (18Möbus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) always showed a good correlation. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant RepB—The bacterial overexpression of RepB was performed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen), and the recombinant was protein purified by its His tag sequence. Cells transformed with plasmid pETrepB were grown at 37 °C in a shaker (250 rpm), and maintenance of plasmids was ensured by adding 100 μg/ml ampicillin to the culture media. 8 ml of a culture grown overnight was used to inoculate 400 ml of fresh medium. At an A600 of 0.6, expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h, cells were sedimented and washed once in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 8.0. The cell pellet was either stored at –80 °C for further usage or directly suspended in 15 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole, 6 m urea, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed by sonication (4 × 10 s, ice cooling), and the resulting mixture was centrifuged (1 h, Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 4 °C). 2 ml of the supernatant were applied to a 1 ml of nickel-agarose affinity column (HisTrap™ Pharmacia Biotech). After a 10-ml wash with buffer A, a step gradient of 25, 60, and 100% buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride, 500 mm imidazole, 6 m urea, pH 7.4) at 5 ml each was applied (ÄKTA™ Purifier, Amersham Biosciences). RepB eluted from the column in the 60% step corresponding to an imidazole concentration of 316 mm. Samples containing pure protein as assessed by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4). Messenger RNA Mobility Shift Assays—For the mRNA mobility shift assays, digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled 3α-HSD/CR mRNA was prepared using the SP6/T7 transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Diagnostics). 8 μg of ClaI-linearized pSPT8 was used as DNA template (Fig. 1). The linear DNA (2.4 pm) was incubated with 4 μl of each ATP, CTP, and GTP as well as with 2.6 μl of UTP, 1.4 μl of digoxigenin-11-UTP, 4 μl of buffer, 2 μl of RNase inhibitor, 1 μl of Sp6 RNA polymerase, and 9 μlofH2O from the SP6 transcription kit (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 2 h. Two units of DNase I (RNase-free) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The mixture was heated at 65 °C for 5 min, and 4 μl of 0.2 m EDTA were added to stop the reaction. The resulting mRNA was purified twice by ethanol precipitation. For the mRNA mobility shift assays, an amount of 15 ng of labeled mRNA/lane was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 1 μg of purified RepB in 1× binding buffer (from Roche Kit). After the incubation, mixtures were separated by 4% SDS-PAGE and blotted on nylon membranes and the labeled RNA was visualized by chemiluminescence using the digoxigenin luminescence detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). In Vitro Binding Assays and UV-cross-linking—Binding assays with undigested digoxigenin-labeled 3α-HSD/CR mRNA and RepB consisted of 15 ng of RNA and 1 μg of purified RepB in a volume of 20 μl of 1× binding buffer (from Roche kit). After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the mixtures were separated by 4% SDS-PAGE and blotted on nylon membranes and labeled RNA was visualized by chemiluminescence using the digoxigenin luminescent detection kit. Binding assays for UV-cross-linking contained 32P-labeled 3α-HSD/CR mRNA prepared by using the SP6/T7 transcription kit (Roche Diagnostics) and 1 μg of purified RepB. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 1× binding buffer (from Roche kit). Different amounts of RNase T1 were then added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The binding reactions were transferred into a 96-well plate and irradiated at 254 nm for 15 min at a distance of 3 cm. Residual RNA was digested by the addition of RNase A (100 μg/ml) and incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixtures were supplemented with SDS-loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Computer Analysis—3α-HSD/CR mRNA secondary structure prediction was performed with the mfold program from the mfold server (mfold2.wustl.edu/~mfold/rna/form1.cgi), version 3.1, using default settings (30Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 31Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar). Homology Search and Sequence Alignments—The BLAST program (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71432) Google Scholar) was used to screen protein and DNA databases for proteins that shared sequence similarities. Amino acid sequences were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment option of ClustalX, version 1.8. Identification of a Gene Coding for a Negative Regulator of 3α-HSD/CR Expression—For the identification of the gene product of repB as a repressor of hsdA expression, C. testosteroni cells were transformed with plasmids pBB6N5 and pBB6NP1 (Fig. 1). Compared with the control vector pBBR1MCS-2, a strong repression of hsdA expression occurred (Fig. 2). For further characterization of RepB, co-transformation of E. coli was performed with plasmids containing the hsdA gene (pBBX1, pBBAX7) and the repB gene (p6N4, p6NP1, p1N3) (Fig. 1). Plasmids pBBX1 and pBBAX7 are descendants of the vector pBBR1MCS-2, which contains a kanamycin resistance gene, whereas p6N4, p6NP1, and p1N3 are descendants of the vector pUC18, which contains an ampicillin resistance gene. Supplementing the growth medium with both antibiotics ensured successful double transformations. To determine the orientation of repB, the inserts were cloned in both orientations under the lacZ promoter as shown in Fig. 1. Plasmids p6N4 and p6NP1 are designed such that the lacZ promoter is located upstream and, in p1N3, is located downstream of the repB gene. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the amount of 3α-HSD/CR expressed is significantly lower in cells co-transformed with p6N4 relative to the control (pUC18). 3α-HSD/CR expression is even lower in cells co-transformed with p6NP1. In p1N3 co-transformed cells, 3α-HSD/CR expression is higher but still lower than in the respective control experiments. These results demonstrate that the gene product of repB represses hsdA expression. Because inhibition is strongest when the lacZ promoter is located upstream of repB, its orientation is opposite to that of hsdA (Fig. 1). Decreasing the length between the transcriptional start site of repB and the tac or lacZ promoter reduces the amount of 3α-HSD/CR expression with plasmids pBB6NP1 (Fig. 2) and p6NP1 (Fig. 3), respectively. To conclude, the open reading frame of repB consists of 237 bp (Fig. 4) and translates into a protein of 78 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 8.8 kDa. RepB Does Not Repress hsdA Transcription—RepB does not decrease the amount of 3α-HSD/CR mRNA produced in C. testosteroni cells double transformed with plasmids carrying the genetic information for both genes. In Northern blots, a strong signal of 3α-HSD/CR mRNA can be detected, whereas a significantly weaker band is found in cells expressing RepA (Fig. 5). This indicates that RepB does not act on the level of hsdA transcription. RepB Acts Independently from RepA—To provide evidence that the translational repressor RepB acts independently from the transcriptional repressor RepA, the gene of the latter (repA) was knocked out in pRM4 by the insertion of an additional base at the translational start point of repA (Fig. 1). This causes a frameshift mutation in the repA sequence and consequently a complete loss of the RepA-repressing activity. After transformation of E. coli cells with pRM4, 3α-HSD/CR expression increased compared with cells transformed with pKAN10, which harbors a functional repA gene (Fig. 6A) (25Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). According to this repA silencing in pRM4, the decreased hsdA expression of cells co-transformed with pRM4 and p6NP1 therefore exclusively represents the activity of RepB but not that of RepA. Bacterial Overexpression and Purification of RepB—For further characterization, we overexpressed the His-tagged RepB in E. coli and purified the recombinant protein to homogeneity. After inducing E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring the expression construct pETrepB, a strong band of the expected size (11.4 kDa for the His-tagged protein) was readily observed (data not shown). The resulting protein was packed in inclusion bodies and, for its purification, had to be solubilized using 6 m urea as detergent. By taking advantage of the N-terminal His tag of the recombinant protein, one-step purification to homogeneity by metal chelate affinity chromatography was achieved. After removal of urea, the protein proved to be active and to bind to 3α-HSD/CR mRNA; therefore, thrombin cleavage of the His tag was unnecessary. Testosterone Binding to RepB Causes an Induction of 3α-HSD/CR Expression—Importantly, hsdA repression by RepB is reversed by the addition of testosterone to the culture medium, providing first evidence that RepB binds testosterone (Fig. 6A). Purified RepB did not bind testosterone. However, the addition of increasing amounts of purified RepB to an extract containing 20 μg of E. coli HB101 protein resulted in a concentration-dependent binding of labeled testosterone. This fact reveals, on the one side, the specificity of RepB to bind testosterone but, on the other side, indicates the necessity of an unknown cofactor, which is obviously present in the E. coli extract (Fig. 6B). The ability of RepB to bind testosterone was further substantiated by mixing [3H]testosterone with protein preparations of E. coli HB101 cells expressing RepB after transformation with p6NP1. The addition of competing, unlabeled testosterone gradually reduces the amount of bound, labeled testosterone until background levels are reached (Fig. 6C). Messenger RNA Mobility Shift Assay and UV-cross-linking Studies—A 122-bp fragment of digoxigenin-labeled 3α-HSD/CR mRNA synthesized by the transcription of ClaI-digested pSPT8 was used for mobility shift assays (Fig. 7). The addition of purified recombinant RepB generates a marked shift in mobility. No mobility shift was detected with RepA or empty pET15b plasmid as negative control. The specific binding of RepB to the 3α-HSD/CR mRNA was further substantiated by UV-cross-linking studies (Fig. 8). The addition of both RNase T1 and RNase A to the protein-mRNA complexes resulted in a strong signal of protected RNA covalently attached to RepB.

https://openalex.org/W2005034056,"Ouabain is a glycoside that binds to and inhibits the action of Na+,K+-ATPase. Little is known, however, about the specific requirements of the protein surface for glycoside binding. Using chimeras of gastric H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase, we demonstrated previously that the combined presence of transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase in a backbone of H+,K+-ATPase (HN34/56) is both required and sufficient for high affinity ouabain binding. Since replacement of transmembrane hairpin M3-M4 by the N terminus up to transmembrane segment 3 (HNN3/56) resulted in a low affinity ouabain binding, hairpin M5-M6 seems to be essential for ouabain binding. To assess which residues of M5-M6 are required for ouabain action, we divided this transmembrane hairpin in seven parts and individually replaced these parts by the corresponding sequences of H+,K+-ATPase in chimera HN34/56. Three of these chimeras failed to bind ouabain following expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Altogether, these three chimeras contained 7 amino acids that were specific for Na+,K+-ATPase. Individual replacement of these 7 amino acids by the corresponding amino acids in H+,K+-ATPase revealed a dramatic loss of ouabain binding for F783Y, T797C, and D804E. As a proof of principle, the Na+,K+-ATPase equivalents of these 3 amino acids were introduced in different combinations in chimera HN34. The presence of all 3 amino acids appeared to be required for ouabain action. Docking of ouabain onto a three-dimensional-model of Na+,K+-ATPase suggests that Asp804, in contrast to Phe783 and Thr797, does not actually form part of the ouabain-binding pocket. Most likely, the presence of this amino acid is required for adopting of the proper conformation for ouabain binding. Ouabain is a glycoside that binds to and inhibits the action of Na+,K+-ATPase.

Most likely, the presence of this amino acid is required for adopting of the proper conformation for ouabain binding. Na+,K+-ATPase maintains the electrochemical gradients present across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells by catalyzing ATP-dependent transport of sodium and potassium ions (1Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac glycosides such as ouabain specifically inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The Na+,K+-ATPase-binding site for ouabain has not been identified yet, although many studies with this goal have been performed. One of the difficulties is that during the catalytic cycle, the enzyme is in different conformations, each of which has a different affinity for ouabain. It has been established that the highest affinity for ouabain is obtained when the enzyme is in the phosphorylated E2P form (2Matsui H. Schwartz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 151: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Since it is known that ouabain acts on the α-subunit from the extracellular side, most attention has been paid to the extracellular loops and the transmembrane domains of this subunit. Price and Lingrel (3Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) demonstrated that two polar but uncharged amino acids (Gln111 and Asn122) at the border of the first extracellular loop are responsible for the high ouabain sensitivity of nonrodent Na+,K+-ATPase. In ouabain-resistant rodents, two charged amino acids are present on these positions. Although in first instance, most attention was directed to this region of the catalytic subunit, later studies showed that other parts of the catalytic subunit might also be involved in ouabain binding. Extensive random mutagenic analysis of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, coupled with an ouabain selection system, has been used to identify amino acid residues that alter the inhibitory potency of ouabain (4Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Burns E.L. Nicholas R.A. Price E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14176-14182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Several amino acids present in or around the third extracellular loop (Phe786, Leu793, Thr797) that are possibly involved in ouabain binding were identified. In these experiments, the apparent IC50 for the effect of ouabain on Na+,K+-ATPase activity was determined. The disadvantage of this approach is that a change in the IC50 value can be attributed to a direct effect on the ouabain-binding site but also to a conformational equilibrium shift.Gastric H+,K+-ATPase, like Na+,K+-ATPase, belongs to the P2 type ATPases and has a similar subunit composition and structure. Although the catalytic subunits of gastric H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase are 63% identical, the former enzyme is not inhibited by ouabain. Thus those amino acids that differ between these two enzymes might be important for the specificity of ouabain binding.Previously, we demonstrated that the mere introduction of transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase into a backbone of gastric H+,K+-ATPase resulted in the formation of a high affinity ouabain-binding site (see Fig. 1), as measured by direct binding of [3H]ouabain to the E2P form of Na+,K+-ATPase (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Neither the introduction of hairpin M3-M4 nor that of hairpin M5-M6 alone rendered the chimeric enzyme sensitive to ouabain. Ishii et al. (8Ishii T. Lemas M.V. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6103-6107Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed, however, that a chimera containing the N-terminal 200 amino acids of Na+,K+-ATPase and the backbone of Ca2+-ATPase was able to bind ouabain, although with a low affinity. In our previous study, we found that chimera HNN3, containing the N-terminal 279 amino acids of Na+,K+-ATPase and the backbone of H+,K+-ATPase, could not bind ouabain (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that another chimeric enzyme (HNN3/56), containing the N-terminal 279 amino acids and M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase, was sensitive for ouabain. Taken together, these results indicate that the transmembrane hairpin M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase plays a crucial role in ouabain binding. Therefore, this region was investigated in detail by mutating the amino acids in this hairpin that are specific for Na+,K+-ATPase, in order to pinpoint the individual amino acids that are important for ouabain binding. This report shows that a chimera in which only the M3-M4 hairpin and 3 amino acids of M5-M6 (Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) originate from Na+,K+-ATPase, whereas all other parts of the α-subunit as well as the complete β-subunit originate from H+,K+-ATPase, binds ouabain with a high affinity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Chimeras and Mutants—The chimeras and mutants presented in this report were constructed from the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit containing the R113Q and D124N mutations (3Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. Chimera HN34/56 was made as described previously (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and chimera HNN3/56 was constructed from chimeras HNN3 and HN56 (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1- and β1-subunits, the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunits, and the chimeras were subcloned into the pTLN vector, which is suitable for the Xenopus Laevis oocyte expression system (10Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the mutants described in this report. All introduced mutations were verified by sequencing. For clarity reasons, we also used the numbering of the pig Na+,K+-ATPase for residues in part originating from H+,K+-ATPase.Expression in X. laevis Oocytes—X. laevis were sacrificed, and parts from ovaries were removed. Oocytes were separated by incubation for 2 h in modified Ringer's solution (90 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MOPS, 1The abbreviation used is: ! MOPS3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid. pH 7.4, 30 units/liter penicillin, and 30 mg/liter streptomycin) containing 2 mg/ml collagenase A. Prophase-arrested oocytes of stages V and VI were selected for injection of cRNA. cRNA synthesis was carried out with SP6-polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) and capping analogue (Invitrogen). As a template, the HpaI-linearized pTLN vector was used. For the expression of the α- and β-subunits, oocytes were injected with 10 and 2 ng of the corresponding cRNAs. After injection, the oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 18 °C in modified Ringer's solution.Preparation of Total Membranes—Oocytes were disrupted by passing them ±20 times through a standard 200-μl Gilson pipette in homogenization buffer (10 μl/oocyte; 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and Complete protease inhibitor (according to the instructions of the manufacturer, Roche Applied Science)). The yolk granules were removed by centrifugation of the samples (1000 × g,4 °C, 3 min), and the supernatant was collected in a new tube. This step was repeated twice. Subsequently, the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). Finally, the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (4 μl/oocyte), and the samples were stored at -20 °C.Western Blotting—The total membrane fraction of X. laevis oocytes was solubilized in sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE gels containing 10% acrylamide according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The α-subunits of the chimeras and H+,K+-ATPase were detected with the polyclonal antibody HKB (12Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibody was detected using an anti-rabbit secondary antibody, which was labeled with peroxidase (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark).[3H]Ouabain Binding—A total membrane fraction equivalent to 2.5 oocytes was incubated at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 7.0), 1 mm ATP, 5.0 mm MgCl2, and 250 nm (or 10 nm) [3H]ouabain in a final volume of 50 μl. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was chilled for 15 min at 0 °C. The ouabain-protein complex was collected by filtration over a 0.8-μm membrane filter (Schleicher and Schuell). After washing with ice-cold water twice, the filters were analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis.ATP Phosphorylation—ATP phosphorylation was carried out as described previously (13Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11604-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A total membrane fraction equivalent to 0.45 oocyte was incubated at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 6.0) and 1.3 mm MgCl2 in a volume of 50 μl. After a 30–60 min preincubation, 10 μl of 0.6 μm [γ-32P]ATP was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 10 s. The reaction was stopped by adding 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in 0.1 m phosphoric acid, and the phosphorylated protein was collected by filtration over a 0.8-μm membrane filter (Schleicher and Schuell). After washing twice, the filters were analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis.Calculations—Data are presented as mean values with S.E. Differences were tested for significance by means of the Student's t test.Materials—[3H]Ouabain (17 Ci mmol-1) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol-1) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.RESULTSIn a previous study, we found that a chimera containing the backbone of the α-subunit and the complete β-subunit from gastric H+,K+-ATPase and only the M3-M4 and M5-M6 hairpins of Na+,K+-ATPase (chimera HN34/56; Fig. 1) bound [3H]ouabain with a high affinity (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We next constructed a chimera in which both the N terminus until transmembrane segment M3 (N-terminal 279 amino acids) and the hairpin M5-M6 of H+,K+-ATPase were exchanged by the homologous parts of Na+,K+-ATPase (HNN3/56). This chimera possessed no ATPase activity but could still be phosphorylated by ATP. When 1 mm ouabain was present during the phosphorylation reaction, the phosphorylation level decreased by almost 40%. The phosphorylation levels of chimeras containing only the N terminus until M3 (HNN3), M3-M4 (HN34), or M5-M6 (HN56) of Na+,K+-ATPase were not decreased by the same ouabain concentration. Under conditions in which chimera HN34/56 bound ouabain, chimera HNN3/56, however, did not. Thus, it can be concluded that both chimeras HNN3/56 and HN34/56 interact with ouabain, although the affinity for ouabain is much lower for HNN3/56 than for HN34/56. The common segment in these two chimeras is Na+,K+-ATPase hairpin M5-M6, which therefore seems to be crucial for ouabain binding. In the remainder of this study, we focused on this hairpin and identified the amino acids that are essential in ouabain binding.Hairpin M5-M6 contains 21 amino acids that differ between Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 2). To identify the essential amino acids in hairpin M5-M6, we replaced seven groups of Na+,K+-ATPase residues by their H+,K+-ATPase counterparts (Fig. 2) and measured ouabain binding. These seven mutants of chimera HN34/56 were expressed together with the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit in X. laevis oocytes. The expression levels of the α-subunits were determined by Western blotting of total membranes by using the polyclonal antibody HKB that recognizes the M4-M5 loop of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (12Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that the expression levels of most mutated chimeras were similar to those of chimera HN34/56. The expression level of mutated chimera QKRQ seemed to be somewhat lower. The [3H]ouabain binding levels of the mutants FF, TV, and CDG (Fig. 3B), as determined in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 250 nm ouabain, were significantly different from those of chimera HN34/56 (p < 0.05), but not from those of uninjected oocytes (p > 0.05). This means that these mutants lost their ability to bind [3H]ouabain under these conditions. On the other hand, the [3H]ouabain binding capacity of chimera HN34/56 and the mutants SI, IANI, and MVAI were similar and much higher than those of FF, TV, and CDG. Although the [3H]ouabain binding capacity of mutant QKRQ was slightly lower that that of mutants SI, IANI and MVAI, it was, related to its lower expression level, not decreased. This indicates that none of the latter mutated amino acids are responsible for the ouabain specificity of Na+,K+-ATPase. Taken together, these findings suggest that at least 3 and maximally 7 amino acids present in hairpin M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase, and absent in gastric H+,K+-ATPase, are important for ouabain binding.Fig. 2Amino acid sequence alignments between the M5-M6 region of rat Na+,K+-ATPase and rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α1-subunits. The Na+,K+-ATPase sequence is shown above the corresponding H+,K+-ATPase sequence. Amino acid numbers are indicated on the left side. Asterisks indicate differences between both sequences. The seven mutants are indicated as SI, FF, IANI, TV, CDG, MVAI, and QKRQ.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is directed against the large intracellular loop of H+,K+-ATPase. In B, [3H]ouabain binding was determined by incubating the membranes at room temperature in 5.0 mm MgCl2,50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 7.0), 1.0 mm ATP, and 250 nm [3H]ouabain. Mean values ± S.E. of 5–8 enzyme preparations are shown. *, significantly different from HN34/56 (p < 0.05).

Western blotting confirmed similar expression patterns of these mutants and chimera HN34/56 (Fig. 4A). To exclude the possibility that a loss of ouabain binding capacity of one of these mutants is due to the impossibility of forming a phosphorylated intermediate, we tested the phosphorylation capacity of these seven mutants. Since all mutants could be phosphorylated by ATP up to a similar level (data not shown), the latter possibility could be excluded. Next, the ouabain binding level of these mutants was measured. Fig. 4B shows that the [3H]ouabain binding levels of mutants F783Y, T797C, and D804E were not significantly different from those of uninjected oocytes (p > 0.05) and significantly different from those of chimera HN34/56 (p < 0.05), indicating that these 3 amino acids might be involved in ouabain binding. The [3H]ouabain binding level of mutant F786Y was lower than that of chimera HN34/56 but still higher than that of uninjected oocytes. The ouabain binding levels of mutants V798I, C802F, and G806C were not significantly different from those of chimera HN34/56 (p > 0.05) and much higher than those of the mutants F783Y, T797C, and D804E. These experiments suggest that Phe783, Tyr797, and Asp804 are all important for ouabain binding. These “loss of function” experiments, however, do not exclude the possibility that mutation of these amino acids indirectly results in loss of ouabain binding capacity without involvement of these residues in direct ouabain binding.Fig. 4[3H]Ouabain binding of HN34/56 mutants. In A, membranes were blotted, and the presence of the α-subunit and was detected with antibody HKB (12Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is directed against the large intracellular loop of H+,K+-ATPase. In B, [3H]ouabain binding was determined by incubating the membranes at room temperature in 5.0 mm MgCl2,50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 7.0), 1.0 mm ATP, and 250 nm [3H]ouabain.

The latter chimera contains only hairpin M3-M4 of Na+,K+-ATPase and does not bind ouabain (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Again, Western blotting (Fig. 5A) and ATP phosphorylation experiments (data not shown) confirmed equal expression and phosphorylation levels of all tested mutants. [3H]ouabain binding measurements demonstrated that under the conditions used, none of the double mutants showed a [3H]ouabain binding level significantly higher than those of uninjected oocytes (Fig. 5A). Only the chimera with all three mutations, HN34/FTD, was able to bind ouabain. Thus, Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804 are all essential for high affinity ouabain binding.Fig. 5[3H]Ouabain binding of HN34 mutants.

Chimeras HNN3/FTD and HNN3/56 did not bind [3H]ouabain under our experimental conditions, but the phosphorylation levels of these chimeras decreased when 1 mm ouabain was added by 41% ± 3.5 and 38% ± 7.8 (mean ± S.E.), respectively. This indicates that both chimeras do bind ouabain, although with a lower affinity than chimera HN34/FTD.In our previous work (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the apparent ouabain binding affinity of chimera HN34/56 was similar to that of Na+,K+-ATPase. In an ouabain-replacement assay (Fig. 6), we show that the apparent ouabain binding affinity of chimera HN34/FTD (0.3 ± 0.1 μm) is also similar to that of Na+,K+-ATPase (0.5 ± 0.1 μm) and chimera HN34/56 (0.2 ± 0.1 μm).Fig. 6[3H]Ouabain binding to HN34/56, HN34/FTD and rat Na+,K+-ATPase R113Q/D124N.

Helv. Physiol. Pharmacol. Acta. 1953; 11: 346-354PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that cardiac glycosides inhibit active transport of Na+ and K+, and a few years later, it was shown that this transport was caused by the Na+,K+-ATPase (24Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). The Na+,K+-ATPase-binding site for cardiac glycosides (like ouabain) has not been identified yet, but knowledge about this site might be crucial for the development of new drugs. In a previous study, we demonstrated that introduction of transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase into H+,K+-ATPase resulted in the formation a high affinity ouabain-binding site, whereas the introduction of M3-M4 or M5-M6 alone did not give ouabain binding (7Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified 3 residues (Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) in M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase that play a key role in ouabain binding.Although the catalytic subunits of gastric H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase are for 63% identical, they have different inhibitor sensitivities. Ouabain inhibits Na+,K+-ATPase activity but does not inhibit gastric H+,K+-ATPase activity. In this study, we describe chimeras HNN3/56 and HN34/56 that both interact with ouabain. However, [3H]ouabain did bind to HN34/56, but binding to HNN3/56 could not be detected under the applied assay conditions. However, the phosphorylation level of chimera HNN3/56 could be reduced by ouabain, indicating that ouabain interacts with this chimera and probably binds to it with a low affinity.That chimeras HNN3/56 and HN34/56 both contain transmembrane hairpin M5-M6 indicates that this hairpin is essential for ouabain binding. Movement of hairpin M5-M6 during the catalytic cycle is important for active ion transport (15Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binding of ouabain to this hairpin probably inhibits enzyme activity through immobilization of this hairpin. In the present study, we used chimera HN34/56 as the starting point to determine which amino acids in M5-M6 are responsible for ouabain binding. Transmembrane hairpin M5-M6 contains 21 amino acids that are different in Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase.We started with an H+,K+-ATPase preparation that did not bind ouabain and obtained a chimeric enzyme that could be inhibited by ouabain. All amino acids present in M5-M6 of HN34/56 were groupwise mutated into their corresponding H+,K+-ATPase residues. Three mutants, containing seven mutations (FF, TV, and CDG), lost their [3H]ouabain binding capacity. This suggested that between 3 and 7 of these mutated amino acids present in hairpin M5-M6 of Na+,K+-ATPase are involved in ouabain binding. Individual mutational analysis revealed that only mutants F783Y, T797C, and D804E completely lost the ability to bind [3H]ouabain. Finally, we introduced the mutations Y783F, C797T, and E804D into chimera HN34 (HN34/FTD). Whereas chimera HN34 did not bind ouabain, chimera HN34/FTD obtained a high affinity ouabain-binding site. The apparent affinity of this chimera is similar to that of wild type Na+,K+-ATPase and chimera HN34/56. These results revealed that Na+,K+-ATPase residues Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804 are essential for high affinity ouabain binding.Of these amino acid residues, only a role for Thr797 in ouabain binding has been described. Random mutagenesis of sheep Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit showed that mutants T797N, T797A, and T797V lost their ouabain sensitivity (66–80-fold decrease), indicating that Thr797 was involved in the interaction with ouabain (17Feng J.

Compared with red fluorescent protein from Discosoma sp. (DsRed), mutants of these so-called far-red proteins exhibit a clear red shift in emission spectra as well. Here we report that a far-red chromoprotein from Goniopora tenuidens (gtCP) contains a chromophore of the same chemical structure as DsRed. Denaturation kinetics of both DsRed and gtCP under acidic conditions indicates that the red form of the chromophore (absorption maximum at 436 nm) converts to the GFP-like form (384 nm) by a one-stage reaction. Upon neutralization, the 436-nm form of gtCP, but not the 384-nm form, renaturates instantly, implying that the former includes a chromophore in its intact state. gtCP represents a single-chain protein and, upon harsh denaturing conditions, shows three major bands in SDS/PAGE, two of which apparently result from hydrolysis of an acylimine C=N bond. Instead of having absorption maxima at 384 nm and 450 nm, which are characteristic for a GFP-like chromophore, fragmented gtCP shows a different spectrum, which presumably corresponds to a 2-keto derivative of imidazolidinone. Mass spectra of the chromophore-containing peptide from gtCP reveal an additional loss of 2 Da relative to the GFP-like chromophore.

A variety of fluorescent proteins from Anthozoa species has been described recently (1Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat.

A. 2002; 99: 11646-11651Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These proteins represent the GFP-like family according to their homology to the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria jellyfish. A growing interest in GFP-like proteins was stimulated largely by their potential utilization as biomarkers in living cells (7Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4899) Google Scholar). Besides their applications to cellular biology, GFP-like proteins are of significant interest as the subjects of basic protein chemistry and enzymology. The main feature distinguishing these proteins from other known chromoproteins is the chromophore moiety composed of modified amino acid residues. Accordingly, the color of GFP-like protein is encoded genetically, and the chromophore center is assembled post-translationally by autocatalytic reactions inside the protein molecule. Thus, GFP-like proteins break the earlier adopted concept that chromoproteins are formed by combining an apoprotein with a prosthetic group. Currently, about 30 members of this family have been described (4Labas Y.A. Gurskaya N.G. Yanushevich Y.G. Fradkov A.F. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. Matz M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Remarkably, all known CPs can be converted to fluorescent analogues by means of mutagenesis (3Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Martynov V.I. Yanushevich Y.G. Lukyanov K.A.

Despite great diversity in the colors of coral proteins, this variability seems to be achieved in a fairly conservative way. Presently, few reactions have been described as sufficient to generate the chromophore formation in different FPs and CPs. All known fluorescent proteins contain an invariant XYG consensus in the chromophore-forming region and, upon maturation, include the chromophore core built up from p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolidinone as a structural unit. Nevertheless, based on imidazolidinone derivatives, different groups of colors of FPs and CPs are currently considered to stem from chemically distinct species (10Remington S.J.

According to the chromophore structure, GFP-like proteins can be classified into subfamilies. The two best studied are GFP and DsRed, the fine crystal structures of which have been determined recently (11Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 12Wall M.A. Socolich M. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct.

A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In this study, we selected gtCP because light absorption of this protein is considerably shifted to longer wavelengths (λmax = 580 nm), and therefore we tested whether different chromophore chemical structures provide a satisfactory explanation for the color diversity. Unexpectedly, our results demonstrate that the purple-blue chromoprotein from Goniopora tenuidens contains the same chromophore as DsRed. Therefore, according to the above criteria, gtCP should be attributed to the DsRed subfamily of GFP-like proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—For heterologous expression, a full-length cDNA encoding gtCP was cloned into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen). The recombinant protein with the N-terminal 6-His tag was expressed in Escherichia coli (3Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Martynov V.I. Yanushevich Y.G. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and purified from cell lysates by metal-affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 Bio UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Varian). Chymotrypsin Digestion and Chromopeptide Purification—His-tagged gtCP was denatured by the addition of NaOH solution to the final concentration of 0.1 m. The protein solution was further complemented with Tris (10 mm) and titrated with hydrochloric acid to pH 7.8. Chymotrypsin (Sigma) digestion (enzyme to protein ratio, 1/30 (w/w)) was performed at 37 °C for 5 h and finally quenched by acetic acid (to pH 4.0). The digest was applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column (Ultrasphere ODS, BD Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, and peptides were eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile in the same buffer. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm and 380 nm. The peptide fractions with absorption at 380 nm were collected and sequenced with a model 491 Procise sequenator (Applied Biosystems). Mass Spectrometry of gtCP Chromopeptide—The mass spectral analysis was performed with Thermo Finnigan LCQ deca XP fitted to electrospray ionization source and ion trap mass analyzer. The peptide was injected at the concentration of 5 pm in 0.1% formic acid in 50/50 (v/v) water-methanol solution at the flow rate of 3 μl/min. The heated capillary was operated at 210 °C, sheath gas was set to 7 units, and the needle voltage was +3.2 kV. A relative collision energy of 29–35% was used in MS/MS experiments with an isolation width of 1.2 units. “Red-to-Green” Conversion of gtCP Chromophore—The spectral diversity of GFP-like proteins is thought to derive from different types of chromophores involved in a protein structure and the way by which a chromophore interacts with a protein environment (12Wall M.A. Socolich M. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In the denatured state, interactions with amino acid side chains do not contribute significantly to the overall absorption spectra, so that upon denaturation, the visible spectrum of the protein reflects the type of implicated chromophore structure. Furthermore, we anticipated that unfolding of the protein protective shell upon denaturation would allow spectral monitoring of the chromophore transformations after exposure to the surrounding solvents. Upon heat-induced (100 °C) or alkaline denaturation (0.1 m NaOH), the chromophore of gtCP converted instantly to a green form, i.e. absorption spectra of gtCP were very similar to the denatured GFP with the maxima at 384 nm (pH 3.0) and 450 nm (pH 14.0). Spectrophotometric titration of the green form of gtCP (not shown) indicated the presence of an ionizable group with pKa = 7.9, which correlated well with the value previously reported for the GFP chromophore phenolic group (15Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 220-222Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggested that the gtCP chromophore shares common features with GFP and contains p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolidinone as a core structure. The acid-stimulated denaturation of gtCP resulted in more complex spectral changes. Under native conditions, gtCP exhibited maximal absorption at 580 nm with a shoulder at 545 nm (3Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Martynov V.I. Yanushevich Y.G. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Initially at pH 1.8, gtCP showed an absorption maximum at 436 nm (the red form of the chromophore of the denatured gtCP), which further gradually transformed to a 384-nm peak upon incubation (Fig. 1A). A single isosbestic point at 406 nm suggested that there are only two species that exist in a red-to-green pathway of the gtCP chromophore conversion and that these two forms interconvert directly without any detectable intermediates. When, in the course of a red-to-green spectral transition, pH was adjusted to 4.0, the 436-nm form of gtCP immediately renaturated, as judged by the reappearance of the 580-nm peak, which is characteristic of the native form of gtCP, and by the disappearance of the 436-nm absorbance (Fig. 1B). Conversely, the 384-nm form retained both the net absorbance and peak position of the absorption band. Accordingly, the extent of renaturation correlated with the ratio of 436-nm to 384-nm forms, which reduced gradually upon incubation. These results implied that the 436-nm form includes a red-shifting modification, which extends a GFP-like chromophore-conjugated system. Remarkably, the red form of the denatured gtCP contains a chromophore in its intact state, as judged by immediate renaturation of this form. By contrast, conversion to the green state is irreversible in this case, suggesting that spectral transition from 436 to 384 nm coincides with the irreversible loss of bathochromic modification by the gtCP chromophore. A similar situation was observed for the chromophore of DsRed, another protein from the GFP family (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). A GFP-like imidazolidinone-conjugated system in DsRed is extended by an additional acylimine substituent (Fig. 2B, I). In the case of DsRed, the abolition of a red-shifting modification upon denaturation was shown to be due to hydration of an acylimine (Fig. 2B, II), upon which the spectra of DsRed immediately reverted back to a GFP-like absorbance (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To test whether a red-to-green conversion is described by the same spectral transition, similar experiments were carried out with DsRed. As compared with gtCP, DsRed proved to be more sensitive to acid-induced denaturation; therefore, spectral transition in this case was monitored upon incubation of the protein at pH 2.8. As shown in Fig. 1C, DsRed exhibits a red-to-green spectral transition with the same maximum of the red form (436 nm) and an isosbestic point at 406 nm. Fragmentation of gtCP upon Denaturation—In earlier reports (15Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 220-222Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar), GFP was shown to migrate as a single band in SDS/PAGE, with an Mr of 28 kDa. It has been demonstrated (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) that DsRed partially splits into fragments, the extent of fragmentation depending on the conditions of denaturation. The purple chromoprotein from Anemonia sulcata, asFP595, has been shown to exist predominantly in a fragmented form regardless of denaturing conditions (16Martynov V.I. Savitsky A.P. Martynova N.Y. Savitsky P.A. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21012-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the conditions and the extent of fragmentation are characteristic features for a chromophore type of GFP-like proteins. The fragmentation of DsRed was shown to occur after the complete hydrolysis of an acylimine and does not exceed 50% of the total protein, because mature DsRed contains red and green species in an approximately equal ratio (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 17Garcia-Parajo M.F. Koopman M. van Dijk E.M.H.P. Subramaniam V. van Hulst N.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14392-14397Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As expected, DsRed, boiled in the electrophoresis buffer, showed two fragment bands in SDS/PAGE, with apparent masses of 10 kDa and 18 kDa and a major band of a full-length protein, with an Mr of 28 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane a1). The extent of DsRed fragmentation increased considerably when the protein was preboiled in 0.1 m HCl (Fig. 2A, lane a2). Likewise, gtCP, boiled in a sample buffer, migrated predominantly as a single band, indicating that the mature protein originally exists as a single-chain polypeptide (Fig. 2A, lane b1). However, the situation changed when gtCP was pretreated with 0.1 m HCl (Fig. 2A, lane b2). In this case, gtCP showed a remarkable increase in the extent of fragmentation (80% of the overall protein), indicating that a certain bond near the chromophore center undergoes acid-stimulated hydrolysis. Assuming that this bond corresponds to the red-shifting modification of the GFP-like chromophore, the mature gtCP should include no less than 80% of the red chromophore. Although both DsRed and gtCP split into common fragments after acid-induced hydrolysis of a red-shifting bond, there was no direct evidence that fragmentation of gtCP occurs by means of the DsRed pathway; i.e. it is hydrolysis of an acylimine that leads to the fragmentation of gtCP. One possible way to obtain the information concerning the route of fragmentation is by analysis of the end products of hydrolysis of acylimine-substituted imidazolidinones. By carefully inspecting the structure of the product of complete hydrolysis of acylimine as published by Gross et al. (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), one can find an additional C=O electron-withdrawing substituent. Therefore, it could be expected that hydration of acylimine (Fig. 2B, II) would shift spectra back to a GFP-like absorbance, and hydrolysis by means of the DsRed pathway would further lead to a spectrally distinct form corresponding to a 2-keto derivative of imidazolidinone (Fig. 2B, III). To check the last assumption, DsRed and gtCP were boiled in 0.1 m HCl, containing 6 m guanidine HCl, and the absorption spectra of both samples were measured. At acidic conditions, hydrolyzed DsRed displayed an absorption maximum at 380 nm and a shoulder at 425 nm. When adjusted to pH 9.0, the protein showed maxima at 458 nm, 377 nm, and a shoulder at 516 nm (not shown). We interpret these data as a superposition of spectra of nonhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed forms, because DsRed contains both red and green species (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The situation was much clearer with gtCP, because this protein apparently includes a chromophore in a predominantly red form. At pH 1.8, hydrolyzed gtCP showed a single peak at 425 nm, which became double with maxima at 516 and 377 nm when pH was adjusted to 9.0 (Fig. 2C). Comparative analysis of the above data implies that an absorption maximum at 425 nm (pH 1.8) and peaks at 377 and 516 nm (pH 9.0) correspond to the structure III (Fig. 2B) of both fragmented proteins. Mass-spectral Analysis of gtCP Chromopeptide—Denatured gtCP was digested extensively by chymotrypsin, and a chromophore-bearing peptide was isolated by HPLC. Sequence analysis revealed that Ser-Pro-Gln-Ser are the N-terminal amino acids of the gtCP chromopeptide, indicating that chymotrypsin cleaves the peptide bond between Leu-60 and Ser-61 (3Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Martynov V.I. Yanushevich Y.G. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The mass spectrum of the chromopeptide showed the monoisotopic mass of 1187.4 Da (Fig. 3A). These results suggested that chymotrypsin additionally cleaves the peptide bond between Phe-71 and Thr-72, yielding the fragment Ser-Pro-Gln-Ser-Gln-Tyr-Gly-Ser-Ile-Pro-Phe. The observed mass of 1187.4 Da (calculated mass = 1187.5 Da) also suggested that the gtCP chromophore derives from cyclization reaction (loss of H2O) and two sites of dehydrogenation (loss of 2H2). If one presumed the mature gtCP would contain a portion of molecules with a GFP-like chromophore (one dehydrogenation site), then one would expect to see a noticeable increase in the 1189-Da peak amplitude, just as it was seen in the DsRed chromopeptide mass spectra (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The simulation mass profile of the gtCP chromopeptide (not shown), which accounts for the natural isotopic distribution, showed exactly the same relative abundance of the 1189-Da peak (24.14%) observed in mass spectra. Thus, the above results are consistent with the existence of the gtCP chromophore, preferably in the red state with two sites of dehydrogenation. Further MS/MS fragmentation of the gtCP chromopeptide ion (parent mass = 1187.4 Da) allowed positioning of this additional dehydrogenation site between α-nitrogen and α-carbon of Gln-65 (Fig. 3B). The most prominent peaks in the secondary MS resulted from the intramolecular cyclization reaction between α-carbon and δ-nitrogen of Gln-65, followed by splitting of the C=N bond (Table I, II and complement fragment I) (Fig. 3B). Similar fragmentation species were detected in MS/MS spectra of the DsRed chromopeptide (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Many other daughter ions of the gtCP chromopeptide were observed in the secondary mass spectrum, the most distinctive originating from fragmentation in the vicinity of the acylimine C=N bond (Table I, V, III, and IV) (Fig. 3B).Table IDistinctive peaks in MS/MS spectrum of the gtCP chromopeptide ionm/z (observed)m/z (calculated)AssignmentRelative amplitude263.1263.1y222313.1313.15b35400.2400.2b4 (V)3417.2417.2c4 (I)13463.1463.2y42498.2498.2a5 (III)4512.2512.2(b10)2+8527.0527.1y7b91691.2691.3x6 (IV)5726.2726.3b71772.2772.3z7-H (II)30813.3813.3b81.5926.3926.4b91001004.41004.4y9131171.41171.5z1131 Open table in a new tab Despite the recent shift in emphasis to the biotechnological utilization of GFP-like proteins, it seems that many fundamental questions should be solved as far as the chemistry of these proteins is concerned. Among these are the mechanisms of self-assembly of the chromophore moiety and the relationships between a chromophore chemical structure and emission maximum of FPs or color of CPs. After a DsRed chromophore was discovered to be an extended π-electron variant of GFP imidazolidinone structure (12Wall M.A. Socolich M. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 13Yarbrough D. Wachter R.M. Kallio K. Matz M.V. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), it seemed very likely that a further red shift of coral proteins would also inevitably accompany the chromophore structure changes. Because gtCP readily lost a red-shifting modification upon denaturation, our strategy in the chromophore structure reconstruction initially was to monitor the pathway of the red-to-green conversion and to identify intermediate products that might have been related to the chromophore in its native state. This approach was facilitated by the fact that relevant data were obtained previously for two other GFP-like proteins with known chromophore structures (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 18Cody C.W. Prasher D.C. Westler W.M. Prendergast F.G. Ward W.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Upon different denaturing conditions, gtCP eventually showed absorption maxima at 384 nm (pH 3.0) and 450 nm (pH 14.0). Because these two forms proved to be interconvertible with pKa = 7.9, these results suggested that the gtCP chromophore includes a GFP-like imidazolidinone core structure. The next set of experiments indicated that imidazolidinone structure of the gtCP chromophore is extended by a red-shifting modification. Upon denaturation at acidic conditions, the gtCP chromophore initially exists as a 436-nm red form, which further converts to the green GFP-like form (λmax = 384 nm). Remarkably, both gtCP and DsRed exhibited the same absorption maxima of the chromophore red forms and the same positions of the isosbestic point of the red-to-green conversion. The red form of denatured gtCP readily restored its native absorption spectra after adjusting pH to 4.0; the green form did not. Therefore, we interpret this phenomenon as the irreversible loss of a red-shifting modification by the gtCP chromophore in the course of transition. Two additional points should be noted. First, gtCP naturally includes the same chromophore chemical structure as a red form of the denatured protein, as judged by instant renaturation of this form. Second, a red-to-green conversion of the gtCP chromophore is described by the single isosbestic point, suggesting that there are only two species participating in this reaction, and one converts into another directly by a one-stage reaction. Consequently, these results allowed rejecting any suspected intermediate products that might have been related to the chromophore structure in its native state. Originally, gtCP represented a single polypeptide chain protein, as judged by a major band of Mr = 28 kDa in SDS/PAGE. Nevertheless, at harsher denaturing conditions, especially after boiling in 0.1 m HCl, the majority of protein molecules undergo fragmentation. This situation resembled fragmentation of DsRed, except for the extent of the gtCP fragmentation, which exceeded 80% of total protein. Assuming a red-shifting modification of the gtCP chromophore to represent an acylimine group, one would expect generation of two products upon harsh denaturing conditions. The primary one is a 2-carbinol-amide derivative of imidazolidinone (Fig. 2B, II) (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), the conjugated system of which is equivalent to the GFP chromophore. This product apparently corresponds to the green form of the chromophore in our experiments. The terminal one is the result of complete hydrolysis of acylimine and the consequent fragmentation of the protein. This compound contains an additional C=O electron-withdrawing substituent (Fig. 2B, III), and, therefore, a pronounced difference in absorption spectra of II and III should have been expected. Comparative analysis of absorption spectra of fragmented DsRed and gtCP indeed revealed the generation of a new pH-dependent form with the same maxima for both proteins (Fig. 2C). Therefore, our interpretation of these results is that fragmentation of gtCP occurs by the same pathway as DsRed; i.e. it is a hydrolysis of acylimine that splits both proteins into fragments. It is noteworthy that, unlike DsRed, absorption spectra of completely hydrolyzed gtCP lacked absorption bands characteristic for a green GFP-like form of the chromophore. Along with SDS/PAGE data, these results indicate that gtCP exists predominantly in the red form, and maturation of this protein progresses far beyond the 50% found for DsRed (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The results of mass spectra of the gtCP chromopeptide were the most conclusive. The mass of the peptide corresponded to the mass of the GFP-like chromophore that had lost an additional 2 Da. Because we used the peptide-containing chromophore in a green state in our mass spectral measurements (Fig. 2B, II), this situation resembled dehydration of the DsRed chromopeptide upon entry into the electrospray mass spectrometer (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, unlike the DsRed chromopeptide, which showed a mixture of masses of two species (with and without additional dehydrogenation) with approximately equal amplitudes (14Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), an expected form of the gtCP chromopeptide without additional dehydrogenation did not contribute appreciably in mass spectra, suggesting that a red form of the chromophore with additional dehydrogenation site is a predominant one in this case. Tandem mass spectrometry allowed localization of this additional dehydrogenation site in gtCP between α-C and α-N of Gln-65, similar to the acylimine C=N bond in the DsRed chromophore. The recently published crystallographic structures of a blue CP pocilloporin and a far-red FP from the sea anemone Entacmaea quadricolor revealed that these GFP-homologous pigments include a conformational analogue of the DsRed chromophore (19Prescott M.

Although we were unable to gain information relevant to the gtCP chromophore conformation by the methods we used in this study, both published data and our results suggest that a drastic chromophore structural reconstruction is not a prerequisite to the shift of spectra of GFP-like proteins to the far-red region. Thus, isomerization of the chromophore moiety and/or rearrangements in its interactions with surrounding amino acid side chains seems to be sufficient in some cases for the color manifold of the GFP-family proteins.

GTA and GTB utilize a common acceptor, the H antigen disaccharide α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-OR, but different donors, where GTA transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc and GTB transfers Gal from UDP-Gal. GTA and GTB are two of the most homologous enzymes known to transfer different donors and differ in only 4 amino acid residues, but one in particular (Leu/Met-266) has been shown to dominate the selection between donor sugars.

Remarkably, although the 3-deoxy inhibitor occupies the same conformation and position observed for the native H antigen in GTA and GTB, the 3-amino analog is recognized differently by the two enzymes. The 3-amino substitution introduces a novel intramolecular hydrogen bond between O2′ on Fuc and N3′ on Gal, which alters the minimum-energy conformation of the inhibitor. In the absence of UDP, the 3-amino analog can be accommodated by either GTA or GTB with the l-Fuc residue partially occupying the vacant UDP binding site. However, in the presence of UDP, the analog is forced to abandon the intramolecular hydrogen bond, and the l-Fuc residue is shifted to a less ordered conformation.

When the primary structures of GTA and GTB were determined, it was found that they differ in only four amino acid residues which, given that they share a common acceptor, were assumed to confer their ability to distinguish between the donor substrate molecules (3.Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of the catalytic domains of the two enzymes revealed that their structures are almost identical outside of these four residues, that only two of these four residues served to distinguish between donor substrates, and that the acceptor substrate binding sites were nearly superimposable (4.Patenaude S.I.

To assist in further elucidating the mechanisms of these glycosyltransferases, specific analogs of the acceptor molecules were made and characterized kinetically by their ability to inhibit the enzyme reaction. The targeting of the acceptor moiety at the 3-OH linkage site (the point at which the monosaccharide is transferred to the acceptor) of the Gal ring via modification to 3-deoxy and 3-amino analogs (5.Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6.Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 251: 33-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) produced potent inhibitors of glycosyltransferase activity (Fig. 1). The 3-deoxy analog was found to be a competitive inhibitor of both GTA and GTB, with Ki ranging from 14 to 68 μm, and was shown to inhibit GTA in cell culture such that the expression of surface A antigen was significantly reduced (7.Laferte S. Chan N.W. Sujino K. Lowary T.L. Palcic M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4840-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Ki of the 3-amino analog could not be determined, as the mode of inhibition for both GTA and GTB was observed not to fit standard models of inhibition. However, it was estimated that Ki for the 3-amino analog is in the 200-nm range for GTA (5.Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6.Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 251: 33-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To understand the different behaviors of the two inhibitors and, specifically, the mode of binding of the 3-amino analog, we determined structures of both GTA and GTB in complex with the 3-deoxy and 3-amino analogs both in the absence and presence of UDP.

For this step, octyl 4,6-O-benzylidene-3-deoxy-β-d-xylo-hexopyranoside (61 mg, 16.7 mmol) and phenyl-2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-1-thio-β-l-fucopyranoside (105 mg, 20 mmol) were dissolved in dry CH2Cl2/ether (6 ml, ratio of 1/5, v/v) at room temperature and cooled to 0 °C. Then N-iodosuccinimide (45 mg, 20 mmol) and a catalytic amount of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid were added, and the mixture was stirred for 3 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of Et3N. The mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (20 ml) and washed with saturated Na2SO3 (2 × 10 ml), water, and brine. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Removal of the solvent followed by chromatography on silica gel (6:1, hexane:ethyl acetate) gave the desired 3-deoxydisaccharide as a white solid (96 mg, 74%), which was hydrogenated as originally described. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of native GTA and GTB were grown as reported previously (4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Crystals were soaked with various combinations of UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Gal, UDP, and acceptor analogs. Soaking solution contained 7.5% polyethylene glycol 4000 (Sigma), 15% glycerol (BDH), 75 mm ADA buffer (Sigma), pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2 (Fisher), and 10 mm acceptor for 3–4 days. UDP, UDP-GalNAc, or UDP-Gal (Sigma) was added to the soaking solution at a concentration of 10–15 mm for 20–25 h. At the end of the soaking period, crystals were frozen in liquid propane using magnetic crystal caps (Hampton Research), and the caps were stored in liquid nitrogen for transport to the beamline. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Data was collected at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratories at a wavelength of 1.15 Å. Two data sets (GTA+DI and GTA+AI) were collected on a MAR 300 mounted on a Rigaku RU300 generator at Queen's University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada). All data were collected at low temperature using a Cryostream 600 cooler. Data was reduced and scaled with HKL2000 software (9.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Initial rigid body refinement in CNS (10.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54 (Pt. 5): 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) was carried out by using the native GTA and GTB structures with and without H-antigen and UDP bound (PDB codes 1LZ0, 1LZ7, 1LZI, and 1LZJ). This procedure was followed by overall structural refinement using CNS. Leastsquared overlaps of structures were calculated by using LSQKAB within the CCP4 program suite (11.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). All overlaps shown are based on protein-protein overlaps to the GTB structure (PDB code 1LZJ). Diagrams were made using ChemSketch and SETOR (12.Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 127-138Crossref Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Data Collection and Structure Refinement—Details of the data collection and structure refinement are shown in Tables I and II. Data were collected to a maximum of 2.09–1.55 Å resolution, with R and Rfree for the final models from ∼0.188–0.208 and from 0.209–0.227, respectively. All structures show excellent electron density over the course of the polypeptide chain, with the exception of the disordered loop between residues 177–195 and the final 10 residues of the C terminus, which were also absent in the native structures (4.Patenaude S.I.

These data sets (see Table I) are GTA + 3-deoxy inhibitor (GTA+DI), GTB + 3-deoxy inhibitor (GTB+DI), GTA + 3-amino inhibitor (GTA+AI), and GTB + 3-amino inhibitor (GTB+AI). UDP was present in the soaking solution of four crystals, and UDP appears clearly in the corresponding electron density maps.

Open table in a new tab Structural Analysis of 3-Deoxy Acceptor Analog—The 3-deoxy acceptor analog of the H-disaccharide bound to both GTA and GTB in the absence of UDP (Fig. 2, a and b), which was surprising given that UDP is known to form an integral part of the acceptor-binding site (4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This 3-deoxy inhibitor has the same overall conformation and binding interactions observed for the GTA and GTB structures containing H-antigen and UDP (Fig. 3a; Ref. 4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). No significant changes in polypeptide structures were observed. The acceptor analog displayed the same position and orientation in the binding site as the native acceptor (Fig. 4a; Ref. 4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As in the structures of the native enzymes, the aliphatic tail of the acceptor analog occupies a different specific location in GTA and GTB due to the presence of Ser-235 in GTB compared with the Gly-235 in GTA (Fig. 2, a and b; Ref. 4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The conformation and orientation of the deoxy analog did not change with the presence of UDP (structures not shown). These observations are consistent with the kinetic results reported for the 3-deoxy analog that characterize it as a competitive inhibitor of the H-antigen with well defined behavior (5.Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Significant contacts observed between GTB and 3-deoxy inhibitor (a) and 3-amino inhibitor (b), both in the absence of UDP.

However, experiments to co-crystallize UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Gal with GTA and GTB, respectively, did not yield any electron density corresponding to the donor sugar. (Electron density consistent with partial occupancy by UDP was observed similar to that described for the 3-amino inhibitor, below.) Structures of 3-Amino Acceptor Analog—Unlike the 3-deoxy inhibitor, the kinetic data regarding the 3-amino analog indicated that there was a complex mode of binding involved in its inhibition of both GTA and GTB (6.Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 251: 33-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the electron density surrounding the acceptor analogs in GTA and GTB complexed to the 3-amino analog crystallized in the absence (Fig. 2, c and d) and presence (Fig. 2, e and f) of UDP. In the absence of UDP, the analog is seen to adopt a conformation that is significantly different from that observed for either the native acceptor or 3-deoxy analog, which is induced by the presence of the amino group. This group would be protonated at physiological pH and is observed in the crystal structures of the complexes to form a hydrogen bond with hydroxyl on O-2′ of the fucose residue. This new conformation has the Gal residue in approximately the same location as the native acceptor, with the maintenance of the O-4′ and O-6′ hydrogen bonds observed in other structures (Fig. 3b), with the result that the l-Fuc residue moves sharply toward the surface of the protein pocket and into the space normally occupied by UDP. This new position is further stabilized by the formation of a new hydrogen bond from Fuc O-2′ through a bridging water molecule to potential nucleophilic residue Glu-303 in both GTA and GTB (Figs. 3b and 4b). In the presence of UDP, the Gal moiety of the 3-amino analog remains in approximately the same position observed for the native acceptor and deoxy analog. The fucose residue is thus displaced, causing the 3-amino analog to abandon the intramolecular hydrogen bond and the hydrogen bond to the bridging water molecule. The fucose ring takes up a less ordered position, with no apparent contact with any part of the enzyme (Fig. 4c), and displays significantly higher temperature factors than the Gal residue. As with the 3-deoxy analog, attempts made to co-crystallize the 3-amino analog with GTA and GTB in the presence of UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Gal did not reveal a density corresponding to either donor; however, as was found for the deoxy analog, the enzyme was able to hydrolyze significant amounts of donor over the crystallization experiments such that partial occupancy for UDP was observed. In these crystal structures (GTA+AI+UDP-GalNAc and GTB+AI+UDP-Gal), excellent density was observed for the Gal residue, but the l-Fuc residue was disordered, especially in GTA (possibly over the two basic conformations observed), to the extent that the electron density corresponding to this residue was poorly defined (Fig. 5, a and b). The repositioning of the 3-amino acceptor analog is not restricted to the influence of UDP alone, and Fig. 4b shows that, in the absence of UDP, the analog occupies distinctly different positions in GTA and GTB, which correspond to changes in the identity of amino acid residue 266. Of the four amino acid differences between GTA and GTB, residue 266 has been shown to dominate the selection between UDP sugar donors (4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), with GTA having Leu and GTB having Met. Small differences between the binding of H-disaccharide acceptor to GTA and GTB have been noted in the past (8.Marcus S.L. Polakowski R. Seto N.O. Leinala E. Borisova S. Blancher A. Roubinet F. Evans S.V. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12403-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and attributed to Leu/Met-266; however, the positions of both the native (4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and now the 3-deoxy acceptor analogs in GTA and GTB are nearly superimposable. The large difference in position observed for the 3-amino analog emphasizes the influence that Leu/Met-266 can have on acceptor binding. Finally, although the aliphatic aglycones are placed to aid in the purification of the acceptor analogs, they are attached at the same position as the natural glycoprotein or glycolipid substrate of the A and B antigens, and their conformations give some insight into the differential recognition of these substrates by GTA and GTB (4.Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Fig. 4a shows the positions of the aliphatic groups observed for the deoxy acceptors, where the difference in conformation is similar to that observed in the native acceptors and can be attributed to one of the four critical residue differences between GTA and GTB (Gly/Ser-235). The observed movement of the Fuc residue to form a hydrogen bond with the 3-amino Gal in the absence of UDP opens a pocket in the binding site into which the aliphatic tail moves (Fig. 4b). The presence of UDP in the binding site causes the Fuc ring on the inhibitor to become disordered but still permits the aliphatic aglycone to assume the same general conformation. The x-ray crystal structures of the 3-deoxy and 3-amino analogs in complex with GTA and GTB show that the binding of these modified H-antigen acceptor analogs are consistent with their observed activity as inhibitors of acceptor binding in GTA and GTB. The binding of the 3-amino analog takes a marked departure from that displayed by the H-disaccharide acceptor and 3-deoxy analog, where this binding changes in the presence or absence of UDP. Remarkably given that GTA and GTB share a common acceptor, the binding of acceptor analog is significantly affected by whether the enzyme is GTA or GTB. The competition of the 3-amino acceptor with UDP for the same binding site in the protein is consistent with the observed complex mode of inhibition."

The 13,650-bp ribonucleotide reductase gene is divided into eight extein- or exon-coding sequences that together encode a 768-amino acid mature ribonucleotide reductase protein, with 83% of the gene sequence encoding introns and inteins. The four inteins are encoded on the second half of the gene, and each has conserved sequence motifs for a protein-splicing domain and an endonuclease domain. These four inteins, together with known inteins, define five intein insertion sites in ribonucleotide reductase homologues. Two of the insertion sites are 10 amino acids apart and next to key catalytic residues of the enzyme. Protein-splicing activities of all four inteins were demonstrated in Escherichia coli. The four inteins coexist with three group II introns encoded on the first half of the same gene, which suggests a breakdown of the presumed barrier against intron insertion in this bacterial conserved protein-coding gene.

Inteins are intervening protein sequences embedded in precursor proteins and catalyze a protein-splicing reaction that excises the intein and joins the flanking sequences (N- and C-exteins) with a peptide bond (1Perler F.B.

A typical intein is ∼400 amino acid long and has two structural domains, with its N- and C-terminal parts forming the protein-splicing domain and its middle part forming the endonuclease domain (7Duan X.

Biol. 2000; 300: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The protein-splicing function ensures self-removal of intein from the host protein, and the endonuclease function initiates an intein homing (gene conversion) process and promotes maintenance and spread of the intein coding sequence (9Cooper A.A.

Group II introns have properties of both catalytic RNAs and retroelements and are the presumed progenitors of eukaryotic nuclear spliceosomal introns (15Lambowitz A.M. Belfort M. Annu. Rev.

But unlike spliceosomal introns that are abundant in protein-coding genes, bacterial group II introns are strongly excluded from protein-coding genes outside mobile DNA (20Edgell D.R. Belfort M.

Group II introns are rare in bacterial (and archaeal) protein genes and were found mostly in mobile DNAs such as transposon-like insertion sequence elements (21Dai L. Zimmerly S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Nearly half of bacterial group II introns are outside of any gene (27Dai L. Toor N. Olson R. Keeping A. Zimmerly S.

Among bacterial group II introns inside genes, few are inside conserved protein-coding genes, indicating extremely strong selection against insertion into “housekeeping” protein genes (20Edgell D.R.

Only a few completely sequenced bacterial genomes encode both intein and intron. The only known example of coexistence of an intein and a group I intron in the same gene, a bacteriophage ribonucleotide reductase gene (28Lazarevic V. Soldo B. Dusterhoft A. Hilbert H. Mauel C. Karamata D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1356-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Coexistence of intein and group II intron in one gene has not been reported before. Here we report the coexistence of four inteins and three group II introns in a bacterial ribonucleotide reductase gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of multiple inteins and multiple introns (any intron) in the same gene, which has interesting implications regarding the evolution and possible function of inteins and introns. Gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis—GenBank searches, sequence alignments, and intron RNA folding were performed using the BLAST search program (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59441) Google Scholar), the ClustalW program (31Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (10157) Google Scholar), respectively. Parts of the ribonucleotide reductase gene were amplified by doing PCR from total genomic DNA of Trichodesmium erythraeum (Ter) strain IMS101, using the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase. DNA fragments were cloned in a pDrive plasmid vector (Qiagen), and DNA sequences were determined through automated DNA sequencing. Protein-splicing Analysis in Escherichia coli Cells—To construct gene expression plasmids, intein coding sequences were inserted in the previously described pMST plasmid (33Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) between XhoI and AgeI sites, replacing the Ssp DnaB intein coding sequence of pMST. Protein production in E. coli cells, gel electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (33Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells containing the expression plasmid were grown in liquid LB medium at 37 °C to late log phase (A600, 0.5). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm to induce production of the recombinant protein, and the induction was continued at 37 °C for 3 h or at 25 °C overnight. Cells were then harvested, and cellular proteins were dissolved in SDS- and dithiothreitol-containing gel loading buffer in a boiling water bath before electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blots were carried out using anti-thioredoxin antibody (Invitrogen) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL). Intensity of protein band was estimated by using a gel documentation system (Gel Doc 1000 coupled with Molecular Analyst software, Bio-Rad). Identification of Ter RIR Gene Encoding Multiple Introns and Inteins—A search for new intein sequences led us to a DNA sequence in the GenBank (accession no. AABK02000003) that had been deposited by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute and was from the genome of the oceanic N2-fixing cyanobacterium T. erythraeum strain IMS101. Our initial analysis indicated that this DNA sequence has a ribonucleotide reductase (RIR) gene containing inteins as well as introns. Subsequent DNA cloning and sequence determination confirmed this analysis and also corrected a small deletion error in the above GenBank sequence. This revealed the complete T. erythraeum RIR gene as illustrated in Fig. 1. The 13,560-bp long Ter RIR gene is divided into eight exon- or extein-coding sequences by the presence of three intron- and four intein-coding sequences. The eight extein/exon-coding sequences are 252, 141, 306, 126, 396, 30, 390, and 663 bp long, respectively, and together they encode a 768-amino acid mature RIR protein that is highly similar to homologous but intein/intron-less RIR of other bacteria (Fig. 2A). Specifically, the mature RIR sequence of T. erythraeum is 69% identical and 80% similar to its homologue in the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain PCC7120 (Nsp), and this level of RIR sequence identity is normal among cyanobacterial species. The Nsp RIR (also known as Asp RNR) has been functionally characterized as a class II B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase (34Gleason F.K. Olszewski N.E. J.

The mature RIR sequence of T. erythraeum is also 24% identical and 40% similar to the RIR sequence of the distantly related bacterium Lactobacillus leichmannii (Lle). The Lle RIR is also a class II (coenzyme B12-dependent) ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase with a known crystal structure (35Sintchak M.D. Arjara G. Kellogg B.A. Stubbe J. Drennan C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 13,560-bp Ter RIR gene is much larger than other bacterial RIR genes because of the presence of intein and intron coding sequences, with just 17% of its coding sequences for exteins and exons and the remaining 83% for inteins and introns.Fig. 2Protein sequence comparisons.A, predicted mature RIR protein sequence of Ter is aligned with RIR sequences of Nostoc sp. strain PCC7120 (Nsp) and Lactobacillus leichmannii (Lle). Only sequences proximal to the insertion sites of the Ter introns and inteins are shown, and amino acid positions in the Ter sequence are numbered. Intron and intein insertion sites (I1 through I7) in the Ter sequence are marked with arrowheads, and the corresponding intron and intein names are shown in parentheses. The Nsp RIR sequence also has an intein at the I1 insertion site. B, four intein sequences predicted from the Ter RIR gene are aligned, and putative intein sequence motifs (blocks A through H) are underlined. Less conserved sequences are omitted, the numbers of omitted residues are shown in parentheses, and the length of each sequence is shown at the end. Symbols represent gaps introduced to optimize the alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification and Sequence Analysis of the Inteins—The four intein-coding sequences are located on the second half of the gene (Fig. 1), are named Ter RIR-1, Ter RIR-2, Ter RIR-3, and Ter RIR-4 intein, according to nomenclature of known inteins, and are 394, 373, 323, and 381 amino acids long, respectively. Insertion positions of the four inteins are before amino acid residues Ser-276, Cys-408, Cys-418, and Thr-548 of the mature RIR protein, respectively. Boundaries of the four inteins were readily identified by comparison of extein sequences with intein-less homologues such as Nsp RIR (Fig. 2A) and by location of conserved intein sequence blocks A and G marking the ends of each intein (Fig. 2B). Each of the four inteins begins with a nucleophilic residue (Cys), ends with Asn, and is followed immediately by another nucleophilic residue (Ser, Cys, or Thr), as expected for the protein-splicing function of the intein (2Xu M.Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Each intein also has sequence motifs for protein-splicing function (sequence blocks A, B, F, and G) as well as putative sequence motifs for intein endonuclease function (sequence blocks C, E, and H) (36Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Ter RIR-1 intein and the Ter RIR-2 intein are also homologous to previously identified Nsp RIR intein and Pfu RIR1–2 intein, respectively, based on significant (>30%) sequence similarities and the same corresponding insertion site (data not shown). Protein-splicing function has been demonstrated for both the Nsp RIR intein (34Gleason F.K. Olszewski N.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6544-6550Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the Pfu RIR1–2 intein (37Komori K. Fujita N. Ichiyanagi K. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The four Ter RIR inteins showed only low levels (less than 15%) of sequence identity among themselves, and their insertion sites have no apparent sequence similarity, indicating that they are not closely related. Insertion sites of Ter RIR-2 and Ter RIR-3 inteins are just 10 amino acids apart and inside the catalytic center of ribonucleotide reductase, according to sequence comparison to the structurally determined Lle ribonucleotide reductase (35Sintchak M.D. Arjara G. Kellogg B.A. Stubbe J. Drennan C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The Ter RIR-2 intein is inserted at Cys-408 that acts with metallocofactor to generate the active-site thiyl radical (S*), whereas the Ter RIR-3 intein is inserted at Cys-418 (Ter numbering) that forms a redox-active disulfide with another Cys residue. The four Ter RIR inteins, together with known RIR inteins in other organisms, define five distinct intein insertion sites in the RIR protein. Protein-splicing Activity of the Inteins—To determine whether the four inteins are functional, we tested their protein-splicing activity in E. coli cells. For each intein, a plasmidborne fusion gene was constructed to produce a fusion protein in which the intein (plus 5 amino acids of its native extein sequence on each side) was fused to an N-terminal maltose binding protein and a C-terminal thioredoxin (Fig. 3). Similar fusion protein constructs had been used in previous studies of other inteins (33Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 38Liu X.Q. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26315-26318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), so that the protein-splicing products can readily be identified using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Precursor protein, spliced protein, and excised intein were identified by their predicted sizes, and the first two were further identified using anti-thioredoxin antibody. To estimate the efficiency of protein splicing, the intensity of individual protein bands on Western blots was measured to estimate the amount of that protein, and protein-splicing efficiency was calculated as the amount of spliced protein divided by the sum of spliced protein and precursor protein. At 37 °C, the Ter RIR-1 intein and the Ter RIR-3 intein showed efficient protein splicing, as indicated by the strong bands corresponding to the spliced protein and the excised intein. In contrast, the Ter RIR-2 intein and Ter RIR-4 intein showed little or no protein splicing at 37 °C. At 25 °C, which is closer to the natural growth condition of T. erythraeum, all four inteins showed efficient protein splicing. The protein-splicing efficiency was estimated to be 100%, 76%, 100%, and 95% for Ter RIR-1, -2, -3, and -4 intein, respectively. Identification and Analysis of the Introns—The three introns are located in the first half of the gene and are named T.er.I2, T.er.I3, and T.er.I4 intron, according to nomenclature of known introns; they are 2,524, 1,757, and 2,554 nucleotides long, respectively (Fig. 1). Boundaries of these introns were defined by comparison of exon sequences with intron-less homologues such as Nsp RIR and by sequence comparison to known introns. Each intron can be folded into a typical secondary structure of group II introns, which includes the six helical domains and the exon-binding sequences. Predicted secondary structure of the T.er.I2 intron is shown in Fig. 4A. The T.er.I3 and T.er.I4 introns are very similar to the previously identified T.er.I1 intron both in sequence (Fig. 4B) and in predicted secondary structure (not shown). The T.er.I1 intron is listed as T.sp.I1 intron in the database for mobile group II introns and located in an intergenic sequence of this organism. These three introns are over 80% identical to each other in the ∼680-nucleotide folded RNA sequence and over 70% identical in overall sequence, although the T.er.I3 intron lacks a 754-nucleotide sequence present in the other two introns. These three introns are ∼50% identical to the T.er.I2 intron. The T.er.I2 intron, T.er.I4 intron, and the intergenic T.er.I1 intron each encode an RTL protein in domain IV, and their RTL protein sequences are over 60% similar to each other (data not shown). But the T.er.I2 RTL lacks a domain Zn, and the T.er.I1 RTL coding sequence has at least two single-base deletions causing frameshifts and is likely not functional. The T. erythraeum RIR gene was found to encode four inteins and three group II introns, which predicts three RNA splicing events followed by four protein-splicing events in producing the mature ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 1). The Ter RIR gene is believed to be functional in vivo despite its seven intervening sequences, based on the following considerations. The Ter RIR gene, after excluding its intein and intron coding sequences, predicts a complete and normal looking class II ribonucleotide reductase. The non-intron parts of the Ter RIR gene, totaling 6,717 bp, are maintained as open reading frames, whereas its non-coding frames have numerous termination codons, which would be extremely unlikely if the Ter RIR gene were not functional. All of the four inteins are functional in protein splicing when tested in E. coli and are predicted to be functional in vivo. The group II introns are also predicted to be functional in vivo, based on their normal looking structure and high levels of sequence identity to known group II introns. Ribonucleotide reductase is an essential housekeeping enzyme in all organisms, and there are at least three known classes of ribonucleotide reductase with very different amino acid sequences for different classes. We can not exclude the possible existence of an additional copy or class of RIR gene in T. erythraeum, although no other class II RIR gene was found through a Blast search of the nearly complete genome sequence of this organism. Four inteins in the Ter RIR protein represent the largest number of inteins found so far in one host protein, and their coexistence with three group II introns in the same gene adds to the novelty. A gene encoding a single intein and a single intron has been reported before (28Lazarevic V. Soldo B. Dusterhoft A. Hilbert H. Mauel C. Karamata D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but that gene is a bacteriophage ribonucleotide reductase gene not similar to the Ter RIR gene, and that single intron is a group I intron frequently found in bacteriophage genes (20Edgell D.R. Belfort M. Shub D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 39Edgell D.R. Fast N.M. Doolittle W.F. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Ter RIR gene is apparently a chromosomal gene, not a phage or plasmid gene, because it was found on a large sequence contig (∼225 kb) of the incomplete Ter genome sequence that encodes numerous other known chromosomal genes. It is interesting to see the high levels of sequence identity among the T.er.I3, T.er.I4, and the intergenic T.er.I1 introns. If these introns are related through relatively recent retrotranspositions, the T.er.I4 intron may be the closest to the presumed progenitor, because it alone encodes an intact RTL protein for retrotransposition. It may also be possible for RTL protein of T.er.I4 intron to act on the other introns in RNA splicing and in retrotransposition. Furthermore, T.er.I3 and T.er.I4 introns in the same gene may possibly cause exon skipping during splicing, as was found with certain bacterial phage group I introns (40Landthaler M. Shub D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is novel to see three group II introns in one bacterial gene, especially in a chromosomal conserved housekeeping proteincoding gene, although multiple group I introns in one gene have been reported previously for bacterial phage and prophage protein-coding genes (40Landthaler M. Shub D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Lazarevic V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3212-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Bacterial and archaeal group II introns are strongly excluded from conserved protein-coding genes, even in organisms with relatively large numbers of introns. For example, among the 28 group II introns in the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus (42Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Sato S. Ikeuchi M. Katoh H. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Iriguchi M. Kawashima K. Kimura T. Kishida Y. Kiyokawa C. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Sugimoto M. Takeuchi C. Yamada M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2002; 9: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), 26 are outside of gene or inside mobile elements (insertion sequence, other group II introns), and 1 is inside a tRNA gene. The remaining intron is inside a hypothetical protein gene but in reverse orientation to transcription and therefore not functional. Preliminary searches in the nearly complete genome sequence of T. erythraeum did not reveal exceptional abundance of intron or intron in protein genes. Therefore, the presence of three group II introns in the ribonucleotide reductase gene represents a striking departure from known patterns of bacterial intron distribution. It is extremely unlikely that by pure chance the four inteins and three group II introns inserted in the T. erythraeum ribonucleotide reductase gene, considering the rarity of intein and intron. Ribonucleotide reductase and other DNA metabolism proteins are more likely than other proteins to have intein and phage group I intron, which has generated many discussions regarding possible reasons (12Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Gogarten J.P. Senejani A.G. Zhaxybayeva O. Olendzenski L. Hilario E. Annu. Rev.

In these highly conserved genes, an intein or group I intron may spread more easily in a population, because the recognition sequences of the intein-contained or group I intron-encoded homing endonucleases would be better preserved. It may also be more difficult for these genes to lose an intein or intron, because any imprecise deletion of the intein or intron will likely inactivate the essential gene. Consistent with this argument, the four Ter RIR inteins are inserted in the more conserved parts of the RIR protein, and two of them (Ter RIR-2 and Ter RIR-3) are next to critical catalytic residues of the enzyme. It is more difficult to explain the existence of three group II introns in the Ter RIR gene, considering the apparently strong selection against intron insertions in bacterial conserved protein genes (20Edgell D.R. Belfort M. Shub D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Dai L. Zimmerly S.

A. 1998; 95: 1356-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In bacteria, protein translation starts before completion of transcription and may, therefore, interfere with RNA splicing (20Edgell D.R. Belfort M. Shub D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 44Ohman-Heden M. Ahgren-Stalhandske A. Hahne S. Sjoberg B.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and it remains to be determined whether or how the Ter RIR gene avoided this problem. Interestingly, there is a translation termination codon just 3, 15, and 18 nt after the beginning of the T.er.I2, T.er.I3, and T.er.I4 introns, respectively, which may help to pause translation before RNA splicing is complete, as has been suggested for some group I introns (20Edgell D.R. Belfort M. Shub D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 44Ohman-Heden M. Ahgren-Stalhandske A. Hahne S. Sjoberg B.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For whatever reason, barriers against intron insertion were broken in the Ter RIR gene, and multiple insertions through retrotransposition could have happened within a relatively short period of time. This may be reminiscent of what happened in the proliferation of introns in eukaryotes (45Cho G. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 46Stoltzfus A. Logsdon Jr., J.M. Palmer J.D. Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 14244-14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Another interesting possibility is that the multiple inteins and introns may help to regulate the production of ribonucleotide reductase in T. erythraeum. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, and its production is intricately regulated in other organisms in response to DNA synthesis, cell cycle, and DNA damages (48Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A regulatory role of the inteins and introns would confer selective advantage on the host organism and explain the existence of the inteins and introns against all odds. We thank Dr. J. B. Waterbury for the gift of T. erythraeum cells used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2023279588,"The characteristics of tryptophan phosphorescence from the NAD(H)-binding component (dI) component of Rhodospirillum rubrum transhydrogenase are described. This enzyme couples hydride transfer between NAD(H) and NADP(H) to proton translocation across a membrane and is only active as a dimer. Tryptophan phosphorescence spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for the detection of protein conformational changes and was used here to characterize dI under mechanistically relevant conditions. Our results indicate that the single tryptophan in dI, Trp-72, is embedded in a rigid, compact, and homogeneous protein matrix that efficiently suppresses collisional quenching processes and results in the longest triplet lifetime for Trp ever reported in a protein at ambient temperature (2.9 s). The protein matrix surrounding Trp-72 is extraordinarily rigid up to 50 °C. In all previous studies on Trp-containing proteins, changes in structure were reflected in a different triplet lifetime. In dI, the lifetime of Trp-72 phosphorescence was barely affected by protein dimerization, cofactor binding, complexation with the NADP(H)-binding component (dIII), or by the introduction of two amino acid substitutions at the hydride-transfer site. It is suggested that the rigidity and structural invariance of the protein domain (dI.1) housing this Trp residue are important to the mechanism of transhydrogenase: movement of dI.1 affects the width of a cleft which, in turn, regulates the positioning of bound nucleotides ready for hydride transfer.

Transhydrogenase couples hydride transfer between NAD(H) and NADP(H) to proton translocation across a biological membrane according to Equation 1.NADH+NADP++nHout+↔NAD++NADPH+nHin+(Eq. 1) The enzyme is found in the inner membrane of higher animal mitochondria and in the cytoplasmic membrane of many bacteria (1Jackson J.B. White S.A. Quirk P.G. Venning J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4173-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, it is thought to utilize the proton electrochemical gradient to generate NADPH. Transhydrogenase comprises three components: dI 1The abbreviations used are: dINAD(H)-binding component of transhydrogenasedI.1 and dI.2domains 1 and 2 of dIdIIthe membrane-spanning component of transhydrogenasedIIIthe NADP(H)-binding component of transhydrogenaseBWbandwidth in nm of the 0,0 vibronic band at 1/2 peak heightλ0,0peak wavelength of the 0,0 vibrational band in nmτphosphorescence lifetimekqbimolecular quenching constant. (∼380 residues), which binds NAD+/NADH; dII (∼400 residues), the membrane-embedded component harboring the proton translocation channel; and dIII (∼200 residues), which binds NADP+/NADPH (Fig. 1). Transhydrogenase is a “dimer” of two dI-dII-dIII “monomers”, though the polypeptide composition varies in different species. One of the best characterized transhydrogenases is that from Rhodospirillum rubrum. Recombinant dI and dIII from this organism are stable proteins that bind their cognate nucleotides. Upon mixing, they readily form a dI2·dIII1 complex (Kd ≈ 25 nm), which catalyzes rapid hydride transfer between bound nucleotides. Crystal structures are available for isolated dI (2Buckley P.A.

In transhydrogenase, proton translocation is linked to the redox reaction by way of inter-domain conformational changes. Our current working model is that proton translocation through dII drives transhydrogenase between an “open” state, in which the nucleotide products are replaced with fresh substrates from the solvent, and an “occluded” state, in which the hydride transfer reaction takes place. The nature of the coupling reactions that link events during proton translocation with those at the hydride transfer site is not understood. Asymmetries in the dI2·dIII1 complex and half-site reactivity in the intact enzyme suggest that the conformations of the two monomeric units might alternate during turnover (1Jackson J.B. White S.A. Quirk P.G. Venning J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4173-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Phelps D.C. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4475-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Experiments to investigate the conformation of dI and dIII under mechanistically relevant conditions should provide information on the coupling between the two components and between monomers within the dimer. In this report, we describe observations on the phosphorescence emission of a unique Trp residue at position 72 in R. rubrum dI. At micromolar concentrations, isolated dI from R. rubrum is a dimer: the Kd is unknown, but experiments suggest that the protein retains its dimeric character even at nanomolar concentrations (8Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P. Jackson B.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dI protein comprises two domains, designated dI.1 and dI.2, which are separated by a deep cleft (Fig. 1). The x-ray structures reveal extensive contact areas between the dI.2 domains of the dimer polypeptides. Trp-72 is located on strand βd close to the center of domain dI.1. Its side chain is shielded from the solvent by amino acid residues on helices α1, α11, and loop βa-α1 (Fig. 2). Trp fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of dimeric dI with substrates (9Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There was no evidence for co-operative binding of NADH. The phosphorescence emission of Trp in proteins has recently emerged as a complementary monitor of local protein structure, standing out for its remarkable sensitivity to the nature, dynamic make-up, and conformational uniformity of the protein environment. The sharp vibrational structure of the phosphorescence spectrum gives detailed information on the polarity and conformational homogeneity of the Trp environment (10Galley W.C. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence: Concepts. Dekker, New York1976: 409-439Google Scholar, 11Hershberger M.V. Maki A.H. Galley W.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the absence of internal quenching by proximal cysteine, cystine, tyrosine, or histidine residues, the phosphorescence lifetime of proteins in fluid solutions provides a direct probe of the local flexibility of the protein matrix. The lifetime ranges from sub-milliseconds, when the Trp side chain is in unstructured fluid regions of the polypeptide, to seconds for completely buried and immobilized sites (12Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7646-7651Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Gonnelli M. Strambini G.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13847-13857Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additional information on structural flexibility can be derived from the accessibility of small solutes, such as oxygen and acrylamide, that migrate to the protein interior and quench the phosphorescence of deeply buried chromophores (14Cioni P.

In this paper, the phosphorescence properties of wild-type dI and two mutants, dI.Q132N and dI.R127M, are presented. It emerges that Trp-72 has an exceptionally well resolved phosphorescence spectrum and a slow phosphorescence decay in fluid solution, indicating that its local environment in dI.1 is conformationally homogeneous and unusually rigid. It is suggested that this feature is significant for the mechanism of action of transhydrogenase. Domain dI.1 is thought to close against dI.2 to control the relative movement of the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH and the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ prior to hydride transfer. All chemicals were of the highest purity grade available from commercial sources. Glycerol for fluorescence microscopy was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). NADH, NAD+, NADPH, and NADP+ were obtained from Sigma. Acrylamide (>99.9% electrophoretic purity) was obtained from Bio-Rad. For phosphorescence measurements, water, doubly distilled over quartz, was purified by the Milli-Q Plus system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). All glassware used for sample preparation was conditioned in advance by standing for 24 h in 10% HCl Suprapur (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Recombinant dI and dIII from R. rubrum transhydrogenase were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by column chromatography as described (8Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P. Jackson B.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The dI protein was purified in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) and Butyl Toyopearl (Tosoh) columns, and the dIII component in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 4 μm NADP+ on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), Q-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Biosciences), and Butyl Toyopearl (Tosoh) columns. The dI mutant protein, dI.Q132N, was isolated as in Ref. 23van Boxel G.I. Quirk P.G. Cotton N.P. White S.A. Jackson J.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, and dI.R127M was isolated by similar procedures (G. I. van Boxel and J. B. Jackson, unpublished data). Ammonium sulfate-precipitated dI was extensively dialyzed against sodium phosphate (20 mm, pH 7.5) or HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.3) before use in phosphorescence experiments. For phosphorescence measurements in fluid solutions, it is paramount to rid the samples of all O2 traces. The samples were placed in 5 × 5 mm-square quartz cuvettes especially designed to allow thorough removal of O2 by the alternative application of moderate vacuum and inlet of ultra-pure N2 (12Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7646-7651Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For measurements in low temperature glasses, the solvent was 60/40 (v/v) glycerol/buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5), and the protein concentration was 7 μm. Acrylamide-quenching experiments were carried out as described before (14Cioni P. Strambini G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11749-11757Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Measurements—All luminescence measurements were conducted on home-made instrumentation. Briefly, for emission spectra, continuous excitation was provided by a Cermax xenon lamp (LX150UV, ILC Technology, Sunnyvale, CA) whose output was selected (6 nm bandpass) by a 0.23-m double-grating monochromator (SPEX Fluorolog 1680, Spex Industries, Edison, NJ) optimized for maximum stray-light rejection. The emission collected at 90° from the excitation was dispersed by a 0.25-m grating monochromator (H-25, Jobin-Yvon) set to a bandpass of 0.3 nm. A two-position light chopper intersects either the excitation beam only (fluorescence mode) or both excitation and emission beams in alternate fashion in such a way that only delayed emission gets through to the detector (phosphorescence mode). The photomultiplier (EMI 9635QB) current was fed to a low-noise current preamplifier (SR570, Standford, Sunnyvale, CA) followed by a lock-in amplifier (ITHACO 393, Ithaca, NJ) operated at the chopper frequency. The output was digitized and stored by a multifunction board (PCI-20428W, Intelligent Instrumentation Inc., Tucson, AZ) utilizing visual Designer software (PCI-20901S Version 3.0, Intelligent Instrumentation Inc., Tucson, AZ). Spectra were acquired at a scan rate of 0.2 nm s–1 and with a time constant (lock-in amplifier) of 125 ms. For phosphorescence decays, pulsed excitation was provided by a frequency-doubled, Nd/Yag-pumped dye laser (Quanta Systems, Milan, Italy) (λex = 292 nm) with a pulse duration of 5 ns and a typical energy per pulse of 0.5–1 mJ. The phosphorescence emitted at 90° from the excitation was selected by an interference filter (DTblau, Balzer, Milan, Italy) with a transmission window between 410–450 nm. A gating circuit that inverted the polarity of dynodes 1 and 3, for up to 1.5 ms after the laser pulse, protected the photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R928, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) from the intense fluorescence light pulse. In spectral measurements, the photocurrent signal was amplified, digitized, and multiple sweeps were averaged by the same computer-scope system. All phosphorescence decays were analyzed in terms of a sum of exponential components by a non-linear least-squares fitting algorithm (Global Unlimited, LFD, University of Illinois). Phosphorescence Spectrum of Transhydrogenase dI—The characterization of dI phosphorescence was initiated by recording a spectrum at low temperatures in vitreous glasses. At low temperature, the spectrum of Trp generally displays a pronounced vibronic structure with a relatively well resolved 0,0 vibrational band. Although the wavelength of the 0,0 band (λ0,0) is related to the polarity/polarizability of the indole environment (10Galley W.C. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence: Concepts. Dekker, New York1976: 409-439Google Scholar), its bandwidth (BW, the width at half height) reports on the structural homogeneity of the site (11Hershberger M.V. Maki A.H. Galley W.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The spectrum of Trp-72 in glycerol/phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7; 60/40, w/w) at 140 K is shown in Fig. 3. λ0,0 is at 408.0 nm, which is blue shifted by 3–4 nm relative to that of Trp in non-polar solvents. This implies that the triplet-state energy of Trp-72 is raised, relative to that in a fully non-polar site, by polar interactions with the surrounding polypeptide. In addition, the spectrum is exceptionally well resolved, with the 3.25 nm BW of the 0,0 vibrational band being the smallest reported to date for any protein. By comparison the BW of Trp-48 in azurin (a residue with a similarly blue-shifted fluorescence spectrum) is 6.5 nm (24Strambini G.B. Gabellieri E. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 4347-4352Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and that of Trp free in the solvent is 9.6 nm. It was also found that between 295–280 nm, the spectrum is independent of the excitation wavelength. Indeed, after subtraction of the tyrosine component, which is identified by its characteristic contribution between 350–400 nm, the spectrum remained unaltered when the excitation wavelength was varied. Both the high resolution of the phosphorescence spectrum (a narrow distribution of excited-state energies) and the spectral invariance with respect to the excitation wavelength (a narrow distribution of ground-state energies) emphasize the structural homogeneity of the Trp-72 environment. The implications are that there is little conformational freedom in the region of Trp-72 and that the structures of the two subunits in the dimer are equivalent. Warming a low temperature glass into a fluid solution increases the flexibility of the structure of a protein. As a result of relaxation about the excited chromophore, the emission spectrum of the protein generally, therefore, undergoes a sizable red-shift and broadening. However, the phosphorescence spectrum of dI in buffer remains quite well resolved up to ambient temperature and red-shifts by only 2 nm relative to that seen in the rigid glass (Fig. 3). This is an unusually small shift when compared with the 5–10 nm observed for Trp residues in flexible or solvent-exposed sites (10Galley W.C. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence: Concepts. Dekker, New York1976: 409-439Google Scholar). It indicates that spectral relaxation in dI is largely inhibited even on the long time scale of phosphorescence. This finding is consistent with the notion of a very rigid core around Trp-72 even at temperatures where the enzyme is fully functional. Phosphorescence Decay of dI in Fluid Solutions—In fluid solutions at ambient temperature, both phosphorescence intensity and phosphorescence lifetime can be greatly reduced through the enhancement of radiationless processes promoted by the mobility of the protein/solvent matrix about the triplet probe. As a result, long-lived phosphorescence (τ ∼ 0.1–1 s) from proteins in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature is owed exclusively to Trp residues that are buried in rigid sites. The lifetime of these Trp residues, when not influenced by intramolecular quenching reactions with proximal cysteine, cystine, histidine, or tyrosine side chains, is directly correlated to the local flexibility of the polypeptide (12Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7646-7651Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Gonnelli M. Strambini G.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13847-13857Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The phosphorescence emission of dI in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) is intense and exceptionally long lived. The decay at 20 °C is slow and almost uniform, with over 95% of the intensity having a lifetime (τ) of 2.9 ± 0.1 s (Fig. 4). This τ is more than half the value observed in low temperature rigid glasses (5.3 s), where the flexibility of the polypeptide is completely blocked. The τ for dI is the longest reported to date for any protein in fluid aqueous solutions. According to the correlation between τ and solvent viscosity (η) obtained with model compounds (12Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7646-7651Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the site of Trp-72 is very rigid and almost glass-like (ηlocal ∼ 3 × 106 cPoise). Because dI appears to form a very tight dimeric structure, the rate of interconversion with the monomer is likely to be slow during the phosphorescence lifetime. In this case, the homogeneous decay would imply identical lifetimes in each dI subunit of the dimer and indicate that the two cores of the dI.1 domains are structurally equivalent. A small fraction of the dI phosphorescence emission, 2–5%, has a lifetime of 0.9 s. This component was common to every sample, and its amplitude was insensitive to changes in temperature or buffer. It could represent the emission from a non-native fraction of dI or a protein impurity. Temperature Dependence of the Phosphorescence Decay of dI—To determine the activation barrier of the structural fluctuations responsible for the triplet-state relaxation, the phosphorescence lifetime of dI in buffer was monitored across the 0–50 °C-temperature range. The value of τ decreased 3.8-fold, from 3.35 s at 1 °C to 0.89 s at 50 °C, whereas the decay remained homogeneous (α > 0.95) throughout. At temperatures a few degrees above 50 °C, the phosphorescence became rapidly quenched, and the τ dropped to the sub-millisecond range, consistent with extensive unfolding of the globular structure. Under the conditions of the experiment, the process was irreversible in that the phosphorescence was not restored upon re-lowering the temperature of the sample. The empirical relationship obtained between τ and solvent η with model compounds (12Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7646-7651Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was used to obtain a parameter (1/ηprot) that is an indirect measure of the rate of segmental motions about Trp-72 that are responsible for the τ reduction. The plot of ln(1/ηprot) versus 1/T (formally equivalent to an Arrhenius plot) is linear between 10–50 °C (Fig. 5), and the slope yields an activation enthalpy of 23.3 kcal/mol. Activation energies above 20 kcal/mol are characteristic of tight protein cores formed by β-structures, sheets, and barrels, as found in proteins like azurin, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase (15Strambini G.B. Cioni P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 8337-8344Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of τ confirms that below 50 °C, the dI.1 domain retains a compact fold in which structural fluctuations are effectively blocked by activation barriers to unfolding. Note that the slope of the plot decreases below 10 °C. The deviation could indicate either a shift to lower-energy τ relaxation modes or an increasing insensitivity of τ to local fluidity as the lifetime approaches its upper limit of 5–6 s in rigid matrices. Acrylamide Quenching of dI Phosphorescence—An independent assessment of the flexibility of the macromolecule in the region of Trp-72 can be obtained by observing how neutral molecules like acrylamide diffuse through the globular fold to the chromophore and quench its phosphorescence by a relatively short-range reaction (14Cioni P. Strambini G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11749-11757Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The long τ of dI permits, in principle, the determination of even very low bimolecular quenching rate constants. The phosphorescence decay is monoexponential for acrylamide concentrations between 0–200 mm, and the lifetime decrease yields a linear Stern-Vollmer plot (1/τ = 1/τ0 + kq[acrylamide])(Fig. 6). At 20 °C, the slope of the plot gives a second-order rate constant kq = 34 ± 2 m–1s–1. When compared with kq values of 109m–1s–1 for solvent-exposed residues (14Cioni P. Strambini G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11749-11757Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Kerwin B.A. Chang B.S. Gegg C.V. Gonnelli M. Li T. Strambini G.B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is evident that the rate of migration of acrylamide to the site of Trp-72 is greatly reduced. Similarly small values of kq were found for the compact regions of azurin and asparaginase (14Cioni P. Strambini G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11749-11757Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). They are in accord with the long, phosphorescence decay and are consistent with the view that structural fluctuations in the core of dI.1 are greatly hindered. Further, the fact that the decay remains homogeneous despite acrylamide quenching indicates that the rate is similar for the two subunits of the dimer, suggesting again that their Trp-72 environments are equivalent. In contrast to the slow acrylamide migration inferred from phosphorescence experiments, data on the quenching of Trp-72 fluorescence yielded a Stern-Vollmer constant of ∼2 m–1, which translates into a kq value of 3.8 × 108m–1s–1 (9Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Differences in quenching rates of several orders of magnitude between fluorescence and phosphorescence have been observed with several proteins and are attributed to efficient long-range interactions between the fluorescence state and the quencher in the solvent (14Cioni P. Strambini G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11749-11757Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This makes acrylamide an unsuitable quencher of Trp fluorescence in accessibility studies on most proteins, including dI. The kq value of 34 m–1s–1 found from the current phosphorescence measurements more realistically represents collisional quenching of Trp-72 by acrylamide diffusing through the protein matrix, and this low value is consistent with the very long triplet lifetime. In contrast to acrylamide, potassium iodide, an effective quencher of fluorescence from exposed Trp residues, had very little effect on the emission from Trp-72 in dI (9Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Effects of dI2·dIII1 Heterotrimer Formation on the Phosphorescence of Trp-72—Mixtures of recombinant dI and dIII from R. rubrum transhydrogenase form a stable, dI2·dIII1 heterotrimer: a second dIII binds to the complex with only very low affinity (26Quirk P.G. Jeeves M. Cotton N.P. Smith J.K. Jackson B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This asymmetry is very interesting in the context of the mechanism of proton translocation by the enzyme, and we have, therefore, compared the phosphorescence of Trp-72 in isolated dI dimers (above) with that in dI2·dIII1 complexes (Figs. 1 and 6 and Table I). The comparison is simplified by the fact that dIII is devoid of Trp residues. The experiments were performed with dIII in its NADP+ form. The results show that both spectral and lifetime characteristics of Trp-72 are unaffected when the dI dimer binds dIII. The only significant change is a small but reproducible reduction of the acrylamide quenching constant, indicating a decreased accessibility of the quencher to Trp-72 in the complex. The rate constants for dissociation of dI2·dIII1 (into dI dimer and dIII monomer) and re-association are ∼50 s–1 and 109m–1s–1, respectively, and thus, at the protein concentrations used in the experiments, the complex is reformed many times during the phosphorescence decay. As a consequence of rapid dimer-trimer interchange, any potential asymmetry in phosphorescence lifetime between the dI subunits in the trimer would be masked. However, the observation that the phosphorescence lifetime of the complex is practically identical to that of the dI dimer, and the fact that there is no change in BW of the heterotrimer spectrum, strongly indicate that the protein conformation in the region of Trp-72 is identical in the two subunits and is not affected by dIII binding.Table ISpectral (γ0,0 and BW), lifetime (τ0), and acrylamide quenching (kq) parameters characterizing the phosphorescence emission of W72 in WT and dI mutants and the effects of complex formation with dIII and coenzymes ([coenzyme} = 160 μm)Sampleλ0,0BWτ0kqnmnmsm-1 s-1Wild type dI408.053.252.85 ± 0.134 ± 1.0 dI·dIII408.003.302.95 ± 0.130 ± 1.2 dI·NADH408.323.502.75 ± 0.2 dI·dIII·NADPH408.283.602.66 ± 0.2Q132N dI408.203.132.95 ± 0.130 ± 0.9 dI·dIII408.223.092.95 ± 0.125 ± 1.1 dI·NADH408.343.602.80 ± 0.1 dI·dIII·NADPH408.243.502.61 ± 0.1R127M dI408.173.222.80 ± 0.122.5 ± 1.1 dI·dIII408.193.272.75 ± 0.119"

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide GTP-binding (G) proteins are composed of α, β, and γ subunits at a ratio of 1:1:1 (1.Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G proteins play important roles in a variety of transmembrane signaling pathways that are activated by extracellular hormones, neurotransmitters, chemokines, local mediators, and sensory stimuli (2.Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1988; 333: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 3.Spiegel A.M. Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Endocr.

An agonist-bound G protein-coupled receptor activates the G proteins by generating GTP-bound α subunits and triggering the release of the βγ subunits from the heterotrimer. Both the α and βγ subunits are then able to regulate downstream effectors through direct interactions. Once the Gα-GTP subunit is inactivated through GTP hydrolysis, the Gα-GDP subunit reassociates with the Gβγ subunits to form the inactive heterotrimer, which can interact with the G protein-coupled receptor and lead to a new signaling cycle. G protein γ subunits are a large family of proteins with distinctly different primary structures, with <20% identity among 13 isoforms. In contrast, the β subunits display >90% identity among the Gβ1–β4 isoforms (5.Wall M.A. Posner B.A. Sprang S.R.

DNA Res. 2000; 7: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the Gβγ complex acts as a functional monomer where the β and γ subunits never dissociate from each other. Multiple isoforms, including 5 Gβ and 13 Gγ subunits, have been identified in mammals so far (5.Wall M.A. Posner B.A. Sprang S.R.

The diversity seen in the number of subunit isoforms and the degree of sequence identity among them implies that Gγ subunits may confer specificity to particular Gβγ complexes in modulating effector function.

Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar), where these channels have been best studied. GIRK channels belong to the inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channel family that is structurally characterized by a pore helix that controls a loop that forms the K+ selectivity filter, flanked by two putative transmembrane helices, M1 and M2, that extend to intracellular N and C termini. Both the N and C termini of GIRK channels harbor the sites of interaction with the Gβγ subunits (24.Cohen N.A. Sha Q. Makhina E.N. Lopatin A.N. Linder M.E. Snyder S.H. Nichols C.G. J. Biol.

Expression of either GIRK1 or GIRK4 alone in heterologous cell systems, Xenopus oocytes, or mammalian cell lines, reveals moderate to no K+ currents (23.Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of a mutation within the pore helix region of GIRK1 (F137S) or GIRK4 (S143T, GIRK4*) channels results in highly active G protein-sensitive K+ currents (34.Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L.

Use of the modified homomeric channel simplifies the experimental design for structure-function studies and provides an efficient approach to addressing the contribution of each of the subunits of the Gβγ dimer in signaling to the channel. Co-expression of Gα subunits with GIRK channels inhibits basal current activity, presumably through binding free Gβγ subunits that are responsible for the basal activity (25.He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have found that the G protein subunits most distantly related to the mammalian ones, the yeast Gβγ (Ste4/Ste18) (5.Wall M.A. Posner B.A. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1169-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibit GIRK4* currents. Combining biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we have screened a series of chimeras between Gβ1 or Gγ2 and their yeast counterparts. A minimal region localized in the middle of the primary amino acid sequence of γ2 was identified to be necessary for activation of GIRK4* channels. Ten residue differences between Gγ2 and its yeast counterpart, most of which are clustered together in the Gγ2 three-dimensional structure, proved critical for channel activation. This cluster of residues is located close to Gβ residues that have been previously identified to be functionally important (35.Mirshahi T. Mittal V. Zhang H. Linder M.E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36345-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These studies define a molecular surface that is critical for Gβγ effects on GIRK channels, suggesting that multiple residues of γ2 play a role in regulating GIRK4* currents. Construction of Various Recombinant Plasmids—Yeast genomic DNA was isolated from DY150 cells (Clontech) according to standard protocol. cDNAs encoding Ste4 and Ste18 (GenBank™ accession numbers: M23982 and M23983) were amplified using PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE (36.Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Similarly, cRNAs for GIRK4*, Gβ1, and Gγ2 were also subcloned into pGEMHE. Gene splicing by overlap extension was used to generate the chimeric cDNAs between Gβ1 and STE4 or Gγ2 and STE18. Site-specific mutations were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene). FLAG-Gβ1 was constructed by attaching the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) to the N terminus of the cDNA. The correct sequence of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Cornell University, or Invitrogen). Heterologous Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were harvested from Xenopus laevis frogs and were placed in OR2 solution (82.4 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Following a 3–4-time wash with OR2 solution, oocytes were subjected to collagenase treatment (2 mg/ml). Once ∼50% of the oocytes were defolliculated (1.5–2.5 h), they were rinsed and placed in an ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6) and were supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Oocytes were kept at 17–18 °C before and after injection of cRNA until they were used for electrophysiological recordings or biochemistry. All constructs were linearized with NheI or SphI (New England Biolabs), and in vitro transcription of cRNA was performed using Ambion's mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) with T7 polymerase. cRNAs were electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde gels, and concentrations were estimated from two dilutions compared with the RNA marker (Invitrogen). cRNAs were dissolved in nuclease-free water to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. One ng of each cRNA was generally injected into each oocyte, unless otherwise indicated. The cRNAs listed below were injected in the following approximate quantities: GIRK channel subunits, 1.0 ng/species; IRK1 channel, 1.0 ng; m2 receptor, 1.5 ng; Gβ subunit, 1.0 ng; Gγ2 subunit, 1.0 ng; STE4, 1.0 ng; STE18, 1.0 ng; chimeras and mutants, 1.0 ng. Electrophysiology—Whole-oocyte currents were measured by conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Agarose cushion microelectrodes were used with resistances between 0.1 and 1.0 megaohms (37.Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Oocytes were constantly superfused with a high potassium solution containing 91 mm KCl, 1 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KOH/HEPES (pH 7.4). To block GIRK currents, the oocyte chamber was perfused with solutions containing 3 mm BaCl2. Typically, oocytes were held at 0 mV, the potassium reversal potential (EK), and currents were constantly monitored by 500-ms pulses to a command potential of –80 mV for 200 ms followed by a step to +80 mV for another 200 ms, and the cycle was repeated every 2 s. Periodically, a protocol was applied with a command potential from –100 with steps to +100 mV in 10-mV increments. Current amplitudes were measured at the end of the 200-ms pulse at each potential. Control currents were evaluated 2–5 min after impaling the oocytes, whereas Ba2+-insensitive currents were evaluated once steady-state inhibition was achieved, 1–3 min after application of 3 mm Ba2+. Basal current represents the difference between the control and the Ba2+-insensitive currents. Error bars in the figures represent mean ± S.E. Each experiment shown or described was performed on 3–5 oocytes of the same batch. A minimum of 2–3 batches of oocytes was tested for each experiment shown. Preparation of Crude Membranes—The injected or uninjected oocytes were lysed with a glass homogenizer in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Next, they were incubated on ice for 1 h. Following two rounds of low speed centrifugation (900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), the insoluble debris was removed, and the clear supernatant was subjected to high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C). The pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 in a volume of 2 μl/oocyte. Immunoprecipitation, Trypsin Assay, and Immunoblotting—Crude membranes were mixed with the FLAG (M2) agarose affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes with beads were washed three times and mixed with the lysis buffer. A limited trypsin digestion assay of the FLAG-β1γ2 complexes was performed as described previously (38.Lee C. Murakami T. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8779-8784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with small modifications. Briefly, the protein bound to the beads was directly subjected to trypsin digestion (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethylketone-treated trypsin, Sigma T-8642) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of equal volume of sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) 4% SDS, 5% 2-mercapthethanol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) and was boiled for 5 min. After removal of the beads by a transient spin, the same amount of protein was loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) using a semidry electroblotter (120 mV for 45 min at room temperature). The membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% non-fat dry milk, and 0.02% NaN3), and the protein was immunoblotted with anti-Gβ polyclonal antibody (T-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The bound antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and chemiluminescence was used to visualize the bands (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Gβγ Inhibits GIRK4* Basal Currents—We set out to test the effect of yeast Gβγ subunits on GIRK4* channels. Oocytes were injected with cRNA for GIRK4*. We measured basal K+ currents using a two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 1A). As expected, co-expression of the channel with Gβ1γ2 subunits resulted in stimulated inwardly rectifying currents, as compared with control (34.Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expression of yeast Gβγ subunits significantly inhibited basal (Fig. 1A) but not agonist-dependent GIRK4*currents (data not shown). The effects of yeast Gβγ subunits on GIRK currents appeared similar to those of the mammalian Gβ5γ2 subunits (35.Mirshahi T. Mittal V. Zhang H. Linder M.E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36345-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39.Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inwardly rectifying K+ channel IRK1, which is insensitive to G proteins (25.He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40.Kubo Y. Iizuka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was not affected by the presence of yeast Gβγ subunits (Fig. 1A). We next mixed and matched mammalian and yeast Gβ and Gγ subunits and tested their effects on GIRK4* currents. Only Gβ and Gγ dimers of the same species showed either stimulatory (mammalian) or inhibitory (yeast) effects on GIRK4* currents (Fig. 1B). Yeast Gγ and Mammalian Gγ2 Exert Opposite Effects on the Function of GIRK4* Channels by Associating with a Yeast/Mammalian Gβ Chimera—To determine the molecular determinants of the functional difference between the yeast Gγ and the mammalian Gγ2 on the Gβγ-mediated stimulation of GIRK4* channels, we constructed chimeras between the yeast Gβ and the mammalian Gβ and screened for stimulatory or inhibitory effects on GIRK4* currents. One chimera, where the first 35 amino acids of the yeast Gβ were added to the intact mammalian Gβ1 subunit (ymβ), could yield the expected effect on GIRK channel activity upon association with either the mammalian or the yeast Gγ subunit. cRNAs of the ymβ chimera, GIRK4* channels, the mammalian Gγ2 (mγ), or the yeast Gγ (yγ) were co-injected into oocytes (Fig. 2A). The controls, mammalian Gβ1γ2 (mβγ) or yeast Gβγ (yβγ), were tested each time on the same batch of oocytes. Fig. 2B shows the agonist-independent (basal) current measured by expression of GIRK4* alone or together with mammalian and or yeast Gβγ subunits. The ymβ chimera stimulated GIRK4* currents upon co-expression with the mammalian Gγ and inhibited currents upon co-expression with the yeast Gγ. This result strongly suggested that the N-terminal first 35 amino acids of the yeast Gβ is sufficient to confer the inhibitory phenotype of the yeast Gβγ to GIRK4* currents, without affecting the stimulatory effect of the mammalian Gγ2. Moreover, this result underscores the importance of the Gγ subunit in the Gβγ complex as the same Gβ subunit (ymβ) was stimulatory, when complexed with the mammalian Gγ subunit, or inhibitory, when complexed with the yeast Gγ subunit. When stoichiometric amounts of both the mammalian and yeast Gγ were co-expressed with the ymβ chimera, no significant effect on GIRK4* currents was observed. However, when progressively greater amounts of mammalian Gγ were expressed relative to the yeast Gγ, then a correspondingly greater stimulatory effect was obtained. These data suggest that the competition of the appropriate Gβγ for the channel sites yields either a stimulatory effect (the mammalian phenotype) or an inhibitory effect (the yeast phenotype). The C-terminal Half of the Gγ2 Subunit Is a Crucial Contributor to the GIRK4* Current Stimulation by Gβ1γ2—To identify a minimal region of Gγ2 responsible for activating GIRK4* channel currents, chimeric constructs between the mammalian Gγ2 and the yeast Gγ were made based on a sequence comparison between the two subunits (showing a 15% identity between the Gγ2 and the yeast Gγ proteins) (Fig. 3A). Each of these Gγ chimeras were co-injected with Gβ1, and their effects on GIRK4* currents were compared with control. Gγ chimeras GS-2, GS-6, and GS-11 showed significant stimulation of GIRK4* currents upon co-expression with Gβ1. All these chimeras had in common the Gγ2 amino acid region between residues 35 and 50, suggesting that this region contains important determinants for the stimulatory effects of Gγ2 on GIRK4* currents. Since the GS-11 chimera did not produce as much GIRK4* current as the GS-2 chimera or the wild-type Gγ2, it is likely that the residue 51–71 region contains determinants in addition to those found in the residue 35–50 region that are important for maximal Gβγ stimulation of GIRK4* currents. Another chimera, GS-10 incorporating the unique 13-residue insert Lys-68–Val-80 in the yeast Gγ sequence onto the mammalian Gγ (m1–44y68–80m45–71), did not interfere with the ability of the Gβ/GS-10 complex to stimulate GIRK currents (data not shown). Thus, the 13-residue insert did not appear to be responsible for the inhibitory effect of the yeast Gγ on the Gβγ complex with the mammalian Gβ subunit. Ten Amino Acids of Gγ2 Reduce the Ability of Gβγ to Stimulate GIRK4* Currents—We proceeded to identify the specific amino acids within the residue 35–71 region of Gγ2 responsible for the Gγ contribution to the stimulatory effects of the Gβγ complex on GIRK4* currents. Each residue of Gγ2 was mutated to its counterpart in the yeast Gγ and was co-expressed with GIRK4* channels in oocytes. Whole-cell currents were recorded, allowing us to screen for the ability of each mutant to increase channel currents relative to the wild-type Gβ1 (Fig. 4A). Of the 33 mutants of Gγ2 tested, 23 mutants showed the ability to enhance GIRK4* currents to levels that were not significantly different from those of the wild-type Gβ1γ2. The remaining 10 single-point mutants (A35L, E42S, D48N, P49H, P53G, V54L, P55K, P60S, F61S, and R62N) of Gγ2, however, significantly decreased the ability to activate the channel current but did not completely abolish stimulation of channel activity, implying that negation of the contribution from multiple residues of Gγ2 might be required for disrupting full stimulation of the GIRK channel by Gβ1γ2 subunits. The inability of the mutants to cause full GIRK stimulation raises the question of whether the impairment of the channel function could be due to a change in the native conformation of Gβ1γ2. To test for such a possibility, we linked a FLAG epitope at the N terminus of Gβ1 to distinguish it from endogenous Gβ and identified the expressed Gβ1 in oocytes by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma). The FLAG-tagged Gβ1 showed similar stimulation of K+ currents as compared with the non-tagged Gβ1 co-expressed with Gγ2 (data not shown). For the pulled-down proteins, limited tryptic digestion was performed (9.Muntz K.H. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38.Lee C. Murakami T. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8779-8784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows that a typical band of 26 kDa was protected from trypsin digestion. In contrast, expression of Gβ1 alone failed to confer trypsin resistance, which is accomplished by proper association of the Gβ with a Gγ subunit. (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). These results confirm that the Gγ2 mutants that show significant functional impairment still assemble properly with wild-type Gβ1 to produce Gβγ-stimulated currents. The weaker enhancement of the channel currents by the Gγ mutants is likely to be caused by a functional impairment rather than a global structural defect. Gγ Residues Co-localize with Gβ Residues, All of Which Are Critical for Mediating the Gβγ Effects on GIRK Channel Activity—To better understand the nature of interactions between Gγ2 and GIRK channels, we mapped the identified critical residues onto the known crystal structure of the Gβ1γ2 complex. Fig. 5A (left panel) shows a ribbon diagram of the Gβ1γ2 complex adapted from the published coordinates (5.Wall M.A. Posner B.A. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1169-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gβ1 is shown in white, and Gγ2 is shown in yellow. Identified residues on Gγ2 are colored in cyan. Except for Ala-35 and Glu-42, the remaining 8 identified residues cluster in the same region of the complex. The Gγ2 structure is composed of two α-helical domains and two loops. Eight clustered residues are in a loop in close proximity to the lipid modification that is used to anchor the protein to the membrane. All 7 of the critical residues are located around a groove that is formed from the interaction of Gβ and Gγ. Ser-67 in Gβ, which was previously identified to play an important role in controlling GIRK channel activity (35.Mirshahi T. Mittal V. Zhang H. Linder M.E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36345-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), resides on the side of this groove defined by the majority of the identified mutations. Several residues in this region maintain interactions between Gβ and Gγ. Mapping the 7 functionally important residues onto the Gβ1γ2 structure clearly indicates that these residues are surface-accessible (Fig. 5, right panel). Furthermore, these residues form a continuous surface with Ser-67 on Gβ. Overall, the positioning of these residues defines a surface on the Gβγ structure that is critical in the activation of GIRK channels. The D36T and D48N Combination Mutant of Gγ2 Abolishes Gβγ-mediated K+Currents—Based on the above evidence that no single-point mutant of Gγ2 could totally abolish activation of the GIRK channel, we next sought to address whether multiple residues were required for the Gβγ-mediated stimulation of channel currents. It has been shown that three consecutive amino acids in Gγ2, Ala-Asp-Leu (residues 35–37), conferred the ability to assemble with Gβ2 (38.Lee C. Murakami T. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8779-8784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Does the triple-point mutant also impair the"
https://openalex.org/W1968475897,"A mammary-derived growth inhibitor-related gene (<i>MRG</i>) was previously identified and characterized. MRG induces differentiation of mammary epithelial cells <i>in vitro</i> and its expression is associated with mammary differentiation. To further define the role of MRG on mammary gland differentiation, a <i>MRG</i> transgenic mice model under the control of mouse mammary tumor virus promoter was established and the effect of MRG on mammary gland differentiation was investigated at histological and molecular levels. Expression of endogenous mouse <i>MRG</i> gene was significantly increased from the non-differentiated gland of control virgin mice to the functionally differentiated gland of pregnant control mice. Whole mount analyses demonstrated that ductal development was not affected by <i>MRG</i> transgene expression. While there was no lobuloalveolar structure in control virgin mice, expression of MRG transgene in the mammary gland resulted in the development of lobuloalveolar-like structure, which mimics the gland from early pregnancy. Consistent with the morphological change, expression of MRG also increased milk protein β-casein expression in the gland. To study the mechanism of MRG-induced mammary differentiation, we investigated the Stat5 activation in the glands from the transgenic mouse <i>versus</i> virgin control mouse. While activated Stat5 was expressed at the minimal level in the non-differentiated control virgin gland, a significant Stat5 phosphorylation was observed in the virgin transgenic gland. Our data indicate that MRG is a mediator of the differentiating effects of pregnancy on breast epithelium, and overexpression of MRG in young nulliparous mice can induce differentiation."
