https://openalex.org/W2069950623,"Monitoring neuronal electrical activity using fluorescent protein-based voltage sensors has been limited by small response magnitudes and slow kinetics of existing probes. Here we report the development of a fluorescent protein voltage sensor, named ArcLight, and derivative probes that exhibit large changes in fluorescence intensity in response to voltage changes. ArcLight consists of the voltage-sensing domain of Ciona intestinalis voltage-sensitive phosphatase and super ecliptic pHluorin that carries the point mutation A227D. The fluorescence intensity of ArcLight A242 decreases by 35% in response to a 100 mV depolarization when measured in HEK293 cells, which is more than five times larger than the signals from previously reported fluorescent protein voltage sensors. We show that the combination of signal size and response speed of these new probes allows the reliable detection of single action potentials and excitatory potentials in individual neurons and dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2050218188,"A fundamental question in developmental neuroscience is how a collection of progenitor cells proliferates and differentiates to create a brain of the appropriate size and cellular composition. To address this issue, we devised lineage-tracing assays in developing zebrafish embryos to reconstruct entire retinal lineage progressions in vivo and thereby provide a complete quantitative map of the generation of a vertebrate CNS tissue from individual progenitors. These lineage data are consistent with a simple model in which the retina is derived from a set of equipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that are subject to stochastic factors controlling lineage progression. Clone formation in mutant embryos reveals that the transcription factor Ath5 acts as a molecular link between fate choice and mode of cell division, giving insight into the elusive molecular mechanisms of histogenesis, the conserved temporal order by which neurons of different types exit the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2129737293,"Although Aβ peptides are causative agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. We report that Aβ42 induces a translational block by activating AMPK, thereby inhibiting the mTOR pathway. This translational block leads to widespread ER stress, which activates JNK3. JNK3 in turn phosphorylates APP at T668, thereby facilitating its endocytosis and subsequent processing. In support, pharmacologically blocking translation results in a significant increase in Aβ42 in a JNK3-dependent manner. Thus, JNK3 activation, which is increased in human AD cases and a familial AD (FAD) mouse model, is integral to perpetuating Aβ42 production. Concomitantly, deletion of JNK3 from FAD mice results in a dramatic reduction in Aβ42 levels and overall plaque loads and increased neuronal number and improved cognition. This reveals AD as a metabolic disease that is under tight control by JNK3."
https://openalex.org/W1995617740,"Mind wandering has recently received extensive research because it reveals an important characteristic of our consciousness: conscious experience can arise internally and involuntarily. As the first attempt to examine mind wandering in a non-western population, the present study used experience-sampling method to collect the daily momentary mind wandering episodes in a Chinese sample. The results showed that mind wandering was also a ubiquitous experience among the Chinese population, and, instead of emerging out of nowhere, it was often elicited by external or internal cues. Furthermore, most of the mind wandering episodes involved prospective thinking and were closely related to one’s personal life. Finally, the frequency of mind wandering was influenced by some contextual factors. These results taken together suggest that mind wandering plays an important role in helping people to maintain a continuous feeling of “self” and to prepare them to cope with the upcoming events."
https://openalex.org/W2065418093,"As genes that confer increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are identified, a crucial next step is to determine how these risk factors impact brain structure and function and contribute to disorder heterogeneity. With three converging lines of evidence, we show that a common, functional ASD risk variant in the Met Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (MET) gene is a potent modulator of key social brain circuitry in children and adolescents with and without ASD. MET risk genotype predicted atypical fMRI activation and deactivation patterns to social stimuli (i.e., emotional faces), as well as reduced functional and structural connectivity in temporo-parietal regions known to have high MET expression, particularly within the default mode network. Notably, these effects were more pronounced in individuals with ASD. These findings highlight how genetic stratification may reduce heterogeneity and help elucidate the biological basis of complex neuropsychiatric disorders such as ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2170977055,"Mice bearing a “humanized” immune system are valuable tools to experimentally manipulate human cells in vivo and facilitate disease models not normally possible in laboratory animals. Here we describe a form of GVHD that develops in NOD/SCID mice reconstituted with human fetal bone marrow, liver and thymus (NS BLT mice). The skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and parotid glands are affected with progressive inflammation and sclerosis. Although all mice showed involvement of at least one organ site, the incidence of overt clinical disease was approximately 35% by 22 weeks after reconstitution. The use of hosts lacking the IL2 common gamma chain (NOD/SCID/γc−/−) delayed the onset of disease, but ultimately did not affect incidence. Genetic analysis revealed that particular donor HLA class I alleles influenced the risk for the development of GVHD. At a cellular level, GVHD is associated with the infiltration of human CD4+ T cells into the skin and a shift towards Th1 cytokine production. GVHD also induced a mixed M1/M2 polarization phenotype in a dermal murine CD11b+, MHC class II+ macrophage population. The presence of xenogenic GVHD in BLT mice both presents a major obstacle in the use of humanized mice and an opportunity to conduct preclinical studies on GVHD in a humanized model."
https://openalex.org/W2082612365,"To ascertain genetic diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among a representative collection of Chinese winter wheat cultivars and lines, 90 winter wheat accessions were analyzed with 269 SSR markers distributed throughout the wheat genome. A total of 1,358 alleles were detected, with 2 to 10 alleles per locus and a mean genetic richness of 5.05. The average genetic diversity index was 0.60, with values ranging from 0.05 to 0.86. Of the three genomes of wheat, ANOVA revealed that the B genome had the highest genetic diversity (0.63) and the D genome the lowest (0.56); significant differences were observed between these two genomes (P<0.01). The 90 Chinese winter wheat accessions could be divided into three subgroups based on STRUCTURE, UPGMA cluster and principal coordinate analyses. The population structure derived from STRUCTURE clustering was positively correlated to some extent with geographic eco-type. LD analysis revealed that there was a shorter LD decay distance in Chinese winter wheat compared with other wheat germplasm collections. The maximum LD decay distance, estimated by curvilinear regression, was 17.4 cM (r2>0.1), with a whole genome LD decay distance of approximately 2.2 cM (r2>0.1, P<0.001). Evidence from genetic diversity analyses suggest that wheat germplasm from other countries should be introduced into Chinese winter wheat and distant hybridization should be adopted to create new wheat germplasm with increased genetic diversity. The results of this study should provide valuable information for future association mapping using this Chinese winter wheat collection."
https://openalex.org/W2009470502,"Plasma membranes of the somatodendritic and axonal domains of neurons are known to have different protein compositions, but the molecular mechanisms that determine this polarized protein distribution remain poorly understood. Herein we show that somatodendritic sorting of various transmembrane receptors in rat hippocampal neurons is mediated by recognition of signals within the cytosolic domains of the proteins by the μ1A subunit of the adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) complex. This complex, in conjunction with clathrin, functions in the neuronal soma to exclude somatodendritic proteins from axonal transport carriers. Perturbation of this process affects dendritic spine morphology and decreases the number of synapses. These findings highlight the primary recognition event that underlies somatodendritic sorting and contribute to the evolving view of AP-1 as a global regulator of cell polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2130393131,"Lambda Red recombineering is a powerful technique for making targeted genetic changes in bacteria. However, many applications are limited by the frequency of recombination. Previous studies have suggested that endogenous nucleases may hinder recombination by degrading the exogenous DNA used for recombineering. In this work, we identify ExoVII as a nuclease which degrades the ends of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cassettes. Removing this nuclease improves both recombination frequency and the inheritance of mutations at the 3' ends of ssDNA and dsDNA. Extending this approach, we show that removing a set of five exonucleases (RecJ, ExoI, ExoVII, ExoX, and Lambda Exo) substantially improves the performance of co-selection multiplex automatable genome engineering (CoS-MAGE). In a given round of CoS-MAGE with ten ssDNA oligonucleotides, the five nuclease knockout strain has on average 46% more alleles converted per clone, 200% more clones with five or more allele conversions, and 35% fewer clones without any allele conversions. Finally, we use these nuclease knockout strains to investigate and clarify the effects of oligonucleotide phosphorothioation on recombination frequency. The results described in this work provide further mechanistic insight into recombineering, and substantially improve recombineering performance."
https://openalex.org/W2014823816,"The transformation of dendritic excitatory synaptic inputs to axonal action potential output is the fundamental computation performed by all principal neurons. We show that in the hippocampus this transformation is potently controlled by recurrent inhibitory microcircuits. However, excitatory input on highly excitable dendritic branches could resist inhibitory control by generating strong dendritic spikes and trigger precisely timed action potential output. Furthermore, we show that inhibition-sensitive branches can be transformed into inhibition-resistant, strongly spiking branches by intrinsic plasticity of branch excitability. In addition, we demonstrate that the inhibitory control of spatially defined dendritic excitation is strongly regulated by network activity patterns. Our findings suggest that dendritic spikes may serve to transform correlated branch input into reliable and temporally precise output even in the presence of inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2049632022,"The phenolic phytoalexin resveratrol is well known for its health-promoting and anticancer properties. Its potential benefits are, however, limited due to its low bioavailability. Pterostilbene, a natural dimethoxylated analog of resveratrol, presents higher anticancer activity than resveratrol. The mechanisms by which this polyphenol acts against cancer cells are, however, unclear. Here, we show that pterostilbene effectively inhibits cancer cell growth and stimulates apoptosis and autophagosome accumulation in cancer cells of various origins. However, these mechanisms are not determinant in cell demise. Pterostilbene promotes cancer cell death via a mechanism involving lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Different grades of susceptibility were observed among the different cancer cells depending on their lysosomal heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) content, a known stabilizer of lysosomal membranes. A375 melanoma and A549 lung cancer cells with low levels of HSP70 showed high susceptibility to pterostilbene, whereas HT29 colon and MCF7 breast cancer cells with higher levels of HSP70 were more resistant. Inhibition of HSP70 expression increased susceptibility of HT29 colon and MCF7 breast cancer cells to pterostilbene. Our data indicate that lysosomal membrane permeabilization is the main cell death pathway triggered by pterostilbene."
https://openalex.org/W2131672615,"Given a noisy sensory world, the nervous system integrates perceptual evidence over time to optimize decision-making. Neurophysiological accumulation of sensory information is well-documented in the animal visual system, but how such mechanisms are instantiated in the human brain remains poorly understood. Here we combined psychophysical techniques, drift-diffusion modeling, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to establish that odor evidence integration in the human olfactory system enhances discrimination on a two-alternative forced-choice task. Model-based measures of fMRI brain activity highlighted a ramp-like increase in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that peaked at the time of decision, conforming to predictions derived from an integrator model. Combined behavioral and fMRI data further suggest that decision bounds are not fixed but collapse over time, facilitating choice behavior in the presence of low-quality evidence. These data highlight a key role for the orbitofrontal cortex in resolving sensory uncertainty and provide substantiation for accumulator models of human perceptual decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2018162829,"Background Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a glycoprotein that functions to inhibit angiogenesis, proliferation, and invasion in different types of cancer. The ability of SPARC to modulate neovascularisation is believed to be mediated in part by its ability to modulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of SPARC expression in gastric cancer cells on proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Method We evaluated expression of SPARC in seven human gastric cancer cell lines. Then we established a stably transfected SPARC overexpressed cell line (BGC-SP) and a stably transfected SPARC knock-down cell line (HGC-sh). The effect of SPARC overexpression and SPARC silencing was studied by examining capillary formation of HUVECs in vitro and a dorsal skin-fold chamber model in vivo. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to detect if the expressions of VEGF and MMP-7 were modulated by SPARC expression. To further determine the effect of SPARC expression on angiogenesis in vivo, xenograft models were established and microvessel density (MVD) of different clones were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results Endogenous SPARC overexpression inhibited the expression of VEGF and MMP-7, as well as the angiogenesis induced by BGC-SP cells. Correspondingly, SPARC silencing increased the expression of VEGF and MMP-7, as well as the angiogenesis induced by HGC-sh cells. Elevated angiogenesis induced by SPARC silencing in HGC-sh cells was decreased when VEGF was neutralised by antibodies, and MMP-7 was knocked down in vitro. Conclusion SPARC suppresses angiogenesis of gastric cancer by down-regulating the expression of VEGF and MMP-7."
https://openalex.org/W2046826834,"Background Modern selachians and their supposed sister group (hybodont sharks) have a long and successful evolutionary history. Yet, although selachian remains are considered relatively common in the fossil record in comparison with other marine vertebrates, little is known about the quality of their fossil record. Similarly, only a few works based on specific time intervals have attempted to identify major events that marked the evolutionary history of this group. Methodology/Principal Findings Phylogenetic hypotheses concerning modern selachians’ interrelationships are numerous but differ significantly and no consensus has been found. The aim of the present study is to take advantage of the range of recent phylogenetic hypotheses in order to assess the fit of the selachian fossil record to phylogenies, according to two different branching methods. Compilation of these data allowed the inference of an estimated range of diversity through time and evolutionary events that marked this group over the past 300 Ma are identified. Results indicate that with the exception of high taxonomic ranks (orders), the selachian fossil record is by far imperfect, particularly for generic and post-Triassic data. Timing and amplitude of the various identified events that marked the selachian evolutionary history are discussed. Conclusion/Significance Some identified diversity events were mentioned in previous works using alternative methods (Early Jurassic, mid-Cretaceous, K/T boundary and late Paleogene diversity drops), thus reinforcing the efficiency of the methodology presented here in inferring evolutionary events. Other events (Permian/Triassic, Early and Late Cretaceous diversifications; Triassic/Jurassic extinction) are newly identified. Relationships between these events and paleoenvironmental characteristics and other groups’ evolutionary history are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2088602755,"Hindbrain neuronal networks serving respiratory, proprioceptive, and arousal functions share a developmental requirement for the bHLH transcription factor Atoh1. Loss of Atoh1 in mice results in respiratory failure and neonatal lethality; however, the neuronal identity and mechanism by which Atoh1-dependent cells sustain newborn breathing remains unknown. We uncovered that selective loss of Atoh1 from the postmitotic retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons results in severely impaired inspiratory rhythm and pronounced neonatal death. Mice that escape neonatal death develop abnormal chemoresponsiveness as adults. Interestingly, the expression of Atoh1 in the RTN neurons is not required for their specification or maintenance, but is important for their proper localization and to establish essential connections with the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC). These results provide insights into the genetic regulation of neonatal breathing and shed light on the labile sites that might contribute to sudden death in newborn infants and altered chemoresponsiveness in adults.

In humans, aberrant respiratory control presents a significant public health burden, with sudden infant death syndrome being the leading cause of postnatal infant mortality. Moreover, genetic disorders such as Joubert syndrome and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) also impair central control of respiration, as does central apnea in adults. However, our knowledge about the underlying transcriptional regulation of the neurocircuitries controlling respiration remains largely incomplete. In the case of CCHS, a polyalanine expansion in paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B)—a transcription factor essential for the development of subsets of hindbrain motor neurons, interneurons, and postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system—has been identified as the disease-defining mutation (Amiel et al., 2003Amiel J. Laudier B. Attié-Bitach T. Trang H. de Pontual L. Gener B. Trochet D. Etchevers H. Ray P. Simonneau M. et al.Polyalanine expansion and frameshift mutations of the paired-like homeobox gene PHOX2B in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.Nat.

Mice carrying the most common PHOX2B mutation display neonatal lethality caused by central apnea (Dubreuil et al., 2008Dubreuil V. Ramanantsoa N. Trochet D. Vaubourg V. Amiel J. Gallego J. Brunet J.F. Goridis C. A human mutation in Phox2b causes lack of CO2 chemosensitivity, fatal central apnea, and specific loss of parafacial neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which highlights the critical role of Phox2b-dependent hindbrain structures in newborn breathing. While studying the functions of the bHLH transcription factor atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1, also known as Math1) in hindbrain development, we discovered that Atoh1 null mice die within the first hour after birth from respiratory failure (Ben-Arie et al., 1997Ben-Arie N. Bellen H.J. Armstrong D.L. McCall A.E. Gordadze P.R. Guo Q. Matzuk M.M. Zoghbi H.Y. Math1 is essential for genesis of cerebellar granule neurons.Nature. 1997; 390: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Atoh1 is expressed in the proliferating rhombic lip (RL) progenitors that give rise to hindbrain neuronal subtypes constituting the respiratory, interoceptive, proprioceptive, and arousal systems (Rose et al., 2009aRose M.F. Ahmad K.A. Thaller C. Zoghbi H.Y. Excitatory neurons of the proprioceptive, interoceptive, and arousal hindbrain networks share a developmental requirement for Math1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 22462-22467Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, Atoh1 is expressed in the postmitotic RL-independent parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (hereafter referred to as the RTN) and paratrigeminal (pTRI) neurons that surround the facial motor nucleus (nVII) and trigeminal motor nucleus (nV), respectively (collectively termed paramotor neurons) (Dubreuil et al., 2009Dubreuil V.

While Atoh1 expression in the mitotic RL precursors is essential for their specification (Machold and Fishell, 2005Machold R. Fishell G.

Many Atoh1-dependent neurons may provide modulatory inputs to the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), the hypothesized primary inspiratory rhythm generator in mammals (Gray et al., 1999Gray P.A. Rekling J.C. Bocchiaro C.M. Feldman J.L.

Pre-Bötzinger complex: a brainstem region that may generate respiratory rhythm in mammals.Science. 1991; 254: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Because of Atoh1’s complex expression pattern, it is unclear which neuronal population is responsible for the respiratory and lethality phenotypes. We used conditional inactivation, in combination with genetic neuronal projection mapping and electrophysiological studies, to explore the mechanism by which Atoh1 modulates respiration and to pinpoint the identity of the neurons critical for neonatal breathing. We uncovered the neuronal identity and mechanism by which Atoh1 mediates neonatal respiratory activity and revealed the function of Atoh1 during the development of RTN neurons that affect neonatal respiratory efficacy and respiratory chemoresponsiveness in adulthood. Atoh1 null mice die shortly after birth, despite retaining the rhythmogenic preBötC populations and the capacity to generate respiratory output in vitro (Rose et al., 2009bRose M.F. Ren J. Ahmad K.A. Chao H.T. Klisch T.J. Flora A. Greer J.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Math1 is essential for the development of hindbrain neurons critical for perinatal breathing.Neuron. 2009; 64: 341-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We set out to delineate Atoh1-dependent projections that innervate the preBötC by comparing wild-type (WT) and Atoh1 null mice, with a focus on Atoh1 populations adjacent to the preBötC (Figure 1A). To this end, we crossed mice that constitutively express Cre recombinase from the endogenous Atoh1 locus (Atoh1Cre/+) with Atoh1+/− mice that also carry a Cre-responsive TaumGFP-nLacZ reporter allele. Upon Cre expression, nuclear LacZ (nLacZ) and myristoylated GFP (mGFP) permanently mark neuronal somas and projections, respectively in WT (Atoh1Cre/+; TaumGFP-nLacZ) and Atoh1 null (Atoh1Cre/−; TaumGFP-nLacZ) mice. Consistent with the observation that Atoh1 is essential for the formation of RL descendants (Machold and Fishell, 2005Machold R. Fishell G. Math1 is expressed in temporally discrete pools of cerebellar rhombic-lip neural progenitors.Neuron. 2005; 48: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2005Wang V.Y.

In contrast, Atoh1 null mice still retain the RL-independent RTN neurons, but the somas cluster at the dorsal surface of nVII, likely as a result of a migration defect (white arrowheads) (Figures 1B and 1C). Moreover, the closely localized nVII neurons, which do not express Atoh1, show normal marker expression and localization (Figures S1A and S1B available online), suggesting their development is Atoh1 independent. During embryonic development, the RTN neurons migrate radially to assume their final location around the nVII, with the majority of them lining the ventral medullar surface (Dubreuil et al., 2009Dubreuil V. Thoby-Brisson M. Rallu M. Persson K. Pattyn A. Birchmeier C. Brunet J.F. Fortin G. Goridis C.

Math1 is essential for the development of hindbrain neurons critical for perinatal breathing.Neuron. 2009; 64: 341-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In Atoh1 null mice, the mislocalized RTN neurons retain expression of lineage markers such as Phox2b and ladybird homeobox homolog 1 (Lbx1), similar to WT mice (Figures 1D and 1E), indicating that their lineage identities are unchanged. This defect is different from the CCHS mouse model, in which these neurons do not form (Dubreuil et al., 2008Dubreuil V. Ramanantsoa N. Trochet D. Vaubourg V. Amiel J. Gallego J. Brunet J.F. Goridis C. A human mutation in Phox2b causes lack of CO2 chemosensitivity, fatal central apnea, and specific loss of parafacial neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We then stained for myristoylated GFP to ask whether loss of Atoh1 affects neuronal connectivity of lower brainstem circuitry. In the preBötC region (orange dotted circled neurons marked by somatostatin, Sst) of the E18.5 WT brainstem (Figure 1F), we detected neuronal processes extending from both rostral (white open arrowheads) and caudal (white arrowheads) Atoh1 populations. The rostral neuronal bundles correspond to the pontine Atoh1 respiratory populations and the RTN neurons, while the caudal processes belong predominantly to the LRt neurons (Abbott et al., 2009Abbott S.B.

This early connectivity is consistent with connectivity in adult rodents and functional connectivity occurring prior to the onset of inspiratory behaviors in utero (Feldman and Del Negro, 2006Feldman J.L. Del Negro C.A. Looking for inspiration: new perspectives on respiratory rhythm.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In the Atoh1 null brain, the preBötC received little to no Atoh1-dependent rostral and caudal inputs (Figure 1G). Notably, neurites of the mislocalized RTN neurons accumulate at the dorsal side of nVII and do not extend to the preBötC. This suggests that Atoh1 null RTN neurons not only mislocalize but also lack direct targeting to the primary breathing center. In an effort to identify the Atoh1 subpopulations critical for neonatal survival, we applied conditional knockout strategies. We have previously shown that removal of Atoh1 using a HoxB1Cre allele that covers all tissues caudal to the rhombomere 3/4 boundary results in 50% neonatal lethality (Maricich et al., 2009Maricich S.M. Xia A. Mathes E.L. Wang V.Y. Oghalai J.S. Fritzsch B. Zoghbi H.Y.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11123-11133Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hence, we focused on hindbrain Atoh1 lineages that fall within this region. The ventral medulla contains a number of Atoh1-dependent populations that may provide input to the respiratory column, including the trigeminal sensory inputs (Potts et al., 2005Potts J.T. Rybak I.A. Paton J.F. Respiratory rhythm entrainment by somatic afferent stimulation.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1965-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the subcaudal ventrolateral medulla neurons (Gray et al., 2010Gray P.A. Hayes J.A. Ling G.Y. Llona I. Tupal S. Picardo M.C.

Convergence of central respiratory and locomotor rhythms onto single neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus.Exp. Brain Res. 1997; 113: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether loss of these caudal Atoh1 hindbrain populations contributes to the neonatal lethality of Atoh1 null mice, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing Cre recombinase under the regulation of the HoxA4 enhancer sequence (Behringer et al., 1993Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Sequences 5′ of the homeobox of the Hox-1.4 gene direct tissue-specific expression of lacZ during mouse development.Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crossing HoxA4Cre to RosaLacZ/LacZ reporter mice, we confirmed that the HoxA4Cre allele predominantly targets neurons caudal to the rhombomere 6/7 boundary, sparing anterior structures such as the RTN (Figures 2A–2G). Mice carrying HoxA4Cre and Atoh1-LacZ (an Atoh1 null allele that traces Atoh1-expressing cells with LacZ, HoxA4Cre; Atoh1LacZ/+) were crossed with Atoh1flox/flox mice to delete Atoh1 caudal to the rhombomere 6/7 boundary (Atoh1HoxA4CKO: HoxA4Cre; Atoh1flox/LacZ). Fate mapping using X-gal staining confirmed that Atoh1 neurons of the posterior extramural stream, such as the LRt and external cuneate (ECu) nuclei, as well as radially migrating populations are ablated in Atoh1HoxA4CKO brainstems (Figures 2H and 2I). Because no conditional mutants showed lethality (0/25) at birth, and only three died at P1, we conclude that the caudally derived Atoh1 lineages play a minor role in neonatal survival. The RTN neurons transiently express Atoh1 (E12.0-P0) and are localized within the HoxB1 domain (Dubreuil et al., 2009Dubreuil V. Thoby-Brisson M. Rallu M. Persson K. Pattyn A. Birchmeier C.

To determine whether Atoh1 expression is cell-autonomously required for their proper migration and to evaluate the physiological role of postmitotic Atoh1 expression in vivo, we removed Atoh1 from the Phox2b-derived paramotor neurons using Phox2bCre transgenic mice (Rossi et al., 2011Rossi J. Balthasar N. Olson D. Scott M. Berglund E. Lee C.E. Choi M.J. Lauzon D. Lowell B.B. Elmquist J.K.

Cre expression in Phox2bCre; RosaEYFP/+ mice showed more than 98% colocalization (quantified from three embryos) among EYFP, Phox2b, and Lbx1 in the RTN neurons (yellow arrowheads, Figure 3A), confirming correct expression of Cre. Interestingly, the two groups of paramotor neurons displayed different requirements for Atoh1. Phox2bCre-mediated Atoh1 conditional knockout (Atoh1Phox2bCKO) did not affect RTN lineage identity (retained Phox2b and Lbx1 expression, Figure 3B), but it did disrupt their normal radial migratory path toward the ventral brainstem (white arrowheads) (Figure 3B). Moreover, the expression of RTN differentiation marker, neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), is lost without Atoh1 (Figure 3C), suggesting Atoh1 plays a cell-autonomous role in both RTN neuronal migration and differentiation. This phenotype is distinct from the induced expression of the alanine expanded Phox2b (Phox2b27Ala) either systematically or in rhombomeres 3/5 where the RTN neurons are eliminated (Ramanantsoa et al., 2011Ramanantsoa N. Hirsch M.R. Thoby-Brisson M. Dubreuil V. Bouvier J. Ruffault P.L. Matrot B. Fortin G. Brunet J.F. Gallego J. Goridis C. Breathing without CO(2) chemosensitivity in conditional Phox2b mutants.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 12880-12888Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The paratrigeminal (pTRI) neurons surrounding the trigeminal motor nucleus (nV) also express Atoh1, Phox2b, and Lbx1 (Figure S2A). They are also targeted by the Phox2bCre allele (Figure S2B) and showed Atoh1-independent lineage specification (Figure S2C). However, unlike the RTN neurons, the pTRI neurons do not require Atoh1 for proper localization, as shown by marker analyses (Figures S2D and S2E) and cell number quantification (Figure S2F) from serial sections. Phox2bCre-mediated conditional knockout do not affect RL-derived Atoh1 neurons, as mRNA in situ hybridization (Figure 4A) and fate mapping analyses (Figures 4B–4E) showed that Atoh1 expression and the development of RL populations are normal in the Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice. We conclude that Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice show a selective RTN mislocalization phenotype while the rest of the RL-derived Atoh1 populations remained unaffected. We monitored the birth of conditional mutants and discovered that although the birth rate of all genotypes conformed to Mendelian ratios, 43% (20/46) of Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice died within the first hour after birth; none of the other genotypes showed postnatal lethality. We were surprised to find erroneous RTN migration in surviving Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice, similar to the mice that died at P0 (Figures S3A–S3D), suggesting that loss of Atoh1 increases respiratory vulnerability specifically during the newborn period. To determine whether the RTN and caudal HoxA4-derived Atoh1 neurons affect newborn viability synergistically, we generated Phox2bCre; HoxA4Cre-mediated Atoh1 mutant animals, which showed neonatal lethality (52%, 9/17) not significantly different from that of Phox2bCre alone (two-tailed p value = 0.4477, Fisher’s exact test). Taken together, we conclude that Atoh1-mediated development of the RTN neurons is critical for neonatal respiratory fitness. To ascertain whether loss of Atoh1 in the RTN has a direct effect on the respiratory rhythm-generating networks right before birth, we recorded the inspiratory activity from the C4 root of E18.5 brainstem-spinal cord preparations. Interestingly, the baseline fictive respiratory frequency of the Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice was significantly slower than that of their WT littermates (Atoh1Phox2bCKO: 37.44% ± 2.48%, n = 5, versus WT: 100% ± 22.24%, n = 9, p < 0.05) (Figure 5A). To test the response of respiratory circuit to excitatory neuropeptides, we recorded the inspiratory activity of WT and Atoh1Phox2bCKO brainstems 5 min before and after 1 μM Substance P (SP) treatment (Figure 5B). The Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice show consistently depressed baseline motor activity when compared with WT (Atoh1Phox2bCKO: 23.45% ± 5.60%, n = 5, versus WT: 100% ± 34.61%, n = 6, ∗p < 0.05, paired t test). Interestingly, SP application significantly increased the motor activity of WT (174.71% ± 39.32%, compared with WT before SP, n = 6, ∗p < 0.05) but not Atoh1Phox2bCKO preparations (16.55% ± 5.60%, compared with WT before SP, n = 5, ∗p < 0.05). These data suggest that Atoh1 is important for the RTN neurons to modulate inspiratory frequency, and the RTN neurons are a critical component of the neonatal rhythmogenic network. The lifelong attenuated ventilatory response to hypercapnia is a major contributing factor to fatal apnea in CCHS patients. Such a chemosensory defect might be caused by functional impairments in Phox2b-dependent structures such as the carotid body and RTN neurons (Amiel et al., 2003Amiel J. Laudier B. Attié-Bitach T. Trang H. de Pontual L. Gener B. Trochet D. Etchevers H. Ray P.

USA. 2008; 105: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Carotid bodies are the peripheral chemoreceptors that sense the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide (pCO2), along with changes in pH. Although the cellular identities of central CO2 chemoreceptors remain elusive, it has been shown that the RTN neurons are activated by low pH and can increase ventilation upon sensing high pCO2 (Abbott et al., 2009Abbott S.B. Stornetta R.L. Fortuna M.G. Depuy S.D. West G.H. Harris T.E. Guyenet P.G.

The en bloc brainstem preparation responds to lower pH at early embryonic stages, allowing us to test the integrity of embryonic chemosensory network when the RTN is the only affected population. We first recorded inspiratory activities using E16.5 WT and Atoh1Phox2bCKO embryos under baseline pH (7.4), and then perfused the brainstems using artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) with a lower pH (7.2). The Atoh1Phox2bCKO embryos show a slower baseline behavior when compared with WT (Atoh1Phox2bCKO: 58.43% ± 2.24%, n = 11, versus WT: 100% ± 7.14%, n = 7, p < 0.001), consistent with a role for RTN in modulating embryonic inspiratory rhythmogenicity. Interestingly, both WT and Atoh1Phox2bCKO preparations are sensitive to lower pH (Atoh1Phox2bCKO: 227.32% ± 4.99% versus WT: 251.00% ± 5.31%, both compared to baseline WT, p < 0.001) (Figure 5C). These results indicate that the chemosensory circuits of the Atoh1Phox2bCKO embryos are still capable to detect pH change at early embryonic stage and is distinct from the effects of RTN deletion in the Egr-2 lineages by expressing Phox2b27Ala (Ramanantsoa et al., 2011Ramanantsoa N. Hirsch M.R. Thoby-Brisson M. Dubreuil V. Bouvier J. Ruffault P.L. Matrot B. Fortin G. Brunet J.F. Gallego J. Goridis C. Breathing without CO(2) chemosensitivity in conditional Phox2b mutants.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 12880-12888Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Normally, the RTN neurons are located at the marginal layer of ventral brainstem where blood vessels deliver CO2 signals (Lazarenko et al., 2009Lazarenko R.M. Milner T.A. Depuy S.D. Stornetta R.L. West G.H. Kievits J.A. Bayliss D.A. Guyenet P.G. Acid sensitivity and ultrastructure of the retrotrapezoid nucleus in Phox2b-EGFP transgenic mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 517: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine whether RTN mislocalization affects CO2 detection in free-moving adult animals, we utilized unrestrained whole body plethysmography to monitor the respiration of 3-month-old Atoh1Phox2bCKO survivor mice. The breathing parameters of Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice (n = 9) and their littermates (WT, n = 21) were indistinguishable at rest, but when challenged with hypercapnia (5% CO2), WT mice showed increased respiratory frequency (RF, 340.92 ± 3.79 min−1), tidal volume (VT, 13.73 ± 0.30 μl ⋅ g−1), and minute ventilation (VE, 4.68 ± 0.13 ml ⋅ min−1 ⋅ g−1) (Figure 6A). In contrast, the Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice showed a significantly attenuated response to hypercapnia, as reflected by modest increases in RF (286.45 ± 9.86 min−1), VT (10.10 ± 0.45 μl ⋅ g−1), and VE (2.97 ± 0.19 ml ⋅ min−1 ⋅ g−1) (Figure 6A). The compromised hypercapnic response might be due to the inability of the RTN neurons to detect changes in pCO2 and trigger respiration owing to their failed migration. At the same time, the partially p"
https://openalex.org/W2134587379,"The claustrum has been described in the forebrain of all mammals studied so far. It has been suggested that the claustrum plays a role in the integration of multisensory information: however, its detailed structure and function remain enigmatic. The human claustrum is a thin, irregular, sheet of grey matter located between the inner surface of the insular cortex and the outer surface of the putamen. Recently, the G-protein gamma2 subunit (Gng2) was proposed as a specific claustrum marker in the rat, and used to better delineate its anatomical boundaries and connections. Additional claustral markers proposed in mammals include Netrin-G2 in the monkey and latexin in the cat. Here we report the expression and distribution of Gng2 and Netrin-G2 in human post-mortem samples of the claustrum and adjacent structures. Gng2 immunoreactivity was detected in the neuropil of the claustrum and of the insular cortex but not in the putamen. A faint labelling was present also in the external and extreme capsules. Double-labelling experiments indicate that Gng2 is also expressed in glial cells. Netrin-G2 labelling was seen in neuronal cell bodies throughout the claustrum and the insular cortex but not in the medially adjacent putamen. No latexin immunoreactive element was detected in the claustrum or adjacent structures. Our results confirm that both the Gng2 and the Netrin-G2 proteins show an affinity to the claustrum and related formations also in the human brain. The presence of Gng2 and Netrin-G2 immunoreactive elements in the insular cortex, but not in the putamen, suggests a possible common ontogeny of the claustrum and insula."
https://openalex.org/W2139031268,"Background Critically ill patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza are often treated in intensive care units (ICUs), representing significant risk of nosocomial transmission to critical care clinicians and other patients. Despite a large body of literature and guidelines recommending infection control practices, numerous barriers have been identified in ICUs, leading to poor compliance to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The use of PPE among critical care clinicians has not been extensively evaluated, especially during the pandemic influenza. This study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors, and barriers to compliance with the use of PPE among ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) during the pandemic influenza. Methodology/Principal Findings A survey instrument consisting of 36 questions was developed and mailed to all HCWs in 21 ICUs in 17 provinces in China. A total of 733 physicians, nurses, and other professionals were surveyed, and 650 (88.7%) were included in the analysis. Fifty-six percent of respondents reported having received training program of pandemic influenza before they cared for H1N1 patients, while 77% reported to have adequate knowledge of self and patient protection. Only 18% of respondents were able to correctly identify all components of PPE, and 55% reported high compliance (>80%) with PPE use during patient care. In multivariate analysis, vaccination for 2009 H1N1 influenza, positive attitudes towards PPE use, organizational factors such as availability of PPE in ICU, and patient information of influenza precautions, as well as reprimand for noncompliance by the supervisors were associated with high compliance, whereas negative attitudes towards PPE use and violation of PPE use were independent predictors of low compliance. Conclusion/Significance Knowledge and self-reported compliance to recommended PPE use among Chinese critical care clinicians is suboptimal. The perceived barriers should be addressed in order to close the significant gap between perception and knowledge or behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2024880135,"Genes encoding proteins involved in sperm-egg interaction and fertilization exhibit a particularly fast evolution and may participate in prezygotic species isolation [1], [2]. Some of them (ZP3, ADAM1, ADAM2, ACR and CD9) have individually been shown to evolve under positive selection [3], [4], suggesting a role of positive Darwinian selection on sperm-egg interaction. However, the genes involved in this biological function have not been systematically and exhaustively studied with an evolutionary perspective, in particular across vertebrates with internal and external fertilization. Here we show that 33 genes among the 69 that have been experimentally shown to be involved in fertilization in at least one taxon in vertebrates are under positive selection. Moreover, we identified 17 pseudogenes and 39 genes that have at least one duplicate in one species. For 15 genes, we found neither positive selection, nor gene copies or pseudogenes. Genes of teleosts, especially genes involved in sperm-oolemma fusion, appear to be more frequently under positive selection than genes of birds and eutherians. In contrast, pseudogenization, gene loss and gene gain are more frequent in eutherians. Thus, each of the 19 studied vertebrate species exhibits a unique signature characterized by gene gain and loss, as well as position of amino acids under positive selection. Reflecting these clade-specific signatures, teleosts and eutherian mammals are recovered as clades in a parsimony analysis. Interestingly the same analysis places Xenopus apart from teleosts, with which it shares the primitive external fertilization, and locates it along with amniotes (which share internal fertilization), suggesting that external or internal environmental conditions of germ cell interaction may not be the unique factors that drive the evolution of fertilization genes. Our work should improve our understanding of the fertilization process and on the establishment of reproductive barriers, for example by offering new leads for experiments on genes identified as positively selected."
https://openalex.org/W2060093633,"The neurotransmitter glutamate mediates excitatory synaptic transmission by gating ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). AMPA receptors (AMPARs), a subtype of iGluR, are strongly implicated in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We previously discovered two classes of AMPAR auxiliary proteins in C. elegans that modify receptor kinetics and thus change synaptic transmission. Here, we have identified another auxiliary protein, SOL-2, a CUB-domain protein that associates with both the related auxiliary subunit SOL-1 and with the GLR-1 AMPAR. In sol-2 mutants, behaviors dependent on glutamatergic transmission are disrupted, GLR-1-mediated currents are diminished, and GLR-1 desensitization and pharmacology are modified. Remarkably, a secreted variant of SOL-1 delivered in trans can rescue sol-1 mutants, and this rescue depends on in cis expression of SOL-2. Finally, we demonstrate that SOL-1 and SOL-2 have an ongoing role in the adult nervous system to control AMPAR-mediated currents."
https://openalex.org/W2026933161,"Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) facilitate the membrane transport of water and other small molecules across the plant vacuolar membrane, and members of this family are expressed in specific developmental stages and tissue types. Delivery of TIP proteins to the tonoplast is thought to occur by vesicle–mediated traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the vacuole, and at least two pathways have been proposed, one that is Golgi-dependent and another that is Golgi-independent. However, the mechanisms for trafficking of vacuolar membrane proteins to the tonoplast remain poorly understood. Here we describe a chemical genetic approach to unravel the mechanisms of TIP protein targeting to the vacuole in Arabidopsis seedlings. We show that members of the TIP family are targeted to the vacuole via at least two distinct pathways, and we characterize the bioactivity of a novel inhibitor that can differentiate between them. We demonstrate that, unlike for TIP1;1, trafficking of markers for TIP3;1 and TIP2;1 is insensitive to Brefeldin A in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. Using a chemical inhibitor that may target this BFA-insensitive pathway for membrane proteins, we show that inhibition of this pathway results in impaired root hair growth and enhanced vacuolar targeting of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 in the dark. Our results indicate that the vacuolar targeting of PIN2 and the BFA-insensitive pathway for tonoplast proteins may be mediated in part by common mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1983167900,"Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 is one of the most frequent genetic alterations in many solid tumors including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), suggesting the existence of one or more tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) within the frequently deleted region. A putative TSG RBMS3 (RNA binding motif, single stranded interacting protein 3), located at 3p24-p23, has been identified in our previous study. Here, we reported that downregulation of RBMS3 was detected in 3/3 NPC cell lines and 13/15 (86.7%) primary NPC tissues. Functional studies using both overexpression and suppression systems demonstrated that RBMS3 has a strong tumor suppressive role in NPC. The tumor suppressive mechanism of RBMS3 was associated with its role in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint by upregulating p53 and p21, downregulating cyclin E and CDK2, and the subsequent inhibition of Rb-ser780. Further analysis demonstrated that RBMS3 had a pro-apoptotic role in a mitochondrial-dependent manner via activation of caspase-9 and PARP. Finally, RBMS3 inhibited microvessel formation, which may be mediated by down-regulation of MMP2 and β-catenin and inactivation of its downstream targets, including cyclin-D1, c-Myc, MMP7, and MMP9. Taken together, our findings define a function for RBMS3 as an important tumor suppressor gene in NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2144702245,"Background To investigate the epidemiology of a steep decrease in the incidence of suicide deaths in Australia. Methods National data on suicide deaths and deliberate self-harm for the period 1994–2007 were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. We calculated attempt and death rates for five major methods and the lethality of these methods. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the size and significance of method-specific time-trends in attempts and lethality. Results Hanging, motor vehicle exhaust and firearms were the most lethal methods, and together accounted for 72% of all deaths. The lethality of motor vehicle exhaust attempts decreased sharply (RR = 0.94 per year, 95% CI 0.93–0.95) while the motor vehicle exhaust attempt rate changed little; this combination of motor vehicle exhaust trends explained nearly half of the overall decline in suicide deaths. Hanging lethality also decreased sharply (RR = 0.96 per year, 95% CI 0.956–0.965) but large increases in hanging attempts negated the effect on death rates. Firearm lethality changed little while attempts decreased. Conclusion Declines in the lethality of suicide attempts–especially attempts by motor vehicle exhaust and hanging–explain the remarkable decline in deaths by suicide in Australia since 1997."

The eyes of DBA/2J mice show severe age-related changes that finally lead to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve. Recent electroretinogram studies identified functional deficits, which suggest that also photoreceptor cells are involved in the pathological processes occurring in the DBA/2J mouse retina. In a comparative study, we examined anatomical and molecular changes in the retinae of DBA/2J and C57BL/6 control mice with light and electron microscopy and with PCR analyses. In the retina of the DBA/2J mouse, we found a thinning of the outer plexiform layer, the first synaptic layer in the transfer of visual signals, and age-dependent and progressive degenerative structural changes at rod photoreceptor ribbon synapses. The structural ribbon changes represent a photoreceptor synaptic phenotype that has not yet been described in this animal model of secondary angle-closure glaucoma. Furthermore, genes of the classical complement cascade were upregulated in the photoreceptor cells of aging DBA/2J mice, suggesting a putative link between ribbon synapse degradation and the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2043633681,"The cyp19a1 gene that encodes aromatase, the only enzyme permitting conversion of C19 aromatizable androgens into estrogens, is present as a single copy in the genome of most vertebrate species, except in teleosts in which it has been duplicated. This study aimed at investigating the brain expression of a cyp19a1 gene expressed in both gonad and brain of Japanese eel, a basal teleost. By means of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we show that cyp19a1 is expressed only in radial glial cells of the brain and in pituitary cells. Treatments with salmon pituitary homogenates (female) or human chorionic gonadotrophin (male), known to turn on steroid production in immature eels, strongly stimulated cyp19a1 messenger and protein expression in radial glial cells and pituitary cells. Using double staining studies, we also showed that aromatase-expressing radial glial cells exhibit proliferative activity in both the brain and the pituitary. Altogether, these data indicate that brain and pituitary expression of Japanese eel cyp19a1 exhibits characteristics similar to those reported for the brain specific cyp19a1b gene in teleosts having duplicated cyp19a1 genes. This supports the hypothesis that, despite the fact that eels also underwent the teleost specific genome duplication, they have a single cyp19a1 expressed in both brain and gonad. Such data also suggest that the intriguing features of brain aromatase expression in teleost fishes were not gained after the whole genome duplication and may reflect properties of the cyp19a1 gene of ancestral Actinopterygians."
https://openalex.org/W2092081553,"Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit platelet activation. Endothelin is known to be the most potent endogenous growth promoting and vasoactive peptide. In patients and animal models with stroke, the level of circulating endothelin increases and complicates the recovery progress contributed by vascular constriction (an immediate pathology) and vascular proliferation (a long-term pathology). However, the effects of cilostazol on endothelin have not been explored. To demonstrate the dual-antagonizing effects of cilostazol on vasoconstriction and cell proliferation induced by endothelin, we used primary culture of mouse vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, mouse femoral artery ex vivo, and intracranial basilar artery ex vivo. We show that the dual-inhibition effects of cilostazol are mediated by blocking endothelin-induced extracellular calcium influx. Although cilostazol does not inhibit endothelin-induced intraorganellar calcium release, blockade of extracellular calcium influx is sufficient to blunt endothelin-induced vasoconstriction. We also show that cilostazol inhibits endothelin-induced cellular proliferation by blocking extracellular calcium influx. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can block anti-proliferation activity of cilostazol, confirming the downstream role of PKA in cellular proliferation. To further demonstrate the selectivity of the dual-antagonizing effects of cilostazol, we used a different phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Interestingly, sildenafil inhibits endothelin-induced vasoconstriction but not cellular proliferation in smooth muscle cells. For the first time, we show selective dual-antagonizing effects of cilostazol on endothelin. We propose that cilostazol is an excellent candidate to treat endothelin-associated diseases, such as stroke."

Despite the wide array of information available in various vertebrates and one invertebrate the tunicate, their evolutionary origins remain unresolved. Through searches of genome databases and molecular cloning techniques, the first lamprey VIP/PACAP ligands and VPAC receptors are identified from the Japanese lamprey. In addition, two VPAC receptors (VPACa/b) are identified from inshore hagfish and ligands predicted for sea lamprey. Phylogenetic analyses group these molecules into their respective PHI/VIP, PRP/PACAP and VPAC receptor families and show they resemble ancestral forms. Japanese lamprey VIP/PACAP peptides synthesized were tested with the hagfish VPAC receptors. hfVPACa transduces signal via both adenylyl cylase and phospholipase C pathways, whilst hfVPACb was only able to transduce through the calcium pathway. In contrast to the widespread distribution of VIP/PACAP ligands and receptors in many species, the agnathan PACAP and VPAC receptors were found almost exclusively in the brain. In situ hybridisation further showed their abundance throughout the brain. The range of VIP/PACAP ligands and receptors found are highly useful, providing a glimpse into the evolutionary events both at the structural and functional levels. Though representative of ancestral forms, the VIP/PACAP ligands in particular have retained high sequence conservation indicating the importance of their functions even early in vertebrate evolution. During these nascent stages, only two VPAC receptors are likely responsible for eliciting functions before evolving later into specific subtypes post-Agnatha. We also propose VIP and PACAP's first functions to predominate in the brain, evolving alongside the central nervous system, subsequently establishing peripheral functions."
https://openalex.org/W2134118778,"Signalling through post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins is a process central to cell homeostasis, development and responses to external stimuli. The best characterised PTM is protein phosphorylation which is reversibly catalysed at specific residues through the action of protein kinases (addition) and phosphatases (removal). Here, we report characterisation of an orphan protein phosphatase that possesses a domain architecture previously only described in Plantae. Through gene disruption and the production of active site mutants, the enzymatically active Protein Phosphatase containing Kelch-Like domains (PPKL, PBANKA_132950) is shown to play an essential role in the development of an infectious ookinete. PPKL is produced in schizonts and female gametocytes, is maternally inherited where its absence leads to the development of a malformed, immotile, non-infectious ookinete with an extended apical protrusion. The distribution of PPKL includes focussed localization at the ookinete apical tip implying a link between its activity and the correct deployment of the apical complex and microtubule cytoskeleton. Unlike wild type parasites, ppkl– ookinetes do not have a pronounced apical distribution of their micronemes yet secretion of microneme cargo is unaffected in the mutant implying that release of microneme cargo is either highly efficient at the malformed apical prominence or secretion may also occur from other points of the parasite, possibly the pellicular pores."
https://openalex.org/W1963746734,"Background The association between obesity and dementia risk remains debatable and no studies have assessed this association among diabetic patients. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and dementia risk among middle and low income diabetic patients. Methodology/Principal Findings The sample included 44,660 diabetic patients (19,618 white and 25,042 African American) 30 to 96 years of age without a history of dementia in the Louisiana State University Hospital-Based Longitudinal Study. During a mean follow-up period of 3.9 years, 388 subjects developed incident dementia. The age- and sex-adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) for incident dementia at different levels of BMI (≤25, 25–26.9, 27–29.9, 30–34.9, and ≥35 kg/m2) were 1.00, 0.53 (95% CI 0.34–0.83), 0.29 (0.18–0.45), 0.37 (0.25–0.56), and 0.31 (0.21–0.48) (Ptrend<0.001) in white diabetic patients, and 1.00, 1.00 (95% CI 0.62–1.63), 0.62 (0.39–0.98), 0.56 (0.36–0.86), and 0.65 (0.43–1.01) (Ptrend = 0.029) in African American diabetic patients. Further adjustment for other confounding factors affected the results only slightly. There was a significant interaction between race and BMI on dementia risk (χ2 = 5.52, 1df, p<0.025), such that the association was stronger in white patients. In stratified analyses, the multivariate-adjusted inverse association between BMI and risk of dementia was present in subjects aged 55–64 years, 65–74 years, and ≥75 years, in men and women, in non-smokers and smokers, and in subjects with different types of health insurance. Conclusions/Significance Higher baseline BMI was associated with a lower risk of dementia among diabetic patients, and this association was stronger among white than among African American diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2002892304,"The cerebellum is thought to implement internal models for sensory prediction, but details of the underlying circuitry are currently obscure. We therefore investigated a specific example of internal-model based sensory prediction, namely detection of whisker contacts during whisking. Inputs from the vibrissae in rats can be affected by signals generated by whisker movement, a phenomenon also observable in whisking robots. Robot novelty-detection can be improved by adaptive noise-cancellation, in which an adaptive filter learns a forward model of the whisker plant that allows the sensory effects of whisking to be predicted and thus subtracted from the noisy sensory input. However, the forward model only uses information from an efference copy of the whisking commands. Here we show that the addition of sensory information from the whiskers allows the adaptive filter to learn a more complex internal model that performs more robustly than the forward model, particularly when the whisking-induced interference has a periodic structure. We then propose a neural equivalent of the circuitry required for adaptive novelty-detection in the robot, in which the role of the adaptive filter is carried out by the cerebellum, with the comparison of its output (an estimate of the self-induced interference) and the original vibrissal signal occurring in the superior colliculus, a structure noted for its central role in novelty detection. This proposal makes a specific prediction concerning the whisker-related functions of a region in cerebellar cortical zone A2 that in rats receives climbing fibre input from the superior colliculus (via the inferior olive). This region has not been observed in non-whisking animals such as cats and primates, and its functional role in vibrissal processing has hitherto remained mysterious. Further investigation of this system may throw light on how cerebellar-based internal models could be used in broader sensory, motor and cognitive contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2029801592,"Models of indirect (genetic) benefits sexual selection predict linkage disequilibria between genes that influence male traits and female preferences, owing to non-random mate choice or physical linkage. Such linkage disequilibria can accelerate the evolution of traits and preferences to exaggerated levels. Both theory and recent empirical findings on species recognition suggest that such linkage disequilibria may result from physical linkage or pleiotropy, but very little work has addressed this possibility within the context of sexual selection. We studied the genetic architecture of sexually selected traits by analyzing signals and preferences in an acoustic moth, Achroia grisella, in which males attract females with a train of ultrasound pulses and females prefer loud songs and a fast pulse rhythm. Both male signal characters and female preferences are repeatable and heritable traits. Moreover, female choice is based largely on male song, while males do not appear to provide direct benefits at mating. Thus, some genetic correlation between song and preference traits is expected. We employed a standard crossing design between inbred lines and used AFLP markers to build a linkage map for this species and locate quantitative trait loci (QTL) that influence male song and female preference. Our analyses mostly revealed QTLs of moderate strength that influence various male signal and female receiver traits, but one QTL was found that exerts a major influence on the pulse-pair rate of male song, a critical trait in female attraction. However, we found no evidence of specific co-localization of QTLs influencing male signal and female receiver traits on the same linkage groups. This finding suggests that the sexual selection process would proceed at a modest rate in A. grisella and that evolution toward exaggerated character states may be tempered. We suggest that this equilibrium state may be more the norm than the exception among animal species."
https://openalex.org/W2017891869,"We argue that objective fidelity evaluation of virtual environments, such as flight simulation, should be human-performance-centred and task-specific rather than measure the match between simulation and physical reality. We show how principled experimental paradigms and behavioural models to quantify human performance in simulated environments that have emerged from research in multisensory perception provide a framework for the objective evaluation of the contribution of individual cues to human performance measures of fidelity. We present three examples in a flight simulation environment as a case study: Experiment 1: Detection and categorisation of auditory and kinematic motion cues; Experiment 2: Performance evaluation in a target-tracking task; Experiment 3: Transferrable learning of auditory motion cues. We show how the contribution of individual cues to human performance can be robustly evaluated for each task and that the contribution is highly task dependent. The same auditory cues that can be discriminated and are optimally integrated in experiment 1, do not contribute to target-tracking performance in an in-flight refuelling simulation without training, experiment 2. In experiment 3, however, we demonstrate that the auditory cue leads to significant, transferrable, performance improvements with training. We conclude that objective fidelity evaluation requires a task-specific analysis of the contribution of individual cues."
https://openalex.org/W1970087877,"It is well known that damage to the peripheral auditory system causes deficits in tone detection as well as pitch and loudness perception across a wide range of frequencies. However, the extent to which to which the auditory cortex plays a critical role in these basic aspects of spectral processing, especially with regard to speech, music, and environmental sound perception, remains unclear. Recent experiments indicate that primary auditory cortex is necessary for the normally-high perceptual acuity exhibited by humans in pure-tone frequency discrimination. The present study assessed whether the auditory cortex plays a similar role in the intensity domain and contrasted its contribution to sensory versus discriminative aspects of intensity processing. We measured intensity thresholds for pure-tone detection and pure-tone loudness discrimination in a population of healthy adults and a middle-aged man with complete or near-complete lesions of the auditory cortex bilaterally. Detection thresholds in his left and right ears were 16 and 7 dB HL, respectively, within clinically-defined normal limits. In contrast, the intensity threshold for monaural loudness discrimination at 1 kHz was 6.5 ± 2.1 dB in the left ear and 6.5 ± 1.9 dB in the right ear at 40 dB sensation level, well above the means of the control population (left ear: 1.6 ± 0.22 dB; right ear: 1.7 ± 0.19 dB). The results indicate that auditory cortex lowers just-noticeable differences for loudness discrimination by approximately 5 dB but is not necessary for tone detection in quiet. Previous human and Old-world monkey experiments employing lesion-effect, neurophysiology, and neuroimaging methods to investigate the role of auditory cortex in intensity processing are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2166389509,"Oscillatory patterns of activity in various frequency ranges are ubiquitously expressed in cortical circuits. While recent studies in humans emphasized rhythmic modulations of neuronal oscillations (""second-order"" rhythms), their potential involvement in information coding remains an open question. Here, we show that a rhythmic (~0.7 Hz) modulation of hippocampal theta power, unraveled by second-order spectral analysis, supports encoding of spatial and behavioral information. The phase preference of neuronal discharge within this slow rhythm significantly increases the amount of information carried by action potentials in various motor/cognitive behaviors by (1) distinguishing between the spikes fired within versus outside the place field of hippocampal place cells, (2) disambiguating place firing of neurons having multiple place fields, and (3) predicting between alternative future spatial trajectories. This finding demonstrates the relevance of second-order spectral components of brain rhythms for decoding neuronal information."
https://openalex.org/W2000374424,"Increasing evidence indicates that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with the morbidity of cancer. However, whether different dialysis modality and sex effect modify the cancer risks in ESRD patients remains unclear. A total of 3,570 newly diagnosed ESRD patients and 14,280 controls matched for age, sex, index month, and index year were recruited from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The ESRD status was ascertained from the registry of catastrophic illness patients. The incidence of cancer was identified through cross-referencing with the National Cancer Registry System. The Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan–Meier method were used for analyses. A similar twofold increase in cancer risk was observed among ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) after adjusting for other potential risk factors. Patients with the highest cancer risk, approximately fourfold increased risk, were those received renal transplants. Urothelial carcinoma (UC) had the highest incidence in HD and PD patients. However, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) had the highest incidence in the renal transplantation (RT) group. In addition, female patients undergoing RT or PD had a higher incidence of RCC and UC, respectively. Male patients under HD had both higher incidence of RCC and UC. In conclusion, different dialysis modality could modify the cancer risks in ESRD patients. We also found sex effect on genitourinary malignancy when they are under different dialysis modality."
https://openalex.org/W2009801438,"Adult neurogenesis is restricted to specific brain regions. Although involved in the continuous supply of interneurons for the olfactory function, the role of neural precursors in brain damage-repair remains an open question. Aiming to in vivo identify endogenous neural precursor cells migrating towards a brain damage site, the monoclonal antibody Nilo2 recognizing cell surface antigens on neuroblasts, was coupled to magnetic glyconanoparticles (mGNPs). The Nilo2-mGNP complexes allowed, by magnetic resonance imaging in living animals, the in vivo identification of endogenous neural precursors at their niche, as well as their migration to a lesion site (induced brain tumor), which was fast (within hours) and orderly. Interestingly, the rapid migration of neuroblasts towards a damage site is a characteristic that might be exploited to precisely localize early damage events in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, it might facilitate the study of regenerative mechanisms through the activation of endogenous neural cell precursors. A similar approach, combining magnetic glyconanoparticles linked to appropriate antibodies could be applied to flag other small cell subpopulations within the organism, track their migration, localize stem cell niches, cancer stem cells or even track metastatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010787033,"Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), an ethanol-inducible enzyme, has been shown to metabolically activate various carcinogens, which is critical for the development and progression of cancers. It has demonstrated that CYP2E1 polymorphisms alter the transcriptional activity of the gene. However, studies on the association between CYP2E1 polymorphisms (PstI/RsaI or DraI) and gastric cancer have reported conflicting results. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether CYP2E1 polymorphisms is associated with the development and progression of gastric cancer and its prognosis in Chinese patients.A case-control study was conducted in which CYP2E1 PstI/RsaI and DraI polymorphisms were analyzed in 510 Chinese patients with gastric cancer and 510 age- and sex- matched healthy controls by PCR-RFLP. Odds ratios were estimated by multivariate logistic regression, and the lifetime was calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. In addition, a meta-analysis was also conducted to verify the findings.For CYP2E1 PstI/RsaI polymorphism, C2C2 homozygotes (OR = 2.15; CI: 1.18-3.94) and C2 carriers (OR = 1.48; CI: 1.13-1.96) were associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer when compared with C1C1 homozygotes. Both C1C2 and C2C2 genotypes were associated with advanced stage, but not the grade of gastric cancer. Moreover, C2C2 genotype was identified as an independent marker of poor overall survival for gastric cancer. However, there was not any significant association between CYP2E1 DraI polymorphism and the risk of gastric cancer. In the meta-analysis, pooled data from 13 studies confirmed that the CYP2E1 PstI/RsaI polymorphism was associated with a significantly increased risk of gastric cancer.CYP2E1 PstI/RsaI polymorphism is associated with increased risk of development, progression and poor prognosis of gastric cancer in Chinese patients. Pooled data from 13 studies, mainly in Asian countries, are in agreement with our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2076578786,"There have been few studies on children hospitalized with influenza published from mainland China. We performed a retrospective review of medical charts to describe the epidemiology, clinical features and direct medical cost of laboratory-proven influenza hospitalized children in Suzhou, China.Retrospective study on children with documented influenza infection hospitalized at Suzhou Children Hospital during 2005-2009 was conducted using a structured chart review instrument.A total of 480 children were positive by immuno-fluorescent assay for influenza during 2005-2009. The hospitalizations for influenza occurred in 8-12 months of the year, most commonly in the winter with a second late summer peak (August-September). Influenza A accounted for 86.3%, and of these 286 (59.6%) were male, and 87.2% were <5 years of age. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days. Fever was the most common symptom, occurring in 398 (82.9%) children. There were 394 (82.1%) children with pneumonia and 70.2% of these hospitalized children had radiographic evidence of a pulmonary infiltrate. One hundred and twelve children (23.3%) required oxygen treatments and 13 (2.7%) were transferred to the ICU. Multivariable logistic regression showed that compared with the ≤ 6 months children, those aged >60 months old had shorter hospital stay (OR = 0.45); children with oxygen treatment tended to have longer hospital stays than those without oxygen treatment (OR = 2.14). The mean cost of each influenza-related hospitalization was US$ 624 (US$ 1323 for children referred to ICU and US$ 617 for those cared for on the wards). High risk children had higher total cost than low-risk patients.Compared to other countries, in Suzhou, children hospitalized with influenza have longer hospital stay and higher percentage of pneumonia. The direct medical cost is high relative to family income. Effective strategies of influenza immunization of young children in China may be beneficial in addressing this disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W2072525545,"In three studies, EEGs from three groups of participants were recorded during progressively more real world situations after drinking alcoholic beverages that brought breath alcohol contents near the limit for driving in California 30 minutes after drinking. A simple equation that measured neurophysiological effects of alcohol in the first group of 15 participants performing repetitive cognitive tasks was applied to a second group of 15 operating an automobile driving simulator, and to a third group of 10 ambulatory people recorded simultaneously during a cocktail party. The equation derived from the first group quantified alcohol’s effect by combining measures of higher frequency (beta) and lower frequency (theta) power into a single score. It produced an Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve of .73 (p<.05; 67% sensitivity in recognizing alcohol and 87% specificity in recognizing placebo). Applying the same equation to the second group operating the driving simulator, AUC was .95, (p<.0001; 93% sensitivity and 73% specificity), while for the cocktail party group AUC was .87 (p<.01; 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity). EEG scores were significantly related to breath alcohol content in all studies. Some individuals differed markedly from the overall response evident in their respective groups. The feasibility of measuring the neurophysiological effect of a psychoactive substance from an entire group of ambulatory people at a cocktail party suggests that future studies may be able to fruitfully apply brain function measures derived under rigorously controlled laboratory conditions to assess drug effects on groups of people interacting in real world situations."
https://openalex.org/W1994186739,"Theoretical models aimed at explaining the evolution of honest, informative begging signals employed by nestling birds to solicit food from their parents, require that dishonest signalers incur a net viability cost in order to prevent runaway escalation of signal intensity over evolutionary time. Previous attempts to determine such a cost empirically have identified two candidate physiological costs associated with exaggerated begging: a growth and an immunological cost. However, they failed to take into account the fact that those costs are potentially offset by the fact that nestlings that invest more in begging are also likely to obtain more food. In this study, we test experimentally whether a 25% increase in ingested food compensates for growth and immunological costs of extra begging in southern shrike (Lanius meridionalis) nestlings. Three nestmates matched by size were given three treatments: low begging, high begging-same food intake, and high begging-extra food intake. We found that, while a higher food intake did effectively compensate for the growth cost, it failed to compensate for the immunological cost, measured as T-cell mediated immune response against an innocuous mitogen. Thus, we show for the first time that escalated begging has an associated physiological net cost likely to affect nestling survival negatively."

Experiments were designed to gather point dose measurements to verify the Monte Carlo results using Gafchromic film, radiophotoluminescent glass dosimeter, solid water, bone, and lung phantom. The results for radial dose functions and anisotropy functions in solid water phantom were consistent with previously reported data (Williamson and Li). The radial dose functions in bone were affected more by depth than those in water. Dose differences between homogeneous solid water phantoms and solid water-lung interfaces ranged from 0.6% to 14.4%. The range between homogeneous bone phantoms and bone-lung interfaces was 4.1% to 15.7%. These results support the understanding in dose distribution differences in water, bone, lung, and their interfaces. Our conclusion is that clinical parameters did not provide dose calculation accuracy for different materials, thus suggesting that dose calculation of HDR treatment planning systems should take into account material density to improve overall treatment quality."
https://openalex.org/W2060319767,"Stimulating, and some blocking, antibodies to the TSH receptor (TSHR) have conformation-dependent epitopes reported to involve primarily the leucine rich repeat region of the ectodomain (LRD). However, successful crystallization of TSHR residues 22–260 has omitted important extracellular non-LRD residues including the hinge region which connects the TSHR ectodomain to the transmembrane domain and which is involved in ligand induced signal transduction. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to determine if TSHR antibodies (TSHR-Abs) have non-LRD binding sites outside the LRD. To obtain this information we employed the method of epitope protection in which we first protected TSHR residues 1–412 with intact TSHR antibodies and then enzymatically digested the unprotected residues. Those peptides remaining were subsequently delineated by mass spectrometry. Fourteen out of 23 of the reported stimulating monoclonal TSHR-Ab crystal contact residues were protected by this technique which may reflect the higher binding energies of certain residues detected in this approach. Comparing the protected epitopes of two stimulating TSHR-Abs we found both similarities and differences but both antibodies also contacted the hinge region and the amino terminus of the TSHR following the signal peptide and encompassing cysteine box 1 which has previously been shown to be important for TSH binding and activation. A monoclonal blocking TSHR antibody revealed a similar pattern of binding regions but the residues that it contacted on the LRD were again distinct. These data demonstrated that conformationally dependent TSHR-Abs had epitopes not confined to the LRDs but also incorporated epitopes not revealed in the available crystal structure. Furthermore, the data also indicated that in addition to overlapping contact regions within the LRD, there are unique epitope patterns for each of the antibodies which may contribute to their functional heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2166237040,"Background CD4+interferon (IFN)-γ+ T cell (Th1) and CD4+interleukin (IL)-4+ T cell (Th2) polarizations are crucial in the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, this hypothesis is largely based on animal experiments of Parent-into-F1 GVHD model. The causal relationship between kinetics of Th1, Th2 and associated cytokines and the clinical activity of GVHD in a real world situation remains unknown. Methodology Peripheral blood was collected every week prospectively from Day 0 to Day 210 (patients without GVHD) or Day 300 (patients with chronic GVHD) after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in consecutive 27 patients. The frequencies of Th1 and Th2 within CD4+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry and pplasma IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-4, and IL-10 were determined by ELISA. Principal Findings Kinetics of Th1, Th2 frequency, and the plasma IL-10 and IFN-γ more commonly coincided with, rather than predicted, the activity of GVHD. These markers are significantly higher when acute or chronic GVHD developed. The kinetics of IL-10 is especially correlated well with the activity of GVHD during clinical course of immunosuppressive treatment. For patients with hepatic GVHD, there is a positive correlation between plasma IL-10 levels and the severity of hepatic injury. The frequency of Th2 is also significant higher in acute GVHD and tends to be higher in chronic GVHD. Interestingly, there is a very good positive correlation between the frequency of Th1 and Th2 (r = 0.951, p<0.001). The plasma level of IL-4 and IL-12 are not associated with the activity of GVHD. Conclusions The frequency of Th1, Th2 within CD4+ T cells and plasma IL-10 and IFN-γ are good biomarkers of GVHD. Plasma IL-10 can also be used to monitor the therapeutic responsiveness. Furthermore, both Th1 and Th2 likely contribute to the pathogenesis of GVHD."

Laboratory mice housed in the Tokyo, located approximately 330 km south of this earthquake’s epicenter, displayed remarkable changes in a variety of behaviors and physiological measures. Although unusual pre-earthquake behaviors have been previously reported in laboratory animals, little is known about behavioral and physiological changes that occur after a great earthquake. In the present study, the effects of Tohoku earthquake on mice behavior were investigated. “Earthquake-experienced” mice displayed a marked increase in food consumption without gaining body weight in response to the earthquake. They also displayed enhanced anxiety, and in a formal fear memory task, showed significantly greater tone- and context-dependent conditioned freezing. Water maze performance of earthquake-experienced mice showed the quicker acquisition of the task, faster swim speed and longer swim distance than the naive mice. Serum corticosterone levels were elevated compared to the naive mice, indicating that the earthquake and aftershocks were stressful for the mice. These results demonstrate that great earthquakes strongly affect mouse behaviors and physiology. Although the effects of a variety of experimental manipulations on mouse behaviors in disease models or in models of higher cognitive functions have been extensively examined, researchers need to be aware how natural phenomena, such as earthquakes and perhaps other natural environmental factors, influence laboratory animal behaviors and physiology."

This study is designed to assess whether there is a significant correlation between abnormal ABI and echocariographic parameters in patients with CKD stages 3-5. A total of 684 pre-dialysis CKD patients were included in the study. The ABI was measured using an ABI-form device. Patients were classified into ABI <0.9, ≥ 0.9 to <1.3, and ≥ 1.3. Clinical and echocariographic parameters were compared and analyzed. Compared with patients with ABI of ≥ 0.9 to <1.3, the values of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were higher in patients with ABI <0.9 and ABI ≥ 1.3 (P ≤ 0.004). After the multivariate analysis, patients with ABI <0.9 (β = 0.099, P = 0.004) and ABI ≥ 1.3 (β = 0.143, P<0.001) were independently associated with increased LVMI. Besides, increased LVMI (odds ratio, 1.017; 95% confidence interval, 1.002 to 1.033; P = 0.031) was also significantly associated with ABI <0.9 or ABI ≥1.3. Our study in patients of CKD stages 3-5 demonstrated abnormally low and high ABIs were positively associated with LVMI. Future studies are required to determine whether increased LVMI is a causal intermediary between abnormal ABI and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2129352397,"Background Many epidemiological studies have linked small size at birth to adverse adult health outcomes but the relative influence of environmental exposures is less well established. Methods The authors investigated the impact of prenatal environmental exposure by comparing 2750 participants born before (1925–1929) and during (1930–1934) the Great Depression in Reykjavik, Iceland. Calendar year served as proxy for environmental effects. Anthropometric measurements at birth and school-age (8–13 years) were collected from national registries. Participants were medically examined as adults (33–65 years). Results Mean birth weight, adjusted for maternal age and parity, decreased by 97 g (95% confidence interval (CI): 39, 156) for men and 70 g (95% CI: 11, 129) for women from 1925 to 1934; growth at school-age was significantly reduced for participants growing during the Depression. As adults, women prenatally exposed to the Depression had higher body mass index (Δ0.6 kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.1), higher fasting blood glucose levels (Δ0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.23) and greater odds of being obese 1.43 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.02) compared to unexposed counterparts. Non-significant associations were observed in men. Conclusion Reduction in birth weight due to rapid shifts in the economic environment appears to have a modest but significant association with later obesity for women while male offspring appear to be less affected by these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2006559674,"Background Decreased epinephrine (EPI) is an important underlying factor of bronchoconstriction in asthma. Exogenous β2-adrenergic receptor agonist is one of the preferred options to treat asthma. We previously showed that this phenomenon involved adrenal medullary chromaffin cell (AMCC) transformation to a neuron phenotype. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. To further explore this, an asthmatic model with unilateral adrenalectomy was established in this study. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-two rats were randomly into four groups (n = 8 each) control rats (controls), unilateral adrenalectomy rats (surgery-control, s-control), asthmatic rats (asthma), unilateral adrenalectomy asthmatic rats (surgery-induced asthma, s-asthma). Asthmatic rats and s-asthmatic rats were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). The pathological changes in adrenal medulla tissues were observed under microscopy. EPI and its rate-limiting enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT), were measured. Peripherin, a type III intermediate filament protein, was also detected in each group. The asthmatic rats presented with decreased chromaffin granules and swollen mitochondria in AMCCs, and the s-asthmatic rats presented more serious pathological changes than those in asthmatic rats and s-control rats. The expressions of EPI and PNMT in asthmatic rats were significantly decreased, as compared with levels in controls (P<0.05), and a further decline was observed in s-asthmatic rats (P<0.05). The expression of peripherin was higher in the asthmatic rats than in the controls, and the highest level was found in the s-asthmatic rats (P<0.05). Conclusion/Significance Compared with asthmatic rats and s-control rats, the transformation tendency of AMCCs to neurons is more obvious in the s-asthmatic rats. Moreover, this phenotype alteration in the asthmatic rats is accompanied by reduced EPI and PNMT, and increased peripherin expression. This result provides further evidence to support the notion that phenotype alteration of AMCCs contributes to asthma pathogenesis."

Adaptive Tregs differentiated in vitro to express Foxp3 (iTregs) are gaining high interest as potential therapeutics for inflammatory conditions such as autoimmunity, allergy and transplant rejection. However, selective isolation of Foxp3+ iTregs with a stable phenotype still remains to be a problem, especially in the human setting. While screening for culture conditions to generate stable CD4+Foxp3+ iTregs from DEREG mice, with maximum suppressive activity, we observed an unexpected dichotomy of eGFP and Foxp3 expression which is not seen in ex vivo isolated cells from DEREG mice. Further characterization of eGFP+Foxp3− cells revealed relatively lower CD25 expression and a lack of suppressive activity in vitro. Similarly, eGFP− cells isolated from the same cultures were not suppressive despite of a broad CD25 expression reflecting mere T cell activation. In contrast, eGFP+Foxp3+ iTregs exhibited potent suppressive activity comparable to that of natural eGFP+Foxp3+ Tregs, emphasizing the importance of isolating Foxp3 expressing iTregs. Interestingly, the use of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 or Flt3L-driven BMDC resulted in considerable resolution of the observed dichotomy. In summary, we defined culture conditions for efficient generation of eGFP+Foxp3+ iTregs by use of DEREG mice. Isolation of functional Foxp3+ iTregs using DEREG mice can also be achieved under sub-optimal conditions based on the magnitude of surface CD25 expression, in synergy with transgene encoded eGFP. Besides, the reported phenomenon may be of general interest for exploring Foxp3 gene regulation, given that Foxp3 and eGFP expression are driven from distinct Foxp3 loci and because this dichotomy preferentially occurs only under defined in vitro conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2049122444,"Background The assembly of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is initiated when nerve and muscle first contact each other by filopodial processes which are thought to enable close interactions between the synaptic partners and facilitate synaptogenesis. We recently reported that embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons preferentially extended filopodia towards cocultured muscle cells and that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) produced by muscle activated neuronal FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) to induce filopodia and favor synaptogenesis. Intriguingly, in an earlier study we found that neurotrophins (NTs), a different set of target-derived factors that act through Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, promoted neuronal growth but hindered presynaptic differentiation and NMJ formation. Thus, here we investigated how bFGF- and NT-signals in neurons jointly elicit presynaptic changes during the earliest stages of NMJ development. Methodology/Principal Findings Whereas forced expression of wild-type TrkB in neurons reduced filopodial extension and triggered axonal outgrowth, expression of a mutant TrkB lacking the intracellular kinase domain enhanced filopodial growth and slowed axonal advance. Neurons overexpressing wild-type FGFR1 also displayed more filopodia than control neurons, in accord with our previous findings, and, notably, this elevation in filopodial density was suppressed when neurons were chronically treated from the beginning of the culture period with BDNF, the NT that specifically activates TrkB. Conversely, inhibition by BDNF of NMJ formation in nerve-muscle cocultures was partly reversed by the overexpression of bFGF in muscle. Conclusions Our results suggest that the balance between neuronal FGFR1- and TrkB-dependent filopodial assembly and axonal outgrowth regulates the establishment of incipient NMJs."
https://openalex.org/W2044083751,"We investigated how group members achieve collective decision-making, by considering individual intrinsic behavioural rules and behavioural mechanisms for maintaining social integration. Using a simulated burrow environment, we investigated the behavioural rules of coordinated workload for soil distribution in a eusocial mammal, the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber). We tested two predictions regarding a distinct role of the queen, a socially dominant individual in the caste system: the presence of a queen would increase the workload of other caste individuals, and the cues by a queen would affect the soil distribution. In experiment 1, we placed four individuals of various castes from the same colony into an experimental burrow. Workers exhibited the highest frequency of workload compared to other castes. The presence of a queen activated the workload by other individuals. Individuals showed a consistent workload in a particular direction so as to bias the soil distribution. These results suggest that individuals have a consensus on soil distribution and that the queen plays a distinct role. In experiment 2, we placed the odour of a queen in one of four cells and observed its effect on other individuals’ workload and soil distribution. Relative to other cells, individuals frequently dug in the queen cell so the amount of soil in the queen cell decreased. These results suggest that queen odour is an important cue in coordinated workload and soil distribution in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2055773288,"The degree of consistency with which groups of animals use the landscape is determined by a variety of ecological processes that influence their movements and patterns of habitat use. We developed a technique termed Distributional Consistency that uses survey data of unmarked individuals to quantify temporal consistency in their spatial distribution, while accounting for changes in population size. Distributional consistency is quantified by comparing the observed distribution patterns to all theoretically possible distribution patterns of observed individuals, leading to a proportional score between 0 and 1, reflecting increasingly consistent use of sites within a region. The technique can be applied to survey data for any taxa across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We suggest ways in which distributional consistency could provide inferences about the dispersal and habitat decisions of individuals, and the scales at which these decisions operate. Distributional consistency integrates spatial and temporal processes to quantify an important characteristic of different habitats and their use by populations, which in turn will be particularly useful in complimenting and interpreting other ecological measures such as population density and stability. The technique can be applied to many existing data sets to investigate and evaluate a range of important ecological questions using simple survey data."
