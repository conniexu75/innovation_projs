https://openalex.org/W2128401893,"Beta amyloid (Abeta), a peptide generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by neurons, is widely believed to underlie the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies indicate that this peptide can drive loss of surface AMPA and NMDA type glutamate receptors. We now show that Abeta employs signaling pathways of long-term depression (LTD) to drive endocytosis of synaptic AMPA receptors. Synaptic removal of AMPA receptors is necessary and sufficient to produce loss of dendritic spines and synaptic NMDA responses. Our studies indicate the central role played by AMPA receptor trafficking in Abeta-induced modification of synaptic structure and function."

A genome-wide linkage search followed by mutational analysis of the candidate gene SCN9A, which encodes hNav1.7, identified eight missense mutations in 11 families and 2 sporadic cases. Functional analysis in vitro of three of these mutant Nav1.7 channels revealed a reduction in fast inactivation, leading to persistent sodium current. Other mutations in SCN9A associated with more negative activation thresholds are known to cause primary erythermalgia (PE). Carbamazepine, a drug that is effective in PEPD, but not PE, showed selective block of persistent current associated with PEPD mutants, but did not affect the negative activation threshold of a PE mutant. PEPD and PE are allelic variants with distinct underlying biophysical mechanisms and represent a separate class of peripheral neuronal sodium channelopathy.

Inherited disorders of ion channels are now known to account for a wide spectrum of human diseases characterized by paroxysmal dysfunction of excitable tissues. Understanding the molecular basis of these disorders has provided remarkable insights into normal physiological mechanisms (Ashcroft, 2000Ashcroft F.M. Ion channels and disease.

Since this description, mutations in sodium channels have also been shown to cause epilepsy and inherited disorders of cardiac rhythm. Here we describe a study of the molecular basis of Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), previously known as familial rectal pain (Fertleman and Ferrie, 2006Fertleman C.R. Ferrie C.

Neurol. 1992; 32: 824-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that this condition may be underdiagnosed (Elmslie et al., 1996Elmslie F.V. Wilson J. Rossiter M.A. Familial rectal pain: is it under-diagnosed?.J. R. Soc. Med. 1996; 89: 290P-291PPubMed Google Scholar). The distinctive features of PEPD are paroxysmal episodes of burning pain in the rectal, ocular, and mandibular areas accompanied by autonomic manifestations such as skin flushing. The anti-epilepsy drug carbamazepine is effective in many patients. A genome-wide linkage search mapped the PEPD gene to a region of chromosome 2 encompassing SCN9A, which encodes the Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel. The expression pattern and function of this channel rendered SCN9A an excellent functional and positional candidate. Additionally, mutations in this channel were shown to underlie primary erythermalgia (PE) (Drenth et al., 2005Drenth J.P.H. te Morsche R.H.M. Guillet G. Taieb A. Kirby R.L. Jansen J.B.M.J.

Genet. 2004; 41: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), a disease associated with episodic burning pain, flushing of the extremities, inflammation, and swelling. Identification of a distinct repertoire of SCN9A mutations in PEPD, together with detailed functional analysis, suggest that these two disorders are allelic variants that are not only clinically but also mechanistically distinct, and that differences in the effect of the mutations on sodium channel activity account for the clear differences in the clinical phenotypes and in their differential responses to sodium channel-blocking drugs. We conducted a genome-wide linkage search in one large pedigree with PEPD, family 7 (Figure 1). We genotyped DNA from 13 affected and 13 unaffected family members using 455 microsatellite markers. The marker D2S2330 on chromosome 2q gave a LOD score of 4.99 at θ = 0. Haplotype analysis (Figure 1) identified critical recombinants at D2S142 and D2S335, defining a 16 cM critical region containing a cluster of sodium channel genes. One of these, SCN9A (Klugbauer et al., 1995Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Flockerzi V.H.F.

USA. 1997; 94: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), encoding the hNav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit, is expressed only in the peripheral nervous system, in both sympathetic neurons and the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (Sangameswaran et al., 1997Sangameswaran L. Fish L.M. Koch B.D. Rabert D.K. Delgado S.G. Ilnicka M. Jakeman L.B. Novakovic S. Wong K. Sze P. et al.A Novel Tetrodotoxin-sensitive, Voltage-gated Sodium Channel Expressed in Rat and Human Dorsal Root Ganglia.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14805-14809Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Nav1.7 mediates a tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive, fast-inactivating current and has a role in acute and inflammatory pain (Nassar et al., 2004Nassar M.A. Stirling L.C. Matthews E.A. Forlani G. Baker M.D. Dickinson A.H. Mandel G. Wood J.N. Nociceptor-specific gene deletion reveals a major role for Nav1.7 (PN1) in acute and inflammatory pain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12706-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated SCN9A as a positional and functional candidate. We designed intronic primers flanking the 26 exons of SCN9A to amplify genomic DNA from the probands of family 7 (individual IV:4, Figure 1), ten additional pedigrees (in family 15, only DNA from the proband's affected father was available), and two sporadic cases (families 8 and 9). We found a total of eight missense mutations in 8/13 families (Figure 2A) (See the Supplemental Data online for additional pedigrees and electropherograms). All patients are heterozygous for the respective mutations that cosegregated with the disorder in all affected members from whom DNA was available. In family 12, the proband is a compound heterozygote, having inherited R996C from his affected father, but also having a de novo mutation (V1298D). This individual is more severely affected than his father, indicating that R996C may represent a subtle mutation. Family 4, in which R996C is the only mutation, also appears to have a less severe phenotype not requiring medication. None of these mutations were present in 192 ethnically matched control chromosomes (data not shown). All represent nonconservative amino acid changes likely to have an effect on channel function. Moreover, 7/8 mutations alter amino acids that are conserved across other human voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunits as well as those from other species (Figure 2B). Two mutations (I1461T, F1462V) occur within the highly conserved IFM amino acid motif in the linker region between domains III and IV (Figure 2Biii). Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that this motif forms the inactivation gate and plays a pivotal role in fast inactivation (West et al., 1992West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang X. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. A cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues required for fast Na+ channel inactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Molecular analysis of the putative inactivation particle in the inactivation gate of brain type IIA Na+ channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The T1464I mutation changes a completely conserved threonine residue immediately adjacent to the IFM domain (Figure 2Biii), and substitutions at this residue have also previously been shown to disrupt inactivation by substantially altering the stability of the inactivated state (Kellenberger et al., 1997Kellenberger S. West J.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Molecular analysis of the putative inactivation particle in the inactivation gate of brain type IIA Na+ channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The residues V1298 and V1299 are also completely conserved (Figure 2Bii) and occur in the loop between domain III S4-S5, believed to interact with the domain III-IV inactivation motif (Smith and Goldin, 1997Smith M.R. Goldin A.L. Interaction between the sodium channel inactivation linker and domain III S4-S5.Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1885-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The effect of mutations in the S4-S5 linker in domain IV has previously been investigated in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (McPhee et al., 1998McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. A critical role for the S4-S5 intracellular loop in Domain IV of the sodium channel α-subunit in fast inactivation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The M1627K mutation alters a conserved methionine residue (Figure 2Biv) that may form part of the inactivation gate receptor, as previous mutagenesis studies in heart (Nav1.5) and skeletal muscle (Nav1.4) channels suggest a role in fast inactivation (Filatov et al., 1998Filatov G.N. Nguyen T.P. Kraner S.D. Barchi R.L. Inactivation and secondary structure in the D4/S4-5 region of the SkM1 sodium channel.J. Gen.

Role of an S4-S5 linker in sodium channel inactivation probed by mutagenesis and a peptide blocker.J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, the arginine at position 996 is not conserved (Figure 2Bi), although the substitution by cysteine is not a conservative one and may have a subtle effect on channel function. This would be consistent with the less severe nature of the phenotype in family 4 and in the father in family 12. The highly conserved nature of seven of the eight amino acids mutated in these patients supports a causative role in the disorder, and their location makes it likely that channel inactivation would be affected. Therefore, we investigated the electrophysiological properties of three of these mutations (I1461T, T1464I, M1627K) using cDNA constructs of hNav1.7 transfected into HEK293 cells (Figure 3). Wild-type hNaV1.7 expressed in HEK293 cells exhibits normal inactivation (Figures 3A–3C). All three mutant channels exhibited altered inactivation (Figures 3D–3F) with associated persistent currents, which were maintained for more than several hundred milliseconds in the two inactivation gate mutants (Figures 3D and 3E). There is a depolarizing (rightward) shift in steady-state inactivation (h∞) curves for all three mutants (Figures 3G–3I) and inactivation is incomplete for I1461T and T1464I. For M1627K, the greater shift and reduction in voltage-dependence would widen the range of potentials over which “window current” (activation-inactivation gating overlap) could operate. We further investigated the properties of T1464I and the in vitro effects of carbamazepine, as symptoms in patients with this mutation are effectively controlled using this drug. There was a depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of activation in this mutant (6.8 mV compared with wild-type, Figure 3C). The average inactivation time constant (τh) was less voltage-dependent and the kinetics of this partial inactivation were rapid (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The reduced sensitivity of inactivation rate to membrane potential is seen in other sodium channels with mutations in the domain III-IV linker (Cannon, 2000Cannon S.C. Spectrum of sodium channel disturbances in the nondystrophic myotonias and periodic paralyses.Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 772-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In response to long depolarizing steps, the T1464I persistent current was maintained (Figure 4A). In the presence of carbamazepine, this current was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 4A–4C, and the Supplemental Data) while the transient current evoked in the same protocol was spared. The dissociation constant (Kd) obtained from individual data sets is 32.7 ± 8.2 μM (n = 4), assuming that complete block is possible, a value within the range of therapeutic plasma concentrations observed in patients (Breton et al., 2005Breton H. Cociglio M. Bressolle F. Peyriere H. Blayac J.P. Hillaire-Buys D.

Although these observations indicate that this mutant channel is sensitive to carbamazepine in vitro (as is the I1461T mutant, see the Supplemental Data), the therapeutic effect in vivo may also depend on its effects on the other sodium channels, including Nav1.8, expressed in the same sensory neurons. The negative activation potential of a PE mutant, I848T (Yang et al., 2004Yang Y. Wang Y. Li S. Xu Z. Li H. Ma L. Fan J. Bu D. Liu B. Fan Z. et al.Mutations in SCN9A, encoding a sodium channel alpha subunit, in patients with primary erythermalgia.J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) (Figure 4D), was unaffected by exposure to 100 μM carbamazepine, demonstrating the molecular basis for the difference in drug effectiveness in PEPD and PE. We have identified eight SCN9A mutations in families with PEPD. All are missense, indicating a gain-of-function or dominant-negative mechanism for the autosomal dominant inheritance displayed in familial cases. PEPD is the second inherited pain disorder to be shown to be attributable to mutations in SCN9A. Nine mutations have recently been shown to be associated with PE (Dib-Hajj et al., 2005Dib-Hajj S.D.

Fan Z. et al.Mutations in SCN9A, encoding a sodium channel alpha subunit, in patients with primary erythermalgia.J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In contrast to phenotypes associated with mutations in SCN1A (Meisler and Kearney, 2005Meisler M.H. Kearney J.A. Sodium channel mutations in epilepsy and other neurological disorders.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2010-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), sporadic cases with haplo-insufficiency have not been observed in these SCN9A-related disorders, and variable phenotypic expression is limited within families, suggesting that modifier genes are less important in channelopathies of peripheral nerves than in those of central neurons. Our results suggest that around two-thirds of families with PEPD have mutations in SCN9A, suggesting the existence of locus heterogeneity, as in other sodium channelopathies (George, 2005George Jr., A.L. Inherited disorders of voltage-gated sodium channels.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Altered function of hNav1.7 in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons is likely to underlie the pain and flushing common to both PEPD and PE. However, there are marked clinical differences between the phenotypes, as well as differential responses to medication. PEPD is essentially a visceral pain condition, often unprovoked, with marked cranial nerve involvement, whereas PE is a condition primarily affecting the extremities in which the triggers, such as exercise and temperature change, are well documented. To what extent can these differences, including the responses to sodium channel blockers, be accounted for by the functional effects caused by the mutations studied? Three PE mutations have been studied. Two, I848T and L858H (Yang et al., 2004Yang Y. Wang Y. Li S. Xu Z. Li H. Ma L. Fan J. Bu D. Liu B. Fan Z. et al.Mutations in SCN9A, encoding a sodium channel alpha subunit, in patients with primary erythermalgia.J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), cause a significant hyperpolarizing shift in activation, slow deactivation, and increased response to small ramp depolarizations (Cummins et al., 2004Cummins T.R. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. Electrophysiological properties of mutant Nav1.7 sodium channels in a painful inherited neuropathy.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A third mutation, F1449V, produces a smaller hyperpolarizing shift in activation and a depolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation, leading to a lowering of the threshold for single action potentials and high-frequency firing in DRG neurons (Dib-Hajj et al., 2005Dib-Hajj S.D. Rush A.M. Cummins T.R. Hisama F.M. Novella S. Tyrrell L. Marshall L. Waxman S.G. Gain-of-function mutation in Nav1.7 in familial erythromelalgia induces bursting of sensory neurons.Brain. 2005; 1281: 1847-1854Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These effects are likely to reduce the activation threshold for sensory and nociceptive neurons, causing the chronic hyperalgesia, inflammation, and central sensitization associated with activation through nonnoxious stimulation, e.g. walking. In marked contrast to the functional effects of PE mutations, the three PEPD mutants studied here display marked deficits in sodium channel fast inactivation. Similar effects on fast inactivation have been described for muscle sodium channels in myotonia (Cannon, 2000Cannon S.C. Spectrum of sodium channel disturbances in the nondystrophic myotonias and periodic paralyses.Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 772-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2005Wu F.f. Gordon E. Hoffman E.P. Cannon S.C. A C-terminal skeletal muscle sodium channel mutation associated with myotonia disrupts fast inactivation.J. Physiol. 2005; 565 (Published online March 17, 2005): 371-380https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2005.082909Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In PEPD such inactivation deficits may only become apparent after near-normal activation and would promote prolonged action potentials and repetitive firing in response to provoking stimuli, such as stretching and experiencing cold. In either case, it is likely that the role of Nav1.7 as a “threshold channel” is a factor, with Nav1.8 probably contributing to the regenerative current at the nerve ending (e.g., Strassman and Raymond, 1999Strassman A.M. Raymond S.A. Electrophysiological evidence for tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels in slowly conducting dural sensory fibers.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 413-424PubMed Google Scholar, Renganathan et al., 2001Renganathan M. Cummins T.R. Waxman S.G.

Physiol. 2002; 120: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Such allelic heterogeneity is not uncommon in the channelopathies. There are several well-documented examples of channels in which different mutational mechanisms lead to clinically distinct phenotypes. These include generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy in SCN1A; the skeletal muscle disorders, hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) and myotonia, caused by mutations in SCN4A; and the cardiac disorders long-QT and Brugada syndromes, caused by mutations in SCN5A (reviewed in detail in George, 2005George Jr., A.L. Inherited disorders of voltage-gated sodium channels.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that GEFS+, long-QT, and HYPP, in a situation analogous to that of PEPD, are largely the result of gain-of-function mutations leading to persistent sodium current. That there are clear mechanistic differences between PEPD and PE is supported by their differential responses to drug therapy. Oral mexiletine and topical lidocaine, both local anesthetic/type 1b anti-arrhythmia drugs, have been reported to give relief in PE (Legroux-Crespel et al., 2003Legroux-Crespel E. Sassolas B. Guillet G. Kupfer I. Dupre D. Misery L. Treatment of familial erytheramalgia with the association of lidocaine and mexiletine.Ann. Dermatol. and Venereol. 2003; 130: 429-433PubMed Google Scholar), whereas many PEPD patients respond well to the anti-epilepsy drug carbamazepine. Mexiletine is also effective in skeletal muscle myotonias arising from mutations in hNav1.4 (Mohammadi et al., 2005Mohammadi B. Jurkat-Rott K. Alekov A. Dengler R. Bufler J. Lehmann-Horn F. Preferred mexiletine block of human sodium channels with IVS4 mutations and its pH-dependence.Pharmacogenet. Genomics. 2005; 15: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that certain myotonia mutations (e.g., substitutions of R1448) respond well to the drug, an effect ascribed to an increased probability of the channel being in closed-state inactivation and/or enhanced recovery from fast inactivation (Mohammadi et al., 2005Mohammadi B. Jurkat-Rott K. Alekov A. Dengler R. Bufler J. Lehmann-Horn F. Preferred mexiletine block of human sodium channels with IVS4 mutations and its pH-dependence.Pharmacogenet. Genomics. 2005; 15: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A similar effect on channel kinetics is seen in the PE mutant F1449V, so the response to mexiletine may be mutation-specific. Carbamazepine also blocks sodium channels in a use-dependent manner and has long been established as a treatment for neuropathic pain (Backonja, 2002Backonja M.M. Use of anticonvulsants for treatment of neuropathic pain.Neurology. 2002; 59: S14-S17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but has little or no effect in PE (Waxman and Dib-Hajj, 2005Waxman S.G. Dib-Hajj S. Erythromelalgia: A hereditary pain syndrome enters the molecular era.Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This is consistent with pain in PEPD being precipitated by persistent Na current (because carbamazepine preferentially suppresses persistent Na current, as demonstrated for two of the mutants studied—see the Supplemental Data) in comparison with the pain in PE being caused by lowered activation thresholds. In summary, these observations establish the existence of allelic heterogeneity in a class of sodium channelopathy affecting peripheral neurons. PEPD and PE are both inherited autosomal dominant inflammatory pain conditions, but have entirely distinct phenotypes. Our data demonstrate that these distinct phenotypes are the result of distinct repertoires of mutations leading to either lowered thresholds of activation (PE) or defective inactivation (PEPD) These data further emphasize the critical role of Nav1.7 in human inflammatory pain and explain the differential drug sensitivity of PEPD and PE. This study was approved by the joint UCL/UCLH committees on the ethics of human research. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents. Twelve families and two sporadic cases (family 8 and 9) with PEPD were ascertained using the diagnostic criteria outlined below. PEPD is a rare, autosomal dominant paroxysmal disorder of pain and autonomic dysfunction that presents with four types of painful episode: (1) birth crisis, when babies are born red and stiff; (2) rectal crisis, which is triggered by defecation in infants and young children and by a variety of emotional factors in older children and adults; (3) ocular crisis, which may be provoked, but is more usually spontaneous, and (4) mandibular crisis, which is often triggered by eating and yawning. The distinctive features of this condition are paroxysmal episodes of burning pain in the rectal, ocular, and mandibular areas, accompanied by the autonomic manifestations such as skin flushing, reflex asystolic syncopal events, lacrimation, and rhinorrhoea. In between episodes, physical examination is normal, and investigations such as imaging or tissue biopsy are normal. Diagnosis therefore relies on the history and either direct observation or video of the episodes. The former is, of course, more helpful in adults and the latter in infants and children. Family 1 was originally referred with an erroneous diagnosis of hyperekplexia. Other families were ascertained from previous publications (Mann and Cree, 1972Mann T.P. Cree J.E. Familial rectal pain.Lancet. 1972; 1: 1016-1017Abstract PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, Schubert and Cracco, 1992Schubert R. Cracco J.B. Familial rectal pain. A type of reflex epilepsy?.Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 824-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or by direct contact from those managing affected children. Family 7 is a recently ascertained large pedigree from Berkshire, UK and was selected for linkage analysis. Detailed clinical documentation of this family will be published elsewhere. In all cases, DNA was extracted from venous blood or buccal swabs from patients and unaffected family members using standard methods. Primers flanking a total of 455 polymorphic loci primarily identified from the Généthon map spanning the human genome were used in the genome search in family 7. Primers were obtained from MRC HGMP Resource Centre, Research Genetics, MWG Biotech, and Invitrogen. These microsatellites were genotyped using a fluorescent-based semi-automated method on automated DNA sequencing machines (ABI 373A, ABI 3100). Primers were designed for the mutation screen of SCN9A from the genomic sequence obtained from the Human Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). Intronic primers were designed to flank each exon (or groups of exons if separated by small introns). Exons from each of the eight probands and appropriate controls were amplified and sequenced on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 373A or ABI 3100) and the sequences aligned and compared using Sequence Navigator v1.0.1. A full-length version of the human Nav1.7 cDNA was cloned into a modified version of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Klugbauer et al., 1995Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Flockerzi V.H.F. Structure and functional expression of a new member of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-activated sodium channel family from human neuroendocrine cells.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For functional analysis, three mutated constructs were made (I1461T, T1464I, M1627K). These single base substitutions were introduced into this wild-type clone by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Correct introduction of these substitutions was confirmed by complete sequencing of the inserts. HEK293 cells were grown in sparse culture in 35 mm diameter Petri dishes. Transfections were carried out in serum-free medium by incubating with pcDNA3 incorporating Nav1.7 cDNA and mutant DNA 0.8–1.3 μg 3 μl lipofectamine 2000, 0.2 μg pBS500 for 2 hr at 37°C. The medium was then replaced with normal culture medium incorporating 5% serum. Recordings were made from 1–2 days later. Conventional voltage-clamp recordings in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration were made from HEK293 cells 1–2 days following transfection, using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, California, USA) driven from a PC generating pulse protocols (Pclamp 9, Axon Instruments). The extracellular solution contained the following: 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tetraethylammonium Cl, 10 mM HEPES, 2.1 mM CaCl2, 2.12 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM 4-Aminopyridine, 7.5 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM CdCl. The intracellular solution contained the following: 130 mM CsCl, 13 mM CsF, 3 mM EGTA (Na), 10 mM Tetraethylammonium Cl, 10 mM HEPES, 1.21 mM CaCl2, 3 mM ATP(Mg), and 500 μM GTP (Li). The external and internal solutions were buffered to pH 7.2–7.3 with the addition of NaOH and CsOH, respectively. Electrodes were made from thin-walled glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK), with initial resistances of 1–2 MΩ when filled with recording solution. During recording, series-resistance compensation was always used and set to 70% or higher. Families of sodium currents were recorded in response to a series of incrementing depolarizing voltage-clamp steps from a holding potential of −90 mV. Steady-state inactivation protocols comprised an incrementally depolarizing prepulse, 60 or 100 ms in duration, followed immediately by a depolarizing step to +10 mV. Records were usually filtered at 5 KHz (4-pole Bessel) and sampled at 20 or 10 KHz. Current traces were generated by averaging three or more records. Leak subtraction was achieved using a P/N protocol, where five reverse polarity clamp-steps were used to produce the leakage record. TTX was applied to ascertain that the currents were indeed TTX-s sodium currents. The HEK293 cells failed to generate TTX-s currents unless they were transfected with an hNaV1.7 clone. Because HEK293 cells can generate nonlinear leakage currents, records of membrane currents were made both before and after the application of TTX, and the TTX-sensitive component was isolated by off-line digital subtraction. TTX (250 nM) and carbamazepine (up to 200 μM) were applied by local superfusion. Carbamazepine was made up as a stock solution of 50 mM or 200 mM in DMSO. Recordings were made at room temperature. Peak currents were converted to conductances, assuming that the sodium equilibrium potential (ENa) was +70 mV, allowing activation curves to be plotted. Boltzmann relations were drawn according to best-fit parameters (Sigma-Stat) for activation curves and h∞ curves. The maximal block in the presence of carbamazepine was derived from the asymptote of the h∞ curve or (as in the Supplemental Data) by measuring the residual current amplitude at 0 mV. Concentration block data for carbamazepine was described as a rectangular-hyperbola (Langmuir isotherm), assuming that 100% block was achievable, from which the apparent Kd for block could be derived.

Spines form and grow during long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. However, the source of membrane for spine formation and enlargement is unknown. Here we report that membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes is required for the growth and maintenance of spines. Using live-cell imaging and serial section electron microscopy, we demonstrate that LTP-inducing stimuli promote the mobilization of recycling endosomes and vesicles into spines. Preventing recycling endosomal transport abolishes LTP-induced spine formation. Using a pH-sensitive recycling cargo, we show that exocytosis from recycling endosomes occurs locally in spines, is triggered by activation of synaptic NMDA receptors, and occurs concurrently with spine enlargement. Thus, recycling endosomes provide membrane for activity-dependent spine growth and remodeling, defining a novel membrane trafficking mechanism for spine morphological plasticity and providing a mechanistic link between structural and functional plasticity during LTP.

Thus, recycling endosomes provide membrane for activity-dependent spine growth and remodeling, defining a novel membrane trafficking mechanism for spine morphological plasticity and providing a mechanistic link between structural and functional plasticity during LTP. Dendritic spines are micron-sized membrane protrusions of neuronal dendrites that are the major sites of contact for glutamatergic presynaptic inputs in the mammalian central nervous system (Hering and Sheng, 2001Hering H. Sheng M. Dendritic spines: structure, dynamics and regulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Spines are motile and assume diverse shapes, which are correlated with synaptic strength (Matsuzaki et al., 2001Matsuzaki M. Ellis-Davies G.C. Nemoto T. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Dendritic spine geometry is critical for AMPA receptor expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Further, spine morphology is subject to rapid alteration by patterns of neuronal activity and postsynaptic glutamate receptor activation (Lang et al., 2004Lang C. Barco A. Zablow L. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Zakharenko S.S. Transient expansion of synaptically connected dendritic spines upon induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Recent studies have found that new spines form and existing spines grow in response to stimuli that induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F. Bonhoeffer T. Dendritic spine changes associated with hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity.Nature. 1999; 399: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999Maletic-Savatic M.

Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), the dominant cellular model for learning and memory (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Long-term potentiation—a decade of progress?.Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). Such structural growth and expansion of dendritic spines has served as a paradigmatic cellular model for physical alteration of neural circuitry during learning-related plasticity. Along with spine growth, morphological changes associated with LTP include enlargement of the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Toni et al., 1999Toni N. Buchs P.A. Nikonenko I. Bron C.R. Muller D. LTP promotes formation of multiple spine synapses between a single axon terminal and a dendrite.Nature. 1999; 402: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), remodeling of spine actin (Okamoto et al., 2004Okamoto K. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Hayashi Y. Rapid and persistent modulation of actin dynamics regulates postsynaptic reorganization underlying bidirectional plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), redistribution of polyribosomes (Ostroff et al., 2002Ostroff L.E. Fiala J.C. Allwardt B. Harris K.M. Polyribosomes redistribute from dendritic shafts into spines with enlarged synapses during LTP in developing rat hippocampal slices.Neuron. 2002; 35: 535-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and mitochondria (Li et al., 2004Li Z. Okamoto K. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. The importance of dendritic mitochondria in the morphogenesis and plasticity of spines and synapses.Cell. 2004; 119: 873-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), and the appearance of intraspinous vesicles (Toni et al., 2001Toni N. Buchs P.A. Nikonenko I. Povilaitite P. Parisi L. Muller D. Remodeling of synaptic membranes after induction of long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6245-6251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter observation points to the possibility for spatially regulated membrane trafficking events during spine growth. However, to date, emphasis has been placed on spine morphological plasticity through remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (Tada and Sheng, 2006Tada T. Sheng M. Molecular mechanisms of dendritic spine morphogenesis.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Interestingly, linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane through the protein kinase C target MARCKS maintains spine morphology (Calabrese and Halpain, 2005Calabrese B. Halpain S. Essential role for the PKC target MARCKS in maintaining dendritic spine morphology.Neuron. 2005; 48: 77-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the source of membrane for increased spine volume and new spine formation during LTP has been unknown. Membrane for spine expansion could be provided by lateral plasma membrane of the dendritic shaft or by fusion of intracellular membrane compartments. Dendrites are rich in internal membrane compartments including extensive smooth endoplasmic reticulum (Spacek and Harris, 1997Spacek J. Harris K.M. Three-dimensional organization of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in hippocampal CA1 dendrites and dendritic spines of the immature and mature rat.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 190-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sparse Golgi elements (Horton et al., 2005Horton A.C. Racz B. Monson E.E. Lin A.L. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Polarized secretory trafficking directs cargo for asymmetric dendrite growth and morphogenesis.Neuron. 2005; 48: 757-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and endosomes (Cooney et al., 2002Cooney J.R. Hurlburt J.L. Selig D.K. Harris K.M. Fiala J.C. Endosomal compartments serve multiple hippocampal dendritic spines from a widespread rather than a local store of recycling membrane.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whose function and molecular identity remain poorly characterized. In nonneuronal cells, membrane traffic through endosomes contributes to cell morphogenesis. In migrating chick embryo fibroblasts, the transferrin (Tf) receptor (TfR), a representative fast and constitutive recycling transmembrane protein, is loaded into perinuclear recycling endosomes and then trafficked to the surface of the leading lamella (Hopkins et al., 1994Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D.K. Trowbridge I.S. In migrating fibroblasts, recycling receptors are concentrated in narrow tubules in the pericentriolar area, and then routed to the plasma membrane of the leading lamella.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, membrane accumulation for cleavage furrow growth during the terminal phase of cytokinesis in the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is dependent on Rab11 (Skop et al., 2001Skop A.R. Bergmann D. Mohler W.A. White J.G. Completion of cytokinesis in C. elegans requires a brefeldin A-sensitive membrane accumulation at the cleavage furrow apex.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), a small GTPase required for membrane transport from the recycling endosome to the plasma membrane (Ullrich et al., 1996Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. Rab11 regulates recycling through the pericentriolar recycling endosome.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Finally, disruption of the Drosophila exocyst components sec5, sec6, and sec15 in epithelial cells causes accumulation of E-cadherin in an enlarged recycling endosomal compartment and inhibits its delivery to the plasma membrane (Langevin et al., 2005Langevin J. Morgan M.J. Sibarita J.B. Aresta S. Murthy M. Schwarz T. Camonis J. Bellaiche Y. Drosophila exocyst components Sec5, Sec6, and Sec15 regulate DE-Cadherin trafficking from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 355-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Such studies suggest that cellular membrane microdomain composition and shape is governed by rates of endocytosis to and exocytosis from endosomes aligned through the endocytic recycling pathway. At excitatory synapses on dendritic spines, postsynaptic membrane composition is subject to continuous regulation by endocytic cycling of neurotransmitter receptors (Ehlers, 2000Ehlers M.D. Reinsertion or degradation of AMPA receptors determined by activity-dependent endocytic sorting.Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Continuous endocytosis of postsynaptic molecules occurs at specialized endocytic zones on spines lateral to the PSD (Blanpied et al., 2002Blanpied T.A. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Dynamics and regulation of clathrin coats at specialized endocytic zones of dendrites and spines.Neuron. 2002; 36: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Given the small size of dendritic spines, endocytic or exocytic events could have a significant impact on spine size. Yet, in the absence of plasticity-inducing stimuli, most spines are structurally stable (Grutzendler et al., 2002Grutzendler J. Kasthuri N. Gan W.B. Long-term dendritic spine stability in the adult cortex.Nature. 2002; 420: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), suggesting precise spatial control over membrane recycling. Notably, recycling endosomes are highly dynamic in hippocampal neuron dendrites (Prekeris et al., 1999Prekeris R. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Dynamics of tubulovesicular recycling endosomes in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10324-10337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ultrastructural analysis has revealed a widespread pool of recycling compartments and vesicles that serve multiple dendritic spines (Cooney et al., 2002Cooney J.R. Hurlburt J.L. Selig D.K. Harris K.M. Fiala J.C. Endosomal compartments serve multiple hippocampal dendritic spines from a widespread rather than a local store of recycling membrane.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), potentially positioning endosomes to provide membrane and molecular material to specific spine microdomains. During LTP, the number of AMPA-type glutamate receptors at the plasma membrane increases due to enhanced transport from recycling endosomes (Park et al., 2004Park M. Penick E.C. Edwards J.G. Kauer J.A. Ehlers M.D. Recycling endosomes supply AMPA receptors for LTP.Science. 2004; 305: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors produces an increase in AMPA receptor-mediated transmission (Shi et al., 1999Shi S.H. Hayashi Y. Petralia R.S. Zaman S.H. Wenthold R.J. Svoboda K. Malinow R. Rapid spine delivery and redistribution of AMPA receptors after synaptic NMDA receptor activation.Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In addition, LTP-inducing stimuli increase the abundance of coated vesicles in spines (Toni et al., 2001Toni N. Buchs P.A. Nikonenko I. Povilaitite P. Parisi L. Muller D. Remodeling of synaptic membranes after induction of long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6245-6251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increase the rate of recycling endosome transport (Park et al., 2004Park M. Penick E.C. Edwards J.G. Kauer J.A. Ehlers M.D. Recycling endosomes supply AMPA receptors for LTP.Science. 2004; 305: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). These results point to the possibility that enhanced recycling not only ensures enhanced synaptic efficacy by providing AMPA receptors but also mediates spine growth and structural remodeling by supplying lipid membrane and other unknown proteins, thereby coupling membrane remodeling with synaptic potentiation. Yet, little is known about where the relevant endosomal compartments reside in dendrites and spines, whether exocytic events from recycling endosomes occur within spines, and how membrane trafficking from endosomes is regulated during plasticity-associated spine growth. In this study, we have investigated the effect of recycling endosome transport on spine growth and maintenance and the regulation of such transport by LTP-inducing stimuli. Using a combination of live-cell imaging, electron microscopy, and direct visualization of exocytosis from dendritic endosomes, we demonstrate that transport from recycling endosomes bidirectionally regulates spine formation and loss. During LTP, recycling endosomes and endosomal vesicles are rapidly mobilized into spines. Disruption of recycling endosome transport leads to acute spine collapse and prevents LTP-induced spine formation. Exocytosis of cargo from recycling endosomes occurs locally within dendritic spines, is trigged by activation of synaptic NMDA receptors, and occurs concurrently with spine enlargement. These results demonstrate a novel requirement for intracellular membrane trafficking in spine morphogenesis, provide direct evidence for local exocytosis in spines, and identify recycling endosomes as the source of membrane material for activity-dependent spine growth. Activity-dependent establishment of local endosomal recycling provides a potential mechanism linking structural and functional plasticity of highly compartmentalized dendritic spines. To determine the spatial relation of recycling endosomes to dendritic spines, we labeled recycling endosomes in hippocampal neurons (DIV17) using either fluorophore-conjugated transferrin (Alexa-Tf) uptake or immunocytochemical detection of the recycling endosome marker proteins transferrin receptor (TfR), Rab11, and syntaxin13. Recycling endosomes were present in the dendritic shaft and also appeared in spines (Figure 1A). Within the dendritic shaft, recycling endosomes were frequently positioned at the base of spines near the origin of the spine neck (Figures 1B and 1C). Quantitative analysis revealed that most spines had recycling endosomes at their base (a; Figures 1B and 1C), while some spines had recycling endosomes in their neck (b; Figures 1B and 1C) or in their spine head (c; Figures 1B and 1C). A few spines had endosomes extending from the dendritic shaft into the spine neck (a + b; Figure 1B). Notably, less than 10% of spines lacked recycling endosomes in either the spine proper or in immediately adjacent regions of the dendritic shaft. To examine and quantify spine endosomes in more intact circuits in situ, we performed serial section transmission electron microscopy (sSTEM) in postnatal day 15 (PN15) dendrites from acute rat hippocampal slices. Endosomal compartments were categorized into recycling compartments (RCs; red; Figure 1D, panels D1 and D3i) with or without a multivesicular body (MVB; blue; Figure 1D, panels D1 and D3i), amorphous vesicular clumps (AVCs; green; Figure 1D, panel D2), and free endosomes (including abundant smooth vesicles marked with yellow and occasional coated vesicles marked with orange) as previously described (Cooney et al., 2002Cooney J.R. Hurlburt J.L. Selig D.K. Harris K.M. Fiala J.C. Endosomal compartments serve multiple hippocampal dendritic spines from a widespread rather than a local store of recycling membrane.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RCs contained tubules with and without coated buds and smooth and coated vesicles. RCs were found both with and without an associated MVB (blue; Figure 1D, panels D1 and D3i). AVCs were distinguished from RCs by their irregular shape and absence of coated vesicles or tubules. In previous studies, all of these compartments (RCs, AVCs, and free endosomes) contained gold-conjugated cargo endocytosed from the extracellular space, which distinguished them from smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which never contained gold particles (Cooney et al., 2002Cooney J.R. Hurlburt J.L. Selig D.K. Harris K.M. Fiala J.C. Endosomal compartments serve multiple hippocampal dendritic spines from a widespread rather than a local store of recycling membrane.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These endosomal compartments were distributed at the base (a, 56.8% of spines; Figure 1E), in the neck (b, 40.4% of spines; Figure 1E), and in the head (c, 50% of spines; Figure 1E) of dendritic spines (Figure 1E). Pre-embedding immunogold electron microscopy of adult rat CA1 hippocampus revealed TfR-positive membrane compartments at the base, in the neck, and in the head of dendritic spines, which had morphological characteristics indistinguishable from endosomal compartments identified by sSTEM (Figure 1F). Thus, under basal conditions in primary neuron cultures, hippocampal slices, and adult rat brain, endosomes are poised immediately beneath spines or in the spine head proper, suggesting rapid availability of recycling cargo for membrane plasticity. Next, we considered whether endosomes localized within or near spines (Figure 1) have enough membrane to contribute to spine growth or maintenance. Membrane surface areas of spines and endosomal compartments were measured through serial sections (Figures 2A and 2B). The membranes of all tubules and vesicles in both RCs (red; Figures 2Aii and 2Bii) and AVCs (green; Figure 2Bii) were measured, excluding the membrane of MVBs. Quantitative analysis revealed that the range in membrane surface area of dendritic spines overlapped substantially with the surface area summed across vesicles and tubules in RCs or AVCs (mean surface area: spines, 0.66 μm2; RC, 0.35 μm2; AVC, 0.43 μm2; Figure 2C). Moreover, spines containing endosomal compartments were larger than spines lacking endosomes (Figure 2D). Thus, the summed membrane area of RCs or AVCs is a substantial fraction of the spine membrane surface area, revealing a correlation between the presence of endosomes and spine size. We next measured the effect of blocking recycling endosome transport on spine number by expressing either a mutant version of the Eps15-homology domain protein EHD1/Rme1 (Rme1-G429R), a constitutively inactive GDP-bound form of the small GTPase Rab11a (Rab11a-S25N), or a soluble fragment of the recycling endosome SNARE protein syntaxin13 (Syn13ΔTM) that forms cognate SNARE complexes but blocks membrane fusion due to its inability to bind membranes (Figure 3A) (Lin et al., 2001Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Rme-1 regulates the distribution and function of the endocytic recycling compartment in mammalian cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2004Park M. Penick E.C. Edwards J.G. Kauer J.A. Ehlers M.D. Recycling endosomes supply AMPA receptors for LTP.Science. 2004; 305: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To visualize neuronal morphology, we filled neurons by expressing mRFP. In hippocampal neurons, blocking endocytic recycling markedly reduced the number of dendritic protrusions, most of which were spines (protrusions per 10 μm dendrite: GFP, 3.7 ± 0.1; Rme1-G429R, 1.8 ± 0.1; Rab11a-S25N, 1.8 ± 0.2; Syn13ΔTM, 2.3 ± 0.1; Figures 3B and 3C). Conversely, expression of wild-type Rme1, Rab11a, or syntaxin13 enhanced recycling (data not shown) and markedly increased total protrusion number (protrusions per 10 μm dendrite: Rme1-WT, 7.6 ± 0.4; Rab11a-WT, 8.0 ± 0.5; Syntaxin13-WT, 7.0 ± 0.3; Figures 3B and 3C). These findings indicate that transport from recycling endosomes bidirectionally regulates spine number, and ongoing membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes is required to maintain spines. To rule out effects of chronic disruption of endocytic recycling, we applied a cell-permeable Syn13ΔTM fusion protein bearing the short acidic cell-penetrating TAT sequence to allow for cell entry. Purified Syn13ΔTM containing the TAT sequence (TAT-Syn13ΔTM, 3.5 μM) was taken up into cultured hippocampal neurons in a time-dependent manner that was maximal after 60–90 min (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). As a control, a purified TAT-fused soluble fragment of the late endosome SNARE protein syntaxin-7 (TAT-Syn7ΔTM, 3.5 μM) (Sun et al., 2003Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. Hrs regulates early endosome fusion by inhibiting formation of an endosomal SNARE complex.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed similar transducibility into hippocampal neurons (Figure S1). By following the trafficking of the recycling cargo Alexa-transferrin or the late endosomal trafficked cargo fluorescein-EGF, we confirmed that acute application of TAT-Syn13ΔTM or TAT-Syn7ΔTM blocked endocytic recycling and degradation, respectively (Figures S2 and S3). To test whether acute blockade of recycling transport influences spine morphology, we performed time-lapse imaging of hippocampal neurons expressing tdTomato as a cell fill and applied Alexa-488-labeled TAT-Syn13ΔTM (Alexa-488-TAT-Syn13ΔTM; 3.5 μM). Uptake of TAT-Syn13ΔTM proteins was confirmed by Alexa-488 fluorescence. During baseline imaging, dendritic protrusions were largely stable with the occasional appearance of new dendritic protrusions and loss of existing dendritic protrusions that balanced one another producing no net effect on protrusion number over the duration of the experiment under control conditions. However, following application of TAT-Syn13ΔTM, the total number of dendritic protrusions abruptly declined over 30–60 min (Figures 3D–3F) corresponding to the time course of TAT-Syn13ΔTM uptake (Figure S1). Conversely, application of TAT-Syn7ΔTM had no effect on spine number (Figure 3G). These data provide strong evidence that membrane cycling between recycling endosomes and the spine plasma membrane is continuous and rapid and that ongoing membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes is required to maintain spines. We next wondered whether membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes provides a potential source of membrane and other proteins for spine remodeling. To this end, we first tested whether activation of synaptic NMDA receptors by glycine stimulation, a protocol used to induce chemical LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2004Park M.

We found that brief glycine stimulation markedly increased the number of spines and the size of preexisting spines (Figure 4A). Time-lapse imaging revealed that both the number of dendritic protrusions (Figures 4B and 4C; Movie S1) and the size of preexisting dendritic protrusions (Figures 4F and 4G; Movie S2) increased rapidly following glycine application. Both glycine-induced spine formation and preexisting spine growth were blocked by application of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 (Gly + AP5; Figures 4C and 4G), indicating that the increase in dendritic protrusion number and size was dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F. Bonhoeffer T. Dendritic spine changes associated with hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity.Nature. 1999; 399: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), the fractional increase of spine size was larger for small spines (<0.85 μm2) than for large spines (>0.85 μm2) (Figure S4A), while the absolute increase of spine size was nearly identical between small and large spines (Figure S4B). Thus, the absolute amount of membrane added to each spine following glycine stimulation is similar. Interestingly, we observed a small but significant spine loss upon D-AP5 application in the absence of glycine stimulation (Figure 4C), indicating that maintenance of spines under basal conditions also required NMDA receptor activation. In our glycine-induced LTP protocol using 14–18 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons, glycine stimulation produced a 2.5-fold increase in the total number of protrusions (Figures 4C–4E) or an ∼2-fold increase in the size of protrusions (Figures 4G–4I). Before glycine stimulation, neurons had 2.8 ± 0.8 protrusions per 10 μm dendrite (n = 5). After glycine stimulation, the number of protrusions increased to 6.9 ± 1.6 protrusions per 10 μm dendrite. These findings indicate that glycine stimulation induces spine plasticity similar to classically elicited LTP in hippocampal slice preparations, providing an experimental system amenable to cell biological and biochemical studies of LTP-induced spine morphological plasticity. Based on our observation that promoting transport from recycling endosomes increased the number of spines (Figures 3B and 3C), as did LTP-inducing stimuli (Figure 4), we reasoned that LTP-associated spine growth could be occurring via accelerated membrane traffic from recycling endosomes. To test this possibility, we examined glycine-induced spine growth in neurons in which endocytic recycling was blocked by expression of Rme1-G429R or Rab11a-S25N. Unlike control neurons, which displayed robust glycine-induced spine formation (Figures 4A–4C) and preexisting spine growth (Figures 4A, 4F, and 4G), neurons expressing Rme1-G429R or Rab11a-S25N failed to form new dendritic protrusions (lower panel, Figure 4B; Figure 4D; see also Movie S1) and exhibited no detectable spine growth (right panel, Figure 4F; Figure 4H; see also Movie S2) upon glycine stimulation. We have shown previously that blocking recycling endosome transport does not affect immunocytochemically detected NMDA receptors at synapses or NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents (Park et al., 2004Park M. Penick E.C. Edwards J.G. Kauer J.A. Ehlers M.D. Recycling endosomes supply AMPA receptors for LTP.Science. 2004; 305: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In addition, postsynaptic expression of Rme1-G429R, Rab11a-S25N, or Syn13ΔTM had no effect on FM4-64 uptake into contacting presynaptic terminals (Figure S5) and no effect on the magnitude or kinetics of evoked NMDA receptor currents in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure S6), indicating that expressing neurons had functional synapses with unchanged synaptic NMDA receptor currents. Thus, the observed inhibition of spine growth during glycine-induced LTP cannot be accounted for by a decrease of functional NMDA receptors or altered presynaptic function.

https://openalex.org/W2156888897,"Brain systems communicate by means of neuronal oscillations at multiple temporal and spatial scales. In anesthetized rats, we find that neocortical ""slow"" oscillation engages neurons in prefrontal, somatosensory, entorhinal, and subicular cortices into synchronous transitions between UP and DOWN states, with a corresponding bimodal distribution of their membrane potential. The membrane potential of hippocampal granule cells and CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells lacked bimodality, yet it was influenced by the slow oscillation in a region-specific manner. Furthermore, in both anesthetized and naturally sleeping rats, the cortical UP states resulted in increased activity of dentate and most CA1 neurons, as well as the highest probability of ripple events. Yet, the CA3-CA1 network could self-organize into gamma bursts and occasional ripples during the DOWN state. Thus, neo/paleocortical and hippocampal networks periodically reset, self-organize, and temporally coordinate their cell assemblies via the slow oscillation."

https://openalex.org/W1983097317,"The development of dendritic spines is thought to be crucial for synaptic plasticity. Dendritic spines are retracted upon Eph receptor A4 (EphA4) activation, but the mechanisms that control this process are not well understood. Here we report an important function of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in EphA4-dependent spine retraction in mice. We found that blocking Cdk5 activity inhibits ephrin-A1-triggered spine retraction and reduction of mEPSC frequency at hippocampal synapses. The activation of EphA4 resulted in the recruitment of Cdk5 to EphA4, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Cdk5. EphA4 and Cdk5 then enhanced the activation of ephexin1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that regulates activation of the small Rho GTPase RhoA. The association between EphA4 and ephexin1 was significantly reduced in Cdk5(-/-) brains and Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of ephexin1 was required for the ephrin-A1-mediated regulation of spine density. These findings suggest that ephrin-A1 promotes EphA4-dependent spine retraction through the activation of Cdk5 and ephexin1, which in turn modulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1990208186,"<h2>Summary</h2> Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is critical for the temporal control of behavior. Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex might alter neuronal activity in areas such as motor cortex to inhibit temporally inappropriate responses. We tested this hypothesis by recording from neuronal ensembles in rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during a delayed-response task. One-third of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons were significantly modulated during the delay period. The activity of many of these neurons was predictive of premature responding. We then reversibly inactivated dorsomedial prefrontal cortex while recording ensemble activity in motor cortex. Inactivation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex reduced delay-related firing, but not response-related firing, in motor cortex. Finally, we made simultaneous recordings in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and motor cortex and found strong delay-related temporal correlations between neurons in the two cortical areas. These data suggest that functional interactions between dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and motor cortex might serve as a top-down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding."
https://openalex.org/W2019876477,"Functional optical imaging showed that odor or electric shock stimuli presented to the fly causes transient calcium influx into the two major axon branches of α/β mushroom body (MB) neurons. One pairing of odor and electric shock stimuli or multiple, massed pairings did not alter odor-evoked calcium influx. In contrast, animals that received multiple, spaced pairings exhibited a robust increase in calcium influx into the MB axons when tested at 9 or 24 hr after training, but not at 3 hr. This modification occurred only in the α branch of the neurons and was blocked by mutation of the amnesiac gene, inhibition of protein synthesis, or the expression of a protein blocker of the transcription factor Creb. Thus, behavioral long-term olfactory memory appears to be encoded as a branch-specific modification of calcium influx into the α/β MB neurons that occurs after spaced training in a protein synthesis-, Creb-, and amnesiac-dependent way."
https://openalex.org/W2035252993,"Dopamine-glutamate interactions in the neostriatum determine psychostimulant action, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here we found that dopamine stimulation by cocaine enhances a heteroreceptor complex formation between dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) and NMDA receptor NR2B subunits in the neostriatum in vivo. The D2R-NR2B interaction is direct and occurs in the confined postsynaptic density microdomain of excitatory synapses. The enhanced D2R-NR2B interaction disrupts the association of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) with NR2B, reduces NR2B phosphorylation at a CaMKII-sensitive site (Ser1303), and inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated currents in medium-sized striatal neurons. Furthermore, the regulated D2R-NR2B interaction is critical for constructing behavioral responsiveness to cocaine. Our findings here uncover a direct and dynamic D2R-NR2B interaction in striatal neurons in vivo. This type of dopamine-glutamate integration at the receptor level may be responsible for synergistically inhibiting the D2R-mediated circuits in the basal ganglia and fulfilling the stimulative effect of psychostimulants."

https://openalex.org/W2003463790,"MDM2 is a critical negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Recently, small-molecule antagonists of MDM2, the Nutlins, have been developed to inhibit the p53-MDM2 interaction and activate p53 signaling. However, half of human cancers have mutated p53 and they are resistant to Nutlin treatment. Here, we report that treatment of the p53-mutant malignant peripheral nerve sheath (MPNST) and p53-null HCT116 cells with cisplatin (Cis) and Nutlin-3a induced a degree of apoptosis that was significantly greater than either drug alone. Nutlin-3a also increased the cytotoxicity of both carboplatin and doxorubicin in a series of p53-mutant human tumor cell lines. In the human dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (LS141) and the p53 wild-type HCT116 cells, Nutlin-3a induced downregulation of E2F1 and this effect appeared to be proteasome dependent. In contrast, in MPNST and HCTp53−/− cells, Nutlin-3a inhibited the binding of E2F1 to MDM2 and induced transcriptional activation of free E2F1 in the presence of Cis-induced DNA damage. Downregulation of E2F1 by small interfering RNA significantly decreased the level of apoptosis induced by Cis and Nutlin-3a treatment. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of E2F1 rescued cells from apoptosis, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type E2F1 showed an increase in cell death. This correlated with the induction of the proapoptotic proteins p73α and Noxa, which are both regulated by E2F1. These results indicate that antagonism of MDM2 by Nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53 enhances chemosensitivity in an E2F1-dependent manner. Nutlin-3a therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in tumors with mutant p53 provided it is combined with chemotherapy."

Next, we show that Kvβ2 axonal targeting depends on its ability to associate with the microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) EB1. Not only do Kvβ2 and EB1 move in unison down the axon, Brefeldin A-sensitive Kv1-containing vesicles can also be found at microtubule ends near the cell membrane.

The typical molecular mass of the polysaccharide ranges from just a few thousand Da (tens of sugars) that are thought to be important in cellular signaling (6Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) to several million Da (tens of thousands of sugars). These larger forms of HA are present throughout the body and are particularly concentrated within the bursa of major joints, such as the knee, where they help to provide shock absorbance in cartilage or lubrication in synovial fluid (9Moller H.J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1998; 58: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Asari A. Miyauchi S. Kuriyama S. Machida A. Kohno K. Uchiyama Y. J. Histochem.

Meyer-Schwickerath G. Regnault F. Sweeney D.B. Mod. Probl. Ophthal. 1972; 10: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar). The adult human body contains ∼15gof HA, of which about 5 g are turned over daily (12Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. Henriksen J.H. Degradation of Bioactive Substances: Physiology and Pathophysiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 249-264Google Scholar). Partially degraded HA perfuses from extracellular matrices (ECMs) and enters the lymphatic and vascular circulation systems, where it is catabolized to shorter fragments. This active maintenance of HA turnover must be efficient in order to maintain homeostatic conditions for total body HA. All of the other GAGs, including the chondroitin sulfates (CSs), heparan sulfate (HS), and keratan sulfate, are linked to core proteins (as proteoglycans) that help to form ECMs, such as the basement membranes of tissues, or structural components of organs, such as the vitreous humor. There are over 30 known core proteins that are essential for a diverse array of functions, such as neural development, growth factor signaling, and pathogen recognition (13Matsui F. Oohira A. Congenit. Anom. (Kyoto). 2004; 44: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These core proteins are found as prevalent components of tissue ECMs or as specialized components needed for the development of microenvironments that interface a specialized tissue cell type with the ECM. Both the proteoglycans and their attached GAG chains may combinatorially interact with ligands and contribute to modulation of the functional aspects of a particular microenvironment (e.g. CS interacting with apolipoprotein E for uptake of β-very low density lipoprotein in hippocampal neurons) (14Carulli D. Laabs T. Geller H.M. Fawcett J.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have focused on how the inhibition of some CS proteoglycans enhances neural development, especially in injured spinal cord models, there is very little information on how CS and HS are catabolized. The current model is that extracellular chondroitinases, heparinases, and proteases initially break down these GAGs and proteoglycans, and their final digestion can then take place intracellularly at the local tissue level. However, in many cases, some of these GAGs and proteoglycan fragments will probably find their way into the lymphatic and circulatory systems, especially during injury or disease. Without some type of efficient GAG-clearing mechanism, these fluid circulatory systems may get overwhelmed with large amounts of debris derived from tissue ECMs throughout the body. Although the synthesis and catabolism of HA are generally the most understood pathways of any of the GAGs, the details of each pathway currently remain largely unknown. In the early 1980s, it was observed that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells endocytose circulating HA (15Tonnaer E.L. Hafmans T.G. Van Kuppevelt T.H. Sanders E.A. Verweij P.E. Curfs J.H.

Degradation of Bioactive Substances: Physiology and Pathophysiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 249-264Google Scholar, 26Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Most of the partially degraded HA perfusing from a tissue ECM encounters this HA receptor first in lymph nodes, which catabolize about 85% of the HA turning over daily. The remaining 15% of the HA drains from the lymphatics into the circulatory system and is removed by the same receptors present in liver sinusoidal endothelium. This rapidly recycling HA receptor is also present in high copy number in spleen, where it presumably mediates additional, but unknown, HA/GAG activities other than systemic clearance. The primary scavenger receptor for systemic HA turnover is HARE. Orthologues of this receptor are present in other mammals, including cow, pig, guinea pig, rat, mouse, and human (27Falkowski M. Schledzewski K. Hansen B. Goerdt S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 120: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

The hHARE is encoded by a single gene found on chromosome 12q23.3 spanning 180.2 kb and containing 69 exons. The gene encodes a 2551-amino acid glycoprotein with a molecular mass of ∼315 kDa in SDS-PAGE. A primary function of this receptor is to bind and internalize HA for turnover, although other GAGs, such as the CSs (20Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. Pertoft H. Smedsrod B. Biochem.

The internalized receptor traffics through the early endocytic pathway and is recycled to the cell surface (21McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem.

A 20-min recycling time was observed for the rat 175-kDa HARE expressed in SK-Hep1 cell lines, whereas a 7–9-min cycle rate was observed with the 190-kDa hHARE expressed in Flp-In 293 cells. These inconsistent receptor recycling times may be dependent on intrinsic cell machinery differences. Although our group has studied the biological activity of rat and human HARE, we have focused primarily on the smaller 190-kDa HARE isoform. Other groups have focused on the full-length HARE in human, mouse, pig, and cattle and overlooked the smaller isoform as a breakdown product or an experimental anomaly. Thus, confusion has arisen about this particular receptor, including the existence of the smaller form (175 kDa in rat, 190 kDa in human), where it comes from, whether it is functional, and, if so, what the biological implications may be (40Smedsrod B. Johansson S. Goerdt S. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 11G-12GCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 12G-13GCrossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). For example, the ratio of rat 175-HARE to 300-HARE in the liver is higher than in the spleen. Thus, the levels of each isoform appear highly regulated (30Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Zhou B. Oka J.A. Singh A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but it is still not known why or how this occurs. We recently confirmed that the 190-kDa hHARE is, in fact, a functional endocytic recycling receptor that can mediate GAG uptake in the absence of the larger 315-kDa hHARE (37Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36201-36209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this report, we stably expressed the recombinant full-length 315-kDa human HARE, using cDNA derived from human lymph node, and show that a small fraction of the total parent receptor is proteolytically cleaved to produce a functional 190-kDa receptor. Thus, the 315-HARE expressed in stable Flp-In 293 cell lines produces two receptors that bind to and internalize HA. The secreted ectodomain of the 315-kDa receptor was glycosylated; was reactive with anti-HARE monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); bound HA, CS-C, CS-D, and CS-E well; and bound more weakly to CS-B and chondroitin. When expressed in Flp-In 293 cells, most of the receptors are found intracellularly, suggesting that as the receptor cycles between plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles, the time spent on the surface is quite short.

We purified DNA from agarose or aqueous solutions using Qbiogene Bio 101 DNA purification kits (Carlsbad, CA). We used either colorimetric or chemiluminescence detection of blotted protein for Western blot analysis.

Construction of the 315-HARE Expression Vector—Due to the large size of the cDNA, the 315-kDa hHARE coding region was amplified from lymph node cDNA pools (Marathon System; BD Biosciences) using pfu Ultra in two sections that overlapped by 484 nucleotides. The 5′-half of the cDNA was amplified using gene-specific forward (5′-GGATCCATGATGCTACAACATTTAGTAATTTTTTGTCTTGG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTCATTATGGAGAAAGAAGCTCAGGAAATAGGAG-3′) primers, whereas the 3′-half of the cDNA was amplified using gene-specific forward (5′-TCCTTACCAAACCTGCTCATGCGGCTGGAACAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGATCCCAGTGTCCTCAAGGGGTCATTGCC-3′) primers. Both cDNA sections were purified, mixed, denatured, and allowed to hybridize together, and the complementary strands were filled in using pfu Ultra. Using the forward primer for the 5′-half and the reverse primer for the 3′-half, we then amplified the entire 315-HARE encoding cDNA (35 cycles, Tm = 55 °C, extension time = 8 min). Immediately following the amplification, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase and 2 mm MgCl2 were added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for 10 min at 72 °C to add free deoxyadenylate on the 3′-ends of the PCR product for compatible cloning in the TOPO line of expression vectors. The PCR product representing the full-length 315-HARE cDNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using a 0.8% (w/v) gel containing 0.002% crystal violet for band visualization. The band was excised with a clean razor blade, gene-cleaned, ligated into pcDNA5/FRT/V5/His6-TOPO, and transformed into TOP10 E. coli cells. Colonies growing on LB-ampicillin plates were screened for cDNA inserts by visualizing total extracted nucleic acid on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Colonies with potential HARE cDNA were verified by PCR using gene-specific forward (5′-GTTCCATCTACGATCGCCACTGGGCCAG-3′) and vector-specific reverse (5′-CGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAG-3′) primers. The complete sequences of the promoter and complete coding regions of cDNAs in the final clones were determined to be correct before they were used in subsequent experiments. This full-length HARE DNA sequence obtained was identical to that of NCBI accession entry NM_017564 with the exception of silent mutations located at codons 833, 1112, 1700, 1937, 2005, and 2175 and one missense mutation, which created a D1276A mutation. However, Ala1276 was reported in an earlier entry for stabilin-2 (accession number AJ295695) and was also present in the 190 hHARE clones reported by Harris et al. (37Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36201-36209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The D1276A change does not appear to affect the biological activity of the receptor and probably represents a polymorphism in the human STAB2 gene. All protein expression experiments were performed using this NM_017564-like cDNA. Selection and Verification of 315-hHARE Cell Lines—Cell lines were produced and characterized as described by Harris et al. (37Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36201-36209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Flp-In 293 cells (3 × 106; Invitrogen) were plated in a 100-mm dish 2 days prior to transfection. Cells incubating in 10 ml of fresh antibiotic-free DMEM supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum were transfected by the addition of 750 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 1.0 μg of pcDNA5/FRT/315-HARE V5/His6, 9.0 μgof pOG44 (encoding the Flp-In recombinase) and 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Starting 24–36 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced every 2–3 days with DMEM plus 8% FBS containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Visible circular colonies were present about 2 weeks post-transfection and isolated using a P20 pipette with P200 tips. About 40 colonies were isolated by gently nudging with the tip while aspirating no more than 10 μl at a time. Medium on the plate was changed after picking every five colonies to reduce the chance of aspirating free-floating cells. Isolated colonies were grown in 24-well dishes in DMEM plus 8% FBS with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. After a monolayer of cells had developed from each clone, cells were scraped in 1 ml of medium and partitioned into four portions. One portion (100 μl) was reseeded in fresh medium and allowed to continue growing in the 24-well dish. The second portion (100 μl) was reseeded in 100 μg/ml zeocin to test for zeocin sensitivity. The third portion (400 μl) was pelleted and resuspended in 50 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) to test for HARE expression by SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis using anti-V5 antibody. The remaining 400 μl of cell suspension was pelleted and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. In addition to the zeocin sensitivity test, the β-galactosidase test indicates whether the HARE-encoding plasmid integrated specifically and correctly into the genomic FRT site, which is the unique feature of the Flp-In cell line series. The cell pellet for this assay was resuspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 μl of cell lysate per well of a 96-well plate was combined with 70 μl of Z-buffer and 20 μl of 4.0 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside in Z-buffer. After 15–30 min at 37 °C, the absorbance values were measured at 405–420 nm. Lysates from HEK Flp-In 293 and HEK 293 cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Stable cell lines were selected for further study only if they grew well in DMEM containing 8% FBS and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B and showed HARE expression, hygromycin B resistance, zeocin sensitivity, no β-galactosidase activity, and normal cell morphology as determined by phase-contrast microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2086681358,"As different classes of sensory neurons project into the CNS, their axons segregate and establish distinct trajectories and target zones. One striking instance of axonal segregation is the projection of sensory neurons into the spinal cord, where proprioceptive axons avoid the superficial dorsal horn-the target zone of many cutaneous afferent fibers. PlexinA1 is a proprioceptive sensory axon-specific receptor for sema6C and sema6D, which are expressed in a dynamic pattern in the dorsal horn. The loss of plexinA1 signaling causes the shafts of proprioceptive axons to invade the superficial dorsal horn, disrupting the organization of cutaneous afferents. This disruptive influence appears to involve the intermediary action of oligodendrocytes, which accompany displaced proprioceptive axon shafts into the dorsal horn. Our findings reveal a dedicated program of axonal shaft positioning in the mammalian CNS and establish a role for plexinA1-mediated axonal exclusion in organizing the projection pattern of spinal sensory afferents."
https://openalex.org/W2054085911,"Periventricular heterotopia (PVH) is a congenital malformation of human cerebral cortex frequently associated with Filamin-A (FLN-A) mutations but the pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the MEKK4 (MAP3K4) pathway is involved in Fln-A regulation and PVH formation. MEKK4−/− mice developed PVH associated with breaches in the neuroependymal lining which were largely comprised of neurons that failed to reach the cortical plate. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting MEKK4 also impaired neuronal migration. Expression of Fln was elevated in MEKK4−/− forebrain, most notably near sites of failed neuronal migration. Importantly, recombinant MKK4 protein precipitated a complex containing MEKK4 and Fln-A, and MKK4 mediated signaling between MEKK4 and Fln-A, suggesting that MKK4 may bridge these molecules during development. Finally, we showed that wild-type FLN-A overexpression inhibited neuronal migration. Collectively, our results demonstrate a link between MEKK4 and Fln-A that impacts neuronal migration initiation and provides insight into the pathogenesis of human PVH."
https://openalex.org/W2070605762,"The biological behaviors of thyroid cancer are varied, and the pathological mechanisms remain unclear. Some reports indicated an apparent aggregation of amyloid accompanying medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Amyloid aggregation in neurodegeneration leads to hyperactivation of Cdk5 and subsequent neuronal death. Based on the connection with amyloid, the role of Cdk5 in MTC is worthy of investigation. Initially, the expression of Cdk5 and its activator, p35, in MTC cell lines was identified. Cdk5 inhibition by specific inhibitors or short interfering RNA decreased the proliferation of MTC cell lines, which reveals the importance of Cdk5 in MTC cell growth. Although p35 cleavage has been considered as an important element in neurodegeneration, it seems that p35 cleavage was not a major cause in Cdk5 activity-dependent MTC cell proliferation because neither Cdk5 activity nor cell growth was affected by the inhibition of p35 cleavage. Clearance of amyloid by antibody neutralization indicated that MTC cell proliferation was supported by calcitonin-derived extracellular amyloid and subsequent Her2 and Cdk5 activation. Significantly, the STAT3 pathway was involved in Cdk5-dependent proliferation of MTC cells through Ser-727 phosphorylation. In addition, Cdk5 inhibition reduced nuclear distributions of both the Cdk5-p35 complex and phospho-STAT3 in MTC cells. Finally, Cdk5 inhibition retarded tumor formation in vivo accompanying the reduction of phospho-STAT3. Our findings suggest the first demonstration of a novel and specific role for Cdk5 kinase in supporting the proliferation of the medullary thyroid carcinoma cells and could shed light on a new field for diagnosis and therapy of thyroid cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999312196,"Ceramides are vital components of the water barrier in mammalian skin. Epidermis-specific, a major ceramide portion contains ω-hydroxy very long chain fatty acids (C30–C36). These ω-hydroxy ceramides (Cers) are found in the extracellular lamellae of the stratum corneum either as linoleic acyl esters or protein bound. Glucosylceramide is the major glycosphingolipid of the epidermis. Synthesized from ceramide and UDP-glucose, it is thought to be itself an intracellular precursor and carrier for extracellular ω-hydroxy ceramides. To investigate whether GlcCer is an obligatory intermediate in ceramide metabolism to maintain epidermal barrier function, a mouse with an epidermis-specific glucosylceramide synthase (Ugcg) deficiency has been generated. Four days after birth animals devoid of GlcCer synthesis in keratinocytes showed a pronounced desquamation of the stratum corneum and extreme transepidermal water loss leading to death. The stratum corneum appeared as a thick unstructured mass. Lamellar bodies of the stratum granulosum did not display the usual ordered inner structure and were often irregularly arranged. Although the total amount of epidermal protein-bound ceramides remained unchanged, epidermal-free ω-hydroxy ceramides increased 4-fold and ω-hydroxy sphingomyelins, almost not detectable in wild type epidermis, emerged in quantities comparable with lost GlcCer.

In this report we focus on the function of GlcCer in skin.Land dwelling animals have a water and electrolyte barrier in the skin to prevent dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Both membrane proteins of keratinocytes and lipids generated in the epidermis are important for maintenance of the skin barrier and, therefore, for the impermeability of the skin to water. Ceramides (Cers) constitute a major component of the lipid barrier. They are synthesized by amidation of sphingoid bases with long chain fatty acids at the endoplasmic reticulum. Conversion into GlcCer by Ugcg takes place at the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus (4Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).GlcCers are the dominant glycosphingolipids of the epidermis and constitute ∼4% of the total epidermal lipid mass (6Madison K.C. Wertz P.W. Strauss J.S. Downing D.T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 253-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). They are thought to act as an intracellular carrier for secreted ceramides and constitute the main components of lamellar bodies (LBs) (7Doering T. Proia R.L. Sandhoff K.

LBs are found in cells of the upper stratum granulosum and are extruded into the extracellular cleft of the stratum corneum interstices by exocytosis (10Bouwstra J.A. Honeywell-Nguyen P.L. Gooris G.S. Ponec M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 11Madison K.C. J. Investig.

In the presence of its activator protein saposin C, β-glucocerebrosidase catalyzes the release of ceramides from GlcCer in the extracellular space (9Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Menon G.K. Legler G.

At the ω-position, many of the latter are additionally esterified with linoleic acid (EOS-Cer and -GlcCer) (6Madison K.C. Wertz P.W. Strauss J.S. Downing D.T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 253-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Doering T. Holleran W.M. Potratz A. Vielhaber G. Elias P.M. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). EOS- and POS-Cers as well as their corresponding GlcCers seem to be important contributors to the extremely hydrophobic extracellular lipid lamellae of the stratum corneum (15Candi E. Schmidt R. Melino G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). It has not been conclusively shown whether indeed all sphingolipid components (Cers, GlcCers, and sphingomyelins) or merely one or two of them are needed for maintenance of the epidermal water barrier. A deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase or a deficiency of its sphingolipid activator protein saposin C in epidermis led to strong reduction of ceramides concomitant with an accumulation of GlcCers including the protein-bound fraction, suggesting GlcCer as a precursor of Cer, impairing the skin barrier function (7Doering T. Proia R.L. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Doering T. Holleran W.M. Potratz A. Vielhaber G. Elias P.M. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Therefore, a keratinocyte-specific deficiency of glucosylceramide synthase was generated.In the epidermis the genes expressing keratins K5 and K14 are expressed in basal cells (16Byrne C. Tainsky M.

Because of its early expression in the basal layer, the keratin K14 promoter seems optimal to express Cre recombinase to achieve epidermis-specific gene deficiencies (18Huelsken J. Vogel R.

Protein-bound ceramides were not reduced, and free and esterified ω-hydroxy sphingomyelins were synthesized as functionally insufficient substitutes of GlcCer. Our data document for the first time that an intact stratum corneum with an ordered lipid arrangement depending on GlcCer-formation is vital for skin barrier function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransgenic Animals—Mice with loxP-flanked exons 6–8 of the Ugcg gene locus were generated as described (2Jennemann R. Sandhoff R. Wang S. Kiss E. Gretz N. Zuliani C. Martin-Villalba A. Jager R. Schorle H. Kenzelmann M. Bonrouhi M. Wiegandt H. Grone H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12459-12464Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B). Generation of mutant animals and experiments were performed according to federal laws for animal experiments and approved (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany).For the generation of mice with the Ugcg gene deletion in the epidermis, homozygous floxed mice were crossed with K14-constitutive Cre animals (18Huelsken J. Vogel R. Erdmann B. Cotsarelis G. Birchmeier W. Cell. 2001; 105: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). In a second mating step, heterozygous floxed mice with the respective K14 promoted Cre transgene were mated again with homozygous floxed Ugcgflox/flox mice, resulting in epidermal cell-specific glycosylceramide synthase-deficient Ugcgflox/flox//K14Cre mice.Genotyping of Mutant Mice—PCR and Southern blot analysis of tail biopsies were performed for confirmation of the wild type, floxed, and null allele (see Fig. 1C). For PCR, the following primers were used: Ugcg wild type forward, 5′-GATCTA AGAGGGTGAAGGCGCA-3′; wild type/Ugcg-flox reversed, 5′-AAGCCAGTCCAGTCAAACCGAG-3′; Ugcg-null reversed, 5′-CTGCCTTGCAATCCTGTCTGTC-3′. PCR products of 259, 383, and 458 bp indicated the wild type, floxed, and null alleles (see Fig. 1C, upper).The constitutive K14Cre transgene was determined using the primers K14Cre forward, 5′-ATTGCCAGGATCAGGGTTAAAGA-3′, and K14Cre, reverse, 5′-CCCGGCAAAACAGGTAGTTATTC-3′. A 200-bp PCR product was indicative for the K14Cre transgene (see Fig. 1C, lower image).The data obtained from PCR were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis after BglII restriction digestion using a digoxigenin-labeled 3′ “outside” southern probe amplified according to the protocol of the DIG Probe Synthesis Kit and DIG Luminescent detection kit (Roche Applied Science).mRNA Isolation, Analysis, Profile—Skins were prepared from decapitated animals at different time points after birth. Adhering adipose tissue was removed. The epidermis was separated from the dermis after incubation with 0.5 m ammonium thiocyanate in 0.1 m potassium sodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 6.8, for 30 min on ice according to Diaz et al. (21Diaz L.A. Heaphy M.R. Calvanico N.J. Tomasi T.B. Jordon R.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1977; 68: 36-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Total mRNA was extracted using the RNA easy kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was done using the LC-fast DNA Master SYBR Green I kit PCR for the LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) as described, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as reference gene (2Jennemann R.

Rygiel T.P. Olivo C. van der Kammen R. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tissue was lyophilized, and glycosphingolipids were extracted from epidermis essentially according to Doering et al. (12Doering T. Holleran W.M. Potratz A. Vielhaber G. Elias P.M. Suzuki K.

The samples were treated under sonification at 50 °C for 15 min and subsequently centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was taken, and pellets were extracted two additional times as described using the solvent mixtures chloroform/methanol/distilled water, 10:10:1, and chloroform/methanol, 2:1 by vol. Supernatants were combined with the previous fractions. For further purification, an aliquot of the extract pool was further purified by saponification under mild alkaline conditions followed by desalting using reversed phase RP-18 columns of 200 μl of volume as described (23Jennemann R.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7444-7449PubMed Google Scholar).For the extraction of protein-bound sphingolipids, pellets, which were obtained after extraction above, were treated 3 times with 2 ml of 100% methanol at room temperature for 10 min followed by two additional extraction steps with 2 ml of 95% methanol in H20 at 60 °C for 2 h to remove residual free lipids. The respective supernatants were taken after centrifugation as described, and the absence of free ceramides in the final supernatant was confirmed by nano-ESI-MS/MS analyses.From the residual pellet, protein-bound sphingolipids were cleaved after treatment with 1 ml of 1 m KOH in 95% methanol at 60 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were taken as described, neutralized with 1 m acetic acid, and dried and desalted using reversed phase RP-18 columns of 100 μl of volume as described (23Jennemann R. Mennel H.D. Bauer B.L. Wiegandt H. Acta Neurochir. 1994; 126: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).TLC running solvents used were chloroform/methanol/water 65:25:4 (see Fig. 2, A and B) and chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid 190:9:1 (used twice; see Fig. 2, C and E). The amounts spotted corresponded to extracts from 1 mg of dry epidermis. Visualization was performed with 0.2% orcinol in 10% sulfuric acid, 120 °C, 10 min (TLC, see Fig. 2A) and 10% CuSO4 in 8% H3PO4 at 180 °C for 10 min (TLC, see Fig. 2, B, C, and E).FIGURE 2Lipid analysis by TLC and ESI-MS/MS. A–C, TLC of crude epidermal extracts. GlcCer is almost completely depleted (A), and SM (B) is slightly altered already at the age P2 due to a shift to SM with very long chain fatty acids. Epidermal ceramides showed no significant alterations in TLC analysis (C). Chol, cholesterol. DAG, diacylglycerol. St., standards. D, quantification of total GlcCer in epidermal extracts at different time points by densitometry. Partial, however significant deletion of GlcCer could be seen at P0 (p < 0.01). Approximately 80% was deleted at P2 (p < 0.0009). Animals reached the highest degree of GlcCer deletion shortly before death (95%, p < 0.0002), n = 4). f, flox; +, wild type. E, no significant changes could be seen in the protein-bound lipids. PS, phosphocholine; FFA, free fatty acid. F–H, quantification of sphingolipids from epidermal extracts at P4 by nano-ESI-MS/MS. GlcCer, as already shown by TLC (A), was drastically reduced in mutant mice (p < 0.0009 for NS/AS and p < 0.03 for EOS; F). ω-Hydroxy long chain fatty acid ceramides (OS) accumulated significantly due to Ugcg-deficiency in the epidermis (p < 0.002; G), but no differences were observed for esterified (EOS) and protein-bound (POS). Lack of GlcCer was partly substituted by sphingomyelin for ω-hydroxy and linoleic acid-esterified very long chain fatty acids (SM-OS/EOS; p < 0.02 and p < 0.05; H).

In brief, animals at P4 were sacrificed with CO2, briefly washed with 70% ethanol, and incubated in 1 mm Lucifer yellow (Sigma) dissolved in isotonic NaCl at 37 °C for 1 h. The solution was removed, and bodies were incubated for one additional hour at 37 °C in the dark. Subsequently, skin sections were mounted, and slices with a thickness of 5 μm were prepared. Nuclear counterstaining was performed using DRAQ5 (Alexis, San Diego, CA), and slices were investigated by confocal laser microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).Determination of Transepidermal Water Loss—Transepidermal water loss was measured using a Tewameter® TM 300 (Courage-Khazaka Electronics, Cologne, Germany) as described (27Herrmann T. van der Hoeven F.

Tissue was embedded in paraffin wax. Sections of 3-μm thickness were stained by hematoxylin (HE), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Goldner trichrome. Tissues from same locations were immediately frozen in isopentane precooled with liquid nitrogen. Cryo-conserved skin sections (5 μm) were used for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy for membrane-associated proteins and cytoskeleton components (27Herrmann T. van der Hoeven F. Grone H.J.

The secondary antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence were goat anti-guinea pig, anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse immunoglobulins coupled to Cy3 (1:300, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) or Alexa 568 (1:200; Invitrogen).Furthermore, rat anti-mouse Ki67, (1:200, DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), rat anti-mouse HR3, (1:50, Acris, Hiddenhausen, Germany), and rat anti-mouse F4/80, (1:2000, Serotech, Düsseldorf, Germany) as well as a biotinylated secondary rabbit anti-rat antibodies (1:200) and alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin, (1:200, Vector BA-4001, Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA) were used for immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections fixed either in paraformaldehyde or in zinc buffer. Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling was performed according to the instructions of the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science).Electron Microscopy—Freshly dissected skin sections were fixed in 0.5% ruthenium tetroxide, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.2 m cacodylate buffer pH 7.2, 1:1:1 v/v, and embedded in araldite (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). For detection of lamellar bodies, tissues were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min followed by 0.5% ruthenium tetroxide (Polysciences, Eppelheim, Germany) for 1 h. Ultrathin sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Photographs were taken with a digital camera mounted on an electron microscope (Zeiss EM 9000, Carl Zeiss Inc. Germany).Statistics—All experiments were done at least twice, and statistics were calculated using Student's unpaired t test.RESULTSSkin-specific Glycosphingolipid Deletion in Mice—Offspring with the deleted Ugcg gene in the epidermis, Ugcgflox/flox//K14Cre (mutant), were born according to Mendelian inheritance constituting ∼25% of the litter, indicating no prenatal death.Southern blot analysis showed an approximately 70% deletion of the Ugcg gene locus in the epidermis of newborn mice at P0 (Fig. 1D). An almost complete deletion of the gene was observed at P4 (Fig. 1D), and minimal mRNA expression could be demonstrated using real time reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1E). Residual Ugcg DNA and mRNA might be explained by expression in non-keratinocyte cells in which the K14 promoter is not active, e.g. Langerhans cells.Glucosylceramide Was Deleted in the Epidermis of Ugcg-deficient Mice—DNA and mRNA levels of the glucosylceramide synthase were negligibly low in epidermis of mutant mice at P4 (Fig. 1, D and E). The enzyme product, GlcCer, was determined at different days after birth. The total GlcCer content in epidermis of control animals decreased approximately by 40% within the first 4 days after birth (Fig. 2, A and D, controls).Compared with controls, a significant decrease (42%) of GlcCer could be seen in the epidermis of animals with Ugcg gene deletion at P0, p < 0.01 (Fig. 2, A and D, P0). Two days after birth, epidermal GlcCer was reduced by 80% in Ugcg-deficient mice compared with their respective controls, p < 0.0009 (Fig. 2, A and D, P2). The highest degree of GlcCer reduction of ∼95%, which correlated well with very low DNA and mRNA levels of Ugcg, could be measured shortly before most animals died at P4 and P5, p < 0.0002 (Fig. 2, A and D, P4).Free (Fig. 2, B and C) and protein-bound epidermal sphingolipids (Fig. 2E) were analyzed by TLC. In the SM pattern a slight decrease of the slow migrating SM band could be seen in Ugcg-deficient epidermis at P2/P4 (Fig. 2B) that correlates with a 50% decrease of α-hydroxy palmitoyl containing sphingomyelin measured by mass spectrometry. In the ceramide pattern slight quantitative differences occurred (Fig. 2C). A TLC of the protein-bound epidermal lipids reflected no striking changes in lipid compositions between wild type and mutant mice (Fig. 2E).To analyze changes of sphingolipid subpopulations grouped according to their fa"
https://openalex.org/W2024772624,"Morphogens are secreted signalling molecules that govern many developmental processes1. In the Drosophila wing disc, the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) homologue Decapentaplegic (Dpp) forms a smooth gradient and specifies cell fate by conferring a defined value of morphogen activity. Thus, neighbouring cells have similar amounts of Dpp protein, and if a sharp discontinuity in Dpp activity is generated between these cells, Jun kinase (JNK)-dependent apoptosis is triggered to restore graded positional information2,3. To date, it has been assumed that this apoptotic process is only activated when normal signalling is distorted. However, we now show that a similar process occurs during normal development: rupture in Dpp activity occurs during normal segmentation of the distal legs of Drosophila. This sharp boundary of Dpp signalling, independently of the absolute level of Dpp activity, induces a JNK—reaper-dependent apoptosis required for the morphogenesis of a particular structure of the leg, the joint. Our results show that Dpp could induce a developmental programme not only in a concentration dependent manner, but also by the creation of a sharp boundary of Dpp activity. Furthermore, the same process could be used either to restore a normal pattern in response to artificial disturbance or to direct a morphogenetic process."

Urokinase receptors bind urokinase and a set of β1 integrins, but it remains unclear to what degree urokinase receptor/integrin binding is important to β1 integrin signaling. Using site-directed mutagenesis, single amino acid mutants of the urokinase receptor were identified that fail to associate with either α3β1 (D262A) or α5β1 (H249A) but associate normally with urokinase. To study the effects of these mutations on β1 integrin function, endogenous urokinase receptors were first stably silenced in tumor cell lines HT1080 and H1299, and then wild type or mutant receptors were expressed. Knockdown of urokinase receptors resulted in markedly reduced fibronectin and α5β1-dependent ERK activation and metalloproteinase MMP-9 expression. Re-expression of wild type or D262A mutant receptors but not the α5β1 binding-deficient H249A mutant reconstituted fibronectin responses. Because urokinase receptor·α5β1 complexes bind in the fibronectin heparin-binding domain (Type III 12–14) whereas α5β1 primarily binds in the RGD-containing domain (Type III 7–10), signaling pathways leading to ERK and MMP-9 responses were dissected. Binding to III 7–10 led to Src/focal adhesion kinase activation, whereas binding to III 7–14 caused Rac 1 activation. Tumor cells engaging fibronectin required both Type III 7–10- and 12–14-initiated signals to activate ERK and up-regulate MMP-9. Thus urokinase receptor binding to α5β1 is required for maximal responses to fibronectin and tumor cell invasion, and this operates through an enhanced Src/Rac/ERK signaling pathway.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) established that signaling through the fibronectin receptor induces up-regulation of several MMPs. More recently, signaling mechanisms that underlie these effects and a role for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) system in MMP expression have begun to emerge. Cell adhesion on fibronectin (Fn) induces MMP-9 expression, and this induction requires α5β1 integrin (34Xie B. Laouar A. Huberman E. J. Biol.

Kikkawa F. Ichigotani Y. Zhang Y. Sein T.T. Amin A.R. Hamaguchi M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and Rac activation could enhance the association of ERK2 with MEK1, promoting MAPK activity (40Eblen S.T. Slack J.K. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6023-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The uPA system and MMP-9 are both overexpressed in malignant tumors and highly correlated with cancer metastasis (41Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 42Ahmed N. Pansino F. Baker M. Rice G. Quinn M. J. Cell.

Sci. 1999; 878: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but also appears to be involved in regulating MMP-9 production. Suppression of uPAR by an antisense approach in a colon cancer cell line or disruption of uPAR·β1 integrin complex by a uPAR binding peptide, P25, resulted in complete inhibition of pro-MMP-9 secretion and decrease of basal or uPA-induced ERK activation (10Ahmed N. Oliva K. Wang Y. Quinn M. Rice G. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 89: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although uPAR expression is reported to activate Rac and promote cell motility (45Vial E. Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 67-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the role of uPAR or uPAR/α5β1 in Fn-induced MMP-9 production has not been explored, and mechanisms underlying Rac activation via uPAR are unknown. Fn has been shown to regulate multiple cellular functions including gene expression, survival, and cytoskeleton organization through interaction with its principal cell surface receptor, α5β1 (46Mao Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Fn contains NH2-, gelatin-, cell-, and COOH-terminal heparin-binding domains. The central cell-binding domain of fibronectin (CBD) has an RGD sequence in domain III 10 recognized by α5β1 integrin, and several sites in the COOH-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin (HepII) also interact with the cell surface with varying affinities (47Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 48Walker A. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 49Kim J. Han I. Kim Y. Kim S. Oh E.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent data indicate that direct binding of uPAR with α5β1 forms an additional binding site within the HepII that is RGD-independent (25Wei Y. Czekay R.P. Robillard L. Kugler M.C. Zhang F. Kim K.K. Xiong J.P. Humphries M.J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been documented that signaling events are often mediated by two different but adjacent sites within Fn. Fibroblasts plated on the HepII induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, whereas cells plated on the CBD require additional signals from HepII to form focal adhesions and stress fibers (50Bloom L. Ingham K.C. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1521-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 51Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, in some systems both CBD and HepII cooperatively regulate p125FAK activity, affecting cell survival (52Jeong J. Han I. Lim Y. Kim J. Park I. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Oh E.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations invite the hypothesis that the second binding site on Fn created by uPAR/α5β1 association is critical for Fn signaling and enhanced protease expression and raise the possibility that invasive tumor cells are addicted to this pathway for their malignant phenotype. In this study, we tested these hypotheses by generating stable knockdown of uPAR in invasive tumor cell lines of different origins and then reintroducing point mutants of uPAR with selective defects in α5β1 binding. This allowed us to dissociate the capacity of uPAR to bind uPA from its direct binding of α5β1 and to dissect the signaling pathways initiated by direct binding of uPAR to the integrin. We demonstrate that suppression of uPAR expression in tumor cells reduces α5β1/Fn-dependent induction of ERK activation and MMP-9 secretion. Reconstitution of signaling requires expression of uPAR capable of α5β1 binding. Because uPAR/α5β1 binds Fn HepII (III 12–14) whereas α5β1 primarily binds the RGD sequence in Fn fragment III 7–10, we tested whether ERK and MMP-9 responses are binding site-dependent. Our results demonstrate that Fn adhesion-mediated ERK activation and MMP-9 up-regulation require cell engagement with both RGD and HepII sites on Fn either as a single fusion protein or as separate polypeptides. For the first time, we show that uPAR is required for maximal α5β1-dependent responses to Fn that promote tumor cell invasion, and this operates through integration of two signals initiated by cell engagement to the HepII and RGD sites on Fn by uPAR-bound and unbound α5β1. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 and lung cancer cell lines H1299 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Fn, an NH2-terminal 70-kDa Fn fragment, vitronectin (Vn), collagen type I, anti-β-actin mAb, peptides GRGDSPK and GRADSPK, and 0.01% polylysine solution were purchased from Sigma.

Anti-integrin α3 pAb (D23) was a kind gift from Dr. Martin E. Hemler (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Anti-paxillin, anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr-397), anti-FAK, anti-phospho-ERK, and anti-ERK antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-human Fc-HRP was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Dominant negative Rac 1 construct was kindly provided by Dr. Henry Bourne (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Anti-Rac 1 mAb was purchased from Upstate (Chicago, IL). Generation of Stable uPAR Knockdown Cells—pSicoR-GFP (kindly provided by Dr. Michael McManus, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was used for the construction of a plasmid expressing siRNA for uPAR downstream of a mouse U6 promoter and GFP gene downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. A validated siRNA target sequence (45Vial E. Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 67-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) was used for uPAR RNAi: GGTGAAGAAGGGCGTCCAA. Two complementary oligonucleotides, XhoI-(target sense)-TTCAAGAGA-(target antisense)-TTTTTT-HpaI and HpaI-AAAAAA-(target sense)-TCTCTTGAA-(target antisense)-XhoI, were synthesized for each target sequence and annealed in vitro. The annealed complementary oligonucleotides for uPAR were inserted into the HpaI and XhoI sites of pSicoR-GFP vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. These plasmids produce short hairpin RNAs with the linker sequence (TTCAAGAGA) forming a loop structure, and then the linker is processed by Dicer, forming a double-stranded RNA that acts as a siRNA. Expression of Wild Type and Mutant uPARs in uPAR Knockdown Cells—To express wild type (WT) or mutant (mut) uPARs in cells already expressing uPAR RNAi, we introduced three silent mutations in the siRNA uPAR-targeting region and used this as the template uPAR cDNA for Ala point mutations. Preliminary experiments varying the number of silent bp substitutions determined that 3-bp substitutions in the targeting region produced optimal expression in the presence of uPAR RNAi. The point mutations on uPAR were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a PCR megaprimer procedure using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and pcDNA-uPAR as a template as described previously (53Costa G.L. Bauer J.C. McGowan B. Angert M. Weiner M.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar). All the mutated DNAs containing the desired mutation(s) were introduced into pCEP4 for expression. The PCR-generated sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The uPAR knockdown cells expressing WT or mut (H249A or D262A) uPARs were stably selected and sorted. Protein expression was verified by FACS analysis and/or Western blot. Adhesion Assay—Cells were seeded onto Fn or Vn (5 μg/ml)-coated plates and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without peptides for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, attached cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa. The data were quantified by measuring absorbance at 550 nm as described previously (26Wei Y. Eble J.A. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Chapman H.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2975-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). TaqMan Quantitative PCR—Verification of transcript quantity in several selected cDNAs was performed using TaqMan real time PCR. The primer pairs and probe for each cDNA were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The quantification was performed using the standard protocol of ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Gelatin Zymography—Cells were starved and seeded on Fn or Fn fragment-(5 μg/ml), Vn-(5 μg/ml), collagen I-(5 μg/ml), or polylysine (50 μg/ml)-coated wells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.01% BSA for 24 h. The conditioned media were collected, centrifuged, and frozen until use. 10 μl of conditioned medium were separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE gel containing 1% gelatin (Invitrogen) under non-reducing conditions. The gels were rinsed in renaturing buffer (2.5% Triton X-100); developed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3; stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to indicate MMP-9 clear bands; and imaged. Recombinant MMP-9 was used as positive control. In some cases, cells were treated with different inhibitors during a 24-h incubation: MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm), EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (1 μm), and peptide β1P1 or its scrambled control scβ1P1 (0.4 mm). Flow Cytometry—Stable clones expressing siRNA uPAR and WT or mut uPAR were stained with primary antibody to uPAR and secondary allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur®,BD Biosciences). Isolation of various uPAR-expressing cell lines was done by high throughput cell sorting (MoFlo, Dako). uPAR Ligand Binding Assay—All the procedures were done in triplicate at 4 °C. Control cells, cells with uPAR silencing, and uPAR knockdown cells reconstituted with WT or mut uPAR were plated to form a monolayer, acid-washed, and incubated with NH2-terminal fragment of uPA 1–48-Fc fusion protein (100 nm). The cells were then incubated with anti-Fc-HRP in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.02% BSA for 1 h. After washing, the bound 1–48-Fc was detected by HRP substrates and quantified by measuring A490 nm. Western Blot—Control cells and cells with uPAR silencing or uPAR knockdown cells reconstituted with WT or mut uPAR were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of protein were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blotted for uPAR using primary anti-uPAR mAb and secondary anti-mouse-HRP conjugated antibody. The same membrane was blotted for β-actin as loading control. Kinase and Rac Activity Assays—Cells were serum-starved for 4 h and seeded on Fn-, Vn-, or polylysine-coated 6-well plates for 20 min. After incubating with or without treatment, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were immunoblotted for phospho-ERK or FAK and total ERK or FAK. For Rac pulldown assays, cells were lysed in cold Rac assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2,1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate plus protease inhibitors). Lysates were then incubated with purified glutathione S-transferase-p21-activated kinase 1 protein-p21-binding domain (GST-PAK-PBD) beads (54Schmitz U. Thommes K. Beier I. Wagner W. Sachinidis A. Dusing R. Vetter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22003-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) for 30 min and washed three times with Rac assay buffer. The bead-bound active Rac and total Rac in the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Rac mAb. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to integrin α5 (P1D6) or α3 (P1B5). The immunoprecipitates were blotted for uPAR or integrins (pAb). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells plated on Fn-coated chambered slides were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and blocked with 10% horse serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were stained with primary anti-paxillin antibody and Cy3-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody or phalloidin-Texas Red. Slides were incubated with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole before mounting in Prolong (Molecular Probes). uPAR has been shown previously to regulate α5β1 conformation and binding to Fn (25Wei Y. Czekay R.P. Robillard L. Kugler M.C. Zhang F. Kim K.K. Xiong J.P. Humphries M.J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, most malignant tumor cells already express high levels of uPAR (55de Bock C.E. Wang Y. Med. Res. Rev. 2004; 24: 13-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to test the role of uPAR on the regulation of α5β1/Fn-mediated signaling in tumor cells expressing uPAR. The expression of endogenous uPAR was knocked down using RNA interference with short hairpin (sh) RNA in HT1080 and H1299 cells by transfection with pSicoR-GFP-shRNA uPAR (uPAR knockdown) or control vector pSicoR-GFP (control). A pool of GFP-positive and low uPAR-expressing cells were sorted, and uPAR expression was inspected by Western blot (Fig. 1A) or FACS (see Fig. 4C). Because both HT1080 and H1299 cells attach to Fn via α5β1 (Fig. 1C), we tested the effect of uPAR suppression on Fn adhesion. Although uPAR expression does not affect overall Fn adhesion on high concentrations of Fn, reductions in uPAR protein levels resulted in a conversion from RGD-resistant to RGD-sensitive adhesion to Fn (Fig. 1B). These data are consistent with prior observations in tumor cells transiently transfected with synthetic siRNA uPAR (25Wei Y. Czekay R.P. Robillard L. Kugler M.C. Zhang F. Kim K.K. Xiong J.P. Humphries M.J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Conversely overexpression of wild type uPAR in uPAR knockdown cells restored RGD-resistant Fn adhesion (see Fig. 5B).FIGURE 4Expression of wild type and mutant uPARs that are able to escape siRNA targeting.

To identify novel interacting partners that might regulate GABAB receptor (GABABR) functionality, we screened the GABABR2 carboxyl terminus against a recently created proteomic array of 96 distinct PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology) domains. The screen identified three specific PDZ domains that exhibit interactions with GABABR2: Mupp1 PDZ13, PAPIN PDZ1, and Erbin PDZ. Biochemical analysis confirmed that full-length Mupp1 and PAPIN interact with GABABR2 in cells. Disruption of the GABABR2 interaction with PDZ scaffolds by a point mutation to the carboxyl terminus of the receptor dramatically decreased receptor stability and attenuated the duration of GABAB receptor signaling. The effects of mutating the GABABR2 carboxyl terminus on receptor stability and signaling were mimicked by small interference RNA knockdown of endogenous Mupp1. These findings reveal that GABAB receptor stability and signaling can be modulated via GABABR2 interactions with the PDZ scaffold protein Mupp1, which may contribute to cell-specific regulation of GABAB receptors in the central nervous system. γ-Aminobutyric acid, type B (GABAB) receptors are heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptors that mediate slow inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system.

They belong to G protein-coupled receptor Family C and bear a high degree of homology to other family members such as the metabotropic glutamate receptors, calcium receptor, and vomeronasal receptors. GABAB receptors are believed to be heterodimeric combinations of two G protein-coupled receptors, GABABR1 and GABABR2 (2Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P. Mosbacher J.

Heterodimerization of GABABR1 and GABABR2 is necessary for the proper trafficking of GABABR1 to the cell surface (5Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

In the context of the heterodimer, GABABR1 is thought to bind the ligand (7Galvez T. Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Malitschek B. Kaupmann K. Kuhn R. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Pin J.P. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Given that GABAB receptors are important therapeutic targets for a wide variety of diseases, including depression, anxiety, epilepsy, and drug addiction (12Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Bowery N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Bowery N.G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), understanding GABAB receptor signaling and regulation is of significant clinical interest. The cloning of the GABAB receptors has advanced the study of the GABAB receptors substantially over the past decade. However, some discrepancies between the properties of native GABAB receptors and heterologously expressed recombinant receptors still remain. For example, GABAB receptors in native tissue undergo robust endocytosis and desensitization (14Perroy J. Adam L. Qanbar R. Chenier S. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3816-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas recombinant GABABR1/GABABR2 expressed in most heterologous cells neither internalize nor desensitize (14Perroy J. Adam L. Qanbar R. Chenier S. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3816-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Fairfax B.P. Pitcher J.A. Scott M.G. Calver A.R. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. Couve A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12565-12573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for such discrepancies is that GABAB receptor signaling and trafficking properties are highly dependent on cellular context. This implies that interaction with differentially expressed cellular proteins might modulate GABAB receptor function. Indeed, we previously reported that association of GABAB receptors with the GABAA receptor γ2S subunit confers agonist-mediated endocytosis on GABAB receptors expressed in heterologous cells (16Balasubramanian S. Teissere J.A. Raju D.V. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18840-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GABAB receptors have also been shown to be regulated by interactions with several other protein partners, including the transcription factors cAMP-response element-binding protein 2 and ATF4 (17Nehring R.B. Horikawa H.P. El Far O. Kneussel M. Brandstatter J.H. Stamm S. Wischmeyer E. Betz H. Karschin A. J. Biol.

Boudier L. Maurel D. Blahos J. Pin J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GABABR2 possesses a carboxyl-terminal motif (VSGL) that has the potential to interact with PDZ-domain containing scaffold proteins. PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) domains are 90-amino acid protein-protein interaction modules that recognize and bind to specialized motifs in the distal carboxyl termini of target proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels (22Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Multiple PDZ domains on the same PDZ protein can allow these proteins to act as scaffolds for the assembly of large protein complexes at the cell surface. In addition, PDZ proteins can play crucial roles in regulating the sorting, clustering, trafficking, signaling, and stability of proteins in multicellular organisms (23Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than 440 PDZ domains are predicted to exist in the human genome, of which more than a quarter are likely to be Class I PDZ domains based on the amino acid requirement for their binding partners. Class I PDZ proteins bind to the motif (S/T)XΦ, where Φ represents a hydrophobic residue at the carboxyl terminus and X represents any amino acid. The GABABR2 carboxyl-terminal motif of VSGL thus conforms to the preferred binding motif for Class I PDZ domains and may therefore interact with PDZ proteins that could potentially regulate GABAB receptor function. In this study, we screened a proteomic array consisting of known or putative Class I PDZ domains to identify PDZ proteins that might interact with GABABR2. We identified three PDZ proteins that interact with the GABABR2 carboxyl terminus: Mupp1, Erbin, and PAPIN. We further studied the interactions of these proteins with GABABR2 in cells and examined the roles of these interactions in regulating GABAB receptor signaling, trafficking, and stability. Construction of the PDZ Domain Proteomic Array—PDZ protein cDNA constructs were kindly donated by a large number of colleagues (24Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F.

These cDNAs were used as templates to amplify by means of PCR the regions encoding various PDZ domains, which were ultimately subcloned into pET30A for fusion protein expression. PDZ domains were expressed as His- and S-tagged fusion proteins by using the vector pET30A (Novagen) and purified using ProBond nickel resin (Invitrogen). Plasmids—Epitope-tagged (HA-, FLAG-, Myc-, and Histagged) versions of human GABABR1b and GABABR2 in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 were kindly provided by Fiona Marshall (GlaxoSmithKline). Myc-Mupp1 was kindly provided by Dr. Yoko Hamazaki (Kyoto University). GFPPAPIN was kindly provided by Dr. Yutaka Hata (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). Myc-Erbin was kindly provided by Dr. Amy Lee (Emory University). FLAG-GABABR2V938A, FLAG-GABABR2S939A, and FLAG-GABABR2L941A mutants were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Overlay Assays—To assess the binding of receptor carboxyl-terminal GST fusion proteins to the PDZ domain array, the purified PDZ domain fusion proteins were spotted at 1 μg per bin onto Nytran SuperCharge 96-grid nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were allowed to dry overnight and then blocked in “blot buffer” (2% nonfat dry milk/0.1% Tween 20/50 mm NaCl/10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. GST-GABABR2 carboxyl terminus (CT) was prepared via PCR amplification of the region encoding the last 35 amino acids of rat GABABR2 and subcloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoR1 and XhoI restriction enzymes. Overlays with GABABR2-CT fusion protein (100 nm in blot buffer) were then performed by using a previously described technique (24Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F.

Fusion Protein Pull-down Assays—Hexahistidine-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins were grown in Escherichia coli and purified on ProBond nickel resin (Invitrogen). Aliquots of the fusion protein on beads were blocked for 30 min with 1 ml of a 3% “BSA buffer” (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% BSA) at 4 °C. Solubilized lysates from transfected COS-7 cells were then incubated with the beads end-over-end at 4 °C for 2 h. Following three washes with 1 ml of BSA buffer, the proteins were eluted off of the beads with sample buffer, resolved via SDS-PAGE, and analyzed via Western blot using appropriate antibodies. Cell Culture and Transfection—All tissue culture media and related reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For heterologous expression of receptors, 2-4 μg of cDNA was mixed with 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and added to 5 ml of serum-free medium in 10-cm tissue cultures plates containing cells at 80-90% confluency. Following overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with 12 ml of complete media, and the cells were harvested 24 h later. Cerebellar Granule Neuron Culture—Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were obtained from 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Isolated cerebella were stripped of meninges, minced by mild trituration with a Pasteur pipette, and treated with trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. Granule cells were then dissociated by three successive trituration and sedimentation steps in DNase-containing Neurobasal media, centrifuged, and resuspended in Neurobasal medium containing 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, B-27 serum-free supplement, 0.5 mm glutamine, 25 μm glutamic acid, and 25 mm KCl. The neurons were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated culture slides (Fisher) at a density of ∼0.25 × 106 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% humidity atmosphere. Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added after 18-24 h to inhibit replication of non-neuronal cells. Immunoprecipitation, Surface Expression Assay, and Western Blotting—Co-immunoprecipitation of full-length proteins from COS-7 cells was performed using appropriate primary antibodies and methods described previously (16Balasubramanian S. Teissere J.A. Raju D.V. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18840-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody resin (Sigma) was the primary antibody used to immunoprecipitate epitope-tagged proteins. Surface expression of GABAB receptors was verified using a luminometer-based surface expression assay as described previously (16Balasubramanian S. Teissere J.A. Raju D.V. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18840-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Purified proteins, cell extracts, and/or immunoprecipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and detected with appropriate antibodies as described previously (16Balasubramanian S. Teissere J.A. Raju D.V. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18840-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The primary antibodies utilized were M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-coupled 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science), monoclonal anti-c-myc 9E10 antibody (Sigma), anti-GABABR1 antibody, anti-GABABR2 antibody (Chemicon), anti-Mupp1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-GFP antibody (BD Biosciences). Double Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cerebellar granule neurons or transfected COS-7 cells were plated in culture slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with anti-GABABR2 antibody (Chemicon) plus either monoclonal anti-Mupp1 (Upstate) or anti-c-myc 9E10 antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (5 min) with buffer, the cells were incubated with a Rhodamine Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes (5 min) with buffer, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to label the nucleus. After one wash with phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted, and Rhodamine Red-labeled Mupp1 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled GABABR2 were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser confocal microscope. Multiple control experiments, utilizing either transfected cells in the absence of primary antibody or untransfected cells in the presence of primary antibody, revealed a very low level of background staining, indicating that the primary antibody-dependent immunostaining observed in the cells was specific. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were split into 60-mm tissue culture plates. Approximately 40 h after transfection, the cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BIOSOURCE). 60 μCi of Redivue l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each plate and incubated for another 30 min. The radioactive media was removed; the cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and then chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 3 mm cold l-methionine (Sigma) for various time periods. Cells were harvested at 0-, 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, 24-, and 48-h time points and frozen at -80 °C. The cells were solubilized, adjusted for protein concentration, and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG resin. The immunoprecipitates were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to a phosphor screen for 1 week. The autoradiographic images were obtained with a phosphorimaging device (Typhoon) and analyzed with ImageQuaNT and GraphPad prism software. Within each experiment, the values of GABABR2 expression at the zero time point were considered as 100%, and then other time point values were normalized as a percentage of this starting value. The averaged data were subjected to nonlinear regression curve fitting (one phase exponential decay) to determine the protein half-life values. ERK Activation Assay—Transfected HEK-293 cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates at 80% confluency and serum starved overnight the day before the assay. The cells were stimulated with 200 μm baclofen for specified time periods, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+, and lysed in 80 μl of sample buffer. The cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gels and then analyzed via Western blotting with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK and anti-p44/42 MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling). Calcium Imaging—The Ca2+-sensitive fluorophore fura-2AM (Molecular Probes) was used for ratiometric Ca2+ imaging in COS-7 cells. All fluorescence measurements were made from subconfluent areas of the dishes so that individual cells could be readily identified. After transfection in 100-mm plates, cells were split onto coverslips immersed in 0.5 ml of media in 24-well plates and grown for 1-2 days. Before imaging, coverslips were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in extracellular recording solution composed of 150 mm NaCl/10 mm Hepes/3 mm KCl/2 mm CaCl2/2 mm MgCl2/5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.3, 325 mosm. Extracellular recording solution was supplemented with pluronic acid (0.001%) and fura-2 AM (2 μm). Subsequently, coverslips were thoroughly rinsed with extracellular solution lacking fura-2AM and BSA and mounted onto the microscope stage for imaging. Intensity images of 510 nm emission wavelengths were taken at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths, and the two resulting images were taken from individual cells for ratio calculations. Imaging work-bench 2.2.1 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was used for acquisition of intensity images and conversion to ratios. Baclofen (100 μm) was dissolved in extracellular recording solution and applied by bath perfusion. Mupp1 siRNA—A Mupp1 siRNA construct (identification no. 107246) was purchased from Ambion along with control siRNA. Approximately 6 h after transfection with appropriate plasmids, cells were transfected for 36-48 h with 100 nm of either Mupp1 siRNA or control siRNA using TransIT-Quest transfection reagent from Mirus. Screening of a PDZ Proteomic Array with the GABABR2 Carboxyl Terminus and Elucidation of the Structural Determinants of GABABR2 Binding to PDZ Proteins—To identify PDZ domain-containing proteins that might associate with the GABABR2 carboxyl terminus (GABABR2-CT), we first created a GST fusion protein corresponding to the last 35 amino acids of GABABR2, which possesses the putative PDZ binding motif VSGL. We next screened a previously reported (24Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F. Smith Y. Yun C.C. Hall R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GABABR2-CT did not detectably associate with the vast majority of PDZ domains on the array but did specifically interact with three PDZ domains: Mupp1-PDZ13, PAPIN-PDZ1, and Erbin-PDZ (data not shown). The results from the proteomic array screens were confirmed via a second independent technique in pull-down experiments examining PDZ interactions with both wild-type full-length GABABR2 and various full-length GABABR2 carboxyl terminus mutants. The amino acids Val-938, Ser-939, and Leu-941 of the GABABR2 carboxyl-terminal motif (VSGL) were sequentially mutated to alanine. Lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type GABABR2 or one of the three GABABR2 mutants were separately incubated with the three PDZ domains (Mupp1-PDZ13, Erbin-PDZ, and Papin-PDZ1) expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins and adsorbed to nickel resin. A robust association of all the three PDZ fusion proteins with the wild-type GABABR2 was observed (Fig. 1). Alanine mutations at the Ser-939 and Val-938 positions of the GABABR2 PDZ-binding motif partially inhibited GABABR2 binding with all the three PDZ proteins. Strikingly, mutation of the GABABR2 terminal leucine (Leu-941) to alanine strongly reduced the interaction with the PDZ proteins. These results confirm that full-length GABABR2 associates with PDZ domains from Mupp1, PAPIN, and Erbin and also elucidate key residues on GABABR2 that mediate the interaction with PDZ proteins. Mupp1 and PAPIN, but Not Erbin, Associate with GABAB Receptors in Cells—We next examined whether GABABR2 can interact with full-length versions of the various PDZ proteins in a cellular environment. Myc-tagged Mupp1 was expressed alone or in the presence of either wild-type FLAG-tagged GABABR2 or FLAG-tagged GABABR2 L941A mutant in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2A). When FLAG-tagged GABABR2 was immunoprecipitated, robust co-immunoprecipitation of Mupp1 was observed from the cell lysates expressing wild-type GABABR2 and Mupp1. However, Mupp1 co-immunoprecipitation from cell lysates expressing the GABABR2 L941A mutant and Mupp1 was much weaker. Similarly, GFP-tagged PAPIN co-immunoprecipitated with GABABR2 from cells expressing GABABR2 or GABABR2/GABABR1 (Fig. 2B). We also expressed either Myc-tagged Erbin or Myc-tagged Erbin lacking the PDZ domain (Myc-ErbinΔPDZ) in the presence or absence of FLAG-tagged GABABR2 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2C). However, immunoprecipitation of GABABR2 from these cell lysates did not yield any detectable co-immunoprecipitation of Erbin. These results demonstrate that full-length Mupp1 and PAPIN, but not Erbin, physically associate with GABAB receptors in transfected COS-7 cells. Mupp1 Co-localizes with GABABR2 in Neurons and Transfected Cells—GABABR2, Mupp1, and PAPIN have been reported to exhibit overlapping distributions in various regions of the brain (26Deguchi M.

Therefore, we examined the subcellular distributions of GABABR2 and Mupp1 in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (Fig. 3, A-C) and cortical neurons (data not shown) via immunohistochemistry using specific GABABR2 and Mupp1 primary antibodies and differentially tagged fluorescent secondary antibodies. We observed a significant overlap in the distribution patterns of GABABR2 and Mupp1 on the plasma membrane of the cell bodies and processes of these neurons, suggesting that these two proteins are present together in the same subcellular domains of the same cells. Comparable studies examining PAPIN were not possible due to the lack of a specific anti-PAPIN antibody. Next, we used fluorescence immunohistochemistry to study the subcellular distribution of GABABR2 and Mupp1 in transfected cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with either Myc-tagged Mupp1 alone or Myc-tagged Mupp1 plus FLAG-tagged GABABR2. Double immunofluorescence was performed with monoclonal anti-Myc and polyclonal anti-GABABR2 antibodies. In contrast to the prominent expression in the plasma membrane that was seen in neurons, Mupp1 expressed alone in COS-7 cells was distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm with little or no plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3, D-F). Interestingly, upon co-expression with GABABR2 in COS-7 cells, Mupp1 displayed a predominantly plasma membrane localization similar to its native subcellular distribution in neurons (Fig. 3, G-I). These findings suggest that association with GABABR2 can alter the subcellular distribution of Mupp1. Mutation of the PDZ-binding Motif Decreases GABAB Receptor Stability—Transfection of the GABABR2 L941A mutant into COS-7 cells resulted in consistently low expression of this mutant compared with wild-type GABABR2 as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 4A). Additionally, quantification of the plasma membrane expression of GABAB receptors using a luminometer-based cell surface expression assay yielded evidence for a striking decrease in surface expression of the L941A mutant relative to wild-type GABABR2 (Fig. 4B). Thus, we postulated that the stability of GABABR2 might be affected by the L941A mutation that disrupts the PDZ-binding motif. To test this hypothesis, we compared the halflives of wild-type GABABR2 and the GABA"

Factors underlying input specificity of synaptic modifications implicated in information transfer in fear conditioning pathways remain unclear. Here we show that the strength of naive synapses in two auditory inputs converging on a single neuron in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is only modified when a postsynaptic action potential closely follows a synaptic response. The stronger inhibitory drive in thalamic pathway, as compared with cortical input, hampers the induction of LTP at thalamo-amygdala synapses, contributing to the spatial specificity of LTP in convergent inputs. These results indicate that spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity in afferent projections to the LA is both temporarily and spatially asymmetric, thus providing a mechanism for the conditioned stimulus discrimination during fear behavior.

Fear conditioning is an experimental model of associative learning that is instrumental to our understanding of how sensory stimuli are encoded and retained as a memory of behavioral experiences (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5777) Google Scholar, Davis and Whalen, 2001Davis M. Whalen P.J. The amygdala: vigilance and emotion.Mol.

Psychol. 2005; 56: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). During this form of learning, an innocuous conditioned stimulus (CS) becomes biologically meaningful as a result of its temporal association with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) (e.g., an electric footshock). When the CS-US association is learned, the CS alone triggers fear responses. Initially neutral cues of any sensory modality, such as sound, light, smell, or touch could become the CS after a few pairings with the US during behavioral training (Maren, 2001Maren S. Neurobiology of Pavlovian fear conditioning.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 897-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). The amygdala complex, which is composed of several subcortical nuclei, provides the neural substrate for the CS-US association during fear conditioning (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5777) Google Scholar, Goosens et al., 2003Goosens K.A. Hobin J.A. Maren S.

Anatomical and functional studies have identified the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) as a site where the signals encoding the CS and US converge (Pitkanen et al., 1997Pitkanen A. Savander V. LeDoux J.E. Organization of intra-amygdaloid circuitries in the rat: an emerging framework for understanding functions of the amygdala.Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 517-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5777) Google Scholar). Auditory fear conditioning is particularly well-characterized, both in respect to the implicated neural circuitry and underlying cellular mechanisms (Maren and Quirk, 2004Maren S. Quirk G.J. Neuronal signaling of fear memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). During this form of learning, information about the characteristics of the CS (audible sound) is delivered to the LA via two different routes: (1) a direct input to the LA, originating in the auditory thalamus, and (2) an indirect pathway extending from the auditory cortex (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5777) Google Scholar, Maren, 2001Maren S. Neurobiology of Pavlovian fear conditioning.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 897-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). It has been recently demonstrated that fear conditioning is associated with persistent synaptic enhancements in auditory inputs to the LA (McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997McKernan M.G. Shinnick-Gallagher P. Fear conditioning induces a lasting potentiation of synaptic currents in vitro.Nature. 1997; 390: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, Rogan et al., 1997Rogan M.T. Staubli U.V. LeDoux J.E. Fear conditioning induces associative long-term potentiation in the amygdala.Nature. 1997; 390: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Both associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in the LA and fear conditioning demonstrate an identical sensitivity to stimulus contingency, indicating that they might be governed by similar mechanisms (Bauer et al., 2001Bauer E.P. LeDoux J.P. Nader K. Fear conditioning and LTP in the lateral amygdala are sensitive to the same stimulus contingencies.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 687-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, behavioral training induces LTP-like enhancements of synaptic transmission in cortico-amygdala pathway that both mimic and occlude LTP in slices induced with electrical stimulation, thus providing evidence that LTP in auditory inputs to the LA and fear learning are causally linked (Tsvetkov et al., 2002Tsvetkov E. Carlezon W.A. Benes F.M. Kandel E.R. Bolshakov V.Y. Fear conditioning occludes LTP-induced presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission in the cortical pathway to the lateral amygdala.Neuron. 2002; 34: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Experimental animals that are conditioned to fear specific cues can discriminate between conditioned stimuli of distinct modalities and show no signs of generalization of conditioned responses (Campeau and Davis, 1995Campeau S. Davis M. Involvement of subcortical and cortical afferents to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala in fear conditioning measured with fear-potentiated startle in rats trained concurrently with auditory and visual conditioned stimuli.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2312-2327PubMed Google Scholar). As LTP is a likely cellular mechanism of fear learning, input specificity of LTP in afferent inputs to the LA, observed under physiological conditions (Doyere et al., 2003Doyere V. Schafe G.E. Sigurdsson T. LeDoux J.E. Long-term potentiation in freely moving rats reveals asymmetries in thalamic and cortical inputs to the lateral amygdala.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2703-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Tsvetkov et al., 2004Tsvetkov E. Shin R.M. Bolshakov V.Y. Glutamate uptake determines pathway specificity of long-term potentiation in the neural circuitry of fear conditioning.Neuron. 2004; 41: 139-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), could contribute to the stimulus discrimination after the CS-US association is formed. It remains unclear, however, how the information that is contained in the specific afferent input activity could be specifically encoded and preserved during fear learning. We addressed this issue experimentally by studying the properties of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at two independent inputs, thalamo-amygdala and cortico-amygdala pathways, which relay information about different characteristics of the CS to the LA during auditory fear conditioning (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5777) Google Scholar). STDP at central synapses can be induced by precise temporal associations between presynaptic input and postsynaptic action potentials (APs) (Bauer et al., 2001Bauer E.P. LeDoux J.P. Nader K.

Rubin J. Timing in synaptic plasticity: from detection to integration.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Learning rules based on this recently discovered form of synaptic plasticity drew significant attention due to their apparent computational value (Karmarkar et al., 2002Karmarkar U.R. Najarian M.T. Buonomano D.V. Mechanisms and significance of spike-timing dependent plasticity.Biol. Cybern. 2002; 87: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We found that synaptic modifications in convergent cortical and thalamic inputs in the LA demonstrate temporal and spatial specificity. The observed spatiotemporal asymmetry of synaptic plasticity in afferent inputs to the LA could contribute to the encoding of the information about the particular CS and thus contribute to CS recognition during retrieval of the conditioned response. To explore how spatial specificity of the information flow might be determined in fear conditioning pathways, we investigated the rules that govern spike timing-dependent LTP in two inputs implicated in the acquisition of fear to auditory stimulation and converging on the same principal neuron in the LA. We recorded glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in neurons in the LA in current-clamp mode at the cortico-amygdala or thalamo-amygdala synapses (Tsvetkov et al., 2002Tsvetkov E. Carlezon W.A. Benes F.M. Kandel E.R. Bolshakov V.Y.

As we have previously demonstrated, these convergent inputs to the LA can be reliably separated with our stimulation technique, resulting in activation of independent sets of synapses (Tsvetkov et al., 2004Tsvetkov E.

Glutamate uptake determines pathway specificity of long-term potentiation in the neural circuitry of fear conditioning.Neuron. 2004; 41: 139-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Pairing of 80 presynaptic pulses, delivered to the fibers in either the external capsule (cortical input, Figure 1A; also see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data) or the internal capsule (thalamic input, Figure 1E) at a 2 Hz frequency, with APs evoked in the postsynaptic cell with a 4–8 ms delay from the onset of each EPSP by short depolarizing current injections through the recording electrode (Humeau et al., 2005Humeau Y. Herry C. Kemp N. Shaban H. Fourcaudot E. Bissiere S. Luthi A.

Forty minutes after the induction, the EPSP in the cortical input was potentiated to 155% ± 9% (n = 12) of its pre-LTP amplitude (t test, p < 0.01 versus baseline). In thalamic pathway, the EPSP was potentiated to 142% ± 5% (n = 6; t test, p < 0.01 versus baseline) of the initial value. The difference in the magnitude of LTP between cortico-amygdala and thalamo-amygdala synapses with GABAAR-mediated inhibition blocked was not statistically significant (t test, p = 0.39). We next characterized the requirements for the induction of spike timing-dependent LTP in both cortical and thalamic inputs to the LA. Similar to the conventional rate- and voltage-dependent LTP in the amygdala (Huang and Kandel, 1998Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R.

This experimental intervention is known to both decrease resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration and effectively block postsynaptic Ca2+ transients in response to stimulation (Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1994Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Postsynaptic induction and presynaptic expression of hippocampal long-term depression.Science. 1994; 264: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the EPSP remained at 101% ± 4% (n = 4; p = 0.46 versus the baseline amplitude; significantly different from control LTP, p < 0.003) and 113% ± 7% (n = 10; p = 0.61 versus the baseline amplitude; significantly different from control LTP, p < 0.02) of its initial value in cortical (Figures 1C and 1D) and thalamic (Figures 1G and 1H) inputs, respectively, when measured 35–40 min after the delivery of the LTP-inducing stimulation. With this induction protocol, LTP was also completely blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV, 50 μM), either in cortical or thalamic input. When assessed 35–40 min after the LTP-inducing stimulation, the EPSP amplitude was 99% ± 12% (n = 4; p = 0.7 versus the baseline; significantly different from control LTP, p < 0.01) and 104% ± 13% (n = 6; p = 0.74 versus the baseline; significantly different from control LTP, p < 0.03) of the initial value in cortical (Figures 1C and 1D) and thalamic (Figures 1G and 1H) inputs, respectively. It does not rule out, however, the possibility that calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels may also contribute to the induction process under certain conditions (Weisskopf et al., 1999Weisskopf M.G. Bauer E.P. LeDoux J.E. L-type voltage-gated calcium channels mediate NMDA-independent associative long-term potentiation at thalamic input synapses to the amygdala.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10512-10519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tsvetkov et al., 2002Tsvetkov E. Carlezon W.A. Benes F.M. Kandel E.R. Bolshakov V.Y. Fear conditioning occludes LTP-induced presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission in the cortical pathway to the lateral amygdala.Neuron. 2002; 34: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of NMDARs in LTP induction (Bauer et al., 2002Bauer E.P. Schafe G.E. LeDoux J.E. NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels contribute to long-term potentiation and different components of fear memory formation in the lateral amygdala.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5239-5249PubMed Google Scholar), we found that spike triggering in the absence of synaptic activation did not result in LTP in either pathway, with the cortico-amygdala EPSP remaining at 102% ± 2% of the preinduction response (n = 3; not significantly different from the baseline EPSP, t test, p = 0.38), while the thalamo-amygdala EPSP was 104% ± 10% of the initial amplitude (n = 4; not significantly different from the baseline EPSP, t test, p = 0.73), indicating the need for glutamate release in the induction process. Thus, it appears that similar cellular mechanisms are implicated in the induction of spike timing-dependent LTP at convergent cortical and thalamic inputs to the LA. Recent findings indicate that the susceptibility of glutamatergic synapses in the LA to LTP is tightly controlled by GABA-mediated inhibition of the principal neurons (Shumyatsky et al., 2002Shumyatsky G.P. Tsvetkov E. Malleret G. Vronskaya S. Hatton M. Hampton L. Battey J.F. Dulac C. Kandel E.R. Bolshakov V.Y.

Humeau Y. Luthi A. Dopamine gates LTP induction in lateral amygdala by suppressing feedforward inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined LTP at the cortico-amygdala or thalamo-amygdala synapses without the GABAAR antagonist PTX in the bath solution. Consistent with a previous report (Bissiere et al., 2003Bissiere S. Humeau Y. Luthi A. Dopamine gates LTP induction in lateral amygdala by suppressing feedforward inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we found that when GABAAR-mediated inhibition was intact, the EPSP-spike induction protocol failed to induce LTP in thalamo-amygdala pathway. Forty minutes after the induction, the thalamo-amygdala EPSP remained at 103% ± 6% (n = 5) of the initial value (Figures 1F and 1H, not significantly different from the baseline EPSP amplitude, t test, p = 0.69). Surprisingly, LTP in cortical input was diminished (p < 0.03 versus LTP magnitude when GABAARs were blocked), but could still be observed, with the EPSP potentiated to 126% ± 6% (n = 9) of the initial value (Figures 1B and 1D, significantly different from the baseline EPSP amplitude, t test, p < 0.01). The observed effect of the GABAAR antagonist on LTP implies a differential (input-specific) inhibitory control of the induction mechanisms in two convergent inputs in the LA. To characterize temporal characteristics of STDP in the LA, we varied the interval between the stimulus-induced EPSP and the peak of the AP triggered in the LA neuron (Bi and Poo, 2001Bi G. Poo M. Synaptic modification by correlated activity: Hebb's postulate revisited.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 139-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), thus extending the LTP experiments described above (see Figure 1). In agreement with previous studies, we found that the time window for LTP induction in the LA with the EPSP-AP protocol was very narrow, as the pairing of presynaptic stimulation with postsynaptic action potentials evoked with delays longer than 10 ms did not induce LTP in either pathway (Figures 2A–2D). As shown in Figure 2B, the temporal window for LTP induction with the EPSP-AP pairing protocol (the EPSP preceding the spike) in cortico-amygdala pathway did not depend on GABAAR-mediated inhibition. With inhibition blocked, the EPSP-AP timing requirements in thalamic input were identical to those observed at cortical pathway. However, no significant LTP was observed at thalamo-amygdala synapses when inhibition was intact (no PTX), with the EPSP-AP intervals ranging from ∼0 to ∼30 ms (Figure 2D). We further studied the principles that underlie SDTP in the LA by reversing the temporal order of the pre- and postsynaptic activation. The repetitive AP-EPSP pairing (the AP preceding the EPSP) has previously been shown to produce long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic responses at several different synapses (Bi and Poo, 2001Bi G. Poo M. Synaptic modification by correlated activity: Hebb's postulate revisited.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 139-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2005Wang H.X. Gerkin R.C. Nauen D.W. Bi G.Q. Coactivation and timing-dependent integration of synaptic potentiation and depression.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in our experiments, triggering postsynaptic spikes before EPSPs did not result in LTD at naive synapses in either thalamic or cortical input to the LA. LTD was absent with intact inhibition as well as under conditions when inhibition was blocked, regardless of the interpulse interval in the AP-EPSP pair (Figures 2A–2D). Thus, 35 min after the pairing procedure, with the AP-EPSP intervals ranging from ∼0 to ∼30 ms, the EPSP in cortical input remained at 105% ± 3% (n = 12) and 104% ± 3% (n = 12) of the baseline amplitude in the presence of PTX (blocked inhibition, Figure 2E, closed symbols; not significantly different from the baseline EPSP, t test, p = 0.12) or in the absence of PTX (intact inhibition, Figure 2E, open symbols; not significantly different from the baseline EPSP, t test, p = 0.25), respectively. In thalamic pathway, the EPSP remained at 106% ± 5% (n = 9) and 104% ± 4% (n = 11) of the initial value in the presence (Figure 2F, closed symbols; not significantly different from the baseline EPSP, t test, p = 0.1) or absence (Figure 2F, open symbols; not significantly different from the baseline EPSP, t test, p = 0.19) of PTX, respectively. To test whether susceptibility of the studied synapses to spike timing-dependent LTD depends on the frequency of plasticity-inducing stimulation, we varied the frequency at which the AP-EPSP pairs were evoked in both convergent inputs. Repetitive AP-EPSP pairing, with the AP preceding the EPSP by 5–15 ms, did not result in significant LTD at any of the frequencies tested (0.2 Hz, 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, or 2 Hz) in either cortical or thalamic pathway (Figure 2G; p > 0.05 for each point in the graph, not significantly different from the baseline EPSP). Thus, synapses in afferent inputs to the LA are only modified when postsynaptic AP follows the EPSP with a short delay. Input-specific differences in spike timing-dependent LTP between convergent pathways, which were observed when GABAAR-mediated inhibition was intact, could be explained by the induction mechanisms' differential (pathway-specific) sensitivity to the identical levels of inhibitory control. According to this notion, detectable distinctions in parameters of glutamatergic synaptic transmission should exist between cortical and thalamic inputs. To directly compare the parameters of synaptic transmission between cortical and thalamic inputs, we first tested the rate of blockade of the whole-cell NMDAR excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) by an irreversible blocker of the NMDARs, MK-801 (40 μM; Huettner and Bean, 1988Huettner J.E. Bean B.P. Block of N-methyl-D-aspartate-activated current by the anticonvulsant MK-801: selective binding to open channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In the presence of MK-801, the rate with which the NMDAR EPSC declines in the course of repetitive presynaptic stimulation is positively correlated with the basal probability of release (Pr) (Hessler et al., 1993Hessler N.A. Shirke A.M. Malinow R. The probability of transmitter release at a mammalian central synapse.Nature. 1993; 366: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We recorded whole-cell NMDAR EPSCs in the presence of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 μM) at a holding potential of −40 mV to relieve the Mg2+ block of NMDAR channels (Figures 3A and 3B). When MK-801 blocking rates were estimated in both convergent pathways, there was no difference between cortical and thalamic inputs to the LA (Figure 3C; cortical input, n = 9; thalamic input, n = 9; no significant difference, ANOVA, p = 0.74). Second, we obtained quantal size estimates in both cortical and thalamic inputs by measuring the amplitude of asynchronously released single quanta of glutamate when strontium (Sr2+) was substituted for extracellular Ca2+ (Oliet et al., 1996Oliet S.H. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Bidirectional control of quantal size by synaptic activity in the hippocampus.Science. 1996; 271: 1294-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the synchronous component of evoked neurotransmitter release is significantly diminished while asynchronous release is enhanced and can be observed for hundreds of milliseconds after the presynaptic stimulus (Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2000Xu-Friedman M.A. Regehr W.G. Probing fundamental aspects of synaptic transmission with strontium.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4414-4422PubMed Google Scholar; Figures 3D and 3E). This allowed us to analyze quantal events originating from the specific synaptic inputs. Using this approach, we found that quantal size was very similar in the two convergent pathways. The mean amplitude of asynchronous quantal events recorded in the presence of Sr2+ was 15.1 ± 1.2 pA (n = 10) and 14.9 ± 0.9 pA (n = 12) in cortical and thalamic inputs, respectively (Figures 3F and 3G; no significant difference between the two inputs, t test, p = 0.92). These data indicate that cortico-amygdala and thalamo-amygdala synapses do not differ in either their basal Pr or quantal amplitude. As the induction of spike timing-dependent LTP in the LA requires postsynaptic Ca2+ influx through NMDARs (see above), we asked whether distinct NMDAR subtypes could make differential contributions to the induction of synaptic plasticity in afferent inputs to the LA (see Liu et al., 2004Liu L. Wong T.P. Pozza M.F. Lingenhoehl K. Wang Y. Sheng M. Auberson Y.P. Wang Y.T. Role of NMDA receptor subtypes in governing the direction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.Science. 2004; 304: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from pyramidal neurons, we confirmed that both NR2A and NR2B subunit-containing NMDARs are functionally expressed at cortico-amygdala and thalamo-amygdala synapses (Lopez de Armenia and Sah, 2003Lopez de Armenia M. Sah P. Development and subunit composition of synaptic NMDA receptors in the amygdala: NR2B synapses in the adult central amygdala.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6876-6883PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 4). Addition of the selective NR2B antagonist ifenprodil (10 μM) or the NR2A antagonist NVP-AAM077 (0.5 μM; Liu et al., 2004Liu L. Wong T.P. Pozza M.F. Lingenhoehl K. Wang Y. Sheng M. Auberson Y.P. Wang Y.T. Role of NMDA receptor subtypes in governing the direction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.Science. 2004; 304: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) to the external solution produced progressive decreases in the amplitude of the isolated NMDAR EPSC recorded at a holding potential of +50 mV in the presence of CNQX in either cortical or thalamic pathway (Figures 4A and 4D). The degree of inhibition was very similar at both convergent inputs, as ifenprodil reduced the magnitude of the NMDAR EPSC by 25.1% ± 2% (n = 5) and 22.6% ± 6% (n = 5) of its baseline value in cortical and thalamic inputs, respectively (Figures 4B and 4C; no significant difference between inputs, t test, p = 0.71). In the presence of the NR2A antagonist NVP-AAM077, the NMDAR EPSC was reduced by 72.2% ± 2% (n = 8) and 65.5% ± 5% (n = 7) of its baseline value in cortical and thalamic inputs, respectively (Figures 4E and 4F; no significant difference between inputs, t test, p = 0.24). Despite the fact that NMDAR responses were largely mediated by the NR2A-containing receptors, the blockade of NR2B subunit ab"

After the column was washed with the equilibration buffer, GAGs were eluted with the same buffer containing 2.0 m NaCl, dialyzed against water, and concentrated to dryness (the yield was 25 mg). This sample was subjected to a nitrous acid treatment (pH 1.5) to remove heparin/HS as described previously (34Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and the resultant HS fragments were removed by gel filtration on a Superdex® 75 column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The elution was monitored by absorption at 210 nm. The fraction eluted in the void volume was pooled and freeze-dried repeatedly by reconstituting in water to remove NH4HCO3. This CS/DS preparation was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on an Accell QMA Plus cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted stepwise with 0.3 m phosphate buffers (pH 6.0) containing 0.2, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m NaCl. The fractions obtained by elution with 1.0 and 1.5 m NaCl, referred to as SL-CS/DS (1.0 m) and SL-CS/DS (1.5 m), respectively, were desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and each fraction was analyzed by the carbazole reaction for the amount of CS/DS (35Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5192) Google Scholar). Finally, the SL-CS/DS preparations were passed through a Sep-PakC18 cartridge (Waters) to remove peptides. Determination of the Disaccharide Composition and Molecular Mass—An aliquot (1 μg as GAG) of SL-CS/DS (1.0 m) or (1.5 m) was subjected to digestion with CSase ABC, a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II, or CSase B. Each digest was labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (2AB) and subjected to anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA-03 column (YMC-Pack PA, Kyoto, Japan) as described previously (28Nandini C.D. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4058-4069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mass, an aliquot (5 μg as GlcUA) of SL-CS/DS (1.0 and 1.5 m fractions) was chromatographed by gel filtration on a Superdex™ 200 column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences), which had been calibrated using a series of size-defined commercial polysaccharides (36Yamada S. Okada Y. Ueno M. Iwata S. Deepa S.S. Nishimura S. Fujita M. Van Die I. Hirayabashi Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31877-31886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The sample was eluted with 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min for 90 min. Fractions were collected at 3-min intervals, freeze-dried, and dissolved in 100 μl of water. An aliquot was utilized for estimating the total amount of GAGs using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue according to the method of Chandrasekhar et al. (37Chandrasekhar S. Esterman M.A. Hoffman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), except that the absorbance was recorded at 525 nm. Interaction Analysis—Inhibition of PTN binding to a PTN high affinity fraction derived from embryonic pig brain (E-CS/DS-H) was examined using a BIAcore J system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). E-CS/DS-H was immobilized on a sensor chip as previously described (32Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PTN (100 ng) was mixed with 0.5 μg of each tested GAG preparation (SL-CS/DS fractions or commercial CS/DS preparations) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to injection onto the surface of an E-CS/DS-H-immobilized sensor chip. Results are expressed as relative percentages of inhibition based on the binding of PTN to E-CS/DS-H in the absence of inhibitor as 100%. To examine the interaction with various growth factors, SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) was immobilized on a sensor chip as reported earlier (38Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, various concentrations of growth factors were injected onto the surface of this sensor chip in the running buffer (HBS-EP, pH 7.4, BIAcore AB) with a medium flow rate (30 μl/min) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Each growth factor was allowed to interact with SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) for 2 min each for association and for dissociation, after which the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 1 m NaCl for 2 min before each injection. The kinetic parameters were evaluated with BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore AB) using a 1:1 binding model with mass transfer. To investigate the structural characteristics of the putative functional epitopes of SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) for the binding to various growth factors, an aliquot (10 μgas GAG) was digested with 10 mIU each of CSase ABC, a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II, or CSase B, and a 2-μg aliquot of each digest was used for the inhibition analysis as described above except that the SL-CS/DS (1.5 m)-immobilized sensor chip was used here. Preparation of Partially Desulfated CS/DS Chains—The alkali treatment, which removes 2-O-sulfate from the IdoUA of heparin (39Rej R. Jaseja M. Perlin A.S. Thromb. Haemostat. 1989; 61: 540Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was applied to the SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) fraction. SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) (20 μg as GAG) was dissolved in 20 μl of 0.1 m NaOH, frozen at –20 °C for 2 h, neutralized with 0.5 m HCl to pH 7.0, desalted by gel filtration on a PD-10 column, and freeze-dried. Assays for NOP Activity—Cultures of hippocampal neurons were established from E16 mice as previously described (25Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg/well of a CS/DS preparation was individually coated onto coverslips precoated with poly-dl-ornithine (P-ORN) (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The hippocampal neuronal cells were freshly isolated from E16 mouse embryos, suspended in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing N2 supplements, seeded on coverslips at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2, and allowed to grow in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For the neutralization assay using antibodies, polyclonal anti-PTN antibody (10 μg/ml), polyclonal anti-MK antibody (10 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-bFGF antibody (10 μg/ml), or polyclonal anti-HGF antibody (3 μg/ml) was added to the medium 2 h after the seeding of the cells. After incubation overnight, the cells were fixed using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and the neurites were visualized by immunochemical staining using anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (Lieco Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO) (40Caceres A. Banker G.A. Binder L. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 714-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-neurofilament (Sigma) (41Debus E. Weber K. Osborn M. Differentiation. 1983; 25: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The antibodies were then detected using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. The immunostained cells on each coverslip were scanned and digitized with a ×20 objective lens on an optical microscope (BH-2; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (HC-300Z/OL; Olympus). 100 clearly isolated cells with at least one neurite longer than the cell body were chosen at random to determine the length of the longest neurite using a morphological analysis software (Mac SCOPE; Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). At least three independent experiments per parameter or condition were carried out. Analysis of Distribution of CS and DS Domains in the SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) Chains—SL-CS/DS (1.5 m)(1 μg as GAG) was digested with CSase ABC, a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II, or CSase B and labeled with 2AB as described above. Each digest was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.2 m NH4HCO3 and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex™ Peptide HR column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences), which was eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, being monitored with a RF-10AXL Shimadzu fluorescent detector. Preparation of the CS/DS Fractions from Shark Liver—GAGs were extracted from shark liver by protease digestion and alkali treatment, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and purified by anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephadex column. The GAG preparation thus obtained was treated with nitrous acid followed by gel filtration to remove heparin/HS (∼50% of all GAG). No significant hyaluronic acid-derived oligosaccharides were found by anion exchange HPLC in the digests of the CS/DS preparations treated with CSase ABC or hyaluronidase SH (data not shown). This preparation was further fractionated by anion exchange chromatography using an Accell™ Plus QMA cartridge, which was eluted stepwise with buffers containing 0.2, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m NaCl. Only trace amounts of CS/DS were detected in the fractions eluted with buffers containing 0.2 and 2.0 m NaCl. 80 and 20% of the total CS/DS were detected in the fractions eluted with buffers containing 1.0 and 1.5 m NaCl and designated as SL-CS/DS (1.0 m) and SL-CS/DS (1.5 m), respectively. These preparations were passed through a C18 cartridge to remove peptides. Determination of the Molecular Mass of Shark Liver CS/DS—The molecular mass of SL-CS/DS preparations was determined by gel filtration (Fig. 1). Using the calibration curve generated with standard polysaccharides, the average molecular mass of SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) was estimated to be 75.7 kDa, whereas SL-CS/DS (1.0 m) gave a broader peak with a molecular mass ranging from 3.8 to 38.9 kDa. The distinct sizes of these two preparations may suggest different structures and functions. Interestingly, the mass of SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) was comparable with that of shark skin CS/DS (SS-CS/DS) preparations (28Nandini C.D. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4058-4069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the large molecular mass may be characteristic of shark CS/DS. Analysis of the Disaccharide Composition—The disaccharide composition of SL-CS/DS fractions was determined by digestion with CSases differing in specificity, followed by anion exchange HPLC. The two SL-CS/DS preparations were individually digested with CSase ABC, a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II, or CSase B. Each digest was labeled with a fluorophore, 2AB, for high sensitivity and resolution and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC. The analysis revealed a unique and heterogeneous disaccharide composition with diverse sulfation patterns for both SL-CS/DS (1.0 m) and SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Both fractions showed Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GalNAc (ΔO), Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GalNAc(6S) (ΔC), Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S) (ΔA), Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(6S) (ΔD), Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S) (ΔB), and Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) (ΔE) in varying proportions (Table 1), where 2S,4S, and 6S stand for 2-O-, 4-O-, and 6-O-sulfate and 4S,6S stands for 4,6-O-disulfate, respectively. Note that a small yet appreciable proportion of the Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc-(4S,6S) (ΔT) unit was detected in SL-CS/DS (1.5 m). SL-CS/DS (1.0 m) was relatively low sulfated due to significant proportions of monosulfated disaccharides, ΔC (31.8%) and ΔA (33.1%), with a sulfate/disaccharide unit ratio of 1.18, whereas SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) was enriched with oversulfated disaccharides, ΔB (18%), ΔE (22.8%), and ΔT (1.8%), with a sulfate/disaccharide unit ratio of 1.43 (Table 1). Thus, an unique composition was revealed for SL-CS/DS (1.0 m) with three kinds of disulfated disaccharide units (ΔB, ΔD, and ΔE) and for SL-CS/DS (1.5 m) with small proportions of ΔD and ΔT in addition to significant proportions of ΔB and ΔE.TABLE 1Disaccharide composition of the SL-CS/DS preparationsUnsaturatedaΔDi-0S, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc; ΔDi-4S, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc(4S); ΔDi-6S, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc(6S); ΔDi-diSB, Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α 1-3GalNAc(4S); ΔDi-diSD, Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α 1-3GalNAc(6S); ΔDi-diSE, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc(4S,6S). disaccharideSL-CS/DS (1.0 m)SL-CS/DS (1.5 m)CSase ABCCSase BCSases AC-I and AC-IICSase ABCCSase BCSases AC-I and AC-IIpmol (mol %)pmol (mol %)ΔDi-0S15.5 (6.3)11.2 (11.6)6.9 (2.6)2.2 (6.4)ΔDi-6S78.1 (31.8)5.6 (9.0)25.0 (25.8)11.7 (4.3)4.9 (13.9)ΔDi-4S81.4 (33.1)39.8 (64.0)38.6 (39.8)132.7 (49.4)49.7 (42.6)13.8 (39.3)ΔDi-diSD10.5 (4.3)1.0 (1.6)3.0 (3.1)2.8 (1.0)0.5 (0.4)0.3 (1.0)ΔDi-diSB16.7 (6.8)8.8 (14.1)7.0 (7.2)48.2 (18.0)45.9 (39.4)3.3 (9.3)ΔDi-diSE43.4 (17.7)7.0 (11.3)12.1 (12.5)61.2 (22.8)15.2 (13.0)10.6 (30.2)ΔDi-triS4.9 (1.8)5.4 (4.6)Total245.662.296.9268.3118.935.5S/unitbS/unit, a molar ratio of sulfate to disaccharide.1.181.43a ΔDi-0S, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc; ΔDi-4S, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc(4S); ΔDi-6S, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc(6S); ΔDi-diSB, Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α 1-3GalNAc(4S); ΔDi-diSD, Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α 1-3GalNAc(6S); ΔDi-diSE, Δ4,5HexUAα 1-3GalNAc(4S,6S).b S/unit, a molar ratio of sulfate to disaccharide.

https://openalex.org/W2057731607,"Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult T cell leukemia. HTLV-1 encodes a trans-activating protein, Tax, which is largely responsible for the oncogenic properties of the virus. Tax promotes T cell transformation by deregulating the activity of various cellular factors, including the transcription factor NF-κB. Tax activates the IκB kinase (IKK) via physical interaction with the regulatory subunit, IKKγ, although it is unknown precisely how Tax activates the IKK complex. Here we show that Tax modulates the cellular localization of the IKK complex. The IKKs relocalize from a broad distribution in the cytoplasm to concentrated perinuclear “hot spots” in both HTLV-1-transformed lines and in Tax-expressing Jurkat cells. Relocalization of IKK is not observed with Tax mutants unable to activate NF-κB, suggesting that only activated forms of IKK are relocalized. However, relocalization of IKK is strictly dependent on Tax expression because it does not occur in ATL cell lines that lack Tax expression or in Jurkat cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. Furthermore, IKKγ is required for redistribution because cells lacking IKKγ were unable to relocalize IKKα upon expression of Tax. We also find that Tax ubiquitination likely regulates IKK relocalization because mutation of three critical lysine residues in Tax renders it unable to relocalize IKK and activate the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways. Finally, we have observed that the perinuclear IKK in Tax-expressing cells colocalizes with the Golgi, and disruption of Golgi with either nocodazole or brefeldin A leads to a redistribution of IKK to the cytoplasm. Together, these results demonstrate that Tax induces relocalization of the IKK complex in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, and dynamic changes in the subcellular localization of the IKK complex may be critical for Tax function.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 475-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The HTLV-1 genome encodes a regulatory protein Tax in the pX region that plays a central role in HTLV-1-associated disease (2Grant C. Barmak K. Alefantis T. Yao J. Jacobson S. Wigdahl B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Tax acts as a trans-activating protein that is critical for the expression of viral genes and also deregulates the expression of cellular genes. Tax regulates the expression of cellular genes by modulating signaling pathways such as NF-κB, AP-1, CREB, and nuclear factor of activated T cells (3Hall W.W. Fujii M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Tax activation of NF-κB is required for immortalization of T lymphocytes (4Akagi T. Ono H. Nyunoya H. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further, pharmacologic inhibition of NF-κB leads to apoptosis of HTLV-1 transformed T cell lines and ATL cells (5Mori N. Yamada Y. Ikeda S. Yamasaki Y. Tsukasaki K. Tanaka Y. Tomonaga M. Yamamoto N. Fujii M. Blood. 2002; 100: 1828-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). NF-κB represents a family of transcription factors that regulate a wide variety of genes controlling cell survival, development, differentiation, and activation. NF-κB family members include RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52, all of which contain a 300-amino acid Rel homology domain that mediates DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear localization (6Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 1999; 5: RE1Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, heterodimeric NF-κB complexes are held in the cytoplasm as latent transcription factors because of an interaction with members of the inhibitory IκB proteins. In response to cytokine stimulation, antigen stimulation, stress, or infection, the IκB proteins are phosphorylated on two N-terminal serine residues by a large kinase complex consisting of the catalytic subunits IKKα, IKKβ, and the regulatory protein IKKγ (also known as NEMO) (7Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκBs are ubiquitinated and targeted to the 26 S proteasome for degradation, thus releasing NF-κB from inhibition, allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate target genes (6Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 1999; 5: RE1Google Scholar). In the canonical NF-κB pathway, IKKβ and IKKγ are essential for the phosphorylation of IκBα and IκBβ, leading to the liberation of heterodimers composed of p50 and RelA or c-Rel (7Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). In the noncanonical pathway, the NF-κB inducing kinase and IKKα play important roles in the phosphorylation and processing of the p52 precursor protein p100 (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol.

HTLV-1-transformed cell lines and leukemic cells from ATL patients exhibit persistent activation of the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways (11Harhaj E.W. Harhaj N.S.

We and others have shown that Tax interacts with IKKγ, and this interaction is essential for Tax-mediated activation of IKK and NF-κB (14Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

Several recent studies have reported that ubiquitination and sumoylation are important post-transcriptional regulators of Tax-mediated NF-κB activation (17Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R.

Ubiquitinated Tax resides in the cytoplasm and activates NF-κB, whereas sumoylated Tax is located in nuclear bodies together with RelA (17Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R. Burny A.

Ubiquitination and sumoylation of Tax occur on overlapping lysine residues of which lysines 263, 280, and 284 are critical for NF-κB activation (17Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R.

In this report, we have monitored the subcellular localization of the individual endogenous IKK subunits in Tax-expressing T cells as well as HTLV-1-transformed cells. We found that Tax expression triggers a dynamic relocalization of IKK into concentrated perinuclear “hot spots” that reside within or in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus. Tax-mediated relocalization of IKKα is dependent on IKKγ because this event does not occur in IKKγ-deficient T cells. The relocalization is likely dependent on a direct interaction of IKKγ with Tax because a Tax mutant that does not bind to IKKγ is unable to relocalize IKK. Further, we find that mutation of lysines 263, 280, and 284 within Tax that are important for Tax ubiquitination are essential for Tax and IKK targeting to the Golgi. Thus, Tax-mediated NF-κB activation is associated with ubiquitin-dependent relocalization of IKK to specific compartments within the cell.

JM4.5.2 cells are a mutant cell line derivative from Jurkat SVT.35 cells that lack IKKγ (20Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C.

ED40515(-), MT-1, and TL-OM1 cells are clones of leukemic cells derived from ATL patients, kindly provided by Dr. Michiyuki Maeda (Kyoto University). These cells lack Tax expression but exhibit constitutive NF-κB activation (22Miura H. Maeda M. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All of the cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. 293-T kidney carcinoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. 293-T cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Approximately 40 h after transfections, the cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid). Retroviral Infection—Retroviral infections were performed with the pCLXSN system from Dr. I. Verma (23Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (13Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293-T cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCL-ampho, 0.15 μg of VSV-g and either 1 μg of pCLXSN, pCLXSN-Tax WT, M22, M47, or K263R,K280R,K284R mutants, or pCLXSN-GFP using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 48 h post-transfection, the viral supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm polysulfone filters specialized for low protein binding (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Viral supernatant supplemented with fresh media and 8 μg/ml polybrene was used to infect 1 × 106 Jurkat cells. The cells were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 45 min to increase infection efficiency. Viral supernatant was removed 24 h post-infection, and normal growth medium was replenished. The cells were subjected to experimentation 72 h post-infection. Immunostaining—The cells were seeded onto 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and were briefly centrifuged prior to fixation. The cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding was prevented by a 1-h incubation in PBS containing 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and 0.1% Triton X-100. The antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary antibody incubations were for 1 h, followed by five washes in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Secondary antibody incubations were for 1 h, followed by three washes in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The coverslips were mounted onto slides using AquaPolymount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) and were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal laser scanning microscope. In each experiment, the controls were stained only with secondary antibody to confirm specificity of the primary antibody. Some of the images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop. EMSA—Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected 293-T cells as described previously (24Harhaj E.W. Harhaj N.S. Grant C. Mostoller K. Alefantis T. Sun S.C. Wigdahl B. Virology. 2005; 333: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed essentially as described (24Harhaj E.W. Harhaj N.S. Grant C. Mostoller K. Alefantis T. Sun S.C. Wigdahl B. Virology. 2005; 333: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated representing a consensus NF-κB site derived from the interleukin-2Rα promoter. The probe was radiolabeled with [32P]α-dCTP in a fill-in reaction with dNTPs (Invitrogen) and Klenow (Promega, Madison, WI). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts (4 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled probe and poly(dI-dC) (1 μg), dithiothreitol (1 mm), and buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells infected with empty vector pCLXSN or pCLXSN Tax using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNA was converted to cDNA and used for PCRs to amplify either Tax or GAPDH. The primer sequences are available upon request. Reporter Gene Assays—Jurkat cells (1 × 106) were transfected with pCMV4-Tax (0.25 μg), pCMV4-Tax K263R,K280R,K284R (0.25 μg), or empty vector together with κB-TATA Luc (0.1 μg). The cell lysates were subjected to a luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. Activation of the reporter by Tax or Tax mutants was calculated as fold induction compared with empty vector. Tax Induces Relocalization of IKK into Perinuclear Hot Spots—A hallmark of receptor-mediated signal transduction is the concentration of signaling components in specific membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts (25He H.T. Lellouch A. Marguet D. Semin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is less clear how intracellular molecules, such as Tax, initiate signal transduction. Nevertheless, strong evidence suggests that Tax-mediated IKK activation does not involve cellular receptors or upstream signaling components (26Sun S.C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of IKK activation by Tax, we examined whether Tax alters the subcellular localization of individual IKK subunits in T lymphocytes. We first employed a frequently used T cell line model, Jurkat, to analyze IKKγ localization upon Tax expression. Jurkat T cells were infected with a Tax-expressing retroviral vector or empty vector, stained with anti-IKKγ and anti-Tax and subjected to confocal microscopy. In cells infected with the empty vector, IKKγ was diffusely expressed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and C). Interestingly, however, Tax expression resulted in marked relocalization of IKKγ to cytoplasmic hot spots that appeared to reside in a perinuclear region (Fig. 1, D and F). Tax was predominantly colocalized with IKKγ in these hot spots (Fig. 1, E and F). IKKγ was also relocalized in Tax-inducible JPX-9 cells (data not shown). Importantly, these IKKγ hot spots were also observed in human T cells transformed by HTLV-1 (C8166 cells; Fig. 1G), and Tax was partially colocalized with IKKγ in these cells (Fig. 1I). Because IKKγ exists largely in a trimeric kinase complex that also contains IKKα and IKKβ, we hypothesized that Tax induces aggregation of the IKK holoenzyme. To examine this idea, we analyzed the subcellular localization of IKKα and IKKβ. As seen with IKKγ, IKKα and IKKβ were diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2, A and E), although some punctate IKKβ staining was also observed (Fig. 2, E and F). In C8166 cells, IKKα (Fig. 2C) was present in perinuclear hot spots similar to those observed in Fig. 1 with IKKγ. IKKβ also appeared to be relocalized in C8166 cells compared with Jurkat cells (Fig. 2, E-H), although not to the same extent as seen with IKKα and IKKγ. Thus, Tax expression appears to be associated with the movement of the IKKs to a concentrated perinuclear region within the cell. IKKγ Is Required for Tax-induced Relocalization of the IKK Complex—We have previously shown that IKKγ functions as an adaptor for recruiting Tax to the IKK complex, which is essential for NF-κB activation (14Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 27Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34060-34067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Tax required IKKγ for inducing the relocalization of IKK complex. For this purpose, we used IKKγ-deficient Jurkat cells (JM4.5.2) that we had previously generated by somatic mutagenesis (20Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). JM4.5.2 cells or JM4.5.2 cells stably reconstituted with IKKγ (JM4.5.2-IKKγ) were infected with recombinant retroviruses either expressing Tax or empty vector control. Tax had no effect on the distribution of IKKα in IKKγ-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 3C), although Tax was expressed as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (panel I). Furthermore, this defect was rescued when the IKKγ-deficient cells were reconstituted with exogenous IKKγ (Fig. 3G). Therefore, Tax requires IKKγ to modulate the subcellular localization of IKKα. Tax Mutants Defective in NF-κB Activation Fail to Induce IKK Relocalization—To assess the functional significance of Tax-induced IKK relocalization in NF-κB activation, we examined the ability of two well characterized Tax mutants, M22 and M47, in the relocalization of IKKγ. The Tax mutant M22 is deficient in NF-κB activation but remains competent in CREB activation, whereas M47 is deficient in CREB activation but active in NF-κB activation (28Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing either Tax, Tax M22, Tax M47, or empty vector. The cells were stained with anti-IKKγ and anti-Tax and subjected to confocal microscopy. As expected, the normally diffusely localized IKKγ (Fig. 4A) was relocalized into hot spots upon expression of wild type Tax (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained with cells infected with Tax M47 (Fig. 4J), suggesting the dispensability of the CREB-activating function of Tax in IKK relocalization. In sharp contrast, the M22 mutant failed to induce the relocalization of IKKγ to perinuclear hot spots (Fig. 4G) despite its strong expression in the infected cells (Fig. 4H). Thus, Tax-mediated IKK relocalization is correlated with activation of IKK/NF-κB signaling. Because the M22 mutant is defective in Tax binding (14Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), these results also imply that Tax may require a direct interaction with IKKγ to mediate the redistribution of IKK from a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to concentrated perinuclear hot spots. IKK Relocalization Is Dependent on Tax Expression—Thus far, we have observed that the relocalization of IKK was tightly linked to Tax-mediated NF-κB activation. However, it was important to determine whether IKK relocalization was dependent on Tax expression or simply a result of IKK activation. To address this question, we examined IKKγ localization in three different ATL cell lines that lack Tax expression but maintain activated NF-κB (22Miura H. Maeda M. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). IKKγ was expressed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and on top of the nucleus in the ATL cell lines MT-1, TL-OM1, and ED40515(-) (Fig. 5, E-J). As expected IKKγ was present in hot spots in C8166 cells (Fig. 5, C and D) but not in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Next, we treated Jurkat cells with PMA and ionomycin for either 15 min or 2 h to activate IKK. As observed in Fig. 5 (K-P), PMA and ionomycin did not alter the diffuse staining of IKKα. The treatment was effective because RelA translocated to the nucleus at both time points (data not shown). Also, treatment of cells with TNFα did not trigger the relocalization of IKKα (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that relocalization of IKK to perinuclear hot spots is critically dependent on Tax expression. Tax Promotes IKK Relocalization to the Golgi Apparatus—We next wanted to characterize the perinuclear hot spots containing IKKs. For this purpose, we used antibodies recognizing different cellular markers and organelles. C8166 cells were costained with anti-IKKγ and markers for either endosomal, lysosomal, lipid rafts, or Golgi apparatus. IKKγ did not colocalize with endosomes, lysosomes, or lipid rafts (data not shown). However, we did observe a partial colocalization of IKKα and IKKγ with the Golgi apparatus when cells were costained with either anti-Giantin or anti-Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM-130) antibodies (Fig. 6, C and F). To further demonstrate IKKγ localization to the Golgi, we treated C8166 cells with nocodazole and brefeldin A to disrupt the Golgi. As expected, treatment with nocodazole resulted in a relocalization of GM-130 to multivesicular bodies dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6K). Interestingly, IKKγ localization changed from perinuclear to a more broadly distributed vesicular staining (Fig. 6J). Much of IKKγ remained colocalized with GM-130, suggesting that IKKγ was tightly associated with the Golgi (Fig. 6L). Treatment of C8166 cells with brefeldin A also led to a dramatic relocalization of IKKγ from a perinuclear area to vesicular staining throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6M). Thus, it appears that IKK is localized within or is associated with the Golgi apparatus in HTLV-1 transformed cells. In support of these observations, a recent study has demonstrated that Tax is localized, at least partially, in the cis-Golgi stacks in transfected cells as well as naturally infected T lymphocytes from HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis patients (29Nejmeddine M. Barnard A.L. Tanaka Y. Taylor G.P. Bangham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29653-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the Golgi apparatus is a major site of signal transduction (30Mor A. Philips M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 771-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the Tax-mediated IKK relocalization to this site may be an important mechanism of IKK activation. A Ubiquitination-defective Tax Mutant Does Not Mediate IKK Relocalization—Because ubiquitination of Tax likely regulates its subcellular localization and NF-κB activation (17Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Bex F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10391-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Nasr R. Chiari E. El-Sabban M. Mahieux R. Kfoury Y. Abdulhay M. Yazbeck V. Hermine O. de The H. Pique C. Bazarbachi A. Blood. 2006; 107: 4021-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine the role of Tax ubiquitination in IKK relocalization. The critical lysine residues within Tax for ubiquitination are lysines 263, 280, and 284 (31Chiari E. Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Chopin C. Bex F. Pique C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11823-11832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and mutation of these lysines to arginine residues results in a defect in NF-κB activation (17Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Bex F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10391-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine the role of these lysines in Tax-mediated relocalization of IKK. Therefore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate the Tax K263R,K280R,K284R mutant. We then examined the function of this mutant for activation of the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways. In agreement with others (17Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Bex F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10391-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Nasr R. Chiari E. El-Sabban M. Mahieux R. Kfoury Y. Abdulhay M. Yazbeck V. Hermine O. de The H. Pique C. Bazarbachi A. Blood. 2006; 107: 4021-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), Tax K263R,K280R,K284R was defective in NF-κB activation as assessed by EMSA (Fig. 7B) and luciferase assays (Fig. 7A). This mutant was also defective in the noncanonical pathway because p100 processing to p52 was diminished compared with wild type Tax (Fig. 7C). We also mutated lysines 263, 280, and 284 to arginines in the context of the pCLXSN-Tax retroviral vector. Jurkat cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing the Tax K263R,K280R,K284R mutant. The cells were stained with anti-Tax and anti-IKKγ and subjected to confocal microscopy. In contrast to wild type Tax, the Tax mutant did not relocalize IKKγ to perinuclear hot spots in infected cells (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, Tax was also not present in the perinuclear hot spots. Thus, ubiquitination of Tax and specifically lysines 263, 280, and 284 likely regulates coordinated Tax-IKKγ movement to the Golgi. In this report, we demonstrate that Tax modulates the subcellular localization of endogenous IKK subunits in T lymphocytes. In the absence of Tax, the IKKs are present diffusely throughout the cytoplasm; however, in Tax-expressing T lymphocytes and HTLV-1 transformed cell lines, IKKα and IKKγ are predominantly localized within perinuclear hot spots that colocalize with the Golgi apparatus. The redistribution of IKK to the Golgi appears to be important for IKK activation, because this cellular event was not observed with Tax mutants unable to activate IKK/NF-κB. This idea is further supported by the finding that IKKγ, an essential adaptor of Tax in IKK activation, is required for Tax-mediated relocalization of IKK. Furthermore, the relocalization of IKK is dependent on Tax expression, indicating that IKK activation is not sufficient for movement to the Golgi. We also provide evidence that lysines 263, 280, and 284 are critical for Tax activation of the canonical and noncanonical pathways. These lysines are also essential for the redistribution of IKK. Thus, ubiquitination of Tax may modulate the interaction with IKK and the movement of Tax-IKK complexes within the cell. The IKK-containing perinuclear hot spots that we have observed in Tax-expressing Jurkat cells and HTLV-1 transformed cell lines may represent highly concentrated, oligomerized forms of IKK. Oligomerization of IKKγ is emerging as an important role in the activation of the IKK complex. Forced oligomerization of IKKγ by fusion with the FKBP12 polypeptide leads to NF-κB activation and the redistribution of the IKK subunits from uniform to punctate cytoplasmic staining (32Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J.H. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37966-37977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Tax also promotes the oligomerization of IKKγ through a direct interaction (33Huang G.J. Zhang Z.Q. Jin D.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, Tax likely triggers the oligomerization of IKKγ, through an undefined mechanism, leading to the oligomerization of associated IKKs and the redistribution to the perinuclear hot spots discovered in the present study. We and others have reported that Tax physically interacts with the IKKγ subunit, and this interaction is critical for recruitment of Tax to the IKK complex and the activation of IKK and NF-κB (14Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Chu Z.L. Shin Y.A. Yang J.M. DiDonato J.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17402-17405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because Tax requires IKKγ for the relocalization of IKKα into the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3), it is likely that Tax recruits IKKα to the Golgi via a direct interaction with IKKγ. Indeed, we have not observed Tax in the perinuclear area in the absence of IKKγ. Moreover, a Tax mutant (M22) defective in IKKγ binding fails to relocate IKK (Fig. 4). A recent study suggests that ubiquitination of Tax regulates binding to IKKγ, because a Tax mutant with multiple lysine to arginine substitutions does not interact with IKKγ (18Nasr R. Chiari E. El-Sabban M. Mahieux R. Kfoury Y. Abdulhay M. Yazbeck V. Hermine O. de The H. Pique C. Bazarbachi A. Blood. 2006; 107: 4021-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have found that a ubiquitination-defective Tax mutant (Tax K263R,K280R,K284R) is unable to relocalize IKKγ (Fig. 7D). However, this Tax mutant retains its ability to bind IKKγ, although a Tax mutant harboring arginine substitutions at all 10 lysines becomes defective in IKKγ binding (data not shown). Because the Tax K263R,K280R,K284R mutant itself fails to localize to the Golgi region, it suggests the possibility that ubiquitination of Tax plays a role in mediating its subcellular localization and, thereby, IKK distribution. Our findings are supported by several previous reports indicating that a substantial fraction of Tax colocalizes with the Golgi apparatus (17Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Bex F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10391-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Nejmeddine M. Barnard A.L. Tanaka Y. Taylor G.P. Bangham C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17353-17362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tax appears to be localized partially in the cis-Golgi adjacent to the microtubule organizing center in naturally infected T lymphocytes from HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis patients (29Nejmeddine M. Barnard A.L. Tanaka Y. Taylor G.P. Bangham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29653-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Tax promotes microtubule polymerization, in cooperation with ICAM-1 engagement, leading to the formation of the virological synapse that enables cell-to-cell spread of HTLV-1 (29Nejmeddine M. Barnard A.L. Tanaka Y. Taylor G.P. Bangham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29653-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C. Goon P.K. Taylor G.P. Weber J.N. Griffiths G.M. Tanaka Y. Osame M. Bangham C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Based on our results, one possibility is that Tax may recruit IKK to the vicinity of the Golgi/microtubule organizing center to facilitate IKK-mediated phosphorylation of targets necessary for microtubule polymerization. However, Tax M47 was unable to mediate microtubule organizing center polymerization in Jurkat cells, suggesting that CREB but not NF-κB may be essential for this process (29Nejmeddine M. Barnard A.L. Tanaka Y. Taylor G.P. Bangham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29653-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because Tax-mediated IKK relocalization is correlated with IKK activation, a more attractive hypothesis is that the IKK redistribution serves as a mechanism of IKK activation. Although Tax promotes the relocalization of all three IKK subunits, it appears that the effect of Tax on IKKβ is not as pronounced (Fig. 2). Because IKKα and IKKγ are critical components for Tax-mediated induction of the noncanonical pathway involving p100 processing to p52 (13Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), perhaps the relocalization may be more important for this specific function of Tax. Additional studies are required to more precisely determine the functional roles of Tax-mediated targeting of IKK to the Golgi in the canonical and/or noncanonical NF-κB pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that the Golgi apparatus is one of the intracellular sites of signal transduction (30Mor A. Philips M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 771-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 36Rios R.M. Bornens M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The small GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are critical regulators of cytoskeleton reorganization and cell movement and can all localize to the Golgi. A signaling protein, ARAP1, resides in the Golgi and regulates Arf-, Rho-, and Cdc42-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling and cell movement (37Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K. Hirsch D.S. Resau J. Zheng Y. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The p21-activated kinase (PAK)-related kinase PAK4, which has been implicated in cell transformation, is redistributed to the Golgi in the presence of activated Cdc42 (38Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). With regard to NF-κB signaling, the IKKγ-related coiled-coil protein NRP (NEMO-related protein) is a Golgi-resident protein, although its function in signaling is currently unknown (39Schwamborn K. Weil R. Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22780-22789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We are currently trying to determine whether NRP plays any role in IKK relocalization to the Golgi. Nevertheless, the current findings provide an important insight into the mechanism by which Tax modulates the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Tax has been demonstrated to be mono- and polyubiquitinated in transfected cells and HTLV-1-transformed cell lines (31Chiari E. Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Chopin C. Bex F. Pique C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11823-11832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Peloponese Jr., J.M. Iha H. Yedavalli V.R. Miyazato A. Li Y. Haller K. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11686-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Tax also interacts with various subunits of the proteasome (31Chiari E. Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Chopin C. Bex F. Pique C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11823-11832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 41Hemelaar J. Bex F. Booth B. Cerundolo V. McMichael A. Daenke S. J.

These results suggest that Tax ubiquitination may promote its degradation; however, several recent studies do not support this hypothesis. Rather, it appears that Tax ubiquitination may regulate its subcellular localization and NF-κB activation via binding to IKKγ (18Nasr R. Chiari E. El-Sabban M. Mahieux R. Kfoury Y. Abdulhay M. Yazbeck V. Hermine O. de The H. Pique C. Bazarbachi A. Blood. 2006; 107: 4021-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination mediates distinct functional roles depending on the exact lysine within ubiquitin that links the ubiquitin chains together. Whereas lysine 48-mediated ubiquitin linkages target proteins for proteasomal degradation, linkages supported by other lysines such as Lys63 modulate subcellular localization and/or protein function (44Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that Tax ubiquitination consists of linkages other than Lys48, probably Lys63. Nevertheless, we have shown here that Tax ubiquitination may regulate Tax and IKKα and IKKγ localization to the Golgi apparatus. Future studies will determine additional roles polyubiquitination may play in Tax activation of NF-κB.

Here we studied the effects of the translocational status of HIV-1 RT on drug binding and inhibition of DNA synthesis. We identified “hot spots” for inhibition during active elongation. Site-specific footprinting analyses revealed that the corresponding complexes exist predominantly in the pre-translocational state. The sensitivity to PFA is significantly reduced with sequences that show a bias toward the post-translocational state.

The enzyme can rapidly shuttle between pre- and post-translocated states. The bound inhibitor acts like a pawl of a ratchet and prevents the forward motion of HIV-1 RT, whereas the bound nucleotide binds to the post-translocated complex and prevents the reverse motion. The proposed mechanisms of RT translocation and drug action are consistent with the PFA-resistant phenotypes. We show that certain sequences and the PFA-resistant E89K mutant diminishes the stability of the pre-translocated complex. In these cases, the enzyme is seen at multiple positions around the 3′ end of the primer, which provides a novel mechanism for resistance.

Different classes of inhibitors that target the reverse transcriptase (RT) 4The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; NRTI, nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor; NNRTI, non-nucleoside analogue RT inhibitor; PFA, phosphonoformic acid; PPT, polypurine tract; AZT, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine. 4The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; NRTI, nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor; NNRTI, non-nucleoside analogue RT inhibitor; PFA, phosphonoformic acid; PPT, polypurine tract; AZT, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine. of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been developed (1De Clercq E. Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs. 2005; 10: 241-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are major components in drug regimens that are currently used in the clinic. Two different NRTIs are usually combined with a non-nucleoside analogue RT inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor. The triphosphate forms of NRTIs compete with natural nucleotide pools for incorporation, and, once incorporated, the monophosphate acts as a chain terminator. NNRTIs bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the vicinity but not at the active site of HIV-1 RT. Previous studies have suggested that these compounds interfere with the chemical step, whereas nucleotide binding does not appear to be largely affected (2Spence R.A. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here we studied the mechanism of action of the pyrophosphate (PPi) analogue phosphonoformic acid (PFA or foscarnet), which represents a third class of RT inhibitors. PFA shows a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against various members of the Herpesviridae and Retroviridae (4Oberg B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1982; 19: 387-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The inhibitor is used in the clinic to treat infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), the human cytomegalovirus, and other related herpesviruses when firstline agents have failed (5De Clercq E. J. Clin. Virol. 2004; 30: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Toxic side effects and its poor bioavailability limit its clinical utility as a component in drug regimens for HIV treatment. Despite these problems, PFA is sometimes used in patients infected with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants when no other treatment options are available (6Mathiesen S. Roge B.T. Weis N. Lundgren J.D. Obel N. Gerstoft J. Aids. 2004; 18: 1076-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The beneficial effects of this drug have been primarily associated with its resistance profile. With few exceptions, mutations that confer decreased susceptibility to NRTIs and NNR-TIs do not affect susceptibility to PFA (7Mellors J.W. Bazmi H.Z. Schinazi R.F. Roy B.M. Hsiou Y. Arnold E.

Virology. 1995; 212: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Most importantly, mutations associated with PFA resistance were shown to increase susceptibility to the nucleoside analogue 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (zidovudine or AZT) (10Tachedjian G. Mellors J.

Biochemical data have shown that PFA-associated resistance mutations diminish the phosphorolytic excision of incorporated chain terminators such as AZT-monophosphate (8Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E.

Wild type HIV-1 RT is capable of removing AZT-monophosphate in the presence of pyrophosphate (PPi) (13Rigourd M. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26944-26951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or a PPi donor such as ATP (14Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Rates of the ATP-dependent excision reaction are significantly increased with RT enzymes containing thymidineassociated resistance mutations, which provides an important mechanism for resistance to this class of compounds (15Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in PFA drug action and drug resistance remain to be elucidated. Steady-state kinetics with retroviral RT enzymes, and DNA polymerases of herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus suggest a non-competitive mode of inhibition of DNA synthesis with respect to the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrate (4Oberg B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1982; 19: 387-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Crumpacker C.S. Am. J. Med. 1992; 92: 3S-7SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Tchesnokov E.P. Gilbert C. Boivin G. Gotte M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, PFA competitively blocks pyrophosphorolysis and PPi exchange reactions, which points to overlapping binding sites for PFA and PPi (18Derse D. Bastow K.F. Cheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10251-10260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT has been crystallized in various forms in the presence of primer/template without and with a bound dNTP substrate (19Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Jacobo-Molina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar); however, structures of ternary complexes with PFA or PPi are not available. In a single cycle of nucleotide incorporation, PPi is generated following the formation of a new phosphodiester bond (21Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4835-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 22Hsieh J.C. Zinnen S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the next complementary nucleotide requires the release of PPi from this product complex. The enzyme must translocate a single template position further downstream to clear the nucleotide binding site (N-site). This motion relative to the nucleic acid substrate brings the 3′ end of the primer to the priming or product site (P-site) (24Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The latter configuration is referred to as the post-translocational state. Cross-linking experiments revealed that pyrophosphorolysis or the ATP-dependent excision can only occur in the former pre-translocational state (26Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Tuske S. Squire C.J. Das K. Sheng D. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Kroth H. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To account for the non-competitive mode of inhibition it has been suggested that PFA may likewise bind to the pre-translocated complex (8Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Zonarich D. Chopra R.R. Pendarvis E. Bazmi H.Z. Mellors J.W. Scott W.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6127-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). High concentrations of PFA appear to excise incorporated AZT-monophosphate, which provides some support for this notion (44Cruchaga C. Anso E. Rouzaut A. Martinez-Irujo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27744-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be seen whether the pre-translocational state is accessible during active DNA synthesis. If so, what is the underlying mechanism? We have recently developed site-specific footprinting techniques that allow the distinction between pre- and post-translocated states (27Marchand B. Gotte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the sequence of the nucleic acid substrate affects the ratio of pre- and post-translocational states at a given template position. PFA-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis is linked to primer/template sequences that facilitate the formation of the pre-translocational state. These findings suggest that pre- and post-translocated complexes equilibrate immediately following each nucleotide incorporation event. The PPi analogue traps the pre-translocated complex, which prevents binding of the next nucleotide. PFA is therefore a competitive inhibitor. The non-competitive mode of inhibition is a consequence of the increased stability of the product complex, which diminishes the turnover. The results of this study validate the pre-translocated complex as a target for drug discovery and development efforts. Enzymes and Nucleic Acids—Heterodimeric reverse transcriptase p66/p51 was expressed and purified essentially as described (28Le Grice S.F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were generated through sitedirected mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study were chemically synthesized and purchased from Invitrogen. The following sequences were used as templates: PPT57, CGTTGGGAGTGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA; PPT31, CCATCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGT. The following sequences were used as primers: PPT, TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGG; PPT+2, TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGAC; PPT+3, TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACT; PPT+4, TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACTG; PPT+5, TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACTGG; PPT+6, TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACTGGA; PPT+7, TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACTGGAA; PPT+11, AAAGGGGGGACTGGAAGGGC; PPT+12, AAGGGGGGACTGGAAGGGCT; PPT+15, GGGGGACTGGAAGGGCTAAT; PPT+16, GGGGACTGGAAGGGCTAATT. Deoxynucleotide and dideoxynucleotides were purchased at Fermentas Life Sciences. AZT-triphosphate was purchased from Trilink Biotechnologies, and phosphonoformic acid was purchased from Sigma. DNA Synthesis—1 pmol of the 5′-labeled PPT primer was heat annealed with 3 pmol the template. The DNA/DNA hybrid was incubated with 3 pmol of HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 6 mm MgCl2, in the absence or presence of PFA and 10 μm each of the four dNTPs. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 3 min, and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 90% isopropyl alcohol, 300 mm ammonium acetate, and 10 ng/μl bulk Escherichia coli tRNA. The DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of 100% formamide containing traces of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The samples were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by phosphorimaging. Site-specific Footprinting—KOONO was prepared by stirring 10 ml of 1.2 m KNO2 with 1.4 ml of 30% H2O2 on ice. 10 ml of 1.4 m HCl was added to the stirring solution and immediately quenched with 10 ml of 2 m KOH. Aliquots were stored at -80 °C. In preparation of the footprinting reaction, the 3′ endlabeled template was heat annealed with the primer. The DNA/DNA hybrid (1 pmol) was incubated with 6 pmol of RT in a buffer containing sodium cacodylate, pH 7 (120 mm), NaCl (20 mm), dithiothreitol (0.5 mm), and MgCl2 (6 mm) in a final volume of 20 μl. Different concentrations of PFA were then added to the reaction followed by an incubation of 10 min at 37 °C. The complex was treated with 1.5 μl of KOONO (100 mm). Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The radiolabeled DNA/DNA hybrid (1 pmol) was incubated with 5 pmol of HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 6 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 20 μl. The DNA primer was first chain terminated with the appropriate ddNTP to prevent incorporation of the next complementary nucleotide. PFA or the templated nucleotide, respectively, was then added at different concentrations prior to the addition of heparin (1.5 μg/μl). The complexes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature, and the samples containing 50% sucrose were analyzed on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. The results were quantified as the fraction of shifted primer/template for each concentration of substrate used. Apparent Kd was estimated by fitting the quantified results to a hyperbola for one site binding (Y = Bmax × X(Kd + X)) as previously described (29Tong W. Lu C.D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics—Steady-state kinetic parameters Km, kcat, and Ki for single nucleotide incorporation events in the presence or absence of PFA were determined through gelbased assays (30Gotte M. Kameoka M. McLellan N. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We used three different primers (PPT+4, PPT+6, and PPT+16) that allow the study of single nucleotide incorporation events. The incorporation of the nucleotide was monitored at a single time point in the presence of increasing concentrations of the next complementary nucleotide. Ki values were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of PFA. Reactions were carried out in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 0.6 pmol of primer/template, and 0.08 pmol of active site RT. Nucleotide incorporation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mm, and reactions were allowed to proceed for 7 min at positions +4 and +16, and 3 min at position +6 to ensure that the rates of the reactions were within the linear range. The excess of primer/template (DNA substrate) over the RT and the linear range of product formation ensured and confirmed, respectively, the steady-state conditions of single nucleotide incorporation. The samples were analyzed as described above. Single nucleotide incorporation was quantified as the fraction of the DNA substrate (template/primer) converted to product (template/primer + 1 nucleotide). The rate of single nucleotide incorporation was plotted versus dNTP concentration. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by use of GraphPad Prism (version 4.0) to determine Km and kcat values. kcat was defined as maximal rate of single nucleotide incorporation. Km was defined as the concentration of dNTP at which the rate of single nucleotide incorporation was equal to the half-maximal rate. Ki values were determined by plotting 1/kcat and Km as a function of the concentration of PFA. If increasing concentrations of PFA resulted in increased Km only (suggesting a competitive mode of inhibition) than Ki values were determined from the x intercept of Km versus PFA concentration graphs. If increasing concentrations of PFA resulted in increased Km and/or decreased kcat (suggesting a non-competitive mode of inhibition) than Ki values were determined from the y intercept of kcat versus PFA concentration graphs. kcat, Km, and Ki constitute steady-state parameters for a single nucleotide incorporation event. We conducted experiments that were designed to analyze possible sequence-dependent effects associated with PFA-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis. The aim of this approach was to isolate and characterize complexes that either increase or decrease the inhibitory effects of PFA to study the possible link between the efficiency of inhibition and the translocation status of HIV-1 RT. Hot Spots for PFA-mediated Inhibition of DNA Synthesis—We devised a heteropolymeric primer/template substrate and compared the patterns of DNA synthesis in the presence of increasing concentrations of PFA and PPi, respectively (Fig. 1). The substrate was derived from the polypurine tract (PPT) of HIV-1 as previously described (30Gotte M. Kameoka M. McLellan N. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reactions with PFA show distinct bands at positions +2, +3, +7, +8, +12, +14, +16, and +25 (Fig. 1A, left). At low concentrations of the inhibitor, i.e. conditions that still permit full-length DNA synthesis, most prominent bands correspond to positions +3 and +16 (Fig. 1B, top). At high concentrations of the inhibitor (>25 μm), less sensitive sites, e.g. position +1, can likewise be affected, which eventually leads to complete inhibition. This data shows that inhibition of DNA synthesis in the presence of PFA is sequence dependent. However, unlike classical chain terminators that interact with their complementary base, a common sequence-specific feature is not evident. Reactions with PPi give rise to bands that are frequently offset by a single nucleotide, as compared with the reaction carried out with PFA (Fig. 1, A, right, and B, bottom). Major bands that are observed in the presence of PPi are seen at positions +2, +11, and +15, as compared with major sites of inhibition with PFA that appear at +3 and +16 (Fig. 1B). High concentrations of PPi facilitate the reverse reaction. Thus, the shift in the cleavage patterns suggests that PPi and PFA can bind to the same complexes, although the concentrations of PFA required to block DNA synthesis are significantly lower as compared with the inhibitory concentrations of PPi (micromolar versus millimolar) (Fig. 1A). As pyrophosphorolysis must occur at the N-site in the pre-translocated state, it is conceivable that sequences associated with hot spots for PPi or PFA binding stabilize the pre-translocated state. To address this problem directly, we employed site-specific footprinting techniques that allow us to determine the position of HIV-1 RT on its primer/template substrates at single nucleotide resolution. Effects of the Translocational State of HIV-1 RT on PFA Inhibition—We devised primer/template substrates to generate the complexes that are associated with hot spots of inhibition. These substrates are referred to as PPT+3, PPT+7, PPT+12, and PPT+16. For comparative purpose, we have also included substrates for complexes at adjacent template positions (PPT+2, PPT+6, PPT+11, and PPT+15). With the exception of position +2, the inhibitory effects of PFA are much less pronounced at the latter sequences. Inhibition at position +2 is seen at concentrations >6 μm, which indicates medium levels of inhibition. Treatment of these RT-DNA complexes with the chemical nuclease potassium peroxynitrite (KOONO), which is a metal-free source of hydroxyl radicals, was shown to cleave the template site specifically at positions -7 and/or -8. Position -1 corresponds to the template nucleotide that is base paired with the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the primer (27Marchand B. Gotte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cleavage at position -7 is indicative for the post-translocated state, whereas cleavage at position -8 is indicative for the pretranslocation state. The reaction is mediated through Cys280 in the large subunit p66, which is located in the vicinity of the template. Here, we conducted the footprinting experiments in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of PFA to study whether variations in the sequence can affect the ratio of complexes that exist pre- or post-translocation, and whether the inhibitor traps one or the other configuration. The data show that complexes associated with PFA hot spots, e.g. PPT+16, exist predominantly in the pre-translocated state (cleavage at position -8) in the absence of inhibitor. Increasing concentrations of PFA do not cause a shift in the cleavage pattern (Fig. 2A, top, right). In contrast, complex PPT+15, which is not a PFA hot spot, exists as a mixture of pre- and post-translocated configurations, with preference toward post-translocation (cleavage at position -7) (Fig. 2A, top, left). Increasing concentrations of PFA cause a shift toward pretranslocation, which provides strong evidence that the inhibitor binds to and stabilizes specifically the pre-translocated state. A very similar trend is seen with the other pairs: PPT+3 and PPT+2, PPT+7 and PPT+6, and PPT+12 and PPT+11 (Fig. 2B). Both PPT+3 and PPT+16 strongly promote PFA-mediated inhibition and these two complexes pre-exist in the pre-translocated state in the absence of inhibitor. The other complexes exist as mixtures. The ratio of pre- and post-translocated states depends on both parameters: sequence context and the concentration of PFA that is required to trap the complex in the pre-translocated configuration. Highest concentrations of PFA are required at positions +6, +11, and +15 that are literally resistant to PFA inhibition. Intermediate concentrations of PFA are required at positions +2, +7, and +12, and these complexes are associated with moderate levels of inhibition with PFA. These findings point to a correlation between the efficiency of inhibition and access to the pre-translocational state, which is further explored. Relative Stability of Ternary Complexes with PFA or dNTP Substrate—To further study the role of the translocation status of HIV-1 RT with regards to the mechanism of PFA inhibition, we analyzed whether the sequence-dependent increase in access of the pre-translocational state correlates with increased binding of the inhibitor. Band shift experiments have revealed that binary complexes of HIV-1 RT and primer/template are unstable when challenged with a trap, e.g. heparin (29Tong W. Lu C.D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the presence of dNTP substrate can stabilize the complex, which prevents dissociation in the presence of trap. These findings are consistent with site-specific footprinting experiments showing that the nucleotide traps the complex in the post-translocated state (27Marchand B. Gotte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Marchand B. Gotte M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1823-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we used complexes PPT+3, as an example for a pre-translocated complex, and PPT+6, as an example for a post-translocated complex, to look at the stability of ternary complexes with PFA and the next nucleotide, respectively (Fig. 3A). We found that PPT+3 is stabilized with increasing concentrations of PFA, whereas a stable ternary complex is not formed with PPT+6. The extent to which the templated nucleotide stabilizes the two complexes follows the opposite trend. The apparent Kd for dNTP at complex PPT+6 (Kd(app) = 0.7 μm) is significantly lower as compared with complex PPT+3(Kd(app) = 17.7 μm). The data are consistent with our footprints and provide strong evidence to support the notion that PFA and the templated nucleotide bind to pre- and post-translocated states, respectively. Sequence variations that determine whether a given complex exists predominantly in one or the other configuration play a critical role in this regard. To study whether PFA binds at or close to the PPi binding site in the pre-translocated state, we performed band shift experiments in the absence and presence of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 3B). Significantly lower concentrations of PFA are required to stabilize the complex in the presence of 6 mm Mg2+, which is reflected in the estimation of apparent Kd values. The Kd for complex PPT+3 with Mg2+ was lower (Kd(app) = 0.4 μm) when compared with measurements without Mg2+ (Kd(app) = 13.9 μm). This data suggest that PFA binding to the pre-translocated state occurs in close proximity to the metal binding sites at the active site of HIV-1 RT. PPi may bind to a similar location; however, there must be subtle differences in the mode of binding of PPi and PFA if one considers the differences in the inhibitory concentrations and the inability of PFA to act as PPi donor. Together these findings suggest that binding of PFA and the subsequent stabilization of the pre-translocated state could limit access to the post-translocated state. The dNTP substrate cannot bind to the pre-translocated state, because the 3′ end of the primer and the bound PFA occlude the nucleotide binding site. This model predicts that the inhibition of DNA synthesis with PFA is competitive in nature. Kinetic Consequences—To study the influence of the translocation status on steady-state kinetic parameters for a single nucleotide incorporation event and its inhibition with PFA, we devised a complex that is highly sensitive to PFA inhibition (PPT+16), and a complex that is less sensitive to PFA inhibition (PPT+6). We have also analyzed complex PPT+4, as another independent example for a template position that is not associated with PFA inhibition (see Fig. 1). The three sequences allow us to limit DNA synthesis to single nucleotide incorporation events in standing-start experiments (Fig. 4A). The kinetic parameters are shown in Table 1 and changes with regards to Km and kcat values are shown in Fig. 4, B-D. The efficiency of nucleotide incorporation (kcat/Km) follows the order PPT+6 > PPT"
https://openalex.org/W2083215308,"We have recently reported that treatment with gemcitabine, a potent chemotherapeutic agent and radiation sensitizer, stimulates phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Because phosphorylation of EGFR is known to precede receptor degradation, we hypothesized that gemcitabine treatment may also result in EGFR degradation. In two human head and neck cancer cell lines, UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-6, we demonstrated an approximately 80% decrease in total EGFR levels at 72 h after a 2-h treatment with 1 muM gemcitabine. Neither cisplatin nor 5-fluorouracil, which are used to treat head and neck cancer, caused EGFR degradation. EGFR downregulation did not occur at the level of transcription, as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but instead occurred via phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the receptor along a proteosome/lysosome-mediated pathway. Inhibition of EGFR degradation, by either pretreatment with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib or by exposure to the proteosome/lysosome inhibitor MG132, significantly reduced gemcitabine-induced cell death. These results suggest that EGFR degradation may be a novel mechanism for gemcitabine-mediated cell death. These findings also indicate that caution should be exercised when combining gemcitabine with agents that may prevent EGFR degradation, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in a suboptimal sequence or proteosome inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2025702139,"To identify target genes for the hemizygous deletions of chromosome 13 that are recurrently observed in malignant gliomas, we performed genome-wide DNA copy-number analysis using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and gene expression analysis using an oligonucleotide-array. The response gene to complement 32 (RGC32) at 13q14.11 was identified as a deletion target, and its expression was frequently silenced in glioma cell lines compared with normal brain. Levels of RGC32 mRNA tended to decrease toward higher grades of primary astrocytomas, especially in tumors with mutations of p53. Expression of RGC32 mRNA was dramatically increased by exogenous p53 in a p53-mutant glioma cell line, and also by endogenous p53 in response to DNA damage in p53+/+ colon-cancer cells, but not in isogenic p53−/− cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated binding of endogenous p53 protein to the promoter region of the RGC32 gene, implying p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Transiently and stably overexpressed RGC32 suppressed the growth of glioma cells, probably owing to induction of G2/M arrest. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a concentration of RGC32 protein at the centrosome during mitosis. RGC32 formed a protein complex with polo-like kinase 1 and was phosphorylated in vitro. These observations implied a novel mechanism by which p53 might negatively regulate cell-cycle progression by way of this newly identified transcriptional target. Our results provide the first evidence that RGC32 might be a possible tumor-suppressor for glioma, that it is directly induced by p53, and that it mediates the arrest of mitotic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2165708883,"The cytochrome bc1 complex is a dimeric enzyme of the inner mitochondrial membrane that links electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c by a protonmotive Q cycle mechanism in which ubiquinol is oxidized at one center in the enzyme, referred to as center P, and ubiquinone is rereduced at a second center, referred to as center N. To better understand the mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation, we have examined catalytic activities and pre-steady-state reduction kinetics of yeast cytochrome bc1 complexes with mutations in cytochrome b that we expected would affect oxidation of ubiquinol. We mutated two residues thought to be involved in proton conduction linked to ubiquinol oxidation, Tyr132 and Glu272, and two residues proposed to be involved in docking ubiquinol into the center P pocket, Phe129 and Tyr279. Substitution of Phe129 by lysine or arginine yielded a respiration-deficient phenotype and lipid-dependent catalytic activity. Increased bypass reactions were detectable for both variants, with F129K showing the more severe effects. Substitution with lysine leads to a disturbed coordination of a b heme as deduced from changes in the midpoint potential and the EPR signature.

The mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex, also termed ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (QCR) 2The abbreviations used are: QCR, ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase; ISP, Rieske iron sulfur protein; DQH, decylubiquinol. or complex III, is a central component of respiratory energy conversion. The multisubunit membrane protein complex catalyzes the transfer of electrons from the membrane-localized ubiquinol to the water-soluble cytochrome c. This redox reaction is coupled to translocation of protons across the membrane. The mechanism that links proton translocation to electron transfer, the protonmotive Q cycle (1Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), depends on two spatially separated binding sites for quinol and quinone, both located in subunit cytochrome b. The key step of the mechanism is the bifurcated route of the two electrons released upon ubiquinol oxidation at center P. One electron is transferred into the high potential chain, the 2Fe-2S cluster Rieske protein (ISP) and cytochrome c1, consequently being delivered to cytochrome c. The second electron is transferred via the low potential chain, heme bL and heme bH of cytochrome b, to center N, at which quinone is reduced to semiquinone. A complete turnover of the enzyme requires the oxidation of two ubiquinol molecules, resulting in reduction of the semiquinone (2Hunte C. Palsdottir H. Trumpower B.L.

Details of the molecular mechanism of QCR are under debate. Of special interest is the mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation at center P. The ubiquinol oxidation pocket has no direct access to the aqueous phase. A proton exit route that parallels electron transfer from ubiquinol toward heme bL has been proposed (5Hunte C. Koepke J.

The residue Tyr132 is located between Glu272 and heme bL. The hydroxyl group of this tyrosine is thought to stabilize the proton transfer pathway. The residue Tyr279 is proposed to preorient the substrate, whereas Phe129 presumably stabilizes the hydrophobic tail of the ubiquinol. To challenge the significance of these residues for quinol catalysis, we analyzed how mutations in Glu272, Tyr132, Phe129, and Tyr279 of cytochrome b influence ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity and short circuit electron transfer reactions that result in superoxide anion production. We also used presteady-state reduction kinetics of cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 of the Tyr132 and Glu272 variants to analyze the role of these residues in electron transfer. Media and Yeast Strains—Premixed media were from For-Medium. YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 3% galactose) and YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 3% glycerol) were used for growth of the yeast strains. The strains used in this study are described in detail elsewhere (12Wenz T. Hellwig P. MacMillan F. Meunier B. Hunte C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9042-9052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis, Biolistic Transformation, and Selection of Mitochondrial Mutants—The plasmid pBM5 carrying the wild-type intronless sequence of the cytochrome b gene was mutagenized using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used: 5′-CTA TTG CTA CAG CTA AAT TAG GTT ATT GTT GTG-3′ and 5′-CTC AAC AAT AAC CTA ATT TAG CAG TAG CAA TAG-3′ for F129K, 5′-CTA TTG CTA CAG CTA GAT TAG GTT ATT GTT GTG-3′ and 5′-CTC AAC AAT AAC CTA ATC TAG CTG TAG CAA TAG-3′ for F129R, and 5′-TAC AGC TTT TTT AGG TTT TTG TTG TGT TTA TG-3′ and 5′-CAT AAA CAC AAC AAA AAC CTA AAA AAG CTG TA-3′ for Y132F. The mitochondrial biolistic transformation, the selection of the mitochondrial transformants, and the integration of the mutation into the mitochondrial genome was carried out as described before (12Wenz T. Hellwig P. MacMillan F. Meunier B. Hunte C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9042-9052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The yeast strains carrying the Y279A/C/S mutation were previously constructed and were provided by B. Meunier (13Fisher N. Castleden C.K. Bourges I. Brasseur G. Dujardin G. Meunier B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purification of QCR—Wild-type and mutant yeast strains were grown in YPG or YPGal medium as indicated under “Results.” Mitochondrial membranes were prepared as described previously (12Wenz T. Hellwig P. MacMillan F. Meunier B. Hunte C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9042-9052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). QCR was purified via a single DEAE Biogel column as described elsewhere applying a flow rate of 2-5 ml/min (14Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients of 17.5 mm-1 cm-1 for ascorbate reduced minus ferricyanide oxidized c heme (553-540 nm) and 25.6 mm-1 cm-1 for dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized b hemes (562-575 nm) were used for quantification of QCR. Reconstitution of Purified QCR with Phospholipids and Determination of H+/e- Stoichiometry—Purified QCR was reconstituted in soy asolectin in a 1:10 molar ratio of protein to lipid. Detergent was removed by dialysis for 24 h against 100 mm KCl, 3 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2. The H+/e- stoichiometry of the QCR reconstituted into liposomes was determined by the oxidant pulse method as previously described (12Wenz T. Hellwig P. MacMillan F. Meunier B. Hunte C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9042-9052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Measurement of Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Activity—Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of purified QCR was assayed in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm KCN, 0.05% n-undecyl-β-d-maltoside, 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c at room temperature. The enzyme was diluted to 2.5-10 nm in assay buffer, and the reaction was started with 40 μm decylubiquinol (DQH). Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored at 550 versus 540 nm in dual wavelength mode, and the rate of cytochrome c reduction was calculated with an extinction coefficient of 21.5 mm-1 cm-1. Activity assays of reconstituted QCRs were carried out in 100 mm KCl, 3 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm KCN, 2 μg/ml valinomycin, 40 μm DQH, and 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c using 2.5-10 nm QCR. Turnover numbers are expressed as mol of cytochrome c reduced mol-1 QCR s-1 under steady-state condition. To determine the apparent Km for DQH, variable concentrations of DQH (50-500 nm) were used as substrate in the activity assay with reconstituted enzyme. The concentration of the DQH stock solution was spectroscopically determined at the start of the experiment. Apparent Km values were obtained by linear regression in an Eadie-Hofstee plot. To determine the sensitivity to inhibitors, QCR was reconstituted with phospholipids as described above and was mixed with variable concentrations of inhibitor yielding different inhibitor/QCR ratios. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before starting the activity assay. The concentration of the inhibitors was determined by their extinction coefficient (15von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Dilutions of the inhibitors were done just before the titrations. EPR Spectroscopy and Redox Titrations—20-40 μm purified QCR (50 mm KPi, pH 6.9, 250 mm NaCl, 0.05% n-undecyl-β-d-maltoside) was reduced by the addition of excess pyrophosphate-buffered sodium dithionite at 4 °C, and the samples were immediately transferred to EPR tubes (standard suprasil quartz, outer diameter 4 mm) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-Band (9.4-GHz) continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded as described previously (12Wenz T. Hellwig P. MacMillan F. Meunier B. Hunte C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9042-9052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Data simulation was performed using Win-Simfonia, and the measured g values were corrected for an offset against a known g standard (DPPH; with g = 2.00351 ± 0.00002). The redox titrations were performed as described before at pH 7.5 (12Wenz T. Hellwig P. MacMillan F. Meunier B. Hunte C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9042-9052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Typically, data were recorded at steps of 40 mV between -0.4 and 0.2 V under anaerobic conditions. The reference electrode was calibrated with the cyclovoltammogram of a buffered K4(Fe(CN)6) solution. All electrochemical titrations were reversible as controlled by comparing fully oxidized minus fully reduced visible spectra at different points of the experiments. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—Pre-steady-state reduction of QCRs was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using an OLIS rapid scanning monochromator. Reactions were started by mixing 2 μm bc1 complex in assay buffer containing either 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, plus 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20 against an equal volume of the same buffer containing 40 μm DQH. A fresh solution of DQH substrate was prepared before each experiment. A spectrum of oxidized QCR was obtained by mixing the oxidized QCR against assay buffer and averaging the data sets to a single scan. For each experiment, seven or eight data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set composed of wavelength, absorbance, and time, the time course and amplitude change for cytochrome b reduction at 563 nm or cytochrome c1 reduction at 553 nm was extracted using the OLIS software. For the experiment in which cytochrome c was added, reduction of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c was monitored at 551 nm. To obtain the maximum c1 absorbance value, the enzyme was reduced with ascorbate. To obtain the maximum bH absorbance, the enzyme was reduced with dithionite, and the absorbance change at 563 nm in the dithionite minus ascorbate-reduced difference spectrum was multiplied by 0.7, since the bH heme accounts for ∼70% of the total cytochrome b absorbance. To calculate the expected absorbance changes at 551 nm for reduction of cytochrome c or reduction of cytochrome c1 + cytochrome c, we used extinction coefficients of 20 mm-1 for cytochrome c and 13.7 mm-1 for cytochrome c1. The Ubiquinol Binding Pocket and the Location of Tyr132, Phe129, Glu272, and Tyr279 at Center P—Fig. 1 shows the crystal structure of the yeast ubiquinol oxidation pocket at center P with bound competitive inhibitors and the location of the cytochrome b residues that were mutated for this study. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor stigmatellin is hydrogenbonded to the side chain of Glu272 (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar).

Recent mutagenesis studies in yeast support its relevance for accurate enzyme-substrate complex formation, prevention of electron short circuit reactions, and pH dependence of ubiquinol oxidation (12Wenz T. Hellwig P. MacMillan F. Meunier B. Hunte C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9042-9052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The nearby residue Tyr132 is part of the binding pocket proximal to heme bL. It stabilizes via its hydroxyl group a water molecule of the suggested proton exit relay (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Earlier studies in bacterial QCR suggest that the equivalent Tyr147 is required for efficient electron transfer to heme bL (16Sarbias A.S. Ding H. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1992; 34: 16004-16012Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The side chain of Phe129 is in hydrophobic interaction with the tail of stigmatellin and probably with that of the substrate. This residue is a locus of center P inhibitor resistance both in yeast and bacterial QCR (17Geier B.M. Schagger H. Brandt U. Colson A.M. von Jagow G. Eur. J.

Mutational analysis of the equivalent residue in bacterial QCR (Phe144) indicated that replacement of Phe144 affects ubiquinol binding and oxidation (9Brasseur G. Saribas A.S. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The residue Tyr279 is close to the highly conserved PEWY (Pro271-Tyr274) motif, and it has been suggested to take part in positioning ubiquinol prior to oxidation and in stabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex by weak hydrogen bonds (6Palsdottir H.

Effect of Mutations on QCR Stability and Function—Growth of the mutant strains was monitored in nonfermentable medium to study a possible impact on cell respiration. The doubling time of Y132F was with 3.6 h only slightly increased compared with 3.2 h of the wild-type strain. Mutations in Tyr279 had a more severe effect on the respiratory growth. The Y279C strain had a doubling time of 6.4 h, and growth of Y279S (7.1 h) and Y279A (8.3 h) was even slower. Both Phe129 mutants did not grow on the nonfermentable media, marking F129K and F129R as lethal mutations with respect to respiration-dependent growth (Table 1). For purification of the variant QCRs, the two latter strains were grown in galactose medium, whereas all other QCRs were isolated from cells grown with a mixture of glycerol and ethanol.TABLE 1Properties of wild-type and mutant yeast strains and of the respective purified QCRsWild typeY132FY279AY279CY279SF129KF129RDoubling time on respiratory medium (h)3.2 ± 0.2aData from Wenz et al.

Open table in a new tab The effect of the mutations on QCR content was monitored by spectroscopic b heme quantification of mitochondrial membranes (Table 1). The Y132F mutant showed only a small decrease (∼13%) in QCR concentration. The mutations in Tyr279 resulted in a more pronounced decrease. The Y279C mutant contained 76% of the wild-type level, and the Y279A (68%) and the Y279S (64%) mutants were slightly more affected. For F129K and F129R, the QCR content was determined for cells grown in galactose. In this medium, cell growth is not limited by respiration, and thus the QCR content should not be affected by the respiratory capacity of the mutant. Nevertheless, the F129R mutant had a lower QCR content than the F129K mutant, which might indicate a reduced stability of the F129R variant. The variant enzymes were purified for further characterization. Y132F and the three variants of Y279 were purified by anion exchange chromatography without loss of activity or detectable loss of subunits as monitored with optical spectra and Western immunoblot analysis for the different purification steps (data not shown). For purification of F129R and F129K, the flow rate had to be lowered (0.6 ml/min) to prevent disintegration of the complex. We assume that the modified protein preparation retains more phospholipids, since the latter has been shown to increase complex integrity (6Palsdottir H. Lojero C.G. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31303-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of each QCR preparation were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The turnover numbers and Km values for DQH are given in Table 1. Y132F QCR exhibited about half as much cytochrome c reductase activity as compared with the wild-type enzyme. Y279C QCR retained ∼55% of the wild-type activity, whereas the alanine (18%) and serine substitutions (25%) in this position resulted in a marked decrease of the turnover number. F129K QCR exhibited an activity loss of ∼75% compared with wild-type QCR, whereas F129R QCR retained 84% of the turnover. When comparing turnover numbers of the Phe129 variants with the wild-type enzyme, one has to note that the former may be even overestimated due to presumably higher lipid content (see above). Nevertheless, the respiratory activity of the F129R mutant is apparently not sufficient to support respiratory growth despite the substantial catalytic activity of the isolated F129R QCR and the relatively small difference in QCR content compared with F129K. The properties of F129R QCR are discussed below. Effect of Mutations on Inhibitor Binding—The ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase activity of the purified QCR variants reconstituted in liposomes was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of stigmatellin and myxothiazol to test whether the mutations change the sensitivity of the enzymes to these inhibitors. Stigmatellin binds to the niche distal to heme bL and is proposed to mimic an intermediate of quinol oxidation (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 6Palsdottir H. Lojero C.G. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31303-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Myxothiazol binds proximal to heme bL (8Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 15von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Y132F QCR exhibits unchanged sensitivity to stigmatellin but is resistant to myxothiazol (Table 1). This agrees with results obtained for the equivalent mutation in bacterial QCR (9Brasseur G. Saribas A.S. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Each of the substitutions in position 279 altered the sensitivity for both inhibitors. The alanine replacement caused a ∼5-fold decrease in sensitivity to both inhibitors. Substitution with cysteine had a smaller effect on the sensitivity to myxothiazol, which was increased by a factor of 2.3, whereas the sensitivity to stigmatellin was increased ∼4-fold. Y279S lost sensitivity to both stigmatellin and myxothiazol (Table 1). This variant did not show any decrease in cytochrome c reductase activity upon the addition of up to a 2000-fold excess of the inhibitors (data not shown). The different extent of inhibitor resistance in the three Tyr279 mutants may either reflect variable structural rearrangements in the binding pocket or different direct interactions of the substituted residues with the inhibitor. The latter is likely for stigmatellin, since the x-ray structure of the yeast complex revealed a hydrophobic interaction of Tyr279 and the inhibitor head group (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic interaction is also present between the stigmatellin tail and Phe129 (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Clearly, replacement of the aromatic side chain in position 129 by a charged residue should interfere with its binding. F129K was resistant to both stigmatellin and myxothiazol. The sensitivity of F129R to stigmatellin was decreased by 3.5-fold, and sensitivity to myxothiazol was decreased by 6.7-fold. The observed difference between lysine and arginine substitution is likewise found for substrate binding. The Km for DQH was increased by ∼6-fold for F129K, whereas it was decreased by ∼2-fold for F129R, in line with the proposal that Phe129 stabilizes not only the hydrophobic inhibitor tail but interacts as well with the ubiquinol isoprenoid chain. Tyr132 is nearest to heme bL and not in contact with stigmatellin. Accordingly, the phenylalanine substitution does not affect stigmatellin sensitivity but results in resistance to the proximal niche inhibitor myxothiazol. None of the mutations caused changes in sensitivity to the center N inhibitor antimycin (data not shown). Superoxide Anion Production—Superoxide production is a bypass reaction of the bifurcated electron transfer at center P (24Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To analyze the influence of Phe129, Tyr132, and Tyr279 mutations on this process, superoxide anion formation of the QCR variants was assayed as the superoxide dismutase-sensitive rate of cytochrome c reduction (Fig. 2). The difference between the reaction rate in the absence and presence of superoxide dismutase yields the contribution of cytochrome c reduction by superoxide anion to the overall cytochrome c reductase activity.

This study explores rivalry suppression by probing visual sensitivity during rivalry with various probe stimuli. When two faces engage in rivalry, sensitivity to face probes is reduced 4-fold during suppression. Rivaling global motions also rivaled very deeply when probed with a global motion. However, in a surprising finding, sensitivity to face probes is completely unimpaired during global motion rivalry, and motion sensitivity is unimpaired during face rivalry. This suggests that rivalry suppression is localized to the neurons representing the image conflict, which means that probes of a different kind suffer no suppression. Sensibly, this would leave visual processes not involved in rivalry free to function normally. During binocular rivalry, conflicting monocular images undergo alternating suppression. This study explores rivalry suppression by probing visual sensitivity during rivalry with various probe stimuli. When two faces engage in rivalry, sensitivity to face probes is reduced 4-fold during suppression. Rivaling global motions also rivaled very deeply when probed with a global motion. However, in a surprising finding, sensitivity to face probes is completely unimpaired during global motion rivalry, and motion sensitivity is unimpaired during face rivalry. This suggests that rivalry suppression is localized to the neurons representing the image conflict, which means that probes of a different kind suffer no suppression. Sensibly, this would leave visual processes not involved in rivalry free to function normally. When two markedly dissimilar images are presented to each eye separately, an observer experiences alternations between one image and the other (Alais and Blake, 2005Alais D. Blake R. Binocular Rivalry. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2005Google Scholar). This perceptual alternation, known as binocular rivalry, is of great interest to visual neuroscientists because despite two distinct images entering the visual system, only one of them reaches conscious perception. What becomes of the suppressed image in the visual system, and where the decision to make one of the images conscious is made, are examples of two challenging questions that arise from the phenomenon of binocular rivalry. Two major theories of binocular rivalry have emerged, one proposing that rivalry is a low-level process, and the other proposing that it is a high-level process. According to the first theory, rivalry is an eye-based process, with the perceptual alternations experienced in binocular rivalry being due to a low-level process in which monocular visual channels engage in competition to determine which eye's input will determine perception (Blake, 1989Blake R. A neural theory of binocular rivalry.Psychol. Rev. 1989; 96: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). This theory is known as “eye rivalry,” and is presumed to occur by default when binocular correspondence between the monocular inputs cannot be established (Blake and Boothroyd, 1985Blake R. Boothroyd K. The precedence of binocular fusion over binocular rivalry.Percept. Psychophys. 1985; 37: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the second theory (“stimulus rivalry”), competition occurs at a higher level between stimulus representations so that it is the percepts of the rivaling stimuli that vie for conscious expression (Logothetis, 1998Logothetis N.K. Single units and conscious vision.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 1801-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Logothetis et al., 1996Logothetis N.K. Leopold D.A. Sheinberg D.L. What is rivalling during binocular rivalry?.Nature. 1996; 380: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Both theories of rivalry can claim to draw on considerable experimental support, and the emerging consensus is that rather than being mutually exclusive, both theories can coexist. Eye rivalry is supported by functional imaging studies showing clear evidence for rivalry in V1 (Polonsky et al., 2000Polonsky A. Blake R. Braun J. Heeger D.J. Neuronal activity in human primary visual cortex correlates with perception during binocular rivalry.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), even in the representation of the blind spot in V1, where input is exclusively monocular (Tong and Engel, 2001Tong F. Engel S.A. Interocular rivalry revealed in the human cortical blind-spot representation.Nature. 2001; 411: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Very recent neuroimaging work in the lateral geniculate nucleus, a structure prior to V1 where only monocular neurons are found, shows that neural activity during rivalry modulates with alternations in perceptual dominance (Haynes et al., 2005Haynes J.D. Deichmann R. Rees G. Eye-specific effects of binocular rivalry in the human lateral geniculate nucleus.Nature. 2005; 438: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, Wunderlich et al., 2005Wunderlich K. Schneider K.A. Kastner S. Neural correlates of binocular rivalry in the human lateral geniculate nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Psychophysical support for the low-level theory comes from a host of studies showing that rivalry suppression is not specific to the features engaged in rivalry, but acts indiscriminately on all features presented to the nondominant eye, as if the entire eye's input were suppressed (Blake and Fox, 1974Blake R. Fox R. Binocular rivalry suppression: insensitive to spatial frequency and orientation change.Vision Res. 1974; 14: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Blake et al., 1980Blake R. Westendorf D.H. Overton R. What is suppressed during binocular rivalry?.Perception. 1980; 9: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Wales and Fox, 1970Wales R. Fox R. Increment detection thresholds during binocular rivalry suppression.Percept. Psychophys. 1970; 8: 90-94Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Support for stimulus rivalry comes from a critical psychophysical experiment which swapped two flickering orthogonal gratings rapidly between the eyes (Logothetis et al., 1996Logothetis N.K. Leopold D.A. Sheinberg D.L. What is rivalling during binocular rivalry?.Nature. 1996; 380: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Because the eye-swapping rate was several times faster than typical perceptual alternations in rivalry, the eye rivalry theory clearly predicted that several orientation flips should have been visible while a given eye's view was dominant. However, Logothetis et al.'s data showed that stable percepts of one grating lasting several swap cycles were sometimes observed, despite the grating switching between the eyes. Reports that Gestalt-like organization principles can provoke interocular grouping (Alais et al., 2000Alais D. O'Shea R.P. Mesana-Alais C. Wilson I.G. On binocular alternation.Perception. 2000; 29: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Kovacs et al., 1996Kovacs I. Papathomas T.V. Yang M. Feher A. When the brain changes its mind: interocular grouping during binocular rivalry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 15508-15511Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) also imply a binocular locus for rivalry and therefore seem to be consistent with the stimulus rivalry theory. Functional imaging studies also provide support for stimulus rivalry by demonstrating rivalry in fully binocular cortical areas representing houses and faces (Tong et al., 1998Tong F. Nakayama K. Vaughan J.T. Kanwisher N. Binocular rivalry and visual awareness in human extrastriate cortex.Neuron. 1998; 21: 753-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions are not above dispute. It has recently been shown, for example, that the method of “flicker and swap” rivalry lacks the generality of traditional binocular rivalry, holding only for a limited parameter range (Lee and Blake, 1999Lee S.H. Blake R. Rival ideas about binocular rivalry.Vision Res. 1999; 39: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, when it does hold, there are periods corresponding to traditional eye rivalry as well as periods of stimulus rivalry. Thus, it appears that both kinds of rivalry can and do occur, so that eye and stimulus rivalry are not mutually exclusive, but instead represent different kinds of rivalry. The conclusions to be drawn from the studies showing interocular grouping during rivalry also need to be reconsidered since it has been demonstrated that low-level lateral interactions, perhaps in concert with feedback from higher levels selective for coherent objects, can bring about periods of figural completion in rivalry (Lee and Blake, 2004Lee S.H. Blake R. A fresh look at interocular grouping during binocular rivalry.Vision Res. 2004; 44: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This casts doubt over whether figural completion necessarily implies interocular grouping, and instead suggests that figural completion may be explicable in eye-based terms. One of the distinguishing features of the stimulus rivalry theory is that rivalry occurs between the representations of the objects or features engaged in rivalry. Consequently, stimulus rivalry implies a more localized rivalry process, focused on the conflicting stimulus features, than the eye rivalry theory, which posits a broad-based and nonselective suppression of the nondominant eye. In stimulus rivalry, rivalry should be local to the network representing the conflicting stimuli. This leads to the prediction that representations of other stimuli or features not engaged in rivalry should remain unaffected by the rivalry process. In these experiments, we test this prediction by inducing rivalry between a pair of global motion stimuli or a pair of face stimuli (see Figure 1), and probing for sensitivity to either the same stimulus or the complementary stimulus. In the complementary conditions, face probes will be presented during motion rivalry, and motion probes during face rivalry. Face and global motion stimuli were chosen to exploit one of the major processing divisions in visual cortex, the parallel pathways of the color/form and motion streams (DeYoe and Van Essen, 1988DeYoe E.A. Van Essen D.C. Concurrent processing streams in monkey visual cortex.Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, Livingstone and Hubel, 1988Livingstone M. Hubel D. Segregation of form, color, movement, and depth: anatomy, physiology, and perception.Science. 1988; 240: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Processing of face stimuli is known to depend critically on a specialized extrastriate area in the form pathway called the fusiform face area (FFA; Grill-Spector et al., 2004Grill-Spector K. Knouf N. Kanwisher N. The fusiform face area subserves face perception, not generic within-category identification.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, Kanwisher et al., 1997Kanwisher N. McDermott J. Chun M.M. The fusiform face area: a module in human extrastriate cortex specialized for face perception.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The motion stimuli were random dot kinematograms undergoing global expansions or contractions. These types of global motion signals are not detected prior to the extrastriate medial superior temporal (MST) area in the motion pathway (Graziano et al., 1994Graziano M.S. Andersen R.A. Snowden R.J. Tuning of MST neurons to spiral motions.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 54-67PubMed Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 1989Tanaka K. Fukada Y. Saito H.A. Underlying mechanisms of the response specificity of expansion/contraction and rotation cells in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area of the macaque monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 62: 642-656PubMed Google Scholar) and were composed of limited lifetime dots so as to avoid form cues. Note that while these two kinds of stimuli will no doubt activate larger processing networks (with at least area V1 in common), they do depend critically on specialized cortical areas which reside in distinct processing pathways. Using these rival stimuli (i.e., rivaling faces) with a complementary probe (i.e., global motion), we should be able to determine whether rivalry is localized to the network processing faces or whether the whole eye's processing is attenuated during rivalry suppression (which would also compromise detection of the motion probe). If binocular rivalry is indeed localized to the network of neurons and areas representing the conflicting stimuli, visual processing of other stimuli should not be impeded, provided they are represented by independent neural populations. Several findings hint that this may indeed be the case. For example, global motion requiring integration of motion components between the two eyes can still be perceived even though the differently colored components engage in color rivalry (Carney et al., 1987Carney T. Shadlen M. Switkes E. Parallel processing of motion and colour information.Nature. 1987; 328: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has also been found that motion signals (and temporal modulations) from a suppressed eye can still interact with those from the dominant eye to produce a dichoptic global motion (or temporal beat) percept (Andrews and Blakemore, 1999Andrews T.J. Blakemore C. Form and motion have independent access to consciousness.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 405-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Carlson and He, 2000Carlson T.A. He S. Visible binocular beats from invisible monocular stimuli during binocular rivalry.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Earlier papers report related findings—that a figure can rival independently of its background (Creed, 1935Creed R.S. Observations on binocular fusion and rivalry.J. Physiol. 1935; 84: 381-392PubMed Google Scholar)—and that stereopsis, which requires integration between the eyes, can still occur despite rivalry between the differently colored disparate contours (Treisman, 1962Treisman A. Binocular rivalry and stereoscopic depth perception.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 1962; 14: 23-37Crossref Google Scholar). To test whether processing of other (i.e., nonrivaling) stimuli is impaired or not, we will use the probe method (Blake and Camisa, 1979Blake R. Camisa J. On the inhibitory nature of binocular rivalry suppression.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1979; 5: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Blake and Fox, 1974Blake R. Fox R. Binocular rivalry suppression: insensitive to spatial frequency and orientation change.Vision Res. 1974; 14: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Fox and Check, 1972Fox R. Check R. Independence between binocular rivalry suppression duration and magnitude of suppression.J. Exp. Psychol. 1972; 93: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Wales and Fox, 1970Wales R. Fox R. Increment detection thresholds during binocular rivalry suppression.Percept. Psychophys. 1970; 8: 90-94Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This technique measures the depth of rivalry suppression by comparing sensitivities to brief probe stimuli presented during dominance and suppression. Generally, for simple stimuli such as gratings and contours, probe sensitivity is reduced during suppression to about 60% of the level measured during dominance (Makous and Sanders, 1978Makous W. Sanders R.K. Suppression interactions between fused patterns.in: Armington A.C. Krauskopf J. Wooten B.R. Visual Psychophysics and Physiology. Academic Press, New York1978Google Scholar, Nguyen et al., 2003Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Alais D. Increasing depth of binocular rivalry suppression along two visual pathways.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2003-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although for higher-level stimuli such as global motions and complex forms sensitivity is reduced to about 25% of the dominance level (Nguyen et al., 2003Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Alais D. Increasing depth of binocular rivalry suppression along two visual pathways.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2003-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, one prediction is that the rivaling faces and rivaling global motions used in the present experiments, whose processing networks include specialized extrastriate areas, should produce deep rivalry suppression. The more important prediction, however, is that suppression depth should depend critically on whether the probe stimulus activates the rivaling neurons. Specifically, if two faces are engaged in rivalry, sensitivity to a global motion probe should remain unaffected by whether the probed eye happens to be dominant or suppressed (i.e., there should be zero suppression depth). Similarly, if two global motions are engaged in rivalry, sensitivity to a face probe should remain the same during dominance and suppression. The reason in both cases is that rivalry should be localized to the neurons representing the rivaling stimuli, leaving the probe stimulus to be detected by a population not involved in binocular rivalry, as in normal viewing. Conversely, if the probe is a face stimulus and the rivaling stimuli are also faces, then probe sensitivity should be greatly reduced if it is presented during suppression, and similarly for a motion probe presented during motion rivalry. These predictions are tested below. Figure 2A illustrates the rival stimuli and probes for the four conditions. Note that subjects triggered the probe presentation themselves when (depending on the condition) the eye to be probed was completely dominant or completely suppressed (see Experimental Procedures). The design was a 2 × 2 factorial combining rivalry type (rivaling faces versus rivaling motions) and probe type (motion probe versus face probe). Thresholds for detection of the motion probes during rivalry are presented in the left-hand panel of Figure 2B, and those for face probes are shown in the right-hand panel. For the motion probes (Figure 2B, left) thresholds were defined as the level of motion coherence required to judge whether the probe stimulus rotated clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW). For the first pair of columns in Figure 2B, both the probe (CW or CCW rotation) and the rival stimuli (expansion versus contraction) were global motions (“motion/motion” condition). Thresholds for the monocular motion probe (plotted here as the average of six observers) were higher when it was triggered during suppression (dark column) than when it was triggered during dominance (light column). Reduced sensitivity for probes presented to the suppressed eye is typical in studies using the probe technique, and this is generally interpreted in terms of eye rivalry: if the probed eye is subject to suppression, then detection thresholds must be higher in that eye. Here, thresholds for discriminating direction of rotation are roughly three to four times greater in suppression than in dominance, in agreement with an earlier probe study that used spiral motion as a global motion probe (Nguyen et al., 2003Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Alais D. Increasing depth of binocular rivalry suppression along two visual pathways.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2003-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The second pair of columns in the left panel of Figure 2B shows the threshold for the same motion probe presented when the rival stimuli were faces (“face/motion” condition). Regardless of whether the probe was presented during dominance (light columns) or suppression (dark columns), sensitivity to the motion probe was equally as good, and motion probe sensitivity in both cases was equivalent to that obtained during dominance in the motion/motion condition. Thus, even though the observer experiences a subjective blindness in the eye receiving the suppressed face, sensitivity to the global motion probe was not affected. A similar pattern of results was found for face probe thresholds (Figure 2B, right). The face probes were monocular faces that were morphed (using a cross-fade technique: see Figure 1A and Experimental Procedures) with the rivaling face present in the probed eye. The observer's task was to make a binary choice: whether the probe face was one drawn from a previously learned set or whether it was a composite face (made of upper and lower halves of different faces in the previously learned set). The extent of the cross-fade—in effect, the contrast of the probe relative to the contrast of the rival faces—was varied from trial to trial (Figure 1A) using an adaptive staircase procedure to find the level of probe contrast required for observers to recognize whether or the probe face was one drawn from a previously learned set or was a composite. The first pair of columns in the right panel of Figure 2B shows thresholds obtained when both the probe and the rivaling stimuli were faces (“face/face” condition). Thresholds were higher when the probe was triggered during suppression (dark columns) than when triggered during dominance (light columns). As in the motion/motion condition, suppression thresholds were about 4-fold higher than dominance thresholds, a ratio that agrees with other recent studies of sensitivities to high-level form probes (Nguyen et al., 2003Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Alais D. Increasing depth of binocular rivalry suppression along two visual pathways.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2003-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, face probe measurements obtained when the rival stimuli were motions (“motion/face” condition) show that thresholds during suppression (dark columns) were not any higher than those measured during dominance (light columns). Thus, as was observed when the rival stimuli were motions, there is no loss of probe sensitivity in the apparently suppressed eye provided the probe and rival stimuli differ in kind. (An interesting side issue that may occur to some readers is that detecting the face probe against a face background was no harder than detecting the face probe against a motion background [dominance thresholds in each condition are very similar]. We explored this apparent lack of face masking in a supplementary experiment and conclude that it is due to the lag in switching from motion to face processing in the motion/face condition within a brief probe period of 140 ms [see Supplemental Data].) To quantify the depth of suppression, probe thresholds are usually expressed as a ratio. Figure 2C shows the ratio of dominance-to-suppression thresholds (left axis) and the corresponding amount of suppression depth (right axis). A ratio of 1.0 would indicate no suppression depth, although typical ratios would be around 0.6 to 0.7 (i.e., 30%–40% suppression depth) for probe studies using low-level stimuli such as gratings (Makous and Sanders, 1978Makous W. Sanders R.K. Suppression interactions between fused patterns.in: Armington A.C. Krauskopf J. Wooten B.R. Visual Psychophysics and Physiology. Academic Press, New York1978Google Scholar, Nguyen et al., 2001Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Wenderoth P. The depth and selectivity of suppression in binocular rivalry.Percept. Psychophys. 2001; 63: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In line with a recent study (Nguyen et al., 2003Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Alais D. Increasing depth of binocular rivalry suppression along two visual pathways.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2003-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showing that suppression depth is far deeper for complex stimuli, dominance-to-suppression ratios are low at about 0.25 for the face/face and motion/motion conditions, corresponding to 75% suppression depth. Remarkably, however, here we find that when the probe stimulus was of a different kind from the rivaling stimuli, there was no loss of sensitivity at all during suppression; the dominance-to-suppression threshold ratios were close to 1.0 for all observers, indicating a complete absence of suppression. Results from a two-way ANOVA on the dominance-to-suppression ratios show no main effect of rivalry type (F1,5 = 0.334; p = 0.589) or of probe type (F1,5 = 0.223; p = 0.657), but a very strong interaction (F1,5 = 437.611; p < 0.0001). This confirms what is clear from the graph: the suppression of a probe depends upon the kind of rivaling stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that rivalry suppression is limited to the cortical area representing the conflicting stimuli and does not entail wholesale suppression of one or the other eye. The data in Figure 2 show that face recognition and global motion processing do not interact during binocular rivalry, as probes differing in kind from the rival stimuli show no reduction in sensitivity. Consistent with this, it is known that critical cortical areas in the neural networks underlying face recognition and global motion are located in separate visual processing pathways (Graziano et al., 1994Graziano M.S. Andersen R.A. Snowden R.J. Tuning of MST neurons to spiral motions.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 54-67PubMed Google Scholar, Grill-Spector et al., 2004Grill-Spector K. Knouf N. Kanwisher N.

Neurophysiol. 1989; 62: 642-656PubMed Google Scholar). However, the independence of motion sensitivity during face rivalry (and face sensitivity during motion rivalry) prompts the question of whether faces and global motion could ever engage in rivalry. To test this, we produced a mixed pair of rival stimuli combining both kinds of stimuli: a face presented to one eye and a global expansion or contraction to the other. We found that cross-pairing the stimuli did indeed produce binocular rivalry, and we proceeded to measure rivalry suppression depth for the cross-paired stimuli by probing for sensitivity to face and motion probes. For motion probes and face probes (see Figure 3B), thresholds during dominance were lower than those measured during suppression, but by much less than was observed in Figure 2B for face/face and motion/motion pairs. The threshold values were roughly equivalent whether the face was presented to the left eye and motion to the right (with right eye probed, as shown in Figure 3A) or whether the right eye was probed with the rival stimuli reversed (motion left eye, face right eye), and Figure 3B shows the means of these counterbalanced orders. As shown in Figure 3C, the dominance-to-suppression ratios for these two cross-paired conditions were very similar at 66% and 69%, respectively. This corresponds to a rather shallow suppression, although it is similar in magnitude to values obtained in probe studies using low-level stimuli such as gratings (Makous and Sanders, 1978Makous W. Sanders R.K. Suppression interactions between fused patterns.in: Armington A.C. Krauskopf J. Wooten B.R. Visual Psychophysics and Physiology. Academic Press, New York1978Google Scholar, Nguyen et al., 2001Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Wenderoth P. The depth and selectivity of suppression in binocular rivalry.Percept. Psychophys. 2001; 63: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Nguyen et al., 2003Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Alais D. Increasing depth of binocular rivalry suppression along two visual pathways.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2003-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the amount of suppression depth is indicative of how far along the visual pathways the rivalry process occurs since suppression deepens for more complex global stimuli (Nguyen et al., 2003Nguyen V.A. Freeman A.W. Alais D. Increasing depth of binocular rivalry suppression along two visual pathways.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2003-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For this reason, it appears that rivalry between the cross-paired stimuli occurs at a lower level than rivalry between motion/motion or face/face pairs, possibly because the motion and form processing pathways are divergent at stages beyond V1 (Livingstone and Hubel, 1988Livingstone M. Hubel D. Segregation of form, color, movement, and depth: anatomy, physiology, and perception.Science. 1988; 240: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). In this view, deep suppression would require two stimuli that are complex and of the same kind (such as two global motions or two faces) so that they would be processed within the same pathway. To test the generality of this suggestion, we measured suppression depth for rivalry between a face and a house. Both of these stimuli are detected beyond V1 in the ventral object-processing pathway and would therefore be expected to rival quite deeply. The first pair of columns in the right-hand panel of Figure 3B shows detection thresholds for face probes during “face/house” rivalry, with the dominance-to-suppression ratio shown in Figure 3C. While the ratio in the face/house condition (averaging 56%) was lower than those for the two cross-paired conditions (66% and 69%), it was not significantly lower than either (Bonferroni-corrected t tests; for both tests, p > 0.05) and was not nearly as low as was observed for motion/motion or face/face rivalry in Experiment 1 (35% and 33%, respectively). As discussed below in the Conclusions subsection, this may be due to a lack of coordinated feedback in the face/house condition. We ran a control condition to check that the deep suppression reported for the face/face condition was not due to the fact that the face stimuli were tinted red and green. We simply rivaled uniform red and green patches and measured suppression with a monochrome green (or red) face probe that was cross-faded onto the green (or red) color patch. Sensitivity to the face probe did not depend on whether red or green probes were used, and the mean of both counterbalanced orders are shown (second pair of columns in the right panel of Figure 3B). Importantly, probe sensitivities were equivalent whether tested during dominance or suppression, showing that the deep suppression in our original face/face condition was not due to any extra suppressive effects due to rivalry between the colors of the faces, since face sensitivity was unaffected by the state of color rivalry. Indeed, following a one-way ANOVA comparing the four conditions in Figure 3, Bonferroni-corrected t tests showed that the only statistical differences between any of the groups are that the color-tinted condition is significantly different from the other three groups (for all three tests, p < .001). It is also noteworthy that subjects never observed independent rivalry between the colors and the faces in the original face/face condition—each color remained bound to its corresponding face. Finally, to complement the suppression depth data for the various conditions described above, we measured a rivalry coherence index, a measure that quantifies the extent to which rivaling alternations tend to occur in a globally coherent way or in a piecemeal manner. Rival stimuli that tend to alternate exclusively (either the left-eye or right-eye stimulus is seen in its entirety) have a high rivalry coherence index. Piecemeal rivalry (low coherence index) is one of the hallmarks of low-level rivalry and is thought to be due to the small size of early receptive fields (Blake et al., 1992Blake R. O'Shea R.P. Mueller T.J. Spatial zones of binocular rivalry in central and peripheral vision.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 8: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, higher-level stimuli such as faces, cars, and houses tend to rival coherently (even when up to 12 degrees in diameter; Alais and Melcher, 2006Alais D. Melcher D. The strength and coherence of binocular rivalry depends on shared stimulus complexity.Vision Res. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar), reflecting the larger receptive field sizes in the cortical areas representing these objects. Figure 4 plots rivalry coherence (percentage of exclusive dominance over a 200 s viewing period averaged over four observers) for all of the rivalry conditions tested above. It can be seen that despite the large size of the stimuli (7.5° × 5°), rivalry tended to be very coherent for the conditions that paired complex stimuli of the same kind (face/face, motion/motion). Rivalry coherence was lowest for the mixed face/motion pair, being significantly lower than the average of the face/face and motion/motion conditions (t9 = 7.6; p < 0.001), and also lower than the house/face condition (t9 = 5.3; p < 0.001). The aim of these experiments was to test whether rivalry suppression is a local process involving the neurons representing the conflicting images, or whether it is a large-scale process entailing alternating suppression of a whole eye. The main conclusion to be drawn is that rivalry appears to involve processes localized to the neurons representing the stimulus inputs, since rivalry suppression reduced probe sensitivity only when the probe was of the same kind as the rivaling stimuli. When the probe differed in kind from the two rivaling stimuli, probe discrimination was completely unhindered by rivalry suppression. During face rivalry, for example, sensitivity to motion probes was unaffected whether the motion probe was presented to the dominant eye or to the suppressed one. Conversely, during motion rivalry, sensitivity to a face stimulus was independent of whether the probed eye was dominant or suppressed. Thus, while an observer's subjective experience is of being temporarily blinded in their suppressed eye (in that they can no longer perceive the rival stimulus in that eye), their vision is in fact completely unimpaired for stimuli which differ in kind from those engaged in rivalry. Rivalry, therefore, appears to be restricted to the neural populations dedicated to representing the particular rival stimuli, with neurons processing features or attributes not related to the rival stimuli continuing to function normally."

Although it is evident that senescence can be imposed through multiple mechanisms, restoration of nuclear ERK activity can bypass a critical senescence checkpoint and, thus, extend replicative lifespan. Somatic cells in culture can attain only a limited number of divisions in contrast to most cancer cells that can divide indefinitely. This limited replicative capacity, termed replicative senescence (1Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 2Hayflick L. Finch C.E. Hayflick L. Handbook of the Biology of Aging. van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1977: 159-186Google Scholar), has been used extensively as a model in elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying organismic aging, as well as mechanisms that regulate normal cell growth. Consequently, the phenotype of senescent cells, characterized by enlarged and flattened morphology, increased sensitivity to contact inhibition and loss of responsiveness to mitogens, is well described although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenotype are not yet fully elucidated (reviewed in Refs. 3Cristofalo V.J.

The difference in proliferation potential between senescent and cancer cells has led some investigators to suggest that senescence is a cancer protection mechanism. Furthermore, it has been proposed that proteins that control cell cycle progression and that are inactivated in tumor cells, such as the restriction-point proteins Rb and p53 and various cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitors (CDIs) 2The abbreviations used are: CDI, cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PD, population doubling(s); SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; wt, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; NLS, nuclear localization signal; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: CDI, cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PD, population doubling(s); SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; wt, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; NLS, nuclear localization signal; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. play a role in the establishment of senescence (reviewed in Refs. 5Thomas D.M.

Although this view merits substantial experimental support, it is still unclear whether these are primary causes or, alternatively, if these proteins are activated in response to changes incompatible with normal cell growth that precede p53 and Rb activation. Studies on the cell cycle kinetics of senescent cells have shown that, although they display some characteristics of late G1-arrest, they are actually arrested in a distinct state. Early G1 events, such as proper activation of the ERK signal transduction pathway and expression of the immediate-early genes c-fos, erg-1, Id-1H, and Id-2H do not occur in senescent cells (3Cristofalo V.J. Tresini M. Volker C. Francis M.K. Yu B.P. Methods in Aging Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1998: 77-114Crossref Google Scholar, 4Cristofalo V.J. Lorenzini A. Allen R.G. Torres C. Tresini M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2004; 125: 827-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that signaling defects in early G1 result in phenotypic alteration of sufficient magnitude to block S phase progression.The ERK pathway is a key signaling module that controls critical cell functions such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (9Cross T.G.

Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar). Central to this pathway, the ERK proteins are sites where diverse signals converge to elicit distinct biological responses via activation of the impressive spectrum of ERK effectors which modulate the rate of protein and pyrimidine-nucleotide biosynthesis, activate transcription and translation, regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration, and promote cell cycle progression (10Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr.

The wide range of signals that activate ERKs, their numerous substrates and their crucial role in determining antagonistic cell fates, suggest that precise spatiotemporal regulation of ERK activity is critical for cellular homeostasis. Loss of ERK regulation occurs in many pathological conditions, including age associated pathologies (e.g. cardiovascular disease (14Lips D.J. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Purcell N.H. Kaiser R.A.

Interestingly, in contrast to carcinogenesis during which up-regulation of the ERK pathway has been linked to all stages of progression, from initial tumor growth to tumor vascularization and metastasis, aged tissues and in vitro senescent cells show impaired ERK signaling.

Precise control of the amplitude and duration of nuclear ERK signaling is fundamental for cell homeostasis and is achieved by the coordinated action of numerous proteins that participate in import, export, and ERK cytoplasmic and nuclear anchoring (11Pearson G.

An additional degree of precision is attained by the subfamily of nuclear Dual Specificity MAP Kinases Phosphatases (DS-MKPs/DUSPs), a prominent member of which is MKP2/DUSP4 (44Misra-Press A.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3433-3443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).MKP2 exhibits high specificity toward ERK, is ubiquitously expressed, and, because of the tight ERK-mediated regulation of its levels and activity, is thought to play a critical role in the negative feedback control of nuclear ERK signaling (reviewed in Refs. 19Kohno M. Pouyssegur J. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 219-224PubMed Google Scholar and 48Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The accuracy of this autoregulatory mechanism is ensured by the multiple levels of MKP2 regulation by ERKs; mitogen-induced transcription of the immediate early response mkp2 gene depends on ERK pathway activation (49Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and docking interactions between the two proteins, achieved through the MKP2 docking (D) domain and the ERK2 docking groove (DG), result in catalytic activation of MKP2 (50Tanoue T.

Two acidic residues in the DG of ERK (Asp-316 and Asp-319) establish critical electrostatic interactions with the positively charged residues of the D domain of MKP2 and are critical for docking. Substitution of Asn for Asp at position 319 disrupts MKP2-ERK2 binding and results in a hyperactive ERK2 allele (ERK2(D319N)) analogous to Drosophila melanogaster Sevenmaker (rlsem) gain-of-function mutant (54Brunner D.

Thus, disruption of MKP2 docking to ERK2 disrupts both its catalytic activation and its inactivating capacity toward ERK.Despite the significant advances in elucidating the mechanism of ERK2-MKP2 feedback regulation (48Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), the precise role of MKP2 in vivo is still poorely understood. There is some evidence that MKP2 dysregulation is involved with cancer progression in humans. Chromosomal abnormalities that result in loss of the MKP2 locus (8p12-p11) and protein, in primary malignant breast carcinomas and breast cancer lines, indicate that MKP2 may play a tumor suppression role (57Venter D.J.

Human fibroblasts that reach terminal proliferative arrest have abnormally high MKP2 protein levels and activity (58Torres C. Francis M.K. Lorenzini A. Tresini M. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and reduced nuclear ERK activity (21Tresini M. Lorenzini A. Frisoni L. Allen R.G. Cristofalo V.J. Exp.

Thus in this physiological setting high MKP2 levels may be implicated with the loss of proliferative capacity of senescent fibroblasts.In the present study we examined the physiological role of MKP2 in ERK signaling and how subtle changes in nuclear ERK2 activity affect proliferation and longevity of diploid human fibroblasts. We provide evidence that nuclear targeting of the ERK2 phosphatase resistant mutant D319N restores nuclear ERK2 activity in senescent cells and significantly extends replicative lifespan. Significant lifespan extension was also achieved using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock-down MKP2 expression. In contrast, ectopic expression of MKP2 in early passage cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation and a significant decrease in replicative lifespan. Although cultures with extended lifespan ultimately senesce, some of the molecular characteristics of the senescent phenotype are reversed; the cells retain the ability to express c-fos, and Rb is maintained in its inactive phosphorylated state. Our data provide evidence that replicative senescence is established, in part, through loss of nuclear ERK activity and support the hypothesis that defects in nuclear ERK signaling precede and impose other growth inhibitory changes in senescent cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise.

The anti-phospho ERK1/2 antibody was purchased from Sigma (MAPK-TY) and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA).Cell Culture, Transfections, and Infections—Stock cultures of human diploid WI-38 lung and AG07493 dermal fibroblasts were grown in Autopow minimum essential medium supplemented with basal medium Eagle's vitamins, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were subcultivated to senescence according to our standard procedure (3Cristofalo V.J. Tresini M. Volker C. Francis M.K. Yu B.P. Methods in Aging Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1998: 77-114Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, following trypsinization, cell numbers and size distributions were estimated using a Beckman Z2 coulter particle count and size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA), and 1 × 104 cells were seeded per cm2 of growth surface area. At each subcultivation, the increase in population doubling (ΔPD) was calculated using the formula ΔPD = Log10 (number of cells harvested/number of cells seeded]/log102; the obtained number was added to the previous PD to obtained the cumulative PD). Cultures were considered to be at the end of their replicative lifespan, when unable to complete one PD during a four-week period that included three consecutive weeks of re-feeding. The amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix A was subcultivated using identical growth conditions as for WI-38 cells. For retrovirus production, Phoenix A cells were transfected with the various retroviral expression vectors using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection, filtered through 0.45-μm low protein-binding filters (Millipore Corp., Billerica MA) and used immediately to infect early passage WI-38 cultures in the presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene. Infected cells were selected with the appropriate antibiotic at experimentally determined concentrations that were as follows: 1 μg/ml puromycin, 75 μg/ml hygromycin, and 150 μg/ml G418. Selected cultures were subcultivated to senescence in antibiotic containing media to maintain selective pressure. For stimulation experiments subconfluent cultures were serum-deprived for 3 days in MCDB-104 medium (Invitrogen Corp.) to ensure G0 arrest and were subsequently stimulated for various time periods with FBS to a final concentration of 10% v/v to achieve maximal mitogenic stimulation. For senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assays (59Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5609) Google Scholar), cells seeded at 1-2 × 104/cm2 were grown for 24 h and fixed in 2% (v/v) formaldehyde, 0.2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Activity assays were performed overnight at 37 °C in freshly prepared solution containing 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5mm K4Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm citric acid/phosphate buffer, and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell viability in response to apoptotic stimuli was measured by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions using a Bio-Rad ELISA reader. [3H]Thymidine incorporation as a measure of cell proliferation potential was performed as described previously (60Cristofalo V.J. Gerontology. 1976; 22: 9-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Cloning of Expression Plasmids—The oligonucleotide primers 5′-cccaagcttgccaccatggcggcggcggcggcg-3′ and 5′-ccatcgatttaagatctgtatcctggctggaatctagcagtctc-3′, which contain a HindIII and a ClaI recognition sequence respectively, were used to PCR-amplify from pSRa-based plasmids, full-length wt ERK2, or ERK2(D319N), which were then subcloned between the HindIII and ClaI sites of the pLNCX retroviral expression vector. To generate FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope-tagged ERKs, we used a reverse primer that in addition to the 3′ sequence of ERK2 contained an AgeI restriction site followed by the FLAG sequence inserted just prior to the termination codon. The AgeI site was introduced to facilitate transfer and exchange of tags and fluorescent protein sequences. Thus, to generate ERK2:GFP the FLAG sequence was excised using AgeI and ClaI and replaced with PCR amplified full-length eGFP (minus the initiation codon). eGFP is a red-shifted variant of wt GFP optimized for higher fluorescence and expression in mammalian cells (Clontech Inc.). The pair of oligonucleotide primers 5′-cccaagcttgccaccatggtgacgatggaggaactgcgg-3′ and 5′-cccaccggtacagctgggggaggtggtgatgg-3′, was used to PCR-amplify full-length human MKP2 from a pSRa based plasmid, which was then subcloned into HindIII and AgeI sites of the pLNCX:FLAG and pLNCX:GFP expression plasmids to generate MKP2:FLAG and MKP2:GFP. wt ERK2, ERK2:FLAG, ERK2:GFP, MKP2:FLAG, and MKP2:GFP were also subcloned into pLPCX (puromycin-resistant) and pLHCX (hygromycinresistant) retroviral expression vectors between the HindIII and ClaI restriction sites in their multiple cloning regions. To generate wt ERK2:nuclear localization signal (NLS) and ERK2(D319N):NLS a nucleotide sequence that encodes the nuclear localization signal of the SV-40 T antigen (PKKKRKV) (61Kalderon D.

Cell. 1986; 46: 575-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was inserted at the 3′-end of ERK2 adjacent to the AgeI site. All PCR amplifications were performed on a MJ Scientific, Inc., PTC-100 Thermocycler using hot-start Taq polymerase. Amplified DNAs were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit, and following restriction digestion of the inserts and vectors, shrimp alkaline phosphatase treatment of the vectors, and agarose gel electrophoresis, the gel-excised DNAs were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. DNA concentrations were calculated by spectrophotometry, and inserts were ligated into vectors at a 3:1 molar ratio. Qiagen-purified plamid DNAs were analyzed by restriction digestion and/or sequencing and were transfected into 293 cells using FuGENE 6 to confirm construct expression by immunoblotting.Sample Preparation and Immunoblotting—For sample preparation, cells were lysed by brief sonication (2-4 s) in nondenaturing buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin,"

Six Cav2.3 isoforms resulting from different combinations of three inserts (inserts I and II in the II–III loop and insert III in the carboxyl-terminal region) have been identified in different mammalian tissues. To date, however, Cav2.3 isoforms unique to primary sensory neurons have not been identified. In this study, we determined Cav2.3 isoforms expressed in the rat trigeminal ganglion neurons. Whole tissue reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses revealed that only two isoforms, Cav2.3a and Cav2.3e, are present in TG neurons. Using single cell RT-PCR, we found that Cav2.3e is the major isoform, whereas Cav2.3e expression is highly restricted to small (<16 μm) isolectin B4-negative and tyrosine kinase A-positive neurons. Cav2.3e was also preferentially detected in neurons expressing the nociceptive marker, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. Single cell RT-PCR following calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamp recordings provided evidence of an association between an R-type calcium channel component and Cav2.3e expression.

Calcium plays a key role in cellular processes under these conditions, and the major routes for calcium entry into the cell are the voltage-activated calcium channels (VACCs) (3.Vanegas H.

Indeed, VACCs have a variety of physiological functions, including regulation of firing patterns, synaptic modulation, and neurotransmitter release in the nervous system (5.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev.

As a result, we found that Cav2.3e is the major Cav2.3 isoform in TG neurons, and Cav2.3e is preferentially expressed in small (<16 μm) IB4-negative/trkA-positive and TRPV1-positive neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that SNX-482-sensitive R-type calcium channel component is associated with Cav2.3e expression in these neurons.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of TG Neurons−All surgical and experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the School of Dentistry, Seoul National University. TG neurons from 2- to 5-day-old neonatal rats were prepared as described previously (25.Yang B.H. Piao Z.G. Kim Y.B. Lee C.H. Lee J.K. Park K. Kim J.S. Oh S.B. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, TG neurons were washed several times in cold (4 °C) Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing trypsin. The cells were washed in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and triturated with a flame-polished Pasteur pipette to separate cells and remove processes. Subsequently, cells were centrifuged, resuspended, and placed on poly-l-ornithine (0.5 mg/ml)-coated glass coverslips (25 mm in diameter). Cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C equilibrated with 5% CO2.Immunocytochemistry−For immunocytochemistry, trigeminal ganglion neurons were seeded on poly-l-ornithine-coated coverglass and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The TG neurons were used for the experiments at 1 day after culture. After rinsing in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the TG neurons were fixed in -20 °C methanol (Merck) for 10 min. Afterward, the TG neurons were preincubated in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated in rabbit anti-Cav2.3 (α1E voltage-gated calcium channel, R-type) (1:200; Chemicon) in the same solution at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit IgG antibody (1:200; Jackson Immuno-Research) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the samples were covered with VectaShield mounting (Vector Laboratories), and fluorescent images were obtained under a confocal microscope (FV-300, Olympus, Japan). The specificity of primary antibody was confirmed by control antigen for anti-Cav2.3. For negative control, 1 μg of blocking peptide was preincubated with the same volume of primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.Whole Tissue RT-PCR Analysis−Total RNA was isolated from 2- to 5-day-old rats TG neurons using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Following digestion with DNase I, 3 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the Superscript™ first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After the reverse transcription reaction, 1 ng of cDNA was then used as a template for amplification. Primers for PCR were specifically designed to differentiate the presence or the absence of three inserts (inserts I, II, and III) in the Cav2.3 transcripts based on GenBank™ rat cDNA sequences (Table 1). After a denaturation step of 5 min at 94 °C, the amplification was carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s for 35 cycles. The PCR was completed by maintaining temperatures at 72 °C for 10 min. As a positive control, cDNA from the same preparations was subjected to 35 cycles of PCR with primers for β-actin. All PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels.TABLE 1List of primer sequences designed for this studyPrimersSize (bp)Primer sequenceLengthbpCav2.3 Insert I (57 bp)OuteraOuter primers were used for single cell RT-PCRForward (1751–1770)ATG GGA CTC CTT CGG CTA AT20501/444bBoldface n/n indicates product size with and without insert, respectivelyReverse (2232–2251)CTT TGT TGA GGG CTT CTT GG20InnercInner primers were used for both whole tissue and single cell RT-PCRForward (1992–2011)CAA GGA TGA GCA GGA GGA AG20260/203Reverse (2232–2251)CTT TGT TGA GGG CTT CTT GG20InsertdInsert primers were used for both whole tissue and single cell RT-PCRForward (1751–1770)ATG GGA CTC CTT CGG CTA AT20378/XReverse (2108–2129)CAC ATC GAC ATG TGG TGT CTT C22Cav2.3 Insert II (21 bp)OuterForward (2305–2324)AAC CCA CTC AAT GCT CAT CC20516/495Reverse (2800–2820)CAT CAG ACT GTT GGT CCT CCT21InnerForward (2305–2324)AAC CCA CTC AAT GCT CAT CC20280/259Reverse (2564–2584)GGT CCT CAA AAG TCA CCA CAG21InsertForward (2429–2448)ACA TAG GTG GCC TGA CTA GC20392/XReverse (2800–2820)CAT CAG ACT GTT GGT CCT CCT21Cav2.3 insert III (129 bp)OuterForward (5659–5678)TCC TCA CTG CCT CAG GAG AT20520/391Reverse (6159–6178)AGC GGT GAG TGT CAG ACT TG20InnerForward (5738–5757)GTC GGA GTG GAT ACC CTT CA20267/138Reverse (5985–6004)AAC GTC GCA TAG AGC TAG GG20InsertForward (5738–5757)TCC TCA CTG CCT CAG GAG AT20307/XReverse (5946–5965)CCA TAG TCA GAC GTG GCA TA20β-Actin NM_031144OuterForwardCCC AGA TCA TGT TTG AGA CC20456ReverseAGG ATT CCA TAC CCA GGA AG20InnerForwardAGG CTG TGT TGT CCC TGT AT20317ReverseCAG CTC ATA GCT CTT CTC CA20trkA NM_021589OuterForwardACC ATG CTA CAG CAC CAA CA20489ReverseGGG TTG CTT TCC ATA GGT GA20InnerForwardGGA CCT GAT GCA AAA CTG CT20201ReverseCAT GCC GAA GTC TCC AAT CT20P2X3 NM_031075OuterForwardGCC CAA CAG TGA GCT TTT TC20436ReverseTTT GAT CCT CCA TGC CTA CC20InnerForwardTCC TCA CAC ATC CAC ACA TC20226ReverseAAG TGC TGC AGG TTC CTC TT20TRPV1 AF029310OuterForwardATG CCA GCT ACA CAG ACA GCT A22426ReverseCCT TCC TGT TGG TGA TCT CTT C22InnerForwardTGA CCC TCT TGG TGG AGA AT20245ReverseTGT GTT ATC TGC CAC CTC CA20a Outer primers were used for single cell RT-PCRb Boldface n/n indicates product size with and without insert, respectivelyc Inner primers were used for both whole tissue and single cell RT-PCRd Insert primers were used for both whole tissue and single cell RT-PCR Open table in a new tab Single Cell RT-PCR−We adopted methods described by Silbert et al. (26.Silbert S.C. Beacham D.W. McCleskey E.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 34-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for single cell RT-PCR. An entire single cell or the intracellular content of a single cell (when performed just after electrophysiological recording) was aspirated into a patch pipette using negative pressure under visual control. Patch pipettes used for an entire neuron harvest had a tip diameter range of 12–30 μm and were filled with RNase-free water. The tip of the pipette and its contents were broken into a reaction tube containing RT reagents. To avoid genomic DNA contamination, digestion with DNase I was performed before RT. RT was carried out for 1 h at 50 °C (Invitrogen), and the cDNA product was used in a separate PCR. The forward and reverse primers were designed from unique sequence to avoid amplifying homologous genes. The first round of PCR was performed in 50 μl of PCR buffer containing 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm“outer” primers, 5 μl of RT product, and 0.2 μl of platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The protocol included a 5-min initial denaturation step at 95 °C followed by 60 cycles of 40 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 40 s of annealing at 60 °C, and 40 s of elongation at 72 °C. The reaction was completed with 7 min of final elongation. For the second round of amplification, the reaction buffer (20 μl) contained 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm“inner” primers, 5 μl of the first round PCR products, and 0.1 μl of platinum Taq DNA polymerase. “Insert” primers, designed to detect the presence of insert fragments, were also used in second round amplifications. The reaction procedure for these primers was the same as the first round. The sequences of all the primers used for single cell PCR are presented in Table 1. For positive controls, β-actin primers were used in parallel PCRs. A negative control was obtained from pipettes that did not harvest any cell contents but were submerged in the bath solution. The PCR products were displayed on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels. Gels were photographed using a digital camera (Bioprint 2000 x-press zoom, Vilber Lourmat, France).Classification of Sensory Neurons−As described previously (27.Murray S.S. Cheema S.S. J. Anat. 2003; 202: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), TG neurons were classified into three groups as follows: small (10–16 μm), medium (16–20 μm), and large (20–30 μm) neurons. Griffonia simplicifolia IB4 was also utilized to classify TG neurons as either IB4-positive or IB4-negative neurons (28.Stucky C.L. Lewin G.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6497-6505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before single cell collections, TG neurons were incubated with 10 μg/ml IB4-FITC (Sigma) in a balanced salt solution (BSS (in mm) as follows: 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose) for 10 min and then rinsed in BSS. For electrophysiological experiments, neurons were stained with 10 μg/ml IB4-FITC for 10 min and then rinsed for 10 min in extracellular solution before recording. IB4-FITC staining was visualized with standard FITC filters.Intracellular Calcium Imaging−Intracellular calcium imaging was performed as described previously (25.Yang B.H. Piao Z.G. Kim Y.B. Lee C.H. Lee J.K. Park K. Kim J.S. Oh S.B. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were loaded with fura-2 AM (2 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 40 min at 37 °C in BSS. The cells were then rinsed and incubated for 30 min to de-esterify the dye. The cells were plated onto poly-l-ornithine-coated coverslips, mounted onto the chamber, placed on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70, Japan) and perfused continuously with BSS at 2 ml/min. All measurements were made at 36 °C (temperature controller PTC-20; ALA Scientific Instrument Inc.). Cells were illuminated with a 175-watt xenon arc lamp, and excitation wavelengths (340/380 nm) were selected by a Lambda DG-4 monochromator wavelength changer (Shutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by digital video microfluorometry with an intensified CCD camera (CasCade, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) coupled to a microscope and software (Metafluor, Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA) on a Pentium 4 computer.Electrophysiological Recordings−We performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings to measure barium currents (IBa) with an Axopatch-1C amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The pipette resistance was 2–5 megohms. Series resistance was compensated for (>80%), and leak subtraction was performed. Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. The pClamp8 (Axon Instruments) software was used during experiments and analysis. The pipette solution for IBa contained the following (mm): 100 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 3.6 Mg-ATP, 14 phosphocreatine, 0.1 GTP, and 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. The extracellular solution for IBa contained the following (mm): 151 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 HEPES, 5 BaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium OH. The IBa was evoked by a test pulse to +0 mV from the holding potential, -80 mV every 10 s.Drugs−Nimodipine (Sigma) was dissolved in methanol. ω-Conotoxin-GVIA (ω-CgTx), ω-agatoxin-IVA (ω-Aga; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), SNX-482, and cadmium chloride (Sigma) were dissolved in distilled water to make a stock solution and kept at -20 °C. The drugs were diluted to the final concentration in the extracellular solution and applied by gravity through the bath perfusion system.RESULTSCav2.3 Is Heterologously Expressed in Sensory Neurons−The distribution of Cav2.3 was determined by immunocytochemical approach in rat TG neurons that were prepared from primary culture. We found that Cav2.3 was not evenly distributed in the cell bodies of TG neurons. As shown in Fig. 1, the staining of Cav2.3 in TG neurons was heterogeneous with different levels of immunoreactivity, being predominantly expressed in small sensory neurons than large neurons. These results suggest the potential role of Cav2.3 in nociceptive neurotransmission. Thus, we further examined which isoforms of Cav2.3 are specifically expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons.Two Cav2.3 Isoforms, Cav2.3a and Cav2.3e, Are Expressed in Sensory Neurons−The presence of three major inserts was investigated to determine splice variants of Cav2.3. The inserts tested were I and II in the II–III loop and III in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2A). For RT-PCR, we designed primers flanking each insert (named inner primers) as well as on the insert region (named insert primers) (see Table 1 and Fig. 2C). Using inner primers, the PCR products were differentiated by size, because amplification with the insert yielded products of larger size than amplification without the insert. Cav2.3 containing the insert was further verified using insert primers. One of the insert primers was within the insert region, although the other was outside the region (Fig. 2C). In this scenario we only obtained amplification when the insert was present. As a result, we only found amplification of insert II in the II–III loop. In the carboxyl terminus, however, we obtained both short and long cDNA fragments (absence and presence of the 129-bp insert III fragment) (Fig. 3A). These two isoforms correspond to Cav2.3a and Cav2.3e, respectively (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 2A, putative membrane topology of the Cav2.3 subunit. The structural variations include 19 (insert I) and 7 (insert II) amino acid (aa) segments in the loop between domains II and III and a 43-amino acid segment (insert III) in the proximal carboxyl terminus. B, eight possible isoforms deduced from the Cav2.3 sequence. Cav2.3a-Cav2.3f is a newly proposed set of names by Pereverzev et al. (20.Pereverzev A. Leroy J. Krieger A. Malecot C.O. Hescheler J. Pfitzer G. Klockner U. Schneider T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 352-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The isoform names in parentheses are initial names. C, the illustration shows the locations in Cav2.3 subunit of the primers designed for RT-PCR analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Two Cav2.3 isoforms were detected in TG neurons. A, inserts I–III were analyzed by whole tissue RT-PCR. The expected products sizes are as follows. Inner primer, Δinsert I (203 bp) and +insert I (260 bp); Δinsert II (259 bp) and +insert II (280 bp); Δinsert III (138 bp) and +insert III (267 bp); Insert primer, Δinsert I (no product) and +insert I (378 bp); Δinsert II (no product), and +insert II (392 bp); Δinsert III (no product) and +insert III (307 bp). The PCR products from TG neurons never have insert I, but always have insert II and either lack or contain insert III. B, illustrated are representative gels showing single cell RT-PCR products amplified using specific primers. Cav2.3 isoform that has insert II, but no insert I and III, corresponds to Cav2.3a. Cav2.3 isoform that has insert II and III, but no insert I, corresponds to Cav2.3e. C, single cell RT-PCR products amplified with nested primers from individual neurons were the same as PCR products from whole tissue, i.e. missing insert I, containing insert II, and either containing (lane 1) or missing (lane 2) insert III. Note that two PCR products with or without insert III (larger, lane 1 and smaller lane 2) were produced in different cells at single cell level, indicating that Cav2.3a and Cav2.3e are not expressed together in the same cells. D, the number (lanes 1–6) indicates six different neurons examined by single cell RT-PCR. β-Actin was used in each reaction as a positive control. This shows the proportion of TG neurons that contain Cav2.3e and Cav2.3a, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cav2.3e Is the Major Cav2.3 Isoform in Sensory Neurons− From whole tissue RT-PCR analysis, we found that the Cav2.3a and Cav2.3e isoforms are expressed in TG neurons. We further determined the expression pattern of these two isoforms at the single cell level. When we analyzed inserts I, II, and III, using single cell RT-PCR, the splicing patterns were consistent with those obtained in whole tissue. We detected the Cav2.3a and Cav2.3e isoforms in a subpopulation of TG neurons (Fig. 3C). In further experiments, we only analyzed insert III to discriminate between Cav2.3 isoforms in individual neurons (n = 78, chosen irrespective of size). Of the neurons analyzed, Cav2.3e and Cav2.3a mRNAs were found in 19.2% (n = 15/78) and 2.5% (n = 2/78), respectively (Fig. 3D). We failed to observe the expression of Cav2.3e and Cav2.3a expressed together in the same TG neuron. Our data demonstrate that Cav2.3e is the major Cav2.3 isoform in rat TG neurons.Expression of Cav2.3e Isoform Is Predominant in Small Sensory Neurons−The observation that Cav2.3e is the major isoform in TG neurons led us to analyze only Cav2.3e in subsequent single cell RT-PCR analyses. TG neurons were categorized into small (10–16 μm), medium (16–20 μm), and large (20–30 μm) neurons, as described previously (27.Murray S.S. Cheema S.S. J. Anat. 2003; 202: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Cav2.3e mRNA was detected in 30.9% (n = 13/42) of small neurons and 11.1% (n = 2/18) of medium neurons but was absent from the large neurons (n = 0/18) (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Distribution of Cav2.3e in nociceptive TG neurons. A, expression patterns of Cav2.3e were analyzed in three groups categorized according to TG neuron size (small, medium, and large). The representative gels show single cell RT-PCR products obtained from six (lanes 1–6) different neurons. Control β-actin was used in each single cell RT-PCR. The numbers of Cav2.3e-expressing neurons over total neurons tested are presented in the bar graph. B, distribution of Cav2.3e in small diameter sensory neurons. Illustrated are representative gels showing single cell RT-PCR products obtained from six (lanes 1–6) different neurons, IB4-negative and -positive TG neurons. After small diameter neurons in TG were classified as IB4-negative or IB4-positive neurons, trkA and P2X3 expression in each group was first determined by single cell RT-PCR. Then the expression pattern of Cav2.3e in each group was examined. The graph shows that Cav2.3e isoform expression was only restricted to IB4-negative/trkA-positive sensory neurons but not in IB4-positive neurons. C, illustrated are representative gels showing RT-PCR products amplified with Cav2.3e, TRPV1, and β-actin-specific primers from four different neurons. The graph shows that Cav2.3e is preferentially expressed in TRPV1-positive neurons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Preferential expression of Cav2.3e in small neurons suggests that Cav2.3e might be involved in nociception (29.Murakami M.

https://openalex.org/W1985163729,"Cartilage destruction leads to severe joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis and spinal disorders with back pain, and cartilage regeneration is very inefficient. A major component of the cartilage extracellular matrix is the proteoglycan aggrecan that contains approximately 100 chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, which impart water absorption and resistance to compression. Here, we demonstrate that chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (CSGalNAcT-1) plays a critical role in CS biosynthesis in cartilage. By in situ hybridization and real time reverse transcription-PCR of developing cartilage, CSGalNAcT-1 exhibited the highest level of expression. Its expression in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells correlated well with that of aggrecan core protein. In heterozygote and homozygote aggrecan-null cartilage where aggrecan transcription is decreased, CSGalNAcT-1 transcription diminished accordingly. Overexpression of the enzyme in chondrocytic cells further enhanced CS biosynthesis but not that of the aggrecan core protein, indicating that the enzyme activity is not saturated in the cells and that aggrecan synthesized in the overexpressing cells is heavier than the native molecule. Analysis of the CS chains synthesized in the overexpressing cells by gel chromatography and that of disaccharide composition revealed that the CS chains had similar length and sulfation patterns. Furthermore, adenoviral gene delivery of the enzyme into intervertebral discs displayed a substantial increase in the level of CS biosynthesis. These observations indicate that CSGalNAcT-1 overexpression increases the number of CS chains attached to aggrecan core protein. Our studies may lead to a new therapeutic intervention, ameliorating the outcome of cartilage degenerative diseases.

Cartilage is localized on joint surfaces and in the spine, where it forms the intervertebral discs and helps physical movement. The extracellular matrix of cartilage contains two major structural components: the fiber structure made of collagens and the proteoglycan aggregate. Whereas collagen fibers of types II, IX, and XI provide cartilage with tensile strength, the proteoglycan aggregate, composed of a large proteoglycan aggrecan, hyaluronan, and link protein, provides it with resistance to compression (1Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).

The CS content of aggrecan gradually diminishes with age, resulting in decreased water retention and aggravation of cartilage degeneration (4Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J.

Due to the lack of blood vessels and the presence of specific structural macromolecules, such as aggrecan, cartilage is one of the most difficult tissues to regenerate. CS comprises repeating disaccharide units of GalNAc and glucuronic acid (GlcUA) residues with sulfate residues at various positions. CS biosynthesis (11Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) is initiated by the transfer of a GalNAc residue to the linkage region of a GlcUA-β1,3-Gal-β1,3-Gal-β1,4-Xyl tetrasaccharide primer that is attached to a serine residue of the core protein. Then chain elongation occurs by the alternate addition of GalNAc and GlcUA residues. Enzyme activities that catalyze the initiation and elongation processes are termed glycosyltransferase-I and II activities, respectively (12Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J.

All of these enzymes have an N-terminal transmembrane domain and are localized to the Golgi apparatus, where CS biosynthesis takes place (22Silbert J.E. Freilich L.S. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CSS-1, CSS-2, CSS-3, and CSGlcAT form a family of glycosyltransferase enzymes. CSS-1, CSS-2, and CSS-3 contain two glycosyltransferase domains and exhibit both N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT) and glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT) activities in chain elongation. Thus, they have glycosyltransferase-II (both GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II) activity. CSGlcAT has an inactive GalNAcT domain and exhibits only GlcAT-II activity. CSGalNAcT-1 and -2 have one glycosyltransferase domain and exhibit GalNAcT activity in both the initiation and elongation processes, indicating that CSGalNAcT-1 and -2 have both GalNAcT-I and -II activities. Thus, CS chain elongation may involve all six enzymes, whereas CS chain initiation probably involves only CSGalNAcT-1 and -2. Although individual enzymes have been biochemically characterized, the in vivo mechanism of CS biosynthesis is not fully understood. Since cartilage contains a large amount of CS, chondrocytes must be capable of efficiently synthesizing numerous CS chains. Elucidation of the mechanism of CS biosynthesis in cartilage would provide a basis for the development of a treatment promoting cartilage regeneration. In this study, we identified CSGalNAcT-1 as the enzyme critical for cartilage CS biosynthesis. Overexpression of the enzyme in chondrocytic cells elevated the level of CS biosynthesis, and in vivo adenoviral gene delivery of the enzyme into the intervertebral disc resulted in a higher level of CS incorporation. The aggrecan synthesized in the CSGalNAcT-1-overexpressing cells had a higher number of CS chains. We term this molecule “superaggrecan” and propose a novel enzyme-based approach for the therapeutic intervention of cartilage degenerative diseases. In Situ Hybridization—cDNA fragments encoding glycosyltransferases and aggrecan core protein were prepared by PCR using cDNA of differentiating ATDC5 cells and appropriate primers (supplemental Table 1). The PCR product was then subcloned into the pBluescript IISK(-) vector (Stratagene). RNA probes were prepared using cDNA prepared as described above and a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). A humerus was obtained from an E16.5 mouse and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h at 4 °C. The samples were embedded in paraffin and sliced into 4-μm sections. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (23Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—ATDC5 cells, a cell line established from chondrocytic cells of a mouse embryonal carcinoma, undergo all of the steps of chondrogenesis (24Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in a maintenance medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml human transferrin, 3 × 10-8 m sodium selenite, penicillin, and streptomycin. To induce chondrocyte differentiation, the cells at confluence were treated with 10 μg/ml of bovine insulin. N1511 cells, a cell line established from chondrocytic cells from the rib cage of a 4-week-old male p53-null mouse, undergo all of the steps of chondrogenesis (25Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in minimum essential medium α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Differentiation was similarly induced by combined treatment with of 1 × 10-6 m dexamethasone and 1 × 10-7 m rat parathorimone. LTC cells, a rat chondrosarcoma cell line, were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. 293A cells, an embryonic human kidney cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cell culture was performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The medium was changed every other day. Real Time RT-PCR—mRNA was isolated from ATDC5, N1511, and transfected LTC cells and cartilage of a cartilage matrix deficiency (cmd) mouse at E18.5 using Micro-Fast-Track™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ First-Strand (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The TaqMan probes contained a reporter dye at the 5′ end and a quencher dye at the 3′ end. To calculate the copy number, control vectors were prepared by PCR using appropriate primers and the cDNA obtained from N1511 cells, followed by subcloning of the fragment into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen). For CSS-3, a BAC clone was used as the PCR template. Primers and probes used for real time RT-PCR are listed in supplemental Table 2. Primers for the control vector are listed in supplemental Table 3. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (TaqMan). PCRs for all of the samples were performed in triplicate in 96-well optical plates using 5 ng of cDNA, 25 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), 100 nm probe, 100 nm each primer, and water to a final volume of 50 μl. Thermocycling conditions comprised an initial holding step at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. To standardize mRNA levels, the primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as internal controls. Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors of Glycosyltransferases and Establishment of Their Overexpressing Cell Lines—Full-length human cDNA encoding the glycosyltransferases was amplified by PCR using the Marathon Ready™ cDNA obtained from human bone marrow tissue (Clontech) as the template and two primers: 5′-AAGCTTCCCAAGCTTATGATGATGGTTCGCCGGGGGCT-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGCTCTAGATCATGTTTTTTTGCTACTTGTCTTCTGT-3′ for CSGalNAcT-1; 5′-AAGCTTCCCAAGCTTGCGGGCATGGCCGCGCGCGG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGCTCTAGACATTAGGCTGTCCTCACTGA-3′ for CSS-1; 5′-AAGCTTCCCAAGCTTATGCGGGCATCGCTGCTGCTGT-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACGGGATCCTCAGGTGCTGTTGCCCTGCTCC-3′ for CSS-2; 5′-AAGCTTCCCAAGCTTACCACCATGCGACTGAGCTCCCT-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGCTCTAGACTAAGTGCTATTGGCCTGCTCCT-3′ for CSGlcAT, which are attached with a HindIII or XbaI site (underlined), respectively. The amplified fragment was subcloned into pcDNA/Hygro (Invitrogen) using the HindIII and XbaI sites, as previously described (20Sato T. Gotoh M. Kiyohara K. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Asada M. Watanabe H. Imamura T. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol.

The CSGalNAcT-1/pcDNA3.1(+), CSS-1/pcDNA3.1(+), CSS-2/pcDNA3.1(+), and CSGlcAT/pcDNA3.1(+) vectors were constructed by subcloning the full-length cDNA into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). LTC cells were transfected with these expression vectors (+) or pcDNA3.1(+) (as a mock control) using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These cells were cultured in the presence of 750 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai) for 10 days. The expression levels of these enzymes were measured by real time RT-PCR. The stable cells overexpressing individual enzymes at similar levels were used. Alcian Blue Staining—Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes. When the cells reached 80% confluence in a conditioned medium on day 2, they were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. A humerus was obtained from an E16.5 mouse and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h at 4 °C. The samples were embedded in paraffin and sliced into 4-μm sections. Transduced vertebral sections were obtained as described below. The cells and deparaffinized sections were then stained using 0.1% Alcian blue in 0.1 m HCl at room temperature for 10 min. Immunostaining—The transfected LTC cells were plated in 4-well culture slides. When the cells reached 30% confluence at day 2, they were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. They were double-immunostained as previously described (25Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For chondroitin 4-sulfate detection, mouse monoclonal anti-chondroitin 4-sulfate (LY111, ×200; Seikagaku) and Alexa Fluor™ 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (×1000) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. For aggrecan core protein detection, rabbit polyclonal anti-aggrecan (×1000) (26Matsumoto K. Kamiya N. Suwan K. Atsumi K. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Yamada Y. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18257-18263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Alexa Fluor™ 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (×1000) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The specimen was observed using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser confocal microscope. Characterization of Aggrecan—The transfected LTC cells were plated in a 100-mm culture dish. The cells and conditioned medium were collected separately at day 2 and extracted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The samples were stirred overnight at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation in capped polycarbonate tubes (15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Portions of the samples were used for immuno-dot blot analysis. CsCl was added to obtain a density of 1.55 g/ml, and this was followed by ultracentrifugation under a dissociative condition in polyallomer tubes at 40,000 × g at 10 °C for 70 h. This ultracentrifugation at a slightly higher density enabled separation of the various aggrecan populations. The solution in the tube was fractionated into nine tubes (D1-D9) from the bottom. Aggrecan separation was monitored by immuno-dot blot analysis. Immuno-dot Blot Analysis—The samples were applied to nylon N+ membranes by dot blot using the BIO-DOT™ apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunodetected as previously described with slight modification (4Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). They were pretreated with 1 unit/ml protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku). For aggrecan core protein detection, rabbit polyclonal anti-aggrecan (×5000) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (×10,000; Cappel) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Characterization of CS Chains—The transfected LTC cells were plated in a 100-mm culture dish. After 2 days, they were labeled with [35S]sulfate (100 μCi/ml) for 24 h. The cells and conditioned medium were collected separately at day 3 and extracted with 0.2 m NaOH for 16 h at room temperature. Next, they were neutralized by the addition of 4 m acetate and digested with 1 mg/ml proteinase K in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 37 °C. The samples were applied to a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) column that was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After washing with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, glycosaminoglycan-rich fractions were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl. The eluates were precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate, and the precipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water. A portion (100 μl) of the sample was further isolated by treatment with a mixture of 10 microunits/ml heparitinase I (Seikagaku), 5 microunits/ml, heparitinase II (Seikagaku), and 10 microunits/ml heparinase (Seikagaku) in 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm calcium acetate for 2 h at 37 °C. Separation was performed using an Ultrafree-MC filter cup (Millipore) and dissolved in 200 μl of distilled water. To evaluate [35S]sulfate incorporation, a portion (100 μl) of the sample was measured by scintillation counting. To examine the chain lengths, the other portion (100 μl) of the sample was applied to a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m NaCl. Elution of the CS chains was monitored by scintillation counting. In separate experiments, heparitinase-resistant glycosaminoglycan fractions were prepared from the conditioned medium of nonlabeled LTC cells as described above. The sample was labeled with 3H-labeled sodium borohydride as described previously (27Nogami H. Suzuku H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8219-8229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After the removal of free 3H-labeled sodium borohydride using a Sephadex G-25 spin column, the labeled sample (∼90,000 cpm) was applied to a Superose 6 column under the same conditions as above. Analysis of CS Disaccharide Composition—Transfected LTC cells were plated in a 100-mm culture dish. The cells and conditioned medium were collected separately at day 2. Glycosaminoglycans were isolated by β-elimination, protease digestion, and DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, as described above. The eluates were precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate, and the precipitate was dissolved in 100 μl of distilled water. The samples were treated with 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC in 25 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.04% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C, and filtered using Ultrafree-MC (5,000 molecular weight limit). Unsaturated disaccharides in the filtrates were analyzed by reverse phase ion pair chromatography using the Senshu Pak column Docosil with a fluorescence detector according to Toyoda's method (28Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) with a slight modification of elution conditions. The modified gradient program was as follows: 0-10 min, 1-4% eluent B; 10-11 min, 4-10% eluent B; 11-20 min, 10-18% eluent B; 20-22 min, 18-70% eluent B; 22-29 min, 70% eluent B. Construction of the CSGalNAcT-1 Adenovirus Expression Vector, Viral Particle Production, and in Vivo Transduction to Vertebral Disc—cDNA encoding human CSGalNAcT-1 was prepared by PCR using the primers (5′-CACCATGATGATGGTTCGCCG-3′, 5′-TGTTTTTTTGCTACTTGTCTTCTG-3′) and CSGalNAcT-1/pcDNA3.1(+) as the template. This cDNA was then subcloned into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) using pENT/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). Adenoviral particles were obtained by transfecting 293A cells with the CSGalNAcT-1 adenoviral expression plasmid, and the titer was checked according to the manufacturer's instructions (ViraPower™ adenoviral expression system; Invitrogen). Adenoviral particles prepared using pAd/CMV/V5-GW/Lac-Z (Invitrogen) were used as the negative control. The particles (1.5 × 107 plaque-forming units) were injected into the caudal intervertebral discs of 4-month-old ICR mice. One week after the injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the caudal vertebrae were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and decalcified with K-CX solution (Fujisawa) for 24 h at room temperature. The samples were then embedded in paraffin and sliced into 4-μm sections. Expression Patterns of Glycosyltransferases Involved in CS Biosynthesis in Cartilage—The growth plate cartilage contains chondrocytes at different stages of differentiation: resting, proliferative, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes (29DeLise A.M. Fischer L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). During differentiation, chondrocytes at the prehypertrophic stage show the highest level of aggrecan synthesis (30Shibata S. Fukada K. Imai H. Abe T. Yamashita Y. J. Anat. 2003; 203: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since the CS chains are attached to the core protein of aggrecan in cartilage, the expression of the key enzymes required for CS biosynthesis is probably up-regulated, correlating with the expression of aggrecan core protein during chondrocyte differentiation. Initially, we investigated the expression of glycosyltransferases involved in CS biosynthesis in mouse developing cartilage. By in situ hybridization, CSS-1, CSS-2, CSGlcAT, and CSGalNAcT-1 were shown to be expressed in the prehypertrophic zone of the growth plate at E16.5, colocalized with aggrecan core protein. In particular, CSGalNAcT-1 was expressed at the highest level. In contrast, CSS-3 and CSGalNAcT-2 were expressed at very low levels (Fig. 2). Next, we examined the expression patterns of the CS biosynthetic enzymes in ATDC5 cells, which reflect the in vivo chondrocyte differentiation process (24Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The expression of both CSGlcAT and CSGalNAcT-1 was increased similar to that of aggrecan core protein, whereas response was less pronounced for that of CSS-1, CSS-2, and CSGalNAcT-2. The expression of CSS-3 was not detected (Fig. 3). Another chondrogenic cell line N1511 (25Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) displayed expression patterns similar to those of CS biosynthetic enzymes during differentiation (data not shown). These in vitro cell culture results indicate that the expression of CSGlcAT and CSGalNAcT-1 correlates well with that of aggrecan core protein. Real time RT-PCR showed a high level of CSGalNAcT-1 expression and lower levels of CSS-1, CSS-2, and CSGlcAT expression in cartilage at E18.5 (Fig. 4B, open bar); this is consistent with the in situ hybridization data. We further investigated the correlation between CS biosynthetic enzymes and aggrecan expression, using cartilage isolated from mice with cmd, known as natural aggrecan-null mice (32Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Watanabe H. Nakata K. Kimata K. Nakanishi I. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6943-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Since the heterozygote and homozygote cmd cartilage exhibited ∼50 and ∼9% aggrecan gene transcription, respectively (Fig. 4A), quantification of the enzyme expression in the wild type, heterozygote, and homozygote cartilage could facilitate the identification of enzymes critical for CS biosynthesis. In the cmd heterozygote cartilage, CSGalNAcT-1 expression was diminished to ∼30% that of the wild type, whereas expression of the other enzymes was constantly low (Fig. 4B, gray bar). In the cmd homozygote cartilage, CSGalNAcT-1 expression further decreased to a low level similar to that of the other enzymes (Fig. 4B, black bar). These results, demonstrating high levels of gene expression in cartilage and a good correlation with aggrecan core protein expression, suggested that CSGalNAcT-1 mainly regulates CS synthesis in cartilage. CSGalNAcT-1 Overexpression Enhances CS Biosynthesis in Chondrocytic Cells—Next, we examined whether CSGalNAcT-1 overexpression could enhance CS biosynthesis in LTC cells. LTC cells are derived from a rat chondrosarcoma and have the characteristics of mature chondrocytes, including a high level of aggrecan expression (34Choi H.U. Meyer K. Swarm R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Oegema Jr., T.R. Hascall V.C. Dziewiatkowski D.D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2015317299,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a central role in oxygen homeostasis. Previously, we reported that the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 functions in stabilizing HIF-1α. Here, we demonstrate that 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), an activator of the NR4A family members, enhances transcriptional activity of HIF-1. 6-MP enhanced the protein-level of HIF-1α as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The induction of HIF-1α was abolished by the transfection of either a dominant-negative Nur77 mutant or si-Nur77, indicating a critical role of Nur77 in the 6-MP action. The HIF-1α protein level remained up to 60 min in the presence of 6-MP when de novo protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting that 6-MP induces stabilization of the HIF-1α protein. The fact that 6-MP decreased the association of HIF-1α with von Hippel–Lindau protein and the acetylation of HIF-1α, may explain how 6-MP induced stability of HIF-1α. Further, 6-MP induced the transactivation function of HIF-1α by recruiting co-activator cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein. Finally, 6-MP enhanced the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, and the formation of capillary tubes in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. Together, our results provide a new insight for 6-MP action in the stabilization of HIF-1α and imply a potential application of 6-MP in hypoxia-associated human vascular diseases."

In addition to α subunit gene variants (α1–α4) and developmental alterations in subunit composition of the receptor protein complex, alternative splicing of α subunits has been found to contribute to glycine receptor heterogeneity. Here, we describe a novel splice variant of the glycine receptor β subunit from mouse central nervous system, prevailing in macroglial cells, predominantly in astrocytes and extraneural tissues. As predicted by its cDNA sequence, the novel subunit βΔ7 lacks amino acid positions 251–302 encoded by exon 7 of the Glrb gene. Transcripts and antigen of βΔ7 were detected in cerebral cortex, liver, and heart. Lack of exon 7 results in a profoundly altered prediction of transmembrane topology as βΔ7 lacks TM1 and TM2 present in the full-length variant. Despite these topological alterations, in vitro studies showed that the βΔ7 polypeptide integrates into the plasma membrane, forming receptor complexes with the α1 subunit and gephyrin. Our data demonstrate that a topology deviating from the classical four transmembrane-fold is compatible with formation of glycine receptor protein complexes. However, co-expression of α1 with βΔ7 subunits did not change glycine receptor channel properties. Rather, the high level of expression in non-neuronal cells having intimate contact with synaptic regions may account for a yet unknown function of this splice variant βΔ7 in glycinergic neurotransmission.

A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Common features of all Cys-loop receptor subunits include four transmembrane regions (TM1–TM4), where TM2 forms the ion channel pore, and a large extracellular N-terminal ligand-binding domain. This domain shows significant structural homology to the acetylcholine-binding protein of Lymnaea stagnalis (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), a member of the immunoglobulin-like superfamily of proteins. By association of β subunits with the intracellular anchor protein gephyrin, GlyRs are clustered at the postsynaptic membrane. The gephyrin binding motif of the β subunit polypeptide has been mapped to the long intracellular TM3–4 loop (5Kim E.Y. Schrader N. Smolinsky B. Bedet C. Vannier C. Schwarz G. Schindelin H.

The GlyR β subunit gene is widely transcribed throughout the central nervous system of neonatal and adult rodents. Starting at embryonic day 14, β transcripts are first detectable by in situ hybridization in rat spinal cord and telencephalon (10Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Prior P. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Expression of the ligand binding α subunit variants (α1–α4) is highly regulated during development (12Akagi H. Hirai K. Hishinuma F. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 11: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Becker C.M. Hoch W. Betz H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3717-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Further GlyR subunit heterogeneity is generated by alternative splicing and RNA editing (α1 and α1ins; α2–3A and -3B; α3L and α3K) (11Malosio M.L. Marqueze-Pouey B. Kuhse J. Betz H.

Whereas, there are no reports about alternative splicing of the β subunit, aberrant splicing of GlyR β subunit transcripts underlies neurological disorders in a mouse mutant and human hyperekplexia (16Rees M.I. Lewis T.M. Kwok J.B. Mortier G.R. Govaert P. Snell R.G. Schofield P.R. Owen M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 853-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathological phenotype of the recessive mouse mutant spastic, where a LINE1 element is inserted into intron 5 of the Glrb gene results in exon skipping and a dramatic reduction in GlyR number (17Kingsmore S.F.

Likewise, compound heterozygote mutations of the human β subunit gene GLRB, with one allele resulting in skipping of exon 5, cause the human neurological disorder hyperekplexia (16Rees M.I.

As evident from biochemical cross-linking experiments (3Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and recombinant ion channel physiology (19Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) pentameric GlyRs display a subunit stoichiometry of α2β3. Upon heterologous expression, however, GlyR α subunits are able to assemble into functional homopentameric channels in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells (10Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Prior P.

When co-expressed with α subunits, β subunits incorporate into heteromeric GlyRs and contribute to intracellular transport during protein biogenesis and receptor anchoring. Moreover, the β subunit modifies physiological and pharmacological properties of GlyR chloride channels as demonstrated by altered single channel conductance and induction of picrotoxin insensitivity of heteromeric α1/β as compared with homomeric α1 receptors (22Hawthorne R. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35836-35843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H.

As a consequence of the interaction of the β subunit with gephyrin, GlyRs are clustered at the postsynaptic membrane. Gephyrin is highly enriched at the cytoplasmic face of the inhibitory postsynaptic membrane differentiations and colocalizes with both GlyRs and some GABAA receptor variants in spinal cord, retina, and other brain regions (25Meier J. Grantyn R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Sassoe-Pognetto M. Kirsch J. Grunert U. Greferath U. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Betz H. Wassle H. J. Comp.

This variant, termed βΔ7, is highly expressed in glial cells of rat spinal cord and in cultured astrocytes from mouse brain. The variant βΔ7 was also detectable in total RNA preparations from mouse spinal cord, cortex, liver, and heart. Exclusion of exon 7 predicts an altered transmembrane topology of the β polypeptide with TM1 and TM2 missing. Recombinant expression revealed that βΔ7 forms receptor complexes with the ligand binding α1 subunit as well as the anchor protein gephyrin. Single Cell RT-PCR, Total RNA Extraction, and cDNA Synthesis and Amplification—Harvesting of cytoplasmic RNA, reverse transcription, and PCR were done as described (30Kirchhoff F. Mulhardt C. Pastor A. Becker C.M. Kettenmann H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Lambolez B. Audinat E. Bochet P. Crepel F. Rossier J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In brief, patch clamp recordings were done and cellular RNA was harvested by applying negative pressure to the patch pipette filled with internal solution under visual control. Care was taken to avoid contaminations by material from adjacent cells. Immediately after retraction of the pipette, its content was expelled into a sterilized PCR tube containing 0.5 μl of 10 mm dNTPs (Roche), 1 μl of 50 μm random hexamer primers, 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μl of 30 units/ml RNasin (Promega). Reverse transcription was started by adding 0.5 μl of 200 units/μl of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) to a final volume of 10 μl. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, reaction was stopped by freezing at –20 °C. The polymerase chain reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 10 μl of reverse transcription reaction, 10 pmol, each, of sense and antisense primer, 5 μl of ×10 Taq polymerase buffer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Stratagene). A PerkinElmer Thermocycler 9600 was used set to 5 min at 94 °C for primary denaturation, 35–40 cycles for amplification (94 °C denaturation, 30 s; 45–51 °C annealing, 30 s; 72 °C elongation, 30 s (+1 s per cycle), and 10 min at 72 °C for elongation. After the final elongation step, PCR tubes were cooled to 4 °C and analyzed or frozen for later use. For detection of GlyRβ-specific cDNA sequences, two PCR were performed using different β specific primer pairs, bS1 and bAS1 in the first round, and “nested” primers (bS2/bAS2 generating DNA fragments of 509 bp length) in the second round. Primer sequences were bS1/bS2 (5′-GCTGCAGAGGACCTTGCCCGTGTGC-3′), bAS1 (5′-GCTCGAGCCACACATCCAGTGCCTT-3′), and bAS2 (5′-GTCGTCTTCGAACGTAGGACACTTTGGG-3′) (10Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Prior P. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Taleb O. Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 4: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Due to interspersed intronic sequences, amplification of contaminating genomic DNA could be distinguished from amplified β cDNA fragments by the size differences of the respective amplimers. As a positive control, cDNA derived from spinal cord total RNA was used instead of cytoplasmic RNA from individual cells. For negative control, either buffer (internal pipette solution) was used instead of harvested RNA or cytoplasmic RNA obtained from glial cell displaying no glycine-evoked inward currents (n = 3). For sequencing, PCR amplification products were purified and cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). Total RNA extractions were performed from astrocytes, spinal cord neurons, and different tissues (cortex, spinal cord, heart, and liver) from C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories). Following lysis using PeqLab Gold solution (PeqLab, Erlangen), the RNA was precipitated with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol. Finally, the RNA was washed twice with ethanol (75%) and dried on ice. cDNA synthesis was done as described above. PCR conditions differed only in the annealing temperature (60 °C). The expected amplimer sizes were 606 bp for the β subunit and 453 bp for βΔ7. Primer sequences used for amplification of β or βΔ7 are: bD7S (5′-TTGGATATACAACCGATGATTT-3′), bD7AS (5′-TTGCATCTGGTCTCACCAAC-3′); for β-actin amplification sense (5′-TGAGACCTTCAACACCCCAG-3′), antisense (5′-CATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACA-3′). PCR amplimers were verified by restriction digests and sequencing (ABI sequencer). Transfection of HEK293 and COS7 Cells—COS7 cells were transfected (10 μg of plasmid/10-cm dish) using DEAE-dextran (10 mg/ml). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected (10 μgof plasmid/10-cm dish) using a modified calcium-phosphate precipitation method (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein was cotransfected as a control for transfection efficiency. All experiments for immunocytochemistry, protein biochemistry, and electrophysiological recordings were performed 48 h following transfection. For glycosylation analysis, tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) was added 5 h after transfection, and the cells were incubated in the presence of tunicamycin for an additional 24 h prior cell lysis. Electrophysiological Analysis of Spinal Cord Glia and Transfected HEK293 Cells—Preparation of spinal cord slices and electrophysiological setup were done as described previously (30Kirchhoff F. Mulhardt C. Pastor A. Becker C.M. Kettenmann H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For recordings, cells were selected that were located 10–30 μm below the surface of the slice and displayed a clear, dark membrane surface. Membrane currents were measured applying the patch clamp technique in a whole cell recording configuration (33Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). During application of a series of de- and hyperpolarizing voltage steps (50 ms, ranging from –160 to +20 mV in 10-mV increments), whole cell membrane currents were recorded and cells were classified as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or glial progenitor cells/NG2 glia (30Kirchhoff F. Mulhardt C. Pastor A. Becker C.M. Kettenmann H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Matthias K. Kirchhoff F. Seifert G. Huttmann K. Matyash M. Kettenmann H. Steinhauser C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Current signals were amplified with conventional electronics (EPC-7 or EPC-9 amplifier, HEKA), filtered at 3 kHz, and sampled at 5 kHz. A standard bathing solution was used in the experiments with the following composition: 134.0 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm K2HPO4, 26.0 mm NaHCO3, 10.0 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4 (a total K+ concentration of 5 mm). The solution was gassed with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The internal pipette solution was composed of: 130.0 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 3.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EGTA, 10.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Whole cell recordings from transfected HEK293 cells were performed by application of ligand (100 μm glycine) or coapplication of ligand together with picrotoxin (100 μm) using a U-tube that bathed the suspended cell in a laminar flow of solution, giving a time resolution for equilibration of 10–30 ms. The external buffer consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH; the internal buffer was 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm N(Et)4Cl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. Current responses were measured at a holding potential of –60 mV. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Recording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate capillaries. The open resistance of these patch pipettes was 5–6 megohms. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Protein and in Vitro Deglycosylation—The biotinylation assay was performed 48 h post-transfection of COS7 cells grown in 6-cm dishes as described previously with little variations (35Ren Z. Riley N.J. Needleman L.A. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52700-52709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, after labeling of surface protein with EZ-link™ sulfo-(NHS)-S-S biotin (Pierce) and cell lysis, supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4°C while rotating. Biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling the probes in 1× sample buffer for 5 min. For Endo H digest, biotinylated surface proteins were denatured in 1× denaturing buffer at 100 °C for 10 min, Endo H (New England Biolabs) digest was done following the manufacturer's protocol. Antibody Generation—A peptide epitope bridging the border of exons 6 and 8 within the βΔ7 sequence (TKYYKGTGIFSVLSLASECEC) was chosen based on antigenicity prediction. The peptide was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-PAL-PEG-PS-resin to construct a peptide-amide (9050 PlusPep Synthesizer, Millipore). The integrity and purity of the lyophilized crude peptide were verified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis and mass-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. The crude peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the heterobifunctional cross-linker sulfo-succinimidyl 4-N-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1-carboxylate. Rabbits (chinchilla bastards) were immunized with 400 μg of peptide conjugate at days 0, 14, 28, and 40. The first test serum was taken 6 weeks after the first boost. Preadsorbed βΔ7 antibody K12 was generated by overnight coincubation of serum (dilution 1:20) with a membrane preparation from HEK293 cells transfected with the β subunit. Lysate and Membrane Preparation—For total cell lysates, transfected cells were lysed in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Membranes were separated from nuclei by ultracentrifugation (140,000 × g for 1 h). Pellets were resuspended in reducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol in 0.68 m Tris, pH 6.8) and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (20 μl of lysate/lane). For membrane protein analysis, crude cell membranes were prepared from transfected cells and mouse tissues as described previously (36Sontheimer H. Becker C.M. Pritchett D.B. Schofield P.R. Grenningloh G. Kettenmann H. Betz H. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For detection of myc-tagged β or βΔ7 the monoclonal and polyclonal anti-myc antibodies 9E10 (Santa Cruz) were used. The native β subunits were detected with the polyclonal anti-GlyRβ-(H170) antibody (Santa Cruz). For detection of the α subunits mAb4a hybridoma supernatant was used, for detection of gephyrin a monoclonal antigephyrin antibody (Clontech). Proteins were visualized using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Dianova) followed by detection using the ECLPlus system (GE Healthcare) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-Cy5 (Dianova) analyzed with fluoroimager STORM 860 (GE Healthcare). Immunocytochemistry—Transfected COS7 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (1.5 mm KH2PO4, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl), and blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized, and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (Dianova) (1:200) was applied for 1 h. Slides were analyzed using a confocal microscope (Leica). Immunoprecipitation—Crude cell membranes (1 mg) were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and sodium desoxycholate (10% in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0), and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by solubilization with 2% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, while gently agitating for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min), protein complexes were precipitated using polyclonal anti-myc antibody (1:100) by rotating the supernatants overnight at 4 °C. Prior to precipitation, a supernatant sample was harvested for further analysis. Protein complexes were incubated with protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma). Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C and three washing steps (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.16 m NaCl), the immunosorbent was collected at 3,000 × g. The precipitated proteins were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer. Topology Prediction—The topology of GlyR β and βΔ7 was predicted according to Expasy for post-translational modification. The prediction of transmembrane domains was based on a hidden Markov model (37Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 38Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar) and the predict protein server (39Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Single Cell RT-PCR Analysis of GlyR Expression in Rat Spinal Cord Glial Cells—The starting point of this study was the analysis of GlyR subunit transcripts in glial cells, as investigated in spinal cord slices of young rats (1–3 weeks old). The majority of cells were astrocytes as they showed passive membrane properties as revealed by their whole cell membrane currents (Fig. 1A, G2) (30Kirchhoff F. Mulhardt C. Pastor A. Becker C.M. Kettenmann H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Matthias K. Kirchhoff F. Seifert G. Huttmann K. Matyash M. Kettenmann H. Steinhauser C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second population of cells exhibited voltage-dependent currents characteristic for glial progenitor or NG2 glial cells (Fig. 1A, P1). Because in some cells we also observed a small component of symmetrical decaying in- and outward potassium currents, we cannot exclude the inclusion of some oligodendrocytes in our study (not shown). Glycine-evoked currents were recorded by the patch clamp technique in the whole cell configuration (Fig. 1, A and B). Thereafter, cytoplasmic RNA was harvested by applying negative pressure to the patch pipette. Surprisingly, subsequent RT-PCR analysis using nested PCR with GlyR β-specific primers detected the expression of cDNA fragments of 356 bp, instead of 509 bp as expected from the known GlyR β subunit cDNA sequence (Fig. 1, C and D). cDNA sequencing of the subcloned fragments of 356 bp revealed a novel alternatively spliced variant of the GlyR β subunit lacking exon 7. This novel variant is designated GlyR βΔ7. Deleted from the βΔ7 transcript, exon 7 encodes a region ranging from the C-terminal part of the large extracellular domain, TM1 and the intracellular loop between TM1 and TM2 to the first four amino acid residues corresponding to TM2 (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the polypeptide variant encoded by the βΔ7 transcript predicted a primary structure where TM1 and the loop connecting TM1 and TM2 were missing, suggesting a dramatic change in subunit topology (Fig. 2, B and C). Moreover, four positions of the amino acids corresponding to the pore-forming TM2 were also missing. Based on hydrophobicity analysis, only two TMs were postulated for βΔ7, suggesting a loss of TM2 (Fig. 2C, middle panel). Rather, prediction of secondary structure (39Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar) suggested that the remaining amino acid residues of the former TM2 substitute for the 10th β-sheet of the N-terminal domain that are lost by exon 7 deletion. Due to loss of exon 7, the secondary structure probability of the former TM2 positions changes from α-helical to β-strand, completing the fold of the acetylcholine-binding protein-like N-terminal domain (Fig. 2, B and C, right panels) (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Concurrently, the ion channel pore characteristic of the Cys-loop receptor subunits is lost in βΔ7. To functionally characterize the βΔ7 polypeptide, we cloned the coding sequence into the eukaryotic expression vector pRK7. In addition, β and βΔ7 constructs were generated carrying an N-terminal c-myc epitope (9E10) recognized by specific antibodies (Fig. 2A). Cell Type and Tissue Distribution of β Subunit Transcript Variants in Situ—Analysis of the tissue distribution of the major β subunit transcript variants was extended to spinal cord (sc), cerebral cortex (cx), heart (he), and liver (li) of adult mice (Fig. 3A). Cortex contained high levels of the novel βΔ7 splice variant, whereas liver and heart yielded a weak signal for this transcript. In adult spinal cord the signal for the read-through β transcript was barely detectable. Analysis of βΔ7 transcript distribution in embryonic, neonatal, and adult central nervous system revealed no significant developmental regulation (not shown). Consistent with the single cell PCR data, RT-PCR analysis of β subunit transcripts present in primary astrocytes and neurons cultured from the mouse central nervous system confirmed the presence of the two major β subunit transcripts, corresponding to the read-through β transcript (606 bp) and the variant lacking exon 7 (453 bp) (Fig. 3B). In cultured astrocytes, the βΔ7 transcript prevailed, whereas the read-through β variant predominated in spinal cord neurons. In Vivo Expression of βΔ7—To verify if the βΔ7 transcript is translated, membrane preparations from neuronal and nonneuronal tissues (cortex, spinal cord, and liver) were analyzed for concomitance of the read-through β subunit and the splice variant βΔ7 (Fig. 4). Using the commercial antibody H170 directed against GlyR β variants, we indeed detected an antigen of 53 kDa molecular mass in cortex, spinal cord, and liver corresponding to βΔ7 (Fig. 4A). The staining intensity of the presumptive βΔ7 was not significantly different from the full-length β antigen. As evident from an Endo H digest (Fig. 4A, right panel), the observed double bands do not represent glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of the full-length β variant. After the Endo H digest, both bands were still present, running in a slightly lower position than those of the non-digested preparation. For im"

Erk activity in FGF2-treated RCS (rat chondrosarcoma) chondrocytes or human primary chondrocytes was abolished by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I). Bis I inhibited FGF2-induced activation of MEK, Raf-1, and Ras members of Erk signaling module but not the FGF2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Frs2 or the kinase activity of FGFR3, demonstrating that it targets the Erk cascade immediately upstream of Ras. Indeed, Bis I abolished the FGF2-mediated association of Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase with Frs2 and Gab1 adaptor proteins necessary for proper Ras activation. We also determined which PKC isoform is involved in FGF2-mediated activation of Erk. When both conventional and novel PKCs expressed by RCS chondrocytes (PKCα, -γ, -δ, and -ϵ) were down-regulated by phorbol ester, cells remained responsive to FGF2 with Erk activation, and this activation was sensitive to Bis I. Moreover, treatment with PKCλ/ζ pseudosubstrate lead to significant reduction of FGF2-mediated activation of Erk, suggesting involvement of an atypical PKC.

Activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) cause several human dwarfisms characterized by diminished long bone growth (1Passos-Bueno M.R. Wilcox W.R. Jabs E.W. Sertie A.L.

Protein kinase C (PKC) comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate the consensus motif RXX(S/T)XR (11Klemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The PKCs are further divided into three subfamilies based on sequence similarities and modes of activation. The conventional PKCs (PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ) are activated by phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+, the novel PKCs (PKCδ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ) require only phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol, and the atypical PKCs (aPKC; PKCλ and -ζ) respond to phosphatidylserine alone (12Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The PKC phosphorylation motif is present in many proteins (13Nishikawa K. Toker A.

PKCs are involved in numerous signaling events including activation of the Erk MAP kinase pathway. This is evident by potent Erk activation in cells treated with phorbol esters, such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), which activates both conventional PKCs and novel PKCs through binding of their diacylglycerol site (14Adams P.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In PMA-treated cells, PKCs target the Erk module at the level of both Raf-1 and MEK, through direct activatory phosphorylation or indirectly (15Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H.

To date, little is known about chondrocyte properties of FGF signaling permitting prolonged Erk activity, although slow down-regulation of mutated FGFR3 appears to be involved (30Monsonego-Ornan E.

The requirement of PKC for sustained Ras/Erk signaling prompted us, in this study, to investigate the role of PKC in FGF signaling in chondrocytes. Cell Culture, Western Immunoblotting (WB), and Immunoprecipitation—FGFR2 and FGFR3-expressing (32Aikawa T. Segre G.V. Lee K. J. Biol.

Wilcox, unpublished data. rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) chondrocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media or Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological, Nordcross, GA) and antibiotics. To obtain human chondrocytes, cartilage was dissected from the ends of long bones of 20–28 week-of-gestation fetus and cleared of the soft tissues. Chondrocytes were isolated by a 24-h treatment with 0.1% bacterial collagenase (Invitrogen) and grown in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized by luminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used: actin, Erk2, FGFR1–4, Frs2, Grb2, MEK1, and PKCη, -μ, -θ, and -ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Grb2, PKCα, -β, -γ, -δ, -ϵ, and -λ, Raf-1, Shc, and Shp2 (BD Transduction Laboratories); P-ElkS383, Erk1/2, P-Erk1/2T202/Y204, P-MEKS217/221, P-Raf-1S338, and P-FGFRY653/654 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); 4G10, Gab1, Ras, and Rap1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); PKCζ (Calbiochem); FLAG (Sigma); and Shb (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). For immunoprecipitation, 2 mg of total protein was incubated with Raf-1, Frs2, Gab1, PKCλ, PKCζ, Raf-1, Shc, Shb (2 μg), or FLAG antibody (5 μg) for 2 h at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were isolated using A/G agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To quantify the WB signal, the integrated optical density of a given band was determined using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MA). Signal Transduction Studies—Cells were serum-starved for 12 h before treatment with 10 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 30 min in the presence of heparin (1 μg/ml; Invitrogen). When Bis I, Gö6983, Gö6976, GSK3β inhibitor I (4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione), H89, Raf1 inhibitor I (5-iodo-3-((3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl) methylene)-2-indolinone), Ro-31-8220, SU5402 (Calbiochem), U0126, or rapamycin (Cell Signaling) were used, cells were treated for 30 min prior to FGF2 treatment. When PMA (200 nm; Sigma) was used, cells were treated for 5 min or 12 h, respectively. The phosphorylation status of Raf-1, Erk, and MEK was detected by WB using the antibodies described above. Erk activity was determined using a kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling). Briefly, Erk was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of total protein and incubated with recombinant Elk-1 in the presence of ATP. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 at Ser-383 was determined by WB. For the Raf-1 kinase assay, Raf-1 immunocomplexes were washed with Raf-1 kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2), and the kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 20 μm ATP and 500 ng of recombinant MEK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 40 μl of kinase buffer. MEK1 phosphorylation was determined by WB. For the FGFR3 kinase assay using recombinant FGFR3 intracellular domain, the Frs2 immunocomplexes were washed with FGFR3 kinase buffer (60 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 3 μm Na3VO4, 1.2 mm dithiothreitol), and the kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 2.5 μg of polyethylene glycol, 10 μm ATP, and 300 ng of recombinant FGFR3 intracellular domain (Glu-322–Thr-806; Cell Signaling) in 50 μl of kinase buffer. For the FGFR3 kinase assay using full-length FGFR3, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with vectors carrying C-terminally FLAG-tagged human wild-type or K650E-FGFR3. Ninety-six hours later, FGFR3 was immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody. Immunocomplexes were washed with FGFR3 kinase buffer, and the kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μm ATP and 150 ng of recombinant Frs2 (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan) in 40 μl of kinase buffer. Ras and Rap1 activation was determined using a Ras or the Rap-1 activation assay (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, active GTPase was purified from cell lysates using the agarose-bound glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 or Rap1-binding domain of Ral GDS and detected by WB. Myristoylated atypical PKC pseudosubstrate (N-myristoyl-SIYRRGARRWR KL) was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth, PA). Cells were treated with pseudosubstrate for 30 min, treated with 10 ng/ml FGF2 for 30 min, and analyzed for active Erk by WB. Vectors, Cell Transfection, and Cell Sorting—The pRK7-FGFR3 vector was made by cloning the full-length human wild-type or K650E-FGFR3 cDNA into the HindIII site of pRK7. The FLAG-tagged FGFR3 constructs were prepared by PCR amplification of pRK7-FGFR3 segment between the MluI site and the 3′ end using primers that added the FLAG tag and a BamHI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon (5′-CTGGAGTCCAACGCGTCCATGAGCTC-3′ and 5′-GTTGGGGATCCAGTGGCCCTTCACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCATCGTCCGCGAGCCCCCACTGC-3′). The PCR product was recloned into the pRK7 vector at the MluI and BamHI sites. Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For cell sorting, cells were co-transfected with a GFP-expressing vector (pCCEY) and pRK7-FGFR3 vector in a 1:3 ratio. Twenty-four hours later, the GFP-positive cells were isolated using a FACStar+ cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and plated. Bis I Inhibits FGF2-mediated Activation of Erk MAP Kinase in Chondrocytes—To determine whether PKC is involved in FGF signaling in chondrocytes, we asked whether the FGF2-mediated activation of Erk MAP kinase was sensitive to the chemical inhibition of PKC. We treated RCS chondrocytes with FGF2 alone or together with three different PKC inhibitors (Gö6983, Bis I, Gö6976) and determined their effect on the FGF2-mediated Erk activity. Fig. 1A shows that Bis I almost entirely abolished Erk activation at concentrations higher than 5 μm in contrast to Gö6983 or Gö6976 that only partially modulated the Erk activation. Since sustained Erk activation underlies the growth inhibitory effect of FGF signaling in chondrocytes (8Raucci A. Laplantine E. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1747-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Krejci P. Bryja V. Pachernik J. Hampl A. Pogue R. Mekikian P. Wilcox W.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of Bis I on long term FGF2-mediated Erk activation. Fig. 1B demonstrates that Bis I inhibits both short term and long term FGF2-mediated Erk activation in RCS cells. Similar data were obtained with human primary chondrocytes (Fig. 1C). The effect of Bis I on Erk activity is not direct since no inhibition of Erk activity was detected by kinase assay in the presence of up to 50 μm Bis I (Fig. 1D). Bis I Inhibits FGF2-mediated Activation of the Erk Pathway Upstream of Ras—Fig. 1 demonstrates that Bis I inhibits activation of Erk by FGF signaling upstream of Erk. We asked at which level Bis I targets the Erk module. FGF2 treatment led to activatory phosphorylation of both MEK and Raf-1, and this phosphorylation was abolished by Bis I (Fig. 2, A and B). In the following experiment, Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with FGF2 alone or in combination with Bis I and probed for its kinase activity using recombinant MEK1 as a substrate. Raf-1 kinase activity was inhibited by Bis I, thus confirming that Bis I targets the Erk module either at the level or upstream of Raf-1 (Fig. 2C). Next, we tested whether Bis I targets Raf-1 directly. Active Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from FGF2-treated cells and subjected to a kinase assay with Bis I added into the kinase reaction. No significant Raf-1 inhibition was detected in the presence of up to 50 μm Bis I (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Bis I inhibits the Erk module upstream of Raf-1. It is well established that FGF receptors (FGFR) activate the Erk module via Frs2-mediated recruitment of Grb2-Sos complexes that in turn activate Ras (33Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternative mode was described in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells whereby Frs2 recruits Crk-C3G complexes and activates Erk through Rap1 GTPase and B-Raf kinase (34Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether FGF signaling in RCS cells utilizes Ras or Rap1 for Erk activation. Although FGF2 triggered significant and prolonged Ras activity, a weak, if any, activation of Rap1 was detected (Fig. 3A). FGF2-mediated activation of Ras was abolished by Bis I (Fig. 3B). Bis I Does Not Inhibit FGFR3—Fig. 3B demonstrates that Bis I inhibits FGF2-mediated activation of the Erk pathway upstream of Ras. We asked whether Bis I inhibits FGFR3 kinase itself. First, we determined the FGF2- and Bis I-induced changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Frs2, which reflects FGFR3 activity. Fig. 4A shows that FGF2 treatment led to an increase of Frs2 tyrosine phosphorylation that was not inhibited by Bis I. However, a significant electrophoretic mobility shift of Frs2 was induced by FGF2 that was eliminated by Bis I (Fig. 4B). This shift appears to be caused by Erk-mediated phosphorylation since it was nearly eliminated by the MEK inhibitor U0126. The tyrosine phosphorylation status of Frs2 (Fig. 4A) represents an indirect method of monitoring the FGFR3 activity. Since we could only detect weak Frs2 tyrosine phosphorylation and Bis I is structurally similar to staurosporine (both staurosporine and its derivatives such as PKC412 inhibit FGFRs (35Chen J. Deangelo D.J. Kutok J.L. Williams I.R. Lee B.H. Wadleigh M. Duclos N. Cohen S. Adelsperger J. Okabe R. Coburn A. Galinsky I. Huntly B. Cohen P.S. Meyer T. Fabbro D. Roesel J. Banerji L. Griffin J.D. Xiao S. Fletcher J.A. Stone R.M. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14479-14484Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)), we considered the evidence in Fig. 4A insufficient to rule out the possibility that Bis I directly inhibits FGFR3. Although we routinely detected endogenous FGFR3 in RCS cells by WB, we failed to immunoprecipitate enough FGFR3 to monitor the levels of FGFR3 activity directly by WB with antibody recognizing Tyr-653/Tyr-654-phosphorylated FGFR or 4G10 phospho-tyrosine antibody (not shown). When transfected into the RCS cells, no transgenic FGFR3 was detected 72 h later. When FGFR3 was co-transfected with GFP-expressing vector and GFP-positive cells were isolated by cell sorting 24 h later, they showed poor attachment and no growth in contrast to cells transfected with GFP vector alone, which grew normally (not shown), thus demonstrating the inhibitory effect of FGFR3 overexpression on RCS growth. We therefore probed the Bis I inhibitory activity toward FGFR3 by a kinase assay utilizing the recombinant, kinase active intracellular domain of FGFR3 and Frs2, immunoprecipitated from RCS cells, as a substrate. Fig. 4C shows that in this system, Bis I did not significantly inhibit the Frs2 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by recombinant FGFR3. This contrasted with the FGFR-specific inhibitor SU5402 that completely inhibited Frs2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Next, we tested the ability of Bis I to inhibit the activity of full-length FGFR3. C-terminally FLAG-tagged wild type or constitutively active FGFR3 mutant (K650E) was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to a kinase assay with recombinant Frs2 as a substrate, and Bis I was added into the kinase reaction. Fig. 4D shows that Bis I did not inhibit FGFR3 activity at concentrations up to 20 μm, although partial inhibition was apparent at 50 μm. Bis I Prevents FGF2-induced Shp2 Association with Frs2 and Gab1 Adaptor Proteins—Fig. 4 shows that FGFR3 is not directly inhibited by Bis I concentrations sufficient to abolish FGF2-mediated activation of Erk pathway in cells, suggesting that Bis I inhibits the Erk pathway immediately upstream of Ras (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). To activate Ras, FGFRs phosphorylate several adaptor proteins such as Frs2, Gab1, Shc, and Shb, which recruit Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, complexed with Grb2 or Shp2-Grb2, to the site of FGFR activation (33Kouhara H.

FGF2 treatment led to stable formation of Frs2-Shp2-Grb2 and Gab1-Shp2-Grb2 complexes, whereas Shc recruited mostly Grb2 (Fig. 5A). No significant amounts of Grb2 or Shp2 associated with the Shb upon the FGF2 treatment (not shown). Next, we asked whether FGF2-triggered Shp2 and Grb2 binding to Frs2, Gab1, and Shc is sensitive to Bis I. Fig. 5B shows that Bis I impairs binding of both Shp2 and Grb2, although Shp2 binding appears to be affected to a greater extent. Atypical PKC Pseudosubstrate Inhibits FGF2-mediated Activation of the Erk Pathway—Although considered to be PKC-selective, Bis I may inhibit other kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, GSK-3, p70S6K, and MAPKAP-1β (39Hers I.

We therefore used inhibitors specific to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (H89; 1–10 μm), GSK-3 (GSK-3β inhibitor I; 1–10 μm), p70S6K (rapamycin; 1–20 nm), and MAPKAP-1β (Ro-31-8220; 1–10 μm) to evaluate their role in FGF2-mediated Erk activation. None of the compounds inhibited FGF2-mediated Erk activity (not shown), suggesting that Bis I abolishes FGF2-mediated Erk activation by inhibiting PKC. Next, we determined which PKC isoform is involved in FGF2-mediated Erk activation. At the protein level, RCS cells expressed PKCα, -γ, -δ, -ϵ, -λ, and -ζ (Fig. 6A). We first asked whether phorbol ester-responsive PKCs are involved in Erk activation by FGF2. Brief PMA treatment led to potent Erk activation that was completely inhibited by 5 μm of Gö6983 or Bis I, demonstrating the ability of PMA-responsive PKCs to activate Erk (Fig. 6B) (14Adams P.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Chronic PMA treatment led to down-regulation of PKCα, -γ, -δ, and -ϵ (42Szallasi Z. Kosa K. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Yuspa S.H. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar), and their absence was functionally confirmed by brief PMA treatment, which failed to activate Erk (Fig. 6, A and B). When cells with down-regulated PKCα, -γ, -δ, and -ϵ were treated with FGF2, they responded with the usual levels of Erk activation that remained sensitive to Bis I, suggesting that a PMA-unresponsive aPKC (PKCλ and/or PKCζ) is involved in FGF2-mediated Erk activation in RCS cells (Fig. 6, A and C). To challenge this hypothesis, we determined the effect of cell-permeable, aPKC-specific pseudosubstrate peptide (SIYRRGARRWRKL) on FGF2-mediated Erk activation. The pseudosubstrate suppresses PKC catalytic activity by blocking the substrate-binding site and thus can be used as an isoform-specific PKC inhibitor (43Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31130-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Treatment with PKCλ/ζ pseudosubstrate inhibited FGF2-mediated Erk activation in RCS cells (Fig. 6D). Although it is well established that FGF signaling inhibits chondrocyte growth, the molecular mechanism of this effect is not clearly defined. Considering the usual mitogenic outcome of FGF signaling, the effect of the FGF signal in chondrocytes appears to be unique. It was recently shown that the Ras/Erk pathway is a candidate for FGF-mediated growth arrest, and in contrast to most other cell types, the FGF stimulus elicits a remarkably prolonged Erk activation in chondrocytes (8Raucci A. Laplantine E. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1747-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Krejci P. Bryja V. Pachernik J. Hampl A. Pogue R. Mekikian P. Wilcox W.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This correlates with the known cellular responses to Erk, where transient activation appears to be crucial for mitogenic signaling of growth factors, but sustained activity frequently leads to growth arrest (44Roovers K. Assoian R.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Therefore, a part of the unique chondrocyte response to FGF may lie in their ability to maintain sustained Erk activity following the FGF stimulus. The molecular mechanism of this feature is unknown. The role of PKC in sustained or in constitutive activation of Erk in growth factor and oncogenic Ras signaling (26Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R.

We found that the PKC inhibitor Bis I abolishes FGF2-mediated activation of Erk in chondrocytes. Both short term and long term Erk activity were equally inhibited by Bis I with somewhat higher effectiveness than either FGFR-specific or MEK-specific inhibitors, suggesting a critical role for Bis I-inhibited molecule in both the initiation and the maintenance of Erk activation following FGF2 treatment (Figs. 1 and 4). Bis I inhibited FGF2-mediated MEK activity, demonstrating that it targets the Erk pathway upstream of MEK. It is well established that FGFRs activate the Erk pathway through phosphoryl"

The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors govern the environment dependent regulation of transcription. ECF σ factors have two domains σ2 and σ4 that recognize the -10 and -35 promoter elements. However, unlike the primary σ factor σA, the ECF σ factors lack σ3, a region that helps in the recognition of the extended -10 element and σ1.1, a domain involved in the autoinhibition of σA in the absence of core RNA polymerase. Mycobacterium tuberculosis σC is an ECF σ factor that is essential for the pathogenesis and virulence of M. tuberculosis in the mouse and guinea pig models of infection. However, unlike other ECF σ factors, σC does not appear to have a regulatory anti-σ factor located in the same operon. We also note that M. tuberculosis σC differs from the canonical ECF σ factors as it has an N-terminal domain comprising of 126 amino acids that precedes the σC2 and σC4 domains. In an effort to understand the regulatory mechanism of this protein, the crystal structures of the σC2 and σC4 domains of σC were determined. These promoter recognition domains are structurally similar to the corresponding domains of σA despite the low sequence similarity. Fluorescence experiments using the intrinsic tryptophan residues of σC2 as well as surface plasmon resonance measurements reveal that the σC2 and σC4 domains interact with each other. Mutational analysis suggests that the Pribnow box-binding region of σC2 is involved in this interdomain interaction. Interaction between the promoter recognition domains in M. tuberculosis σC are thus likely to regulate the activity of this protein even in the absence of an anti-σ factor. σ factors are transcriptional regulatory proteins that bind to the RNA polymerase and dictate gene expression.

The slow growing pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has only one ribosomal RNA operon. An efficient transcription mechanism is thus essential for the survival and pathogenecity of this bacillus. Although a third of the human population are carriers of this pathogen, only a few contract this disease. This bacillus can lie latent in the host for prolonged periods of time till a mycobacterial infection gets triggered, most often in the setting of decreased host immunity. Studies that help further our understanding of the latent phase of this bacillus are thus vital to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis and virulence in this organism. This ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in the hostile environmental conditions in the carrier is brought about by adaptability to rapidly changing environmental conditions. The survival mechanism is thus crucially dependent on efficient communication between the mechanism that senses the environment and the molecules that regulate transcription. The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) 3The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; ECF, extracytoplasmic function; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.3The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; ECF, extracytoplasmic function; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. that controls gene expression consists of five domains-two α subunits, one ω subunit and the β and β′ domains. The σ factor reversibly associates with the RNAP and provides the RNAP enzyme with the ability to recognize promoter regions on the DNA template. M. tuberculosis has a total of 13 σ factors: three primary σ factors and 10 extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors. Differences in the promoter specificity of these σ factors lead to differential gene expression (1.Helmann J.D. Adv. Microbial. Physiol. 2002; 46: 47-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 2.Waagmeester A. Thompson J. Reyrat J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 505-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The task of environment-dependent transcription modulation is performed by the ECF σ factors. Regulatory mechanisms, in turn, dictate which σ factors get activated to bind to the apo-RNAP and initiate transcription and which ones are not. This regulatory mechanism is coupled to a signal transduction system that senses the environment. The interplay between signal transduction and the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms allows the bacillus to respond to changes in the environment by synthesizing new proteins or down-regulating others. Studies on the transcription mechanism in Escherichia coli have shown that a σ factor directs promoter-specific transcription initiation by specific interactions between two hexamers of a consensus DNA sequence, the Pribnow box (-10 element) and the -35 element. The crystal structure and limited proteolysis experiments on the principal σ factor σA revealed a structural arrangement comprising of a series of domains connected by flexible linkers. The utility of this structural arrangement is borne out by the observation that substantial structural rearrangements take place in the σ factor during transcription initiation. Exposed surfaces of each of these domains were found to be important for RNAP binding (3.Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester-Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Interaction with the core RNAP has been demonstrated to structurally rearrange the σ factor into an active conformation in which the DNA-binding regions of σ2 and σ4 domains are exposed and appropriately positioned to recognize the -10 and -35 elements (3.Campbell E.A.

Two distinct types of mechanisms have been proposed to describe the regulation of the activity of the σ factors that belong to the σ70 family. Thus while autoinhibition by the N-terminal domain mediates the activity of the principal σ factor, σA, protein-protein interactions mediated by the anti- and anti-anti-σ factors control σ factor concentrations in the case of the ECF σ factors. Other regulatory mechanisms have been proposed wherein σ factor activity is controlled by stimulatory signals (such as the phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation processes controlled by the kinases and phosphatases) or mechanisms that can control the intracellular σ factor concentration by localizing it on the inner surface of the cell membrane. In the case of the E. coli σ factor σE (7.Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Baceriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) for example, many of the key regulators of σE activities (products of the rse genes) are co-transcribed with RpoE to form an operon: rpoE, rseA, rseB, and rseC. The protein RseA is an anti-σ factor for σE, whereas the periplasmic RseB protein enhances its activity. The activity of σE can also be regulated by cytoplasmic factors like guanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp). The signaling pathway employed in this process is distinct from the pathway that is activated upon extracytoplasmic stress (8.Costanzo A. Ades S.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Very little is known of these processes in mycobacteria, although recent reports indicate that work to delineate the regulatory mechanism of σE and another σE-like factor σH are presently in progress (9.Manganelli R. Dubnau E. Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Smith I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 10.Manganelli R. Voskuil M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Dubnau E. Gomez M. Smith I. Mol.

Darst S.A. Cell. 2002; 108: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the σE-RseA complex (4.Campbell E.A. Tupy J.L. Gruber T.M. Wang S. Sharp M.M. Gross C.A. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), appears to bind the free σ factor, thereby preventing its interaction with the core RNAP. The σ28/FlgM complex (6.Sorenson M.K. Ray S.S. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) on the other hand is different from the others in that FlgM can also form a ternary complex with the σ28 holoenzyme, thereby destabilizing the σ28/RNAP interaction. The modes of σ factor anti-σ factor interactions also differ between the σ70 and σ28 families. The anti-σ factor RseA is sandwiched between σE2 and σE4 domains of σE, whereas the FlgM protein wraps around the outside of σ28 and occludes the core RNAP-binding determinants on σ282 and σ284. M. tuberculosis has about 190 transcription regulators (13.Camus J.C. Pryor M.J. Medigue C. Cole S.T. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2967-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), which include 13 σ factors, 11 two-component systems, 5 unpaired response regulators, 11 protein kinases, and 140 other proteins. The resulting interaction among these proteins suggests a complex system of overlapping functions and redundancies (9.Manganelli R. Dubnau E. Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Smith I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Four σ factors, σA, σB, σC, and σE, of the 13 in M. tuberculosis are conserved in all the pathogenic mycobacteria. Only four σ factors in M. tuberculosis, σA, σC, σD, and σL, have been examined in detail for their roles in virulence and pathogenecity. The ECF σ factor σC is essential for lethality in mice but is not required for bacterial survival in this species (14.Sun R. Converse P.J. Ko C. Tyagi S. Morrison N.E. Bishai W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Based on genomic microarray data, σC was demonstrated to modulate the expression of several key virulence associated genes including hspX, senX3, and mtrA, a two-component sensor kinase, and a two-component response regulator. The phenotype of the ΔσC mutant of M. tuberculosis can thus persist in tissues but is attenuated in its ability to elicit lethal immunopathology (14.Sun R. Converse P.J. Ko C. Tyagi S. Morrison N.E. Bishai W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A recent report also suggests σC to be a key regulator of pathogenesis and adaptive survival in the lung and spleen of guinea pigs (15.Karls R.K. Guarner J. McMurray D.N. Birkness K.A. Quinn F.D. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These in vivo studies in two different animal models thus demonstrate the role ofσC in the pathogenesis and virulence of M. tuberculosis. Although σC does not appear to have an anti-σ factor located in the same operon, in silico analysis for the identification of potential interacting partners for σC suggested two proteins SirR and the un-annotated protein Rv0093c. However, the interaction between these proteins andσC could not be substantiated by experimental evidence. In this manuscript, we report the biochemical and structural analysis of the domain organization of σC. Despite the low sequence similarity between the promoter recognition domains of σC with the primary σ factor σA, we observe that the crystal structure of the two promoter recognition domains are conserved. Spectroscopic studies using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as well as surface plasmon resonance experiments suggest that the σC2 and σC4 domains interact in vitro. Interactions between the two promoter recognition domains of σC which involves the occlusion of the Pribnow box recognition region of σC2 suggests that substantial interdomain rearrangements would be needed to activate σC even in the absence of an anti σ factor. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of σC, and the σC2 and σC4 Domains−The details of the expression constructs used in this study are compiled in Table 1. After transforming the plasmid into BL21 (DE3) or Rosetta origami cells (Novagen, Inc.), the cells were grown in Luria broth with an antibiotic selection (100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol) to an A600 nm of 0.5–0.6. The cells were induced with 0.2 mm IPTG (final concentration). Subsequently, the growth temperature was lowered to 290 K, and cells were grown for further 12–18 h before they were spun down and stored at 193 K. Full-length σC (311 amino acids) was purified in denaturing conditions using 8 m urea. Refolding of the denatured protein was carried out in a stepwise fashion with five buffer changes (each lasting about 3–4 h) with decreasing concentration of urea. The recombinant proteins from the other three constructs were purified under native conditions as described earlier (16.Thakur K.G. Gopal B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 779-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) after the affinity chromatography step. The proteins were concentrated using membrane based centrifugal ultra filtration (Amicon). l-Arginine and l-glutamic acid were added to the final concentration of 50 mm each during the concentration step (17.Golovanov A.P. Hautbergue G.M. Wilson S.A. Lian L.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8933-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The purity of the samples was analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Both full-length σC as well as the σC4 domain have poor solubility and are very unstable. These proteins were freshly purified prior to each biochemical experiment. The molecular weights of the recombinant proteins were also verified by mass spectrometry on a MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Inc.) mass spectrometer.TABLE 1List of expression constructs used in the analysis of the domain organization of M. tuberculosis σCSerial no.ConstructRestriction sites used, 5′, 3′Construct size (amino acids)1pET15b-σC127–311aaNdeI, BamHI127–3112pET15b-σC2NheI, XhoI127–2383pET15b-σC4NdeI, BamHI243–3115pETduet1-σCEcoRI, HindIII1–3116pETduet-σC-Rv0093cEcoRI, HindIII; NdeI-XhoI127–311; 1–957pETduet-σC-SirREcoRI, HindIII; NdeI-KpnI127–311; 88–149 Open table in a new tab The Western blot analysis to determine the molecular weight of σC in situ was performed according to the standard procedure outlined in Molecular Cloning (18.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A8.52-A8.55Google Scholar). Cell free lysate of H37Rv was obtained from the TB vaccine testing and research material contract at the Colorado State University. The cell lysate and purified protein samples were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. A polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against σC127–311 (a smaller construct containing residues 127–311aa based on the annotated sequence of H37Rv) was used as the primary antibody for σC detection. Western blots were developed using the AEC (Sigma) substrate with horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Bangalore Genei Co.). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed using a PCR-based method (19.Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The primers GATAGGCGACGAACCGCGCCACGTCTTGCTGGG (for W164A) and CGATGGCCAGCAACGCAGTTCGGGCGCTGG (for the W203A point variant) were used. These mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fluorescence Spectroscopy−All fluorescence studies were performed on a JOBIN YVON FlouroMax-3 fluorimeter at room temperature. The fluorescence excitation was set at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm at a bandwidth of 1 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were set to 3 and 5 nm, respectively. Each spectrum is an average of five scans. The spectra were obtained at a protein concentration of ∼3 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Interactions between the σC2 and σC4 domains were monitored after the two protein samples were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 2 min prior to data acquisition. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments−Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore AB). All experiments were conducted at 25 °C. SPR experiments were performed with either the σC2 and σC4 domains immobilized onto carboxylated dextran chips (sensor chip CM5 from BIAcore AB) using the standard amine coupling procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Immobilization resulted in a change in the refractive index corresponding to 700 and 640 resonance units for σC2 and σC4 respectively. Binding and kinetic assays were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl at flow rate of 20 μl/min. The proteins were diluted in this buffer, and experiments were carried out at concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 200 μm. Freshly purified protein samples were used for these binding assays. Dissociation was initiated by replacing the analyte with buffer. The association and dissociation curves were monitored for 120 s. Sensograms were analyzed with BIAevaluation software version 2 (BIAcore AB). A 1:1 langmuir binding model was used to fit the curves. Model Building and Refinement of the Two Domains of σC− Crystallization conditions and data collection strategies have been reported previously (16.Thakur K.G. Gopal B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 779-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The data collection and refinement statistics for both the domains are reported in Table 2. The N- and C-terminal domains of E. coli σE (Protein Data Bank code 1OR7) were used as starting model(s) for molecular replacement. The sequence identity between σC2 and N-terminal σE is 23%, whereas that between the C-terminal σE and σC4 domain is 45%. Molecular replacement calculations were performed using the program PHASER (20.Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The solution for σC2 and σC4 had log likelihood gains of 71.52 and 489.97 with corresponding Z-scores of 5.21 and 15.53, respectively. There were two molecules in the asymmetric unit in the case of σC2 and three in the asymmetric unit for the σC4 domain. Both structures were refined using tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Iterated cycles of model building using Coot (21.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23040) Google Scholar) and refinement using Refmac (22.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Assuming that interacting proteins would show correlated expression levels under certain conditions, the correlation coefficients and t values (Student’s t test) between a given σ factor and the corresponding anti-σ pair were calculated in different conditions (7H9 medium (n = 4), BALB/c mice (n = 4), Scid mice (n = 4), stationary state (n = 6), low oxygen dormancy (n = 9) using following equations.rjk=(Σ(xij-X¯j)(xik-X¯k))/nσjσk=(Σ(xij-X¯j)×(xik-X¯k))/((Σ(xij-X¯j)2)(Σ(xjk-X¯k)2))1/2tjk=rjk(N-2)1/2/(1-rjk2)1/2 To predict all the interacting proteins/anti-σ factor(s) for σC, we examined all the transcription regulatory genes that are present in Myobacterium leprae (M. leprae has only four σ factors σA, σB, σC, and σE). An amino acid sequence based search was also performed to locate putative anti-σ factors on the basis of the sequence signature (HXXXCXXC) (27.Hahn M.Y. Raman S. Ananya M. Husson R.N. J.

The σC2 and σC4 domains are connected by a flexible ∼25-amino acid-long linker. Sequence-based prediction of low complexity regions (30.Priluski J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H.

Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) in this protein (Fig. 1A) suggests that the N-terminal domain preceding σC2 is largely unfolded. M. tuberculosis extra-cytoplasmic σC thus appears to be more primary σ factor-like in terms of the domain organization except that it lacks the region 3.2 that lies between the σC2 and σC4 domains and is involved in extended -10 promoter recognition. The structure-based sequence alignment of M. tuberculosis σC is shown in Fig. 2 (adapted from Ref. 2.Waagmeester A. Thompson J. Reyrat J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 505-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, M. leprae σC does not have this N-terminal region. Based on the sequence alignment and patterns of protease sensitivity, four expression constructs of σC were examined: the full-length σC, the smaller construct containing only the σC2 and σC4 domains, and the two independent domains σC2 and σC4 (Table 1 and Fig. 3). In a Western blot experiment using a cell-free lysate of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (obtained from the Tuberculosis Research Center, Colorado State University), the polyconal antibody raised against the shorter length construct (lacking the 126-amino acid polypeptide at the N terminus) recognized the full-length σC. σC is thus a 311-amino acid-long protein in both the laboratory (H37Rv) as well as the clinical (CDC1551) strains of M. tuberculosis (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Structure based sequence alignment of σ70 families of σ factors.

https://openalex.org/W1969525820,"The mitochondrion of sea urchin sperm is located at the base of the sperm head, and the flagellum extends from the mitochondrion for ∼40 μm. These sperm have two known flagellar, non-mitochondrial, enzymatic systems to rephosphorylate ADP. The first involves the phosphocreatine shuttle, where flagellar creatine kinase (Sp-CK) uses phosphocreatine to rephosphorylate ADP. The second system, studied in this report, is adenylate kinase (Sp-AK), which uses 2 ADP to make ATP + AMP. Cloning of Sp-AK shows that, like Sp-CK, Sp-AK has three catalytic domains. Sp-AK localizes along the entire flagellum, and most of it is tightly bound to the axoneme. Sp-AK activity and flagellar motility were studied using demembranated sperm. The specific Sp-AK inhibitor Ap5A blocks enzyme activity with an IC50 of 0.41 μm. In 1 mm ADP, flagella reactivate motility in 5 min; 1 μm Ap5A completely inhibits this reactivation. No inhibition of motility occurs in Ap5A when 1 mm ATP is added to the reactivation buffer. The pH optimum for Sp-AK is 7.7, an internal pH at which sperm are fully motile. The pH optimum for Sp-CK is 6.7, an internal pH at which sperm are immotile. In isolated, detergent-permeabilized flagella, assayed at pH 7.6, the Km for Sp-AK is 0.32 mm and the Vmax is 2.80 μm ATP formed/min/mg of protein. When assayed at pH 7.6, the Sp-CK Km is 0.25 mm and the Vmax 5.25. At the measured in vivo concentrations of ADP of 114 μm, at pH 7.6, the axonemal Sp-AK could contribute ∼31%, and Sp-CK 69%, of the total non-mitochondrial ATP synthesis associated with the demembranated axoneme. Thus, Sp-AK could contribute substantially to ATP synthesis utilized for motility. Alternatively, Sp-AK could function in the removal of ADP, which is a potent inhibitor of dynein ATPase.

Thus, Sp-AK could contribute substantially to ATP synthesis utilized for motility. Alternatively, Sp-AK could function in the removal of ADP, which is a potent inhibitor of dynein ATPase. Sea urchin sperm are excellent model cells for the continuing investigation of the molecular mechanism of flagellar motility (1Gibbons I.R. Cell Struct.

Their flagellum is ∼0.1–0.2-μm wide and 40–50-μm long and consists of the 9 + 2 arrangement of microtubule doublets of the axonemal complex covered by a plasma membrane. Methods for reactivating bending waves in nonionic detergent-demembranated flagella are well established, and the effects of ions, nucleotides, and inhibitors on the frequency and shape of the flagellar beat can be faithfully replicated in the demembranated flagella (3Gibbons I.R.

Proteomics. 2002; 1: 451-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Sperm motility is generated by flagellar bending waves, produced by microtubule sliding, the energy being supplied by the hydrolysis of ATP by axonemal dynein ATPase (2Inaba K. Zoolog. Sci. 2003; 20: 1043-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The microtubule sliding velocity (5Kamimura S. Takahashi K. Nature. 1981; 293: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and beat frequency are both dependent on Mg2+ ATP concentrations (6Okuno M. Brokaw C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 38: 105-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is critical for sperm to have efficient mechanisms to synthesize and deliver ATP down the entire flagellum. Studies of the maintenance of ATP concentrations in flagella are relevant to sperm physiology and also of general importance to all flagellated and ciliated eukaryotic cells. The mitochondrion of sea urchin sperm is located at the base of the sperm head, 40–50 μm from the distal tip of the flagellum. The mitochondrion is active in ATP synthesis, but how do concentrations of ATP remain high enough to support the dynein ATPase-driven bending waves along the entire flagellum? Two enzymatic mechanisms have been established, the phosphocreatine shuttle and, as detailed in this report, adenylate kinase (Sp-AK). The phosphocreatine shuttle (7Tombes R.M. Shapiro B.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8van Dorsten F.A. Wyss M. Wallimann T. Nicolay K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) depends on an unusual 145-kDa creatine kinase (Sp-CK) found in the flagellar plasma membrane and also bound to the axoneme (9Tombes R.M. Farr A. Shapiro B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Sp-CK uses high levels of phosphocreatine to rephosphorylate ADP to form ATP and creatine. Inhibition of Sp-CK by FDNB results in flagellar beating waves traveling only one-third of the way down the flagellum, roughly the distance that ATP could diffuse from the mitochondrion before being hydrolyzed by dynein (10Tombes R.M. Brokaw C.J. Shapiro B.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sp-CK is one of the major proteins of the flagellar plasma membrane; it exists in the plasma membrane in a myristoylated form, whereas a non-myristoylated form associates with the axoneme (11Quest A.F.

The reaction constant being ∼1 means that the reaction proceeds equally well in either direction and depends only on the balance among the three reactants (13Schoff P.K. Cheetham J. Lardy H.A. J.

Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Sci. 1973; 13: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study identified several flagellar proteins that become phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) when sea urchin sperm are treated with egg jelly. Tandem mass spectrometry identified one phosphoprotein as adenylate kinase (23Su Y.H. Chen S.H. Zhou H. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we present the primary structure of the sea urchin flagellar Sp-AK. Sp-AK could play roles in ATP regeneration for motility, creatine rephosphorylation, and in removing ADP, which is a potent inhibitor of dynein ATPase (6Okuno M. Brokaw C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 38: 105-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gametes—Sea urchin (S. purpuratus) gametes were spawned by injection of 0.5 m KCl into adults. Sperm was collected as undiluted semen and stored in ice. Cloning—The full-length sea urchin Sp-AK cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification using an S. purpuratus testis cDNA library in Lambda Zap II (Stratagene) as template. Oligonucleotide primers were designed from exact match sequences taken from the Sea Urchin Genome Project (www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/seaurchin/). The nucleotide sequences were found using the eight published peptide sequences of the ∼130-kDa phosphorylated Sp-AK (23Su Y.H. Chen S.H. Zhou H. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PCR reactions, cloning of PCR products, and DNA sequencing were performed using standard methods. Sequence and Structural Analysis—Alignments of the Sp-AK were done with BioEdit (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). Conserved domain structures were predicted using CD-Search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) and InterProScan (www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/). PKA phosphorylation sites were predicted using ScanSite (scansite.mit.edu/motifscan_seq.phtml). Topology prediction was done using SOSUI (sosui.proteome.bio.tuat.ac.jp/sosuiframe0.html). Helical wheel diagrams and Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots were performed on BioEdit (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html).

The GenBank™ accession number of Sp-AK is DQ447969. Production of Recombinant Sp-AK Protein and Antibodies—Amino-terminal His tags were attached to the full-length Sp-AK sequence and to the COOH-terminal sequence of residues 813–920 that were then expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) using the pET-15b vector (Novagen). E. coli were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 37 μg/ml chloramphenicol and expression induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested in 3 h by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the pellets were dissolved in 8 m urea, an equal volume of sample buffer added, and the tubes boiled for 3 min (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Expressed protein, representing the COOH terminus of Sp-AK, was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and used for commercial polyclonal antibody production (Orbigen, San Diego, CA). Immunoblotting—Isolation of sperm heads and flagella was done as described (25Vacquier V.D. Hirohashi N. Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 74: 523-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole sperm, isolated heads, and isolated flagella were dissolved in 10% SDS, an equal volume of 2× sample buffer added, and the tubes boiled for 3 min. The recombinant full-length Sp-AK protein and sperm proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS/PAGE gels and the gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by standard methods. The membranes were blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% v/v Tween 20) for 1 h. The blots were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with anti-Sp-AK antisera diluted in blocker. After washing in TBST, rabbit antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. After washing, blots were developed with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence—Sperm were electrostatically bound to protamine sulfate-coated coverslips and fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde/0.5% glutaraldehyde in seawater. After washing in TBST, coverslips were blocked in TBST containing 5% normal goat serum and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. To permeabilize the cells, the TBST contained 0.1% Tween 20. Coverslips were then incubated in various dilutions of anti-Sp-AK antisera or preimmune sera diluted in blocker. After five washes, coverslips were incubated for 1 h in a 1:400 dilution of Alexa-Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed twice in TBST, and mounted in 75% glycerol. Sp-AK and Sp-CK Activity Assays—Assays of Sp-AK enzymatic activity were performed as follows. The reaction was started by adding 6 μl of the pooled sucrose gradient fractions or 60 μl of demembranated sperm suspension to 900 μl of the motility reactivation solution containing 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 2% (w/v) polyethyleneglycol (MW 20,000), 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, and 2 mm ADP (26Nakano I.

To determine the effect of pH on Sp-AK and Sp-CK, enzyme activity was measured in the reactivating solution plus 1 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm ADP, and 2 mm erythro-9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)] adenine (EHNA) adjusted to various pH values. For measuring Km and Vmax values of Sp-AK and Sp-CK activity, the reaction mixtures containing 12 μl of demembranated isolated flagella suspension (11 μg of protein) and 882 μl of the reactivation solution, plus 2 mm ADP and 2 mm EHNA adjusted to pH 7.6, were preincubated for 10 min at 16 °C. For Sp-CK activity, the Sp-AK assay solution contained 15 mm phosphocreatine and 20 μm Ap5A. The reaction was started by adding 18 μl of 100 mm ADP. After incubating the mixture at 16 °C for 5 min, reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 70% (w/v) perchloric acid and the precipitated proteins removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were neutralized by adding 15 μl of 5 m K2CO3 and the tubes centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. ATP in this supernatant was measured using a coupled enzymatic assay with some modifications (7Tombes R.M. Shapiro B.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μl of sample was added to 500 μl of reaction mixture (38 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.6, 0.33 mm NADP, 6.66 mm MgCl2, 50 mm glucose, 462 milliunits/ml G6PDH, and 1.8 units/ml hexokinase). After incubating reactions at 23 °C, the change in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanied the production of NADPH was monitored. Sigma ATP was used as standard. ATPase Activity Assay—50 μl of sample was added to 950 μl of reaction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT). The ATPase reaction was started by adding 20 μl of 50 mm ATP and the reaction stopped at 10 min by the addition of 50 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. Phosphate liberated from ATP was measured by a colorimetric method (27Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction of Sp-AK from Sperm Flagella—Isolated sperm flagella were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in Buffer A (0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT) and extracted on ice for 30 min. This flagellar suspension was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the first supernatant (S1) and pellet (P1). After removing S1, the extraction procedure was repeated on the P1 pellet to obtain the second supernatant and pellet (S2 and P2) and the P2 pellet extracted and centrifuged a third time to yield the S3 and P3 fractions. The S1 was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the S100 supernatant and P100 pellet. The Sp-AK activities in each fraction were determined by enzymatic assay and immunoblotting. The P3 pellet of axonemes was further extracted to free the outer arm dynein from the axoneme. After washing the axonemes three times in Buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT), each wash being separated by a 10-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g, axonemes were resuspended in Buffer C (600 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT) and extracted for 30 min on ice to solubilize the outer arm dynein (28Tang W.J. Bell C.W. Sale W.S. Gibbons I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 508-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The axonemes, now without the outer arm dynein, were recovered by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. These axonemes were then washed with TED buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT) to remove outer arm dynein remnants. The 20,000 × g washed pellet was resuspended in TED buffer and dialyzed against TED buffer overnight at 4 °C. The resultant suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the supernatant (S-TED) and pellet (P-TED) fractions. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—1 ml of S-TED (2 mg of protein) was layered on top of 10 ml of a 5–20% sucrose gradient in TED buffer and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the tube bottom. Protein concentration and Sp-AK and ATPase activities were assayed on each fraction. Sedimentation coefficients were determined by parallel centrifugation of bovine thyroglobulin (19 s) and bovine catalase (11 s). Sp-AK active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B and aliquots stored at –80 °C. Immunodepletion—200 μl of the sucrose density gradient pooled fractions (∼50 μg of protein/ml) was incubated overnight with anti-Sp-AK antisera or preimmune sera at a 1:100 dilution. 20 μl of 50% Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads was then added to the mixture, which was incubated for 2 h. The bead-free supernatants were then used for enzyme assays and immunoblotting. The precipitated immunocomplexes, which were bound to the Protein A beads, were washed five times in Buffer B and the bound proteins solubilized by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Reactivation of Demembranated Sperm—Demembranation and reactivation of sperm was performed using a slight modification of published methods (26Nakano I. Kobayashi T. Yoshimura M. Shingyoji C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1627-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Undiluted sea urchin semen was suspended in artificial sea water (486 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl, 27 mm MgCl2, 29 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 8.0 with 1 N NaOH) and demembranated by addition of 15 vol of demembranating solution (0.04% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 45 s at 16 °C. The demembranated sperm suspension was diluted with 16 vol of reactivating solution (150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 2% (w/v) polyethyleneglycol (MW 20,000), and 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8). For observation of sperm motility, 1 mm ATP, ADP, or AMP (final concentration) was added to the reactivating solution. Microscopic Observation of Sperm—After the reactivated spermatozoa were incubated at 16 °C, 10 μl of each suspension was placed on a glass slide and covered with a 22 × 22-mm coverslip. As soon as the sample was prepared, movies were taken at 30 frames/s for 10 s with a digital camera mounted on a phase-contrast microscope. Sperm cells were scored as either motile or immotile. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of Sp-AK—Full-length Sp-AK protein has four methionines as potential translation start sites; none are in agreement with the eukaryotic translation start consensus motif (29Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, asterisks). In-frame stop codons occur 5′ to Met1. If this is the start of translation, the open reading frame is 2760 bp encoding a protein of 920 amino acids with a molecular mass of 99.1 kDa. Eight peptide sequences previously obtained from the 130-kDa protein are labeled P1-P8 (23Su Y.H. Chen S.H. Zhou H. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sp-AK has three catalytic domains, occupying residues Ile115-Val295, Ile426-Val598, and Phe736-Phe898 (Fig. 1A, dashed underlines). Three potential PKA sites are Ser99, Thr246, and Ser899 (Fig. 1A, arrowheads). Four P-loop motifs for binding ATP or GTP (30Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar) are at residues 120–128, 381–388, 431–439, and 740–748 (Fig. 1A, gray shade). Each catalytic domain has one P-loop, and the fourth P-loop is between catalytic domains 1 and 2. An exon-intron map, constructed by comparison of the Sp-AK cDNA to the sea urchin genome, shows 19 exons, the gene occupying 18,825 bp of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). All exons are found in one scaffold (GenBank™ accession number NW_678855). The Sp-AK cDNA structure with each exon numbered is shown in Fig. 1C. Exons 4–6, 13–15, and 17–18 encode the three catalytic domains. Residues 3–48, in exons 1–2, consist of a dimerization-anchoring domain for cAMP-dependent type II protein kinase regulatory subunit (31Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A helical wheel projection of residues 28–46 yields an amphipathic α-helix that could be involved in binding calmodulin or other proteins (32O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Both the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy profile algorithm and the SOSUI algorithm predict no transmembrane segments. Phylogenetic Analysis of AK Catalytic Domains of Various Species—The phylogenetic relationships of 24 catalytic domains of AK proteins were determined by constructing a neighbor-joining tree (Fig. 2). The tree shows that the three catalytic domains of Sp-AK are considerably divergent from each other. This is in contrast to the three catalytic domains of Chlamydomonas flagellar AK that are 98–99% identical to each other. Chlamydomonas and this sea urchin are the only flagellated cells known to date to have three catalytic (Cat) domains in an AK protein. The tree suggests that Sp-AK Cat 3 is basal to Cats 1 and 2. H. sapiens AK6 has a duplicated catalytic domain. Human AK6 Cat 1 is most similar to Sp-AK Cat 1, whereas Sp-AK Cat 2 is closest to C. elegans AK1. The percentages of amino acid sequence identity/similarity among the three Sp-AK Cat domains is: Cat 1 versus Cat 2, 38/55; Cat 1 versus Cat 3, 28/48; and Cat 2 versus Cat 3, 27/48. The three trypanosome flagellar AKs (21Ginger M.L. Ngazoa E.S. Pereira C.A. Pullen T.J. Kabiri M. Becker K. Gull K. Steverding D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11781-11789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) separate into their own clade. However, some low bootstrap values of <50% provide low support to this topology. Localization of Sp-AK—Rabbit antibody raised to the COOH-terminal end of Sp-AK reacted with a single protein of ∼130 kDa representing the bacterial-expressed full-length Sp-AK (Fig. 3, lane FL). The bacterial-expressed Sp-AK has the same relative mobility as the Sp-AK-reacting band in whole sperm (W), isolated sperm heads (H), and isolated flagella (F). At equal protein loads, strong signals from flagella (F) and weak signals from sperm heads (Fig. 3, lane H) were detected, showing that Sp-AK is most abundant in flagella. Immunofluorescence with either antisera shows that the Sp-AK localizes almost exclusively along the entire length of the flagellum (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Immunofluorescent localization of Sp-AK. A and C, phase contrast microscopic images. B and D, fluorescence images. Panels A and B show that preimmune serum does not react with sperm.

After three extractions of the pellets, separated by 20,000 × g centrifugations for 10 min, most of the Sp-AK remained in the pellet (Fig. 5A). The amount of Sp-AK enzymatic activity was measured in each fraction. 32% of Sp-AK activity was in the S1 fraction and 68% in the P1 pellet (Fig. 5B). Slight decreases of Sp-AK in the pellet occurred with each extraction. These results show that much of the Sp-AK is tightly associated with the axoneme. The P1 pellet was extracted by dialysis against TED buffer and the dialysate centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was then fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. After fractionation of the gradient, immunoblotting showed that Sp-AK was concentrated in fractions 13–23, with the peak fractions being 19 and 20 (apparent sedimentation coefficient ∼5 s; Fig. 6A). The Sp-AK enzyme activity was also highest in these fractions (Fig. 6B). Most of the ATPase activity, which is axonemal dynein ATPase, was detected in fractions 10–16. To exclude the ATPase activity from the Sp-AK, fractions 18–23 were pooled as the partially purified Sp-AK. To confirm that the ATP synthase activity in the pooled peak fractions was Sp-AK, the AK activity was immunodepleted by adding anti-Sp-AK or preimmune sera as a control. After incubation, immune complexes were sedimented using Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. After the beads settled, the supernatant Sp-AK enzyme activity was measured. 85% of total activity was depleted in the immune sera, whereas activity in the preimmune control was unchanged (Fig. 6C). Inhibition of Sp-AK by Ap5A—The effects of the AK-specific inhibitor Ap5A (33Lienhard G.E. Secemski II, J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined on the pooled gradient fractions. Less than 10 μm Ap5A does not inhibit pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, fructose 6-phosphate kinase, or creatine kinase (33Lienhard G.E. Secemski II, J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract F"
https://openalex.org/W2081715400,"The metzincin metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A, pappalysin-1) promotes cell growth by proteolytic cleavage of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 4 and 5, causing the release of bound insulin-like growth factors. PAPP-A binds an unknown cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, suggesting that it controls insulin-like growth factor signaling spatially. In human pregnancy, the majority of PAPP-A circulates as a disulfide-bonded complex with its inhibitor, the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP). Interestingly, Ser-62 of proMBP is substituted with a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain, possibly a heparan sulfate type, and the PAPP-A·proMBP complex is unable to bind to the cell surface. We show here that proMBP detaches surface-bound PAPP-A in a process that depends on the proMBP GAG and also on the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between PAPP-A and proMBP. Unlike what was expected, we demonstrate that the GAG of proMBP is not required for PAPP-A·proMBP complex formation and that proMBP residues His-137, Ser-178, Arg-179, and Asn-181 are important for the recognition of PAPP-A. Using a mouse model, we find that the half-life of circulating PAPP-A and proMBP in complex is severalfold higher than both of the uncomplexed proteins, further suggesting that the PAPP-A·proMBP complex is formed at the cell surface in vivo rather than in the circulation. Further supporting this, we show that formation of the PAPP-A·proMBP complex at the cell surface proceeds rapidly compared with the slow rate of complex formation in solution. Because both PAPP-A and proMBP are expressed ubiquitously, this model may be applicable to many tissues in which insulin-like growth factor bioavailability is locally regulated.

Overgaard M.T. Weyer K. Boldt H.B. Ebbesen P. Christiansen M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47225-47234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that proMBP detaches PAPP-A from the cell surface in a process that depends on GAG covalently bound to proMBP and requires the formation of intermolecular PAPP-A·proMBP disulfide bonds. Unlike what was expected, the recognition between PAPP-A and proMBP is not mediated by protein-GAG interactions. Rather, we identify proMBP residues His-137, Ser-178, Arg-179, and Asn-181 as part of a site responsible for the recognition of PAPP-A. The PAPP-A·proMBP complex is formed rapidly at the cell surface compared with the slow rate of complex formation in solution, indicating that the redox potential of the tissue microenvironment controls the process. Using a mouse model, we find that the half-life of the PAPP-A·proMBP complex is severalfold higher than the uncomplexed components. This further supports that the circulating PAPP-A·proMBP complex in human pregnancy is formed at the surface of cells within the placenta rather than in the circulation. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of proMBP cDNA was carried out by overlap extension PCR (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using proMBP cDNA contained in pcDNA3.1+ (pcDNA3.1-proMBP (15Overgaard M.T. Glerup S. Boldt H.B. Rodacker V. Olsen I.M. Christiansen M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Oxvig C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) as the template. Outer primers derived from pcDNA3.1+ were 5′-CCCCATTGACGCAAATGGGCGG-3′ (5′ end) and 5′-AGGAAAGGACAGTGGGAGTGG-3′ (3′ end). Internal primers with an overlap of ∼22 bp were used to generate mutated fragments that were digested with NheI/XhoI and swapped into the wild-type construct. PCRs were carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), and all constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using the QIAprep Spin kit (Qiagen). At least two independent clones of each construct were used for further analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (293tsA1609neo) (27DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and gentamicin (Invitrogen). Cells (4.5 × 106) were plated onto 6-cm culture dishes and transfected 18 h later by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (28Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of plasmid DNA. The cells were transfected with either a proMBP or a PAPP-A expression vector, and the medium was harvested 48 h post-transfection. In different experiments cells transfected with PAPP-A cDNA or co-transfected with both PAPP-A and proMBP cDNAs were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm EDTA 48 h post-transfection and analyzed by flow cytometry. All proMBP mutants expressed at a level of 10–20 μg/ml, similar to the level of wild-type proMBP, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (see below). In Vitro Formation of the PAPP-A·ProMBP Complex—PAPP-A·proMBP complex formation experiments were performed as described (15Overgaard M.T. Glerup S. Boldt H.B. Rodacker V. Olsen I.M. Christiansen M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Oxvig C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, culture medium from 293T cells transfected separately with PAPP-A or proMBP cDNAs were mixed to final concentrations of 20 nm PAPP-A and 200 nm proMBP. The proteins were incubated at 37 °C, and samples were taken out and frozen at defined time points between 0 and 48 h. Complex formation was quantitatively monitored by an ELISA specific for the complex (see below). The effect of GAGs on PAPP-A·proMBP complex formation was studied by the addition of 0 or 100 μg/ml heparan sulfate (16,500 g/mol), chondroitin sulfate (14,900 g/mol), or dermatan sulfate (17,800 g/mol) (gifts of Kristian Johansen, LEO Pharma) to the reaction mixtures. Increasing concentrations of NaCl were also added to the mixture to study the effect of increasing ionic strength on PAPP-A·proMBP complex formation. PAPP-A·proMBP complex formation was also studied using purified PAPP-A (variant E483A (29Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) and proMBP diluted to final concentrations of 20 and 200 nm, respectively, in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm CaCl2, pH 7.4. PAPP-A and proMBP were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a PAPP-A specific (mAb 234-5 (30Qin Q.P. Christiansen M. Oxvig C. Pettersson K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Koch C. Norgaard-Pedersen B.

Complex formation at the surface of cells was analyzed in 96-well culture plates (Nunc) with ∼60,000 cells/well. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with conditioned medium from cells expressing PAPP-A and incubated for 1 h on ice. The cells were washed 3 times with culture medium and subsequently incubated at 37 °C with conditioned medium from cells expressing proMBP or proMBP variants. Samples of culture medium were frozen at defined time points (0–16 h) and subjected to the complex-specific ELISA. The cells of each well were detached with 50 μl of PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl to measure surface-bound PAPP-A by ELISA. In other experiments complex formation was monitored using 20 nm PAPP-A and 100 nm proMBP without preincubation on ice and without washing the cells. ELISA—The concentrations of PAPP-A and proMBP were measured by sandwich ELISAs in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) using polyclonal rabbit anti-(PAPP-A·proMBP) (31Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for capture. Monoclonal antibodies against PAPP-A (PA-1A) or proMBP (PM-5A) 4V. Rodacker, M. Overgaard, K. Mortensen, H. Sperling-Petersen, and C. Oxvig, unpublished information. followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-(mouse IgG) (P0260, DAKO) were used for detection. The wells were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (PBST) and 1% bovine serum albumin. PBST was used for washing. To assure that the binding of monoclonal antibody PM-5A to the proMBP mutants was not altered as a result of the amino acid substitutions, the expression levels of proMBP mutants were also verified by ELISA using rabbit anti-(PAPP-A·proMBP) polyclonal antibody for capture and biotinylated rabbit anti-(PAPP-A·proMBP) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin (P0347, DAKO) for detection. The amount of PAPP-A·proMBP complex formed under different conditions was specifically measured as described (15Overgaard M.T. Glerup S. Boldt H.B. Rodacker V. Olsen I.M. Christiansen M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Oxvig C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, a PAPP-A-specific monoclonal antibody (PA-1A) was used as the catching antibody, and the PAPP-A·proMBP complex was detected with a biotinylated, proMBP-specific monoclonal antibody (PM-5A) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin. In this assay, sample dilution and washing after sample incubation were carried out using PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 supplemented with 800 mm NaCl to avoid non-covalent association. A dilution series of the PAPP-A·proMBP complex purified from pregnancy serum (31Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was used to establish standard curves. Western Blotting—Western blotting of wild-type proMBP and proMBP(S62A) was performed after separation by SDS-PAGE (10–20% Tris-glycine gels). After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked in 2% skimmed-milk powder diluted in 50 mm Tris, 500 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 9.0 (TST). After washing and equilibration in TST, the membrane was incubated with a PAPP-A-specific monoclonal (mAb 234-5) or polyclonal rabbit anti-(PAPP-A·proMBP), diluted to 1 or 2.5 μg/ml, respectively, in TST containing 2% skimmed-milk powder, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (P0217, DAKO) diluted in TST containing 2% skimmed-milk powder was done for 0.5 h at room temperature. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and images were captured with an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 1000. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Wild-type proMBP and selected mutants were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (see above). The purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and the purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm NaF, pH 7.4. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis (32Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 789-794PubMed Google Scholar). Three CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C for each protein on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. (Jasco Spectroscopic, Japan) using a polypeptide concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml and a cuvette of 2-mm path length. CD data were obtained in the range from 260 to 190 nm at a resolution of 1 nm using a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. The scan speed was 100 nm/min, and the response time was 1 s. To assess the stability of the wild-type and mutant proteins, temperature scans from 30 to 90 °C at intervals of 10 °C in the range from 240 to 200 nm were also carried out. Δϵ (expressed in millidegrees × cm-1 × m-1) were calculated on the basis of a mean molar mass of 110 g/mol/residue. Flow Cytometry—Transfected cells detached with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA were washed with cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum) and incubated on ice for 1 h with a PAPP-A-specific mAb (234-5) (10 μg/ml). After three washes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum, the cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After 3 washes, the cells were suspended in PBS and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC 500 MPL flow cytometer. In other experiments non-transfected cells were detached and incubated (1 h on ice) with culture medium containing PAPP-A (10 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of purified proMBP (100 μg/ml) before staining. Clearance of PAPP-A·ProMBP, PAPP-A, and ProMBP in Mice—Female inbred mice (C57BL/6Jbom, Taconic Ltd.) ∼9–10 weeks old were used. The mice were housed in plastic cages under pathogen-free conditions with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark schedule and fed standard chow (Altromin #1324, Lage, Germany) and water ad libitum. Purified human protein samples (5 μg/injection) were diluted in sterile-filtered PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. In the case of PAPP-A, a proteolytically inactive PAPP-A mutant, E483Q (29Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was used. Before tail vein injection of the sample, the animals were kept at a high ambient temperature to dilate the veins. A volume of 300 μl was slowly injected, and blood samples were collected at different time points (1–1440 min) after the injection. Blood samples (20–30 μl) were drawn from the retroorbital plexus into vials (Microvette CB 300 KE, Sarstedt, Germany), and the serum was subsequently obtained by sample centrifugation at 1000 × g and analyzed by ELISA. At the end of the experiment, animals were killed by cervical dislocation. The time course of clearance was analyzed in 10 mice for each protein (a maximum of five blood samples were drawn from each individual mouse) and averaged. Initial analysis revealed a biphasic clearance curve for PAPP-A·proMBP, PAPP-A, and proMBP, indicating that clearance can be analyzed by a two-compartment model described by the equation, C=C1e−k1t+C2e−k2t (Eq. 1) in which C is the percentage of injected protein remaining in circulation at a given time (t), k1 and k2 are the kinetic rate constants corresponding to the fast and slow phase, respectively, and C1 and C2 are the percentages of administered sample removed during the fast and slow phases of clearance (α- and β-phase), respectively. The values of k1, k2, C1, and C2 were derived for each clearance curve by fitting C versus t to Equation 1 using Sigmaplot 8.0. The half-lives (t1/2) of the α- and β-phase were defined as α-phase t1/2 = 0.693/k1 and β-phase t1/2 = 0.693/k2. In a similar experiment 8 female BALB/c mice (Taconic) 7–8 weeks old were used. The animal experiments were approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate. The ProMBP GAG Does Not Mediate Recognition between PAPP-A and ProMBP—In one model formation of the covalent proteinase-inhibitor complex between PAPP-A and proMBP (PAPP-A·proMBP) requires an initial interaction between the proMBP GAG chain and CCP-3 and -4 of PAPP-A (11Laursen L.S. Overgaard M.T. Weyer K. Boldt H.B. Ebbesen P. Christiansen M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47225-47234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the presence of heparan sulfate GAG (100 μg/ml) did not affect the formation of the covalent PAPP-A·proMBP complex (Fig. 1A). Similarly, we found that chondroitin or dermatan sulfate did not have any effect on complex formation (data not shown). In a different experiment the amount of PAPP-A·proMBP complex formed over time was similar for wild-type proMBP and proMBP(S62A), in which the single GAG-substituted residue of proMBP, Ser-62, is replaced with alanine (16Glerup S. Kloverpris S. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31509-31516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). This experiment was also carried out with purified proteins with similar results (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the recognition between PAPP-A and proMBP in the process of complex formation most likely does not depend on protein-GAG interactions. However, because increasing concentrations of salt inhibited PAPP-A·proMBP complex formation (Fig. 1D), other types of ionic interactions are likely to be important in the process. Mapping of ProMBP Residues Involved in the Recognition of PAPP-A— Several basic residues of insulinlike growth factor-binding proteins 4 and 5 are known to be important for PAPP-A substrate recognition (33Laursen L.S. Overgaard M.T. Nielsen C.G. Boldt H.B. Hopmann K.H. Conover C.A. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We, therefore, speculated that basic residues of the highly basic MBP domain of proMBP might be involved in the proteinase-inhibitor interaction between PAPP-A and proMBP. Thus, the rate of PAPP-A·proMBP complex formation for a set of proMBP mutants with all surface-exposed basic residues substituted individually or in pairs of two for alanine was compared with wild-type proMBP (Fig. 2, A and B). All mutants expressed at levels similar to wild-type proMBP, as measured by ELISA using polyclonal antibodies for capture and a proMBP-specific monoclonal antibody (PM-5A) for detection. The expression levels were verified using biotinylated polyclonal antibodies for detection, suggesting that the epitope of mAb PM-5A was not altered as a result of amino acid substitutions. Of the mutants, only proMBP(R179A) showed reduced complex formation (60%) compared with wild-type proMBP (Fig. 2B). Arg-179 is in proximity with His-137, Ser-178, and Asn-181 in the crystal structure of the MBP domain (34Swaminathan G.J. Weaver A.J. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Leonidas D.D. Gleich G.J. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26197-26203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and C). Accordingly, when these three residues were substituted individually by alanine, the ability to form the PAPP-A·proMBP complex was reduced by 50–60% (Fig. 2B). These mutants and wild-type proMBP migrated similarly in non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), and all showed similar CD spectra (Fig. 3B). In addition, temperature scans were performed from 30 to 90 °C in the range from 240 to 200 nm for both wild-type proMBP (Fig. 3C) and the proMBP mutants (data not shown). The wild-type and mutant proteins all showed similar gradual loss of secondary structure with increasing temperature, measured at 208 nm (Fig. 3D), further suggesting that the substitutions did not affect the stability of proMBP. In addition, all proteins were refolded after cooling from 90 °C, as the temperature scanning experiments could be largely reproduced for all proteins (data not shown). Therefore, the recognition of PAPP-A by proMBP is based on protein-protein interactions, and residues His-137, Ser-178, Arg-179, and Asn-181 are part of a PAPP-A recognition site of proMBP.FIGURE 3A, analysis of purified wild-type proMBP (lane 1), proMBP(R179A) (lane 2), proMBP(H137A) (lane 3), proMBP(S178A) (lane 4), and proMBP(N181A) (lane 5) by non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining"
https://openalex.org/W2089628652,"Upon agonist binding, the C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (C5aR) is rapidly phosphorylated on phosphorylation sites that are located within the C-terminal domain of the receptor. Previous studies suggested that C5aR phosphorylation proceeds in a hierarchical manner with serine 334 presenting a highly accessible priming site that controls subsequent phosphorylation at other positions. To better understand the dynamics of Ser-334 phosphorylation, we generated site-specific monoclonal antibodies that specifically react with phosphoserine 334. In differentiated U937 cells, which endogenously express C5aR, stimulation with low C5a concentrations resulted in a very rapid (t½ ∼ 20 s), albeit transient, receptor phosphorylation. Whole cell phosphorylation assays with specific inhibitors as well as in vitro phosphorylation assays with recombinant enzymes and peptide substrates revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-334 is regulated by protein kinase C-β and a calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatase. Surprisingly, at high concentrations (>10 nm) of C5a, the protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-334 was essentially blocked. This could be attributed to the even faster (t½ < 5 s) binding of β-arrestin to the receptor. Analysis of C5aR Ser/Ala mutants that possess a single intact serine residue either at position 334 or at neighboring positions 327, 332, or 338 revealed functional redundancy of C-terminal phosphorylation sites since all 4 serine residues could individually support C5aR internalization and desensitization. This study is among the first to analyze in a detailed manner, using a non-mutational approach, modifications of a defined phosphorylation site in a G protein-coupled receptor and to correlate these findings with functional parameters of receptor deactivation.

Biological activities of C5a are mediated via interaction with the C5a receptor (C5aR; CD88), a member of the subfamily of chemoattractant G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The C5aR is highly expressed on cells of myeloid origin such as neutrophils and monocytes and was also detected on non-myeloid cells of the lung and the liver (1.Werfel T. Oppermann M. Schulze M. Krieger G. Weber M. Götze O. Blood. 1992; 79: 152-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Zwirner J. Fayyazi A. Götze O. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Its expression can be induced on myelo-monocytic cell lines such as U937 or HL-60 by treatment with dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) (3.Barker M.D. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Burton D.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In these cells, C5a activates a wide range of biological responses that include directed cell migration, granular enzyme release, and activation of the respiratory burst. Many but not all of these processes require pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi2 protein activation of phospholipase C. This results in increases of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol production, an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations, and the activation of protein kinase C. The cellular response to C5a is rapidly diminished with continued agonist exposure by well established mechanisms (4.Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5.Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). According to a current model of GPCR desensitization, agonist-activated receptors are phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs) on serine and threonine residues that are located in the C terminus or intracellular loops of the receptor. Many GPCR are also substrates for second messenger-activated kinases (PKC or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)), which are activated downstream of the receptor. The phosphorylated receptors then firmly associate with β-arrestins, which precludes further G protein binding. In addition, β-arrestins interact directly (or indirectly via the β2-adaptin subunit of AP-2) with clathrin heavy chains and thereby target phosphorylated receptors to the endocytic machinery. In addition to terminating classical G protein signaling, β-arrestins can also initiate cellular signaling by acting as adaptor proteins that recruit tyrosine kinases and other proteins into signaling complexes with receptors (6.Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Apart from this simple paradigm, alternative mechanisms operate in the fine-tuning of GPCR responses. Evidence for this hypothesis derives from the observation that in many GPCR, there is no direct correlation between receptor phosphorylation, β-arrestin binding, desensitization, and internalization (7.Hüttenrauch F. Nitzki A. Lin F.T. Höning S. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30769-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8.Potter R.M. Maestas D.C. Cimino D.F. Prossnitz E.R. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5418-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This indicates that these adaptive mechanisms are regulated by different conformations or specific phosphorylation patterns of the GPCR C-terminal domain. Previous studies have established that agonist-activated C5aRs are phosphorylated on C-terminal serine residues by protein kinase C and an additional staurosporine-insensitive kinase (9.Ali H.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Among the six major serine phosphorylation sites on C5aR that were identified through receptor mutagenesis, serine 334 was found to be the single most important residue since ligand-induced C5aR phosphorylation was reduced by 50–60% in receptor mutants with alanine exchange of this particular serine (13.Christophe T. Rabiet M.J. Tardif M. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation was essentially lost if, in addition, the neighboring serine residues at positions 332 and/or 338 were mutated as well. From these findings, it was concluded that C5aR phosphorylation proceeds in a hierarchical manner with serine 334 presenting a highly accessible priming site that controls subsequent phosphorylation at other positions. In the present study, we investigate using site-specific phosphopeptide antibodies the kinetics of C5a-induced C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation in cells that express receptors at physiological levels. We identify protein kinases and phosphatases as well as adaptor proteins that together modulate the phosphorylation status at this particular site upon agonist stimulation. Using receptor mutants that lack all C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites except for Ser-334 (or 3 alternative adjacent serine residues), we provide further insight into regulatory mechanisms that determine C5aR desensitization and internalization. Materials−Most reagents have been reported (14.Pollok-Kopp B. Schwarze K. Baradari V.K. Oppermann M. J. Biol.

Synthetic C-terminal C5aR peptide RIC4 was supplied by Bernhard Schmidt (Department of Biochemistry II, Georg-August-University Göttingen). P12/1 and S5/1 anti-C5aR/CD88 mAb were from Serotec. Recombinant human C5a was generated as described previously (15.Rothermel E. Rolf O. Götze O. Zwirner J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase were from MBI Fermentas. pEF1/Myc-His A was from Invitrogen. Accu TaqDNA-polymerase and dibutyryl-cAMP were from Sigma. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin was from Pierce. PKC isozymes and PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide, rottlerin, and Gö6976 were from Calbiochem. LY333531 was kindly provided by Lilly Pharma. Cell Culture−U937 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in 80:20-10 medium (80 parts RPMI, 20 parts medium 199, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). To induce C5aR expression, cells were incubated in the presence of 1 mm Bt2cAMP for 3 days prior to the experiment. Rat basophilic leukemia cells that stably express wild-type C5aR together with CCR5 (RBL-CCR5·C5aR (16.Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)) or a C5aR/CCR5CT chimeric receptor were maintained in the same medium in the presence of 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin. Construction of Mutant Receptor−Using standard molecular cloning techniques, we engineered a chimeric receptor (C5aR/CCR5CT) comprising C5aR with its 25 C-terminal residues substituted by the 23 C-terminal residues of human CCR5. Thereby, a receptor was obtained in which four of a total of six essential phosphorylation sites were substituted by the homologous region of CCR5, including four critical serine phosphorylation sites. This chimera was generated from the vector C5aR-FLAG-pcDNA3 (12.Langkabel P. Zwirner J. Oppermann M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using a mutagenic 5′ primer containing a BamHI site and a 3′ oligonucleotide containing 69 bases corresponding to amino acids Glu-330–Leu-352 of CCR5 and a EcoRV site. After cleavage with BamHI and EcoRV, the PCR fragment was cloned into the vector pEF1/Myc-His A. C5aR variants with replacement of C-terminal serine residues at positions 314, 317, 327, 332, 334, and 338 by alanine in various combinations were generated with mutagenic 3′ oligonucleotides. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified PCR fragments was verified by sequencing. The resulting receptor constructs were stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells, as described before (17.Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). C5aR expression at the cell surface was quantitated by flow cytometry with anti-CD88 mAb S5/1. All functional assays were performed in two different cell clones per receptor mutant, in parallel, to exclude artifacts resulting from clonal variation. Generation of Phosphosite-specific Antibodies−A phosphopeptide (C(ε-aminocaproic acid)SVVRE(pS)K(pS)FTR (pS)TVDTMA) corresponding to 18 C-terminal amino acid residues of the human C5aR with phosphoserine (highlighted in boldface type) incorporated at the three C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites of this receptor were synthesized by standard solid phase methods and purified to >70% purity by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, and BALB/c mice were immunized with the resulting keyhole limpet hemocyanin-phosphopeptide conjugate at four monthly intervals. After the fusion of splenocytes with X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells, positive hybridoma clones were identified by differential ELISA reactivities toward phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated receptor peptides as well as by their binding of agonist activated C5aR as assessed by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting−U937 cells were washed once in serum-free 80:20 medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and stimulated for 2 min at 37 °C with 10 nm C5a or 200 nm PMA or left untreated. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (18.Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)) on ice. Cellular lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Receptors were immunoprecipitated by the incubation (2 h/4 °C) with 10 μg of anti-C5aR S5/1 and protein G-Sepharose. Receptors were dissociated under reducing conditions, electrophoresed, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with the monoclonal anti-pC5aR antibody 32-G1 followed by reaction with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Visualization was performed using ECL detection reagents. Afterward, blot membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-C5aR mAb P12/1. Functional Assays−To document C5a-induced changes in cytosolic calcium concentrations, RBL-C5aR cells were loaded with 1 μm Indo-1 AM for 25 min at 30 °C, washed twice with Krebs-Ringer phosphate containing 1 mm CaCl2, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. Measurement of calcium flux in individual cells was performed by flow cytometry on a LSR II (BD Biosciences). The argon laser was tuned to 357 nm to excite Indo-1, and emissions were collected simultaneously on linear scales at 405 and 485 nm with 20- and 22-nm band pass filters, respectively. The base-line fluorescence of unstimulated cells was collected before each cell stimulation. A sheath buffer of phosphate-buffered saline without glucose at pH 7.4 was used. Before fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were stimulated with 20 nm C5a for 3 min, and fluorescence was monitored after the addition of 1 mm CaCl2. The C5a-stimulated N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells was determined as described (19.Montz H. Fuhrmann A. Schulze M. Götze O. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 127: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Values were expressed as a percentage of total enzyme present in cells after lysis with 0.1% Triton X-100. Enzyme Immunoassay−The ligand-induced phosphorylation of C5aR was determined in differentiated U937 or in RBL-C5aR cells. Cells were stimulated for up to 30 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of C5a in 80:20 medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation (3 min; 150 × g), samples were placed on ice and incubated for 15 min with 900 μl of lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were applied directly into the wells of a microtiter plate pre-coated with the anti-C5aR mAb S5/1 as the capture antibody and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Phosphorylated C5a receptors were recognized by adding the biotinylated anti-pC5aR mAb 32-G1 (1 μg/ml; 2 h at room temperature) followed by 1 h incubation with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:4000 dilution) and 2.2-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) as substrate. To analyze the effect of PKC inhibitors on C5a-induced phosphorylation of C5aR·Ser-334, RBL-C5aR cells were pre-treated for 30 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of bisindolylmaleimide, rottlerin, LY333531, or Gö6976. Thereafter, cells were stimulated with 6 nm C5a for 1 min at 37 °C and lysed, and cell lysates were analyzed for C5aR phosphorylation as described above. In Vitro Phosphorylation of a C5aR Peptide by Recombinant PKC−Protein kinase C activity was assayed essentially as described (20.Ogita K. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (75 μl) contained 100 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2,20mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (sonicated vesicle suspension), 500 nm PMA, 200 μm CaCl2 (for PKC-α,-βI, -βII, and -γ), or 0.5 mm EGTA (for PKC-δ,-ε,-ζ, and -η) and 100 μm of a synthetic peptide comprising 45 amino acids (Ala-303–Val-350) of the C5aR C terminus (21.Oppermann M. Raedt U. Hebell T. Schmidt B. Zimmermann B. Götze O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3785-3794PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by the addition of human recombinant PKC isozymes (8 nm). After incubation for up to 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of EGTA (25 mm) and further diluted in coating buffer (50 mm carbonate, pH 10.6). Reaction mixtures were then directly coated on a microtiter plate, and phosphorylation was determined by the use of the pC5aR·Ser-334-specific mAb 32-G1 as described above. The assays were calibrated using a phosphorylated C5aR peptide as a standard protein. β-Arrestin Translocation Assay−The C5a-induced translocation of β-arrestin from the cytosol to the plasma membrane was performed as described previously (7.Hüttenrauch F. Nitzki A. Lin F.T. Höning S. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30769-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, Bt2cAMP-treated U937 cells or RBL-C5aR cells were stimulated with varying concentrations of C5a for up to 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were scraped into buffer A (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0), and the homogenates were loaded on a discontinuous gradient of 50, 35, and 20% sucrose in the same buffer. After centrifugation (160,000 × g; 2 h), the cytosolic and the membrane fraction were collected, and equivalent amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. β-Arrestins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-β-arrestin 1/2 mAb. Characterization of Anti-pC5aR·Ser-334 mAb 32-G1−To generate phosphosite-specific antibodies that specifically react with activated/phosphorylated C5aR, mice were immunized with a synthetic C5aR C-terminal phosphopeptide that contained phosphoserine instead of serine at position 334 and also at the neighboring phosphorylation sites Ser-332 and Ser-338. The mAb 32-G1 was chosen among several hybridoma clones that were derived from the fusion of splenocytes with myeloma cells and selectively reacted with the C5aR phosphopeptide but not with a non-phosphorylated version of the same peptide. To determine the epitope specificity of this mAb, we tested its binding to overlapping peptides (10- to 11-mers), which contained only one phosphoserine in the context of the C5aR C-terminal sequence. The mAb 32-G1 reacted specifically with a C5aR peptide that contained phosphoserine 334 (supplemental Fig. S1) and also reacted with C5aRs that were isolated from C5a-stimulated, transfected RBL-C5aR cells. It did not recognize a receptor mutant (C5aR-S–) with alanine replacement of all six C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites (not shown). Together, these findings show that 32-G1 binding to C5aR directly correlated with serine 334 phosphorylation. To test whether mAb 32-G1 also reacts with C5aR expressed at physiological levels in non-transfected cells, we stimulated promonocytic U937 cells with a membrane-permeable cAMP analogue (Bt2cAMP). This treatment induces a monocyte/macrophage-like phenotype and a concomitant increase in C5aR expression in these cells. As shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1), mAb 32-G1 reacted with a 40–45-kDa protein in differentiated and C5a-stimulated U937 cells. This protein corresponds to the phosphorylated C5aR monomer. When Bt2cAMP-U937 cells were treated with PMA, a potent PKC activator, the immunoreactivity of immunoprecipitated C5aR increased significantly. Reprobing of the immunoblot with a mAb (P12/1), which reacts with a C5aR N-terminal epitope in a phosphorylation-independent manner, confirmed receptor expression in Bt2cAMP-treated U937 cells. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, which inhibits Gαi-dependent signaling downstream of C5aR, prevented 32-G1 reactivity (not shown). Identification of PKC Isozymes Responsible for C5aR·Ser-334 Phosphorylation−Since PMA treatment induced C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation, we sought to identify PKC isozymes that are capable of phosphorylating this particular receptor site. To this end, we established an in vitro phosphorylation assay with a synthetic C5aR peptide substrate that encompasses Ser-334. Incubation of the peptide with different recombinant PKC isozymes revealed significant differences in Ser-334 phosphorylation. Although all conventional PKC isozymes (α, βI, βII, and γ) and PKC-δ phosphorylated the C5aR peptide in a time-dependent manner, it was not a substrate for atypical (PKC-ζ) and novel (PKC-ε,-η) isozymes (Fig. 2). The peptide phosphorylation assay allows us to identify protein kinases that potentially can phosphorylate C5aR·Ser-334, but it does not answer the question whether C5aR expressed in myeloid cells are also physiological substrates for these kinases. At least five different PKC isoforms are expressed in RBL-2H3 cells, including the Ca2+-dependent α and β and the Ca2+-independent δ, ε, and ζ isoforms (22.Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar expression profile was detected in normal human neutrophils, the major C5aR expressing leukocyte population in peripheral blood (23.Balasubramanian N. Advani S.H. Zingde S.M. Leuk. Res. 2002; 26: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKC inhibition abolishes agonist-induced C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation in whole cells, we tested the effects of various PKC inhibitors on C5a-stimulated receptor phosphorylation in RBL-C5aR cells. Pretreatment of cells with staurosporine, a broad spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases, suppressed C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 ∼ 95 nm; not shown). A similar inhibitory effect was observed when cells were treated with the general PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (IC50 ∼ 250 nm) or with Gö6976, a selective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC α and β isoforms (IC50 ∼ 820 nm) (Fig. 3). Notably, selective inhibition of PKC-βI and -βII isoforms with LY333531 also blocked C5a-induced Ser-334 phosphorylation at concentrations (IC50 ∼ 222 nm) that do not inhibit the activity of PKC α or δ isoforms. In contrast, treatment with the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin at micromolar concentrations did not significantly reduce Ser-334 phosphorylation. Taken together, this inhibitor profile is suggestive of a predominant role for PKC β isoforms in C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation in these cells. Inhibitor concentrations required for 50% inhibition of receptor phosphorylation in intact cells were higher than those reported to inhibit PKC activity in vitro and under experimental conditions of low ATP concentrations. Since kinase inhibitors used in this study were ATP-competitive, inhibitory effects of these compounds depend on the ATP concentrations in the assay, which in living cells are much higher. Together with the potential problem of limited cell permeability, this may explain why higher concentrations were required for efficient PKC inhibition. Characterization of Phosphatases Responsible for Ser-334 Dephosphorylation−Our earlier work on the regulation of CCR5, a related chemotactic leukocyte receptor, showed that PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation is tightly controlled by protein phosphatases that rapidly dephosphorylate ligand-activated receptors. To identify the phosphatase(s) responsible for C5aR·Ser-334 dephosphorylation, we examined the effect of calyculin A and okadaic acid, potent cell-permeable inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A, on C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in intact cells. Treatment with calyculin A (100 nm) for 15 min prior to C5a stimulation significantly, but not completely, retarded C5aR·Ser-334 dephosphorylation, whereas okadaic acid at concentrations (200 nm) that are efficacious in inhibiting dephosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (24.Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) had absolutely no effect on C5aR·Ser-334 (Fig. 4). Since both phosphatase inhibitors at low concentrations block protein phosphatase 2A, but only calyculin A in addition blocks protein phosphatase 1 (25.Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), our findings imply a role for protein phosphatase 1 in C5aR·Ser-334 dephosphorylation. Since calyculin A was only partially effective, another as yet ill-defined phosphatase may also participate in C5aR dephosphorylation. Kinetic Analysis of C5aR·Ser-334 Phosphorylation at Different Agonist Concentrations−Earlier studies on the regulation of C5aR by agonist-induced phosphorylation, which were based on 32P incorporation assays, revealed the presence of fast and slow migrating forms of the phosphorylated receptor in SDS-PAGE analysis (9.Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Naik N. Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In dose-response experiments, these forms were phosphorylated at low or high C5a concentrations, respectively. The electrophoretic shift that accompanies C5aR stimulation at higher agonist concentrations results most likely from GRK-mediated phosphorylation, whereas the faster migrating form corresponds to the PKC phosphorylated receptor (12.Langkabel P. Zwirner J. Oppermann M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that GRK- and PKC-mediated C5aR phosphorylation at different receptor sites proceeds with different kinetics and concentration dependences. The availability of a PKC site-specific mAb (32-G1) allowed us to test this hypothesis. Stimulation of Bt2cAMP-U937 cells with low concentrations (0.2 nm) of C5a resulted in the phosphorylation of C5aR·Ser-334, which was maximal after 30 s, and then the receptor was rapidly dephosphorylated within the next 2 min (Fig. 5). Treatment of cells with up to 6 nm C5a resulted in a dose-dependent increase in maximal levels of C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, at high concentrations (>20 nm C5a), the initial peak was markedly suppressed, and C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation was detectable only at much lower levels, albeit for prolonged periods of time. Inhibition of PKC-mediated C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation could be, in principle, due to impaired activity of the kinase at high concentrations of the agonist or reduced access of the kinase to its substrate. To discriminate between these possibilities, we analyzed C5aR phosphorylation in RBL cells that co-express C5aR together with CCR5, a related chemotactic receptor. We confirmed in transfected RBL-C5aR/CCR5 cells that C5aR·Ser-334 phosphorylation is inhibited after homologous receptor stimulation with C5a concentrations higher than 3 nm (Fig. 6A).

It inhibits its target aspartic proteinase through an unprecedented mechanism whereby residues 2–32 of the polypeptide adopt an amphipathic α-helical conformation upon contact with the active site of the enzyme. This potent inhibitor (Ki < 0.1 nm) appears to be specific for a single target proteinase, saccharopepsin. Mutagenesis of IA3 from S. cerevisiae and its ortholog from Saccharomyces castellii was coupled with quantitation of the interaction for each mutant polypeptide with saccharopepsin and closely related aspartic proteinases from Pichia pastoris and Aspergillus fumigatus. This identified the charged K18/D22 residues on the otherwise hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix as key selectivity-determining residues within the inhibitor and implicated certain residues within saccharopepsin as being potentially crucial. Mutation of these amino acids established Ala-213 as the dominant specificity-governing feature in the proteinase. The side chain of Ala-213 in conjunction with valine 26 of the inhibitor marshals Tyr-189 of the enzyme precisely into a position in which its side-chain hydroxyl is interconnected via a series of water-mediated contacts to the key K18/D22 residues of the inhibitor. This extensive hydrogen bond network also connects K18/D22 directly to the catalytic Asp-32 and Tyr-75 residues of the enzyme, thus deadlocking the inhibitor in position. In most other aspartic proteinases, the amino acid at position 213 is a larger hydrophobic residue that prohibits this precise juxtaposition of residues and eliminates these enzymes as targets of IA3.

Aspartic proteinases are widely distributed in nature and are involved in a variety of physiological processes and pathological conditions such as Alzheimer disease, cancer, hypertension, and AIDS (1Dunn B.M. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4431-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).

There is thus a need to understand the mechanism of action of the few inhibitors that do exist with a view to exploitation of their therapeutic potential. One such inhibitor is the IA3 polypeptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is a potent inhibitor (Ki < 10-10 m) of its target enzyme, the vacuolar proteinase from S. cerevisiae, known previously as proteinase A but which is now better denoted as saccharopepsin (2Winther J.R.

The hydrophilic face of the IA3 helix is oriented predominantly toward the solvent, whereas the face enclosed by the target enzyme is largely hydrophobic. Our previous biochemical and crystallographic investigations have revealed that the potency of the interaction of IA3 with saccharopepsin is mostly generated by the insertion of a series of hydrophobic amino acids into complementary hydrophobic pockets provided by the active site cleft of the enzyme (3Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Brownsey B.G. Bur D. Dunn B.M. Winther J.R. Gustchina A. Li M. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Kay J. J. Biol.

Within the IA3 inhibitory sequence of residues 2–34 (Fig. 1), these consist of (i) an N-terminal cluster of V8-X- X-I11-F12, 3For ease of understanding, residues in the inhibitor(s) are denoted by single-letter abbreviations, whereas proteinase residues are indicated in the three-letter code.3For ease of understanding, residues in the inhibitor(s) are denoted by single-letter abbreviations, whereas proteinase residues are indicated in the three-letter code. (ii) a C-terminal cluster of V26-X-X-A29-F30, and (iii) the leucine residue at position 19. This is found within the sequence K18-L19-X-X-D22, which also contributes, somewhat unexpectedly, two charged amino acids, K18 and D22, in an i, i + 4 pair, to the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helical inhibitor. The ε-NH+3 group of the K18 side chain is held in place through three hydrogen bonds, including one with the carboxyl group of Asp-32 from the enzyme and another with one of the carboxyl oxygens of the side chain of D22 (3Phylip L.H.

The other carboxyl oxygen of D22 is hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-75 contributed by the β-hairpin loop or “flap” that overlies the active site of the enzyme (4Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R.

Chem. 2006; 387: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Through this intricate network of strong hydrogen bonds, K18 and D22 are tightly linked to each other and to crucial residues (Asp-32 and Tyr-75) of the enzyme’s active site (3Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Brownsey B.G. Bur D. Dunn B.M. Winther J.R. Gustchina A. Li M. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Kay J. J. Biol.

However, since Asp-32 and Tyr-75 are totally conserved in the sequences of all active aspartic proteinases from eukaryotic sources, this arrangement cannot by itself account for the very high specificity observed in the interaction between IA3 and its cognate folding partner proteinase, saccharopepsin. Nevertheless, the K18 and D22 residues in the inhibitor were selected as the starting point for our investigations to identify the key features that facilitate this selective interaction because of their unusual positioning on the hydrophobic face of the helix, where they contribute little to the energetics of inhibitor binding. This was demonstrated recently by varying these residues considerably without diminishing the potency of the IA3 interaction with saccharopepsin at the standard pH of 4.7 employed throughout our studies (6Winterburn T.J. Wyatt D.M. Phylip L.H. Berry C. Bur D. Kay J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Their influence on selectivity was established initially by mutagenesis of these residues and determination of the resultant effects on the inhibition not only of saccharopepsin but also of two fungal vacuolar aspartic proteinases (from Pichia pastoris and Aspergillus fumigatus) that are closely related to saccharopepsin (sequence identity ∼75%). Inspection of x-ray structures of IA3-inhibited saccharopepsin (3Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Brownsey B.G. Bur D. Dunn B.M. Winther J.R. Gustchina A. Li M. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Kay J. J. Biol.

DNA Manipulation and Production of Recombinant Proteinases—Mutations were introduced by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (7Tigue N.J. Kay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26441-26446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) into the wild-type saccharopepsin sequence to generate clones encoding the Thr222Ala, Thr287Met/Pro288Gly, and Ala213Ile mutant proteinases. The respective forward (F) and reverse (R) primers used were as follows: 222F, GATACTGGTACTTCTTTGATTGCATTGCCATCAGGATTAGCTG; 222R, CAGCTAATCCTGATGGCAATGCAATCAAAGAAGTACCAGTATC; 287/288F, CTCCTGTATCTCTGCAATTATGGGAATGGATTTCCCAGAAC; 287/288R, GTTCTGGGAAATCCATTCCCATAATTGCAGAGATACAGGAG; 213F, GAATTGGAGAGCCATGGTGCCATAATCGATACTGGTACTTCTTTGATTA; 213R, TAATCAAAGAAGTACCAGTATCGATTATGGCACCATGGCTCTCCAATTC. Each mutant DNA, ligated into the BamHI-XbaI sites of pESC-URA3 (Stratagene) was transformed into S. cerevisiae cells deficient in wild-type saccharopepsin (8van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and expressed as described previously for the wild-type enzyme (3Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Brownsey B.G. Bur D.

Each mutant enzyme, as well as wild-type saccharopepsin, was purified from the respective conditioned medium, essentially as described previously for the wild-type enzyme (3Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Brownsey B.G. Bur D. Dunn B.M. Winther J.R. Gustchina A. Li M. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Kay J. J. Biol.

The gene encoding the proenzyme form of the vacuolar proteinase from P. pastoris does not contain any introns, so the coding sequence was amplified from P. pastoris genomic DNA by PCR using 5′-GTGATCAATGATATTTGACGGTACTACGATG-3′ and 5′-GGTCGACCTAAATAGACTTGGCTAAACCTAC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Following cloning into the vector used for wild-type saccharopepsin, expression was performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells deficient in saccharopepsin (8van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The recombinant Pichia proteinase was purified from the conditioned medium using the same protocol as that described previously for saccharopepsin (3Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Brownsey B.G. Bur D.

Sequencing (through 12 cycles of Edman degradation) of the recombinant Pichia proteinase gave Ala-Ser-His-Asp-Ala-Pro-Leu-Thr-Asn-Tyr-Leu-Asn∼, which corresponds precisely to that of the mature form of the proteinase predicted by the DNA sequence. A clone encoding the precursor of the vacuolar aspartic proteinase from A. fumigatus in the pPICZαA vector was a kind gift from Professor M. Monod (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland). This was expressed in P. pastoris cells as described in Ref. 9Reichard U. Cole G.T. Rüchel R. Monod M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, and the recombinant proteinase was purified to homogeneity from the culture medium by a slight modification of the protocol originally described (9Reichard U. Cole G.T. Rüchel R. Monod M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This was necessary to remove the yellow pigment that is produced in conditioned medium produced by P. pastoris cells. Briefly, this involved dialysis of the culture medium for 72 h against 10 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, followed by successive concentrations in a stirred cell concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) fitted with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane and then in a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience Sartorius Ltd., Epsom, UK) fitted with a 5-kDa cut-off membrane. The concentrate was subjected to successive chromatographies on Sephadex G-50 and a Resource Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) in the same formate buffer. Elution from the ion exchange column was achieved with a 0–50% gradient of the formate buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The purified Aspergillus enzyme was found to have microheterogeneity at its N terminus, as described in the original report on the production of this recombinant enzyme (9Reichard U. Cole G.T. Rüchel R. Monod M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DNA Manipulations and Production of Recombinant Inhibitors—Mutations were introduced, simultaneously where appropriate, at residues 18 and 22 to produce some mutant forms of S. cerevisiae IA3 (inhibitors 2–11, Tables 2 and 3), as described previously (6Winterburn T.J. Wyatt D.M. Phylip L.H. Berry C. Bur D. Kay J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) or overlapping PCR methods (7Tigue N.J. Kay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26441-26446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were used to introduce the mutations, using the primer pairs as detailed in supplemental Table 1. Other mutant inhibitors (inhibitors 16–18 described in Table 4 and 25–27 in Table 6) were produced by engineering a cassette version of the DNA encoding S. cerevisiae IA3. An unwanted SacI site near the 3′-end of the IA3 sequence was removed, and an NheI site was introduced as a silent mutation in the codons for Ala-34-Ser-35 (GCT AGT → GCT AGC) by (separate) site-directed mutageneses using QuikChange. Digestion with SacI/NheI enabled removal of the bases encoding wild-type residues 15–34. Replacement with appropriate pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides carrying the desired base changes enabled the mutations to be introduced; the oligonucleotide pairs used for these mutant forms of IA3 are shown in supplemental Table 1.TABLE 2Interaction of the vacuolar proteinases from S. cerevisiae (saccharopepsin), Pichia pastoris (PpPr), and Aspergillus fumigatus (AfPr) with recombinant wild-type S. cerevisiae IA3 and mutant forms containing hydrophobic residues at positions 18, 19, and 22 Inhibition constants were derived at the standard pH of 4.7 for all three enzymes and, additionally, at pH 3.1 for saccharopepsin.
