https://openalex.org/W2010971702,"We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m(-1)) and -690 Nm(-1), respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m(-1) and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = -2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of sigma(int) = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime."

Recent work indicates that the function of these elements in their environmental reservoirs may be very distinct from the ""weapon-shield"" role they play in clinical settings. Changes in natural ecosystems, including the release of large amounts of antimicrobials, might alter the population dynamics of microorganisms, including selection of resistance, with consequences for human health that are difficult to predict."
https://openalex.org/W2009741028,"Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) are two popular microscopy techniques that have evolved quite independently. CDI promises to reach resolutions below 10 nanometers, but the reconstruction procedures put stringent requirements on data quality and sample preparation. In contrast, STXM features straightforward data analysis, but its resolution is limited by the spot size on the specimen. We demonstrate a ptychographic imaging method that bridges the gap between CDI and STXM by measuring complete diffraction patterns at each point of a STXM scan. The high penetration power of x-rays in combination with the high spatial resolution will allow investigation of a wide range of complex mesoscopic life and material science specimens, such as embedded semiconductor devices or cellular networks."

https://openalex.org/W2048706341,"Cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (di-GMP) is a circular RNA dinucleotide that functions as a second messenger in diverse species of bacteria to trigger wide-ranging physiological changes, including cell differentiation, conversion between motile and biofilm lifestyles, and virulence gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which cyclic di-GMP regulates gene expression have remained a mystery. We found that cyclic di-GMP in many bacterial species is sensed by a riboswitch class in messenger RNA that controls the expression of genes involved in numerous fundamental cellular processes. A variety of cyclic di-GMP regulons are revealed, including some riboswitches associated with virulence gene expression, pilus formation, and flagellum biosynthesis. In addition, sequences matching the consensus for cyclic di-GMP riboswitches are present in the genome of a bacteriophage."

Central to neurobiological models of OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex, a neural region that facilitates behavioral flexibility after negative feedback (reversal learning). We identified abnormally reduced activation of several cortical regions, including the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, during reversal learning in OCD patients and their clinically unaffected close relatives, supporting the existence of an underlying previously undiscovered endophenotype for this disorder."

A stress corrosion crack was grown through a volume of sensitized austenitic stainless steel mapped with DCT and observed in situ by synchrotron tomography. Several sensitization-resistant crack-bridging boundaries were identified, and although they have special geometric properties, they are not the twin variant boundaries usually maximized during grain boundary engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2086367365,"Although many animals use the Earth’s magnetic field for orientation and navigation1,2, the precise biophysical mechanisms underlying magnetic sensing have been elusive. One theoretical model proposes that geomagnetic fields are perceived by chemical reactions involving specialized photoreceptors3. However, the specific photoreceptor involved in such magnetoreception has not been demonstrated conclusively in any animal. Here we show that the ultraviolet-A/blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry) is necessary for light-dependent magnetosensitive responses in Drosophila melanogaster. In a binary-choice behavioural assay for magnetosensitivity, wild-type flies show significant naive and trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum light (∼300–700 nm) but do not respond to the field when wavelengths in the Cry-sensitive, ultraviolet-A/blue-light part of the spectrum (<420 nm) are blocked. Notably, Cry-deficient cry0 and cryb flies do not show either naive or trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum light. Moreover, Cry-dependent magnetosensitivity does not require a functioning circadian clock. Our work provides, to our knowledge, the first genetic evidence for a Cry-based magnetosensitive system in any animal."
https://openalex.org/W2040080235,"When intracellular pathogens invade mammalian hosts, naïve CD8 + T cells differentiate into cytotoxic killers, which lyse infected target cells and secrete cytokines that activate intracellular microbicides. We show that CD8 + T cells deficient in the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) fail to differentiate into functional killers required for defense against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Instead, virus-specific CD8 + T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes differentiate into an interleukin-17–secreting lineage, reminiscent of the helper T cell fate that has been implicated in autoimmunity and extracellular microbial defense. Upon viral infection, mice with T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes develop a CD8 + T cell–dependent, progressive inflammatory and wasting syndrome characterized by multi-organ infiltration of neutrophils. T-bet and Eomes, thus, ensure that CD8 + T cells adopt an appropriate course of intracellular rather than extracellular destruction."
https://openalex.org/W1975284118,"The Hippo pathway in Drosophila controls the size and shape of organs. In the fly, activation of this pathway conveys growth-inhibitory signals and promotes apoptosis in epithelial cells. We “reconstituted” the Hippo pathway in a human epithelial cell line and showed that, in contrast to flies, the activation of this pathway results in anti-apoptotic signals. We have shown that in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the complex formation between transcriptional co-activators YAPs (Yes kinase-associated proteins) and Lats kinases requires the intact WW domains of YAPs, as well as intact Pro-Pro-AA-Tyr (where AA is any amino acid) motifs in Lats kinases. These kinases cooperate with the upstream Mst2 kinase to phosphorylate YAPs at Ser-127. Overexpression of YAP2 in HEK293 cells promoted apoptosis, whereas the Mst2/Lats1-induced phosphorylation of YAP partially rescued the cells from apoptotic death. Apoptotic signaling of YAP2 was mediated via stabilization of p73, which formed a complex with YAP2. All components of the Hippo pathway that we studied were localized in the cytoplasm, with the exception of YAP, which also localized in the nucleus. The localization of YAP2 in the nucleus was negatively controlled by the Lats1 kinase. Our apoptotic “readout” of the Hippo pathway in embryonic kidney cells represents a useful experimental system for the identification of the putative upstream receptor, membrane protein, or extracellular factor that initiates an entire signaling cascade and ultimately controls the size of organs.

Metazoans have evolved several well conserved signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and growth to create organs, and ultimately organisms, of reproducible size and shape (1Leevers S.J.

Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Flies with “loss-of-function” mutations in components of the Hpo pathway develop significantly overgrown organs. Conversely, activation of this pathway results in reduced proliferation of cells and increased sensitivity to developmentally regulated apoptosis (12Huang J. Wu S. Barrera J. Matthews K. Pan D. Cell. 2005; 122: 421-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Several proteins constitute the core of the Hpo pathway; these include a scaffolding protein, two serine/threonine kinases, and one transcriptional co-activator (13Edgar B.A. Cell. 2006; 124: 267-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The most well characterized upstream signaling component of the pathway is Salvador (Sav), a gene product that contains two protein-protein interaction modules known as WW domains (14Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and is believed to act as a scaffolding protein for Hpo and Warts (Wts) (15Tapon N. Harvey K.F.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Hpo is a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates Wts (17Udan R.S. Kango-Singh M. Nolo R. Tao C. Halder G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 18Harvey K.F. Pfleger C.M. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 2003; 114: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). At the amino-terminal portion of the protein, Wts has five PPXY motifs (where X represents any amino acid), which are binding sites to class I WW domains (19Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Hpo-activated Wts binds and phosphorylates Yki, subsequently preventing Yki from stimulating the transcription of diap1 and CycE genes, which ultimately results in reduced cell proliferation (12Huang J. Wu S. Barrera J. Matthews K. Pan D. Cell. 2005; 122: 421-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Wts, Hpo, and Sav are negative regulators of Yki, as the Yki overexpression phenotype resembles that of the functional loss of these three proteins (12Huang J. Wu S. Barrera J. Matthews K. Pan D. Cell. 2005; 122: 421-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 20Jia J. Zhang W. Wang B. Trinko R. Jiang J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The human orthologs of the Hpo pathway are well conserved (Fig. 1A). The most upstream is WW45 (WW domain-containing protein, 45-kDa molecular mass), the ortholog of Sav, which also contains two WW domains (15Tapon N. Harvey K.F. Bell D.W. Wahrer D.C. Schiripo T.A. Haber D.A. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 2002; 110: 467-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). From this point, the pathway bifurcates. The remaining downstream components of the Hpo pathway in humans are represented by two closely related paralogs. Mst1 and Mst2 (mammalian Ste20-like protein kinases) are the mammalian orthologs of Hpo and are closely related serine/threonine kinases known to phosphorylate large tumor suppressor kinases, Lats1 and Lats2 (two serine/threonine kinases that are orthologs of Wts) (21Graves J.D.

Cell. 2003; 114: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Similar to Wts, Lats1 and Lats2 have PPXY sequence motifs at their amino-terminal regions. The human ortholog of Drosophila Yki, YAP, also exists as two splice isoforms: YAP1, which contains one WW domain, and YAP2, which contains two WW domains (28Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33334-33341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). YAP is a transcriptional co-activator in which function depends on the presence of an intact WW domain(s) (29Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We decided to study the YAP signaling function in the context of the Hpo pathway in human cells for several reasons. The first thing to catch our attention was the apparent paradox of YAP functioning either as an oncogene (31Zender L. Spector M.S. Xue W. Flemming P. Cordon-Cardo C. Silke J. Fan S.T. Luk J.M.

Secondly, the Hpo pathway is an ideal pathway for studying signaling mediated by WW domains because all components of the main pathway contain either WW domains or their cognate ligand motifs, PPXY (14Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 40Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) or PPXF (41Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Thirdly, the protein module known as the WW domain and its founding protein, YAP, are the main focus of research in our laboratory. Using our expertise and reagents, we have concentrated on the critical role of the WW domain in mediating multiple, yet specific protein-protein interactions that occur in the Hpo pathway. We have shown that in the human epithelial cell line HEK293, the complex formation of YAP1 and YAP2 with Lats1 and Lats2 requires intact WW domain(s) in YAPs as well as intact PPXY motifs in Lats kinases. These kinases cooperate with the Mst2 kinase to phosphorylate YAP at Ser-127. Overexpression of YAP2 in HEK293 cells promotes apoptosis of HEK293 cells, whereas the Mst2/Lats1-induced phosphorylation of YAP partially rescues cells from apoptosis. The apoptotic signaling of YAP2 is mediated via stabilization of p73, which forms a complex with both of the WW domains of YAP2. Our data provide evidence of the proapoptotic function of YAP and contradict that of Yki, the fly homolog of YAP, which has been shown to act as an oncogene (12Huang J. Wu S. Barrera J. Matthews K. Pan D. Cell. 2005; 122: 421-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—The KpnI-XbaI fragments were excised from p2xFlag-CMV2 YAP2s (wild type (WT), first WW mutant, second WW mutant (29Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33334-33341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar)) and were ligated into the pcDNA4HIS-MAX vector (Invitrogen), pcDNA4/TO/myc-His vector (Invitrogen), pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech), and pDsRed-Monomer-C1 vector (Clontech). All mutants were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR was performed to amplify the cDNA of Lats1 using three primer sets: 5′-agaagaagaggtaccaatgaagaggagtgaaaagccagaaggatatag-3′; 5′-aacattttcataactcttttcactctcatc-3′ and 5′-cccatctgttcctccatacgagtcaatcag-3′; 5′-gcgtgcagctctccgctctaatggcttcag-3′ and 5′-tccacggcaagatagcatggatttcagtaa-3′; 5′-agaagaagatctagaaacatatactagatcgcgatttttaatctctg-3′. The amplified fragments were inserted into p2xFlag-CMV2 vector using KpnI, HindIII, BamHI, and XbaI sites to generate full-length Lats1. The resulting full-length Lats1 was also inserted into pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) using KpnI-SmaI sites. The deletion mutant of Lats1 that encodes the amino-terminal portion of Lats1 was constructed using the HindIII site. pME18SFL-WW45 and pcDNA3-FLAG-Lats2 were kind gifts from Dr. Sumio Sugano and Dr. Tadashi Yamamoto, respectively (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo). pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Mst2 WT and D164A mutant were from Dr. Herman Sillje (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). p2xFlag-CMV2 WW45 was constructed by recloning the cDNA from pME18SFL-WW45. Antibodies—HA antibody (Y-11), Lats1 antibody (N-18), p73 antibody (C-17), and cyclin E antibody (H-145) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Phospho-YAP (Ser-127) antibody was from Cell Signaling. GAPDH antibody was from Abcam. Active caspase-3 antibody and FLAG-M2 antibody were from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody against human YAP was generated in rabbits. The animals were injected with purified antigen that contained GST fused to amino acids 302–450 of human YAP1 (GenBank NP 006097 28) expressed in bacteria using pGEX-2TK vector. GST-YAP fusion protein was purified to homogeneity using glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. Immune sera were partially depleted of antibodies reacting with GST by affinity chromatography on GST-Sepharose. The sera were then affinity-purified on GST-YAP antigen coupled to Sepharose, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline solution (42Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar). The high titer of the preparation was represented by positive Western blotting data obtained at a 1:20,000 dilution of the antibody. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors that encoded the protein of interest using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 24 h later, cells were lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.45), 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). For the immunoprecipitation of YAP, protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was incubated with anti-YAP antibody or control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by the addition of HEK293 cell lysates. The immunoprecipitates were washed with the modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Establishment of Cell Lines That Express YAP in an Inducible System—HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA6/TR vector (Invitrogen), which encodes the Tet repressor under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells that failed to express this repressor were removed by adding blasticidin to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After the selection, cells were transfected with YAP cDNAs that were cloned into pcDNA4/TO/myc-His vector (Invitrogen). Selection was performed again by adding both blasticidin (5 μg/ml) and zeocin (400 μg/ml). Single-cell isolation was never performed when cells were selected. After the establishment of the cell lines, the concentration of zeocin was reduced to 200 μg/ml, and that of blasticidin remained at 5 μg/ml. Tetracycline was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml to induce the expression of YAPs. The same protocol was used for NIH3T3 cells, except higher concentrations of blasticidin (10 μg/ml) were used in the selection of transformants. Cell Counting Assay—293 cells were distributed in DMEM containing 1% FBS, blasticidin (5 μg/ml), and zeocin (200 μg/ml) at an initial density of about 2–3%. 12 h later, tetracycline (1 μg/ml) was added to the medium to induce the expression of YAPs. 96 h later, floating cells were removed, and attached cells were trypsinized and counted. For NIH3T3 cells, more FBS and blasticidin were added to the medium up to 2.5% and 10 μg/ml, respectively. RNAi Treatment—The RNAi oligos for p73 and YAP were purchased from Dharmacon and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Luciferase-specific RNAi oligo was used as a control. The target sequence for p73 is CCAUCCUGUACAACUUCAUGU. HEK293 cells that express YAP2 WT in an inducible system or normal HEK293 cells were plated at ∼25% confluency. Transfections of the RNAi oligos were conducted by using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 48 h, and the amount of endogenous p73 and YAP was determined by Western blotting. YAP Binds Preferentially to Both Lats1 and Lats2—Because all components of the Hpo pathway in human contain either a PPXY/PPXF or cognate WW domain, the potential exists for multicomponent complexes. To determine whether WW45, Mst2, Lats1, and Lats2 interact physically with YAP, a co-precipitation assay was performed. Each of the four proteins was fused to a FLAG tag and transiently co-transfected with YAP2 into HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation using FLAG antibody was performed prior to immunoblotting with YAP antibody (Fig. 1B). As expected, YAP2 was co-precipitated with Lats1 and Lats2. No signal was seen for WW45. A weak and somewhat diffused band of YAP immunoreactivity was visible in the Mst2 lane. Similar results were obtained when YAP1 isoform was substituted for YAP2 (data not shown). The association between YAP and Lats1 was also detected by testing endogenous proteins (Fig. 1C). Binding between Lats1 and YAP2 Requires Intact PPXY Motifs and WW Domains—Because Lats1 contains PPXY motifs and YAP2 contains WW domains, we hypothesized that the Lats1-YAP2 interaction is mediated by a PPXY-WW domain complex. To test this hypothesis, we mutated two PPXY sequences in Lats1 (first, PPXY amino acids 373–376, and second, PPXY amino acids 556–559) by substituting the terminal Tyr for Ala. Such a mutation has been known to abrogate binding to WW domains (29Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33334-33341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 43Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The mutants of the PPXY cores (named PY1* and PY2*) and double mutant (PY1*&2*) were constructed. All three mutants, as well as Lats1 WY, were fused to FLAG tags and transiently co-expressed with YAP2 in HEK293 cells followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 1D). Lats1 WT bound strongly to YAP2 (Fig. 1D, upper panel). As anticipated, binding became weaker when either of the single mutants (PY1* or PY2*) was analyzed. When both PPXY motifs in Lats1 were mutated (PY1* and PY2*), the complex with YAP2 was abrogated. These data suggest that both PPXY sequences in Lats1 are necessary for full-strength association with YAP2. We then asked whether either one or both WW domains in YAP2 mediate the complex with Lats1. To test this query, point mutations were introduced into the WW domains of YAP2. Two highly conserved amino acids in each of the two WW domains, the second signature Trp and the carboxyl-terminal Pro, were mutated to Ala. The WQDP sequence of amino acids 199–202 in the first WW domain of YAP2 was changed to AQDA, whereas the WLDP sequence of amino acids 258–261 in the second WW domain of YAP2 was changed to ALDA. Such a substitution in WW domains renders the mutated domains inactive in terms of ligand binding (29Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33334-33341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The mutants were named 1st WW* and 2nd WW*, respectively. A double mutant was named 1&2 WW*. All three YAP2 mutants and the WT were co-transfected with FLAG-Lats1 into HEK293 cells followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). Relatively strong binding was detected in the case of WT YAP2 (Fig. 1E, upper panel); however, this binding was weakened when the first WW domain of YAP2 was mutated. The second WW domain mutant seemed to have no influence on binding. Finally, when both WW domains of YAP2 were mutated, the binding was barely detectable. Similar results were obtained for Lats2 (data not shown). These results suggest that both WW domains in YAP2 play a crucial role in binding to Lats1 and Lats2 and that the first WW domain plays a more dominant role in the complex. Interestingly, although the first WW domain of YAP2 corresponds to the only WW domain of YAP1, the binding ability of YAP1 to Lats1 and Lats2 was abrogated when its WW domain was mutated (data not shown). In sum, the results presented in Fig. 1, D and E, suggest that the binding between YAP2 and Lats1 (Lats2) is mediated by the WW domains of YAP2 and the PPXY motifs of Lats1 (Lats2). Lats1 and Lats2 Cooperate with Mst2 to Phosphorylate YAP—Because Drosophila Wts interacts with and phosphorylates YKI, we decided to investigate whether Lats1 and Lats2 phosphorylate YAP in mammalian cells. We employed a gel shift assay, to detect YAP phosphorylation. (For the analysis of phosphorylation sites we used YAP1 because of the battery of mutants that were available in our laboratory.) The band of YAP1 was shifted upward when Mst2 and Lats1 were transfected together (Fig. 2A, upper panel, compare third and first lanes). This mobility shift was abrogated by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2A, fourth lane), which suggests that this shift is due to protein phosphorylation. A small difference between the first and second lanes (Fig. 2A) in terms of shift of YAP1 implies that there are endogenous kinases that phosphorylate YAP1 in HEK293 cells. To confirm that Lats1 is the genuine kinase that phosphorylates YAP1, YAP1 together with various combinations of Mst2, Lats1, and Lats2 was transfected into HEK293 cells. The cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by probing with YAP antibody (Fig. 2C, upper panel). YAP1 and vector alone were co-transfected and used as a control (Fig. 2C, upper panel, first lane). No shift was detected in the presence of Lats1 alone or Mst2 alone (Fig. 2C, upper panel, second and third lanes), yet when both Lats1 and Mst2 were present, the band of YAP1 shifted slightly upward (Fig. 2C, upper panel, fourth lane) suggesting that YAP1 is phosphorylated when both Lats1 and Mst2 are present. Mst2 kinase-dead mutant (D164A) could not shift the band of YAP1 when co-transfected with Lats1 (Fig. 2C, upper panel, fifth lane). This result confirms a previous observation showing that the kinase activity of Lats1 is enhanced when Mst2 phosphorylates Lats1 (44Chan E.H. Nousiainen M. Chalamalasetty R.B. Schafer A. Nigg E.A. Sillje H.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal portion of Lats1 (amino acids 1–587), which lacks the kinase catalytic region but still contains two PPXY sequences, was also not able to shift the band of YAP1 (Fig. 2C, upper panel, sixth lane). This finding further suggested that the kinase activity of Lats1 is indispensable for shifting the protein band of YAP1 upward, implying phosphorylation of YAP1. Lats2 exhibits activity similar to that of Lats1, as Lats2 can be substituted for Lats1 (Fig. 2C, upper panel, seventh lane). These results suggest that Mst2 kinase activates Lats1 or Lats2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate YAP1. Ser-127 in YAP1 Is the Target Site Phosphorylated by Lats1—YAP1 is likely to be phosphorylated by activated Lats1 and Lats2. We evaluated the potential phosphorylation sites of YAP1 with the help of the Netphos 2.0 program (Technical University of Denmark). Ten candidate sites of phosphorylation by serine kinases were identified within the YAP1 sequence based on a relative score given by the program. In addition, we included Ser-127, a site that was previously shown to be a target of Akt kinase (45Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and Thr-110, which together with Ser-109, were reported as phosphorylation sites of YAP isolated from the nuclei of HeLa cells (46Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Villen J. Li J. Cohn M.A. Cantley L.C. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12130-12135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). These 12 sites were individually mutated to alanine (Fig. 2B). Each of the 12 YAP1 mutants was transfected into HEK293 cells together with either control vector or FLAG-Lats1 and FLAG-Mst2. Shift assay was performed as shown in Fig. 2A. With the exception of S127A, every mutant was still phosphorylated by Lats1 and Mst2 (data not shown). We investigated whether Ser-127 was phosphorylated (Fig. 2C, middle panel) and found that strong signals were detected when YAP1 was transfected with Mst2 and Lats1 (Lats2). These data correlated with the results of the mobility shift assay. Furthermore, the protein band of YAP1 S127A mutant no longer shifted upward even though it was co-transfected with FLAG-Lats1 and FLAG-Mst2 (Fig. 2D). This suggests that Ser-127 is a common phosphorylation site for Lats1 and Akt kinases. In Fig. 2, we used YAP1 to conduct a gel shift assay. The YAP2 protein also has a Ser-127 site, and the protein band was shifted upward as YAP1 was in the presence of Lats1 and Mst2 (data not shown). In our experimental setting, we could not confirm Ser-109 and Thr-110 of YAP1 as sites phosphorylated by Lats1 kinase. Recent in vitro studies have shown that Lats1 kinase can phosphorylate YAP on several serine residues in addition to Ser-127 (47Hao Y. Chun A. Cheung K. Rashidi B. Yang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5496-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar).

Moreover, several hypotheses suggest that the FEF can only modulate early visual areas in the presence of a visual stimulus. To test for bottom-up gating of frontal signals, we microstimulated subregions in the FEF of two monkeys and measured the effects throughout the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The activity of higher-order visual areas was strongly modulated by FEF stimulation, independent of visual stimulation. In contrast, FEF stimulation induced a topographically specific pattern of enhancement and suppression in early visual areas, but only in the presence of a visual stimulus. Modulation strength depended on stimulus contrast and on the presence of distractors. We conclude that bottom-up activation is needed to enable top-down modulation of early visual cortex and that stimulus saliency determines the strength of this modulation."

Through a forward genetic screen, we identified a gene, sleepless , required for sleep in Drosophila . The sleepless gene encodes a brain-enriched, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Loss of SLEEPLESS protein caused an extreme (&gt;80%) reduction in sleep; a moderate reduction in SLEEPLESS had minimal effects on baseline sleep but markedly reduced the amount of recovery sleep after sleep deprivation. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that quiver , a mutation that impairs Shaker -dependent potassium current, is an allele of sleepless . Consistent with this finding, Shaker protein levels were reduced in sleepless mutants. We propose that SLEEPLESS is a signaling molecule that connects sleep drive to lowered membrane excitability."

But because they are used differently than print—scientists and scholars tend to search electronically and follow hyperlinks rather than browse or peruse—electronically available journals may portend an ironic change for science. Using a database of 34 million articles, their citations (1945 to 2005), and online availability (1998 to 2005), I show that as more journal issues came online, the articles referenced tended to be more recent, fewer journals and articles were cited, and more of those citations were to fewer journals and articles. The forced browsing of print archives may have stretched scientists and scholars to anchor findings deeply into past and present scholarship. Searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion, but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon."

We show that four-jointed encodes a protein kinase that phosphorylates serine or threonine residues within extracellular cadherin domains of Fat and its transmembrane ligand, Dachsous. Four-jointed functions in the Golgi and is the first molecularly defined kinase that phosphorylates protein domains destined to be extracellular. An acidic sequence motif (Asp-Asn-Glu) within Four-jointed was essential for its kinase activity in vitro and for its biological activity in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2107101690,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are sequence-specific post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Although major components of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway have been identified, regulatory mechanisms for this pathway remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the RNAi pathway can be modulated intracellularly by small molecules. We have developed a cell-based assay to monitor the activity of the RNAi pathway and find that the small-molecule enoxacin (Penetrex) enhances siRNA-mediated mRNA degradation and promotes the biogenesis of endogenous miRNAs. We show that this RNAi-enhancing activity depends on the trans-activation-responsive region RNA-binding protein. Our results provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that small molecules can be used to modulate the activity of the RNAi pathway. RNAi enhancers may be useful in the development of research tools and therapeutics."

In this study we doubled the number of Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins (OMPs) for which folding into lipid bilayers has been systematically investigated. We cloned, expressed, and folded nine OMPs: outer membrane protein X (OmpX), OmpW, OmpA, the crcA gene product (PagP), OmpT, outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLa), the fadl gene product (FadL), the yaet gene product (Omp85), and OmpF. These proteins fold into the same bilayer in vivo and share a transmembrane β-barrel motif but vary in sequence and barrel size. We quantified the ability of these OMPs to fold into a matrix of bilayer environments. Several trends emerged from these experiments: higher pH values, thinner bilayers, and increased bilayer curvature promote folding of all OMPs. Increasing the incubation temperature promoted folding of several OMPs but inhibited folding of others. We discovered that OMPs do not have the same ability to fold into any single bilayer environment. This suggests that although environmental factors influence folding, OMPs also have intrinsic qualities that profoundly modulate their folding. To rationalize the differences in folding efficiency, we performed kinetic and thermal denaturation experiments, the results of which demonstrated that OMPs employ different strategies to achieve the observed folding efficiency.

The number of high resolution membrane protein structures increases each year (1White S.H. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1948-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These structures provide a static picture of the membrane protein native state but reveal nothing about the dynamic folding process that formed them. Despite these advances in structural biology, the question remains: how does a polypeptide chain encode a structure that folds into a biological membrane? Proteins adopt a variety of folds, yet those that span a biological membrane exhibit only one of two general architectures, either the α-helix or the β-barrel. These transmembrane (TM) 2The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembraneOMPouter membrane proteinPGphosphatidylglycerolPEphosphatidylethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholineLUVlarge unilamellar vesicleSUVsmall unilamellar vesiclediCdiacylglycerol. motifs satisfy the hydrogen bonding requirements of the peptide backbone in the hydrophobic environment of the cellular membrane (2Kleffel B.

Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these motifs are found in different membranes in vivo. Most bilayers contain proteins with an α-helix TM motif, but β-barrel proteins only reside in the outer membranes of chloroplasts (4Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T.

In vivo, α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins insert into their respective biological membranes via different molecular machinery. The protein factors that aid bilayer insertion of an α-helix motif have been identified, and an elegant system using in vivo machinery has been developed to study α-helix insertion into membranes (8Hessa T. White S.H. von Heijne G. Science. 2005; 307: 1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Meindl-Beinker N.M. Lundin C. Nilsson I. White S.H. von Heijne G. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For β-barrel proteins, also called outer membrane proteins (OMPs), a few of the in vivo folding factors that facilitate insertion have been proposed only recently and are not yet fully understood (10Bos M.P. Robert V. Tommassen J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 191-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although the in vivo OMP folding pathway must yet be completely defined, it has been shown that several OMPs can fold spontaneously into synthetic membranes (11Surrey T. Jahnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Shanmugavadivu B. Apell H.J. Meins T. Zeth K. Kleinschmidt J.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 2007; 373: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ability of OMPs to spontaneously insert into synthetic vesicles has two important implications. First, there is no additional energy input required for the folding reaction to occur. Therefore, the native state of the protein is an equilibrium structure and thermodynamic measurements of stability can be made in vitro that have relevance in the biological setting. Second, a system composed of synthetic vesicles has significantly fewer variables than the heterogeneous milieu of biological membranes. Furthermore, synthetic vesicles can be modified systematically to dissect the molecular details of how bilayer properties influence OMP folding. Thus, in the absence of a clearly defined in vivo folding pathway, in vitro folding studies can identify both the protein and the bilayer characteristics that promote folding and insertion of membrane proteins. Unlike water, the relatively homogeneous solvent for soluble proteins, the biological membrane can vary in its lipid composition, overall charge, and gross morphology. The most valuable in vitro membrane protein folding system would therefore mimic the in vivo lipid conditions that a protein encounters. Proteins in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli reside in an asymmetric bilayer in which the outer leaflet is made of the glycolipid lipopolysaccharide and the inner leaflet is composed of phospholipids with either the phosphatidylglycerol (PG) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) head group (16Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kamio Y. Nikaido H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This asymmetry can be recreated in vitro with planar bilayers, but such bilayers do not remain stable on the time scale of OMP folding experiments (18Seydel U. Schroder G. Brandenburg K. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and therefore are not amenable to folding studies. Instead, vesicles composed entirely of phospholipids have been used to study OMP folding (11Surrey T. Jahnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Shanmugavadivu B.

Biol. 2007; 373: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the asymmetry of outer membranes, it is likely that phospholipids are the most appropriate model for folding studies, because OMPs first encounter the inner leaflet (composed entirely of phospholipids) as they fold into the outer membrane in vivo (10Bos M.P. Robert V. Tommassen J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 191-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied β-barrel folding model in phospholipid vesicles is outer membrane protein A (OmpA). Studies of OmpA have revealed how insertion occurs (19Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K.

The principles garnered from these studies allow conclusions to be drawn for how OmpA behaves, but they cannot reliably be applied to all OMPs until the behaviors of other proteins are observed in the same environment. Moreover, folding studies have been performed on other OMPs (12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Shanmugavadivu B.

Biol. 2007; 373: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but no comprehensive folding screen exists that facilitates comparison between proteins. To directly compare the folding propensities of membrane proteins, we probed the folding conditions of nine different β-barrel OMPs: OmpX, OmpW, OmpA, the crcA gene product (PagP), OmpT, outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLa), the fadl gene product (FadL), the yaet gene product (Omp85), and OmpF. The OMPs we chose all reside in the outer membrane of E. coli. Despite inhabiting the same bilayer environment in vivo and sharing a common TM motif, the primary sequences of these nine OMPs could not be aligned altogether or in pairwise BLAST queries (data not shown). Furthermore, the structure of each OMP varies from the next (Fig. 1). These model OMPs have barrel sizes ranging from eight β-strands (OmpX, OmpW, OmpA, and PagP) to 16 β-strands (OmpF). Their extramembrane structures also vary. OmpA and Omp85 have periplasmic domains as large as their TM domains, whereas FadL and OmpT have significant amounts of structure extending from their barrels toward the extracellular side of the biological membrane. The study of these nine OMPs constitutes the largest set of OMPs evaluated in tandem to date. In this work, we have established OmpW, OmpT, OmpLa, FadL, and Omp85 as novel models for folding studies. For purposes of direct comparison, we included OMPs that have previously been shown to fold into phospholipid bilayers in vitro: OmpA (11Surrey T. Jahnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), OmpF (12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), OmpX (28Mahalakshmi R. Franzin C.M. Choi J. Marassi F.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2007; 373: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data set doubles the number of E. coli OMPs for which folding has been systematically examined in lipid bilayers. Further, because these OMPs are sequentially and structurally diverse yet fold into the same environment in vivo, our results allowed the deduction of broad rules that define folding similarities and differences.

Lipid films were reconstituted in buffer containing 2 mm EDTA (Fluka) and 10 mm borate (Sigma), pH 10. Vesicles used in pH studies were brought up in the same concentration of appropriate buffers at various pH values. To make small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), lipids reconstituted in buffer were sonicated on ice for 50 min with a 50% duty cycle with a Branson Sonifier as described previously (25Hong H. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4065-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were made by extruding reconstituted lipids 11 times through a 0.1 μm filter using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Cloning and Expression of OMPs—Primers were designed to encompass the mature forms of the OMPs and add NdeI (5′) and BamHI (3′) sites. Primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. OMP genes were amplified using ExTaq polymerase (Takara) from an overnight growth of E. coli K12 MG1655 (29Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6053) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cut with restriction enzymes and ligated into a pET11a vector. The resulting plasmids were transformed into a laboratory supply of electrocompetent DH5α cells. The sequences were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using the T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers for all clones. Additional primers were designed and used for Omp85 to cover the length of the insert. The expression products were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute. Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) Star™ cells (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were grown in 500 ml of LB medium to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm before expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm β-d-1-thiogalactopyrano-side. Cells continued to incubate for 3-4 h at 37 °C and were harvested by centrifugation (5500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm EDTA, 125 μl of 20 mg ml-1 lysozyme) and incubated for 30 min on ice before being sonicated three times for 1 min at a 50% duty cycle. Brij-35 (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. Inclusion bodies were centrifuged (6000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C) and washed twice by resuspension in 25 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA) followed by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Cells were resuspended a third time in wash buffer and aliquoted into 3-ml fractions before a final centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Supernatant was discarded, and inclusion body pellets were stored at -20 °C. OMP Folding—Inclusion body pellets were dissolved in 8 m urea (ultra pure grade, Amresco), 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm borate, pH 10, to a final concentration of 100 μm protein. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficients for each OMP were determined using Sequence Analysis software (Informagen), with the exception of OmpLa, for which we used a previously published value (90,444 m-1 cm-1) (30Dekker N. Merck K. Tommassen J. Verheij H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). OMPs were refolded by rapid dilution into 3.2 mm synthetic lipid or 2.3 mg ml-1 lipid extract in folding buffer (1 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm borate, pH 10) to a final concentration of 4 μm protein. Folding temperatures were controlled by incubating reactions in a PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler (MJ Research). Overnight reactions were incubated for 15 h. SDS-PAGE—Folding reactions were quenched by adding 5× SDS gel-loading buffer (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.25Google Scholar) to a final dilution of 1× SDS gel-loading buffer. Samples were stored at -20 °C, if not immediately loaded onto a gel. 15 μl of sample (or only 5 μl of Omp85 sample because of its high molecular weight) were then loaded on a precast gel (Bio-Rad) without boiling. OmpX, OmpW, and PagP required gels with 4-20% acrylamide continuous gradient to resolve the folded and unfolded populations, but all other OMPs could be resolved on 10% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned digitally. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software. 3Program authored by Wayne Rasband. The linear regions of the densitometry were determined by measuring the density of standards of known protein amounts. The fraction folded is calculated by dividing the intensity of the folded band by the sum of the intensities of both the folded and unfolded bands. Folding Efficiency—We defined folding efficiency as the fraction of folded protein quantified at the overnight (15 h) time point. Folding Kinetics—After folding was initiated, small aliquots of the folding reaction were removed and quenched with 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer at the following time points: 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 300, 420, 720, 1200, and 1800 s. The fraction folded for each time point was determined by SDS-PAGE and densitometry as described above. We fit the results of folding kinetics to either a single exponential equation, y=yo+Aexp(-kt)(Eq. 1) or a double exponential equation, y=yo+A1exp(-k1t)+A2exp(-k2t)(Eq. 2) where y is the fraction folded at a given time, t, y0 is the fraction folded as time approaches infinity, k1 and k2 are rate constants, and A1 and A2 are the negative amplitudes associated with each rate constant. The burst phase is calculated as a sum of y0, A1, and A2. The lag phase is defined as the first time point at which fraction folded was equal to or greater than 0.05. The reported values and error bars equal the average and standard deviations, respectively, of three independent kinetic experiments. Thinner Bilayers and Smaller Vesicles Promote Folding Efficiency—To probe the bilayer properties that affect OMP folding, we incubated OMPs overnight with synthetic vesicles composed of a variety of lipids. The overnight time point (15 h) was chosen because it is an experimentally convenient time point for screening a large number of conditions and is intermediate to the incubation times used in previous folding studies (12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Pocanschi C.L. Apell H.J. Puntervoll P. Hogh B. Jensen H.B. Welte W. Kleinschmidt J.H. J. Mol.

Although some of the folding reactions were not complete by 15 h, this time point was sensitive to the fastest and most efficient folding events. The buffer we used contained 10 mm borate, pH 10, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 m urea. Previous OMP studies have used residual amounts of urea under folding conditions (11Surrey T. Jahnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F.

Biol. 2007; 373: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although OMPs can fold into synthetic vesicles at a variety of urea concentrations, we chose a low concentration of urea (1 m) in which to conduct this folding screen. To determine the fraction of protein that folded under a given condition, we used SDS-PAGE. Even before the first OMP structure was solved, it was observed by SDS-PAGE that OMPs share a characteristic called “heat modifiability”; that is, adding SDS to OMPs captures the folded and unfolded populations present in solution. During electrophoresis, these populations migrate to different positions (32Inouye M. Yee M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 304-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nakamura K. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When OMPs are solubilized in SDS and subsequently boiled, they lose their native β-content and migrate to their expected molecular weight on polyacrylamide gels (33Nakamura K. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, unboiled samples of folded OMPs retain a high content of β-structure (33Nakamura K. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) as well as their activity (12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Huysmans G.H. Radford S.E. Brockwell D.J. Baldwin S.A. J. Mol.

Because SDS-PAGE can distinguish between folded and unfolded populations, it has become a standard assay for assessing OMP folding. Fig. 2 shows that the OMPs we cloned and expressed all demonstrate this heat modifiability, as expected for each protein (12Surrey T. Schmid A. Jahnig F.

To determine the folding propensities under the most native-like conditions, we tested whether OMPs could fold into extracts prepared from their native lipids. We purchased two E. coli lipid extracts from Avanti Polar Lipids: total extract (57.5% PE, 15.1% PG, 9.8% cardiolipin, and 17.6% of uncharacterized mass) and polar extract (67.0% PE, 23.2% PG, 9.8% cardiolipin). These E. coli extracts could not be extruded to make LUVs; therefore we made SUVs by sonication. We incubated OMPs with SUVs of native lipids for 15 h, quenched folding by adding SDS-loading buffer, and performed electrophoresis on the unboiled samples. The fraction folded for each protein was determined by densitometry of the scanned gels. Fig. 3 shows that total and polar extracts gave similar results. In both extracts, a small population of only four of the nine proteins (OmpX, OmpA, OmpT, and Omp85) could fold into SUVs of native lipids. We then tested the ability of synthetic lipids to recapitulate the native lipids result. Fig. 3 shows that SUVs composed of synthetic lipids with a composition similar to the native extracts (75% C16C18:1PE, 25% C16C18:1PG) gave comparable results. We therefore conclude that pure preparations of synthetic lipids can reproduce the results obtained using native lipids. Further, unlike the native lipid extracts, the synthetic lipids could be extruded through 100-nm filters to make LUVs, which allowed us to assess the effect of bilayer curvature on OMP folding. With the exception of OmpT, we found that none of the OMPs folded into LUVs of synthetic lipids of native-like composition. Because less than half of the OMPs could fold into extracted lipids or native-like synthetic lipids, we tried bilayers with phosphatidylcholine (PC) head groups. Although E. coli do not contain any PC in their bilayers, PC-containing membranes are used in many aspects of OMP research, including computational simulations (41Khalid S. Bond P.J. Carpenter T.

Moreover, the TM β-barrels found in eukaryotes are located in the outer membranes of mitochondria, which are composed primarily of PC lipids, further supporting the notion that membranes composed of synthetic PC lipids are appropriate in vitro substitutes for biological lipid bilayers. Consistent with this idea, the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate that PC lipids promote in vitro folding of all the OMPs in this study. Using PC lipids, we further investigated how acyl chain length, acyl chain saturation, and vesicle size influenced fo"
https://openalex.org/W1996339481,"Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases are a family of enzymes that sequentially modify glycoproteins in a subcompartment-specific manner. These type II integral membrane proteins are characterized by a short cytoplasmically exposed amino-terminal tail and a luminal enzymatic domain. The cytoplasmic tails play a role in the localization of glycosyltransferases, and coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicle-mediated retrograde transport is also involved in their Golgi localization. However, the tails of these enzymes lack known COPI-binding motifs. Here, we found that Vps74p bound to a pentameric motif present in the cytoplasmic tails of the majority of yeast Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases, as well as to COPI. We propose that Vps74p maintains the steady-state localization of Golgi glycosyltransferases dynamically, by promoting their incorporation into COPI-coated vesicles."

Many fish vocalize during female courtship and territorial defense, as do amphibians, birds, and mammals. Here, we map the neural circuitry for vocalization in larval fish and show that the vocal network develops in a segment-like region across the most caudal hindbrain and rostral spinal cord. Taxonomic analysis demonstrates a highly conserved pattern between fish and all major lineages of vocal tetrapods. We propose that the vocal basis for acoustic communication among vertebrates evolved from an ancestrally shared developmental compartment already present in the early fishes."

https://openalex.org/W2124958324,"The distribution of species body size within taxonomic groups exhibits a heavy right tail extending over many orders of magnitude, where most species are much larger than the smallest species. We provide a simple model of cladogenetic diffusion over evolutionary time that omits explicit mechanisms for interspecific competition and other microevolutionary processes, yet fully explains the shape of this distribution. We estimate the model's parameters from fossil data and find that it robustly reproduces the distribution of 4002 mammal species from the late Quaternary. The observed fit suggests that the asymmetric distribution arises from a fundamental trade-off between the short-term selective advantages (Cope's rule) and long-term selective risks of increased species body size in the presence of a taxon-specific lower limit on body size."
https://openalex.org/W2160632237,"Adult stem cells occupy specialized microenvironments, or niches, that help regulate stem cell renewal and maintenance. The stem cell niche in the Drosophila male gonad is located at the tip of the testis where germline and somatic stem cells surround the apical hub. Voog et al. now show that somatic stem cells in the Drosophila testis contribute to both the apical hub and the somatic cyst cell lineage comprising the niche. They also show that the transcriptional repressor escargot regulates the ability of somatic cells to assume and/or maintain hub cell identity. This work highlights the dynamic relationship between stem cells and the niche and provides insight into genetic programmes that regulate niche size and function to support normal tissue homeostasis and organ regeneration throughout life. Adult stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, or niches, that have an important role in regulating stem cell behaviour1. Therefore, tight control of niche number, size and function is necessary to ensure the proper balance between stem cells and progenitor cells available for tissue homeostasis and wound repair. The stem cell niche in the Drosophila male gonad is located at the tip of the testis where germline and somatic stem cells surround the apical hub, a cluster of approximately 10–15 somatic cells that is required for stem cell self-renewal and maintenance2,3,4. Here we show that somatic stem cells in the Drosophila testis contribute to both the apical hub and the somatic cyst cell lineage. The Drosophila orthologue of epithelial cadherin (DE-cadherin) is required for somatic stem cell maintenance and, consequently, the apical hub. Furthermore, our data indicate that the transcriptional repressor escargot regulates the ability of somatic cells to assume and/or maintain hub cell identity. These data highlight the dynamic relationship between stem cells and the niche and provide insight into genetic programmes that regulate niche size and function to support normal tissue homeostasis and organ regeneration throughout life."

Synthetic PPARγ agonists are used as oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. However, emerging evidence indicates that PPARγ activators can also prevent or attenuate neurodegeneration. Given these previous findings, the focus of this report is on the potential neuroprotective role of PPARγ activation in preventing the loss of mitochondrial function in Huntington disease (HD). For these studies we used striatal cells that express wild-type (STHdhQ7/Q7) or mutant (STHdhQ111/Q111) huntingtin protein at physiological levels. Treatment of mutant cells with thapsigargin resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial calcium uptake, an increase in reactive oxygen species production, and a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone prevented the mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that occurred when mutant striatal cells were challenged with pathological increases in calcium. The beneficial effects of rosiglitazone were likely mediated by activation of PPARγ, as all protective effects were prevented by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. Additionally, the PPARγ signaling pathway was significantly impaired in the mutant striatal cells with decreases in PPARγ expression and reduced PPARγ transcriptional activity. Treatment with rosiglitazone increased mitochondrial mass levels, suggesting a role for the PPARγ pathway in mitochondrial function in striatal cells.

In addition, mitochondrial respiration and ATP production are significantly impaired in striatal cells expressing mutant huntingtin (6Milakovic T. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30773-30782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors (11Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). To date, three mammalian PPAR subtypes have been isolated and termed PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ. PPARα is highly expressed in several tissues and PPARβ is an APC-regulated target of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (12He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). PPARγ is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor implicated in several significant human pathologies, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and inflammation (13Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). PPARγ is the target of the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) drugs, used to treat type II diabetes. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insulin resistance with a PPARγ agonist retards the development of Alzheimer disease (AD) (14Watson G.S. Craft S. CNS Drugs. 2003; 17: 27-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 15Watson G.S. Cholerton B.A. Reger M.A. Baker L.D. Plymate S.R. Asthana S. Fishel M.A. Kulstad J.J. Green P.S. Cook D.G. Kahn S.E. Keeling M.L. Craft S. Am. J. Geriatr. Psychiatry. 2005; 13: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and TZDs extend survival in a transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (16Kiaei M. Kipiani K. Chen J. Calingasan N.Y. Beal M.F. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 191: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). TZDs have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for both AD and multiple sclerosis (17Watson G.S. Craft S. J. Neurol. Sci. 2006; 245: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and most of their neuroprotective effects are ascribed to either improved insulin sensitivity, or to their anti-inflammatory action through PPARγ activation in glial cells (18Bernardo A. Minghetti L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Heneka M.T. Landreth G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 1031-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, activation of PPARγ by three different TZDs protected rat hippocampal neurons against β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced damage (20Inestrosa N.C. Godoy J.A. Quintanilla R.A. Koenig C.S. Bronfman M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and the TZD rosiglitazone protects human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against acetaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity (21Jung T.W. Lee J.Y. Shim W.S. Kang E.S. Kim S.K. Ahn C.W. Lee H.C. Cha B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone up-regulates the Bcl-2 protective pathway and prevents neuronal degeneration induced by both oxidative stress and treatment with Aβ fibrils, with a concomitant increase in mitochondrial viability (22Fuenzalida K. Quintanilla R.A. Ramos P. Piderit D. Fuentealba R.A. Martinez G. Inestrosa N.C. Bronfman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37006-37015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also provided evidence that the expression of PGC-1α, a potent co-activator of PPARγ, is repressed by mutant huntingtin expression, and when PGC-1α knock-out (KO) mice are crossed with HD knockin mice, this resulted in increased neurodegeneration of striatal neurons and motor abnormalities in the HD mice (2Brandt J. Bylsma F.W. Gross R. Stine O.C. Ranen N. Ross C.A. Neurology. 1996; 46: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). At the same time, there is evidence suggesting that PPARγ agonists are neuroprotective and increase mitochondrial function (23Schutz B. Reimann J. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L. Kappes-Horn K. Landreth G.E. Schurmann B. Zimmer A. Heneka M.T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7805-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Hunter R.L. Dragicevic N. Seifert K. Choi D.Y. Liu M. Kim H.C. Cass W.A. Sullivan P.G. Bing G. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that oral treatment with rosiglitazone induced mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse brain (25Strum J.C. Shehee R. Virley D. Richardson J. Mattie M. Selley P. Ghosh S. Nock C. Saunders A. Roses A. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2007; 11: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we explored the possibility of using PPARγ activation to ameliorate mutant huntingtin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (5Panov A.V. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 6Milakovic T. Johnson G.V. J. Biol.

Ellerby L.M. Rego A.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11174-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that there are significant defects in the PPARγ signaling pathway in mutant huntingtin-expressing cells in comparison with cells that express wild-type huntingtin protein. In addition, pretreatment of mutant huntingtin-expressing cells with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone prevented the loss of mitochondrial potential, mitochondrial calcium deregulation, and oxidative stress overproduction in response to intracellular calcium overload. These findings suggest that activation of the PPARγ signaling pathway could ameliorate the mitochondrial function deficits that occur in HD. Reagents—Chemicals, culture media, and serum were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Roche Applied Sciences, Alexis Biochemical, and Invitrogen. Fluo-3 AM, Rhod-2 AM, 4-BrA23187, Calsein AM, Mitotracker Green™ (MitoGreen), tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), Mitotracker Red® CM-H2XRos (MitoRed), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (2,7-DCF) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture—In this study, conditionally immortalized striatal progenitor cell lines STHdhQ7/Q7 (referred to in the text as wild-type cells) expressing endogenous wild-type huntingtin, and STHdhQ111/Q111 (referred to in the text as mutant cells) expressing comparable levels of mutant huntingtin with 111 glutamines were used (27Trettel F.

These cell lines were a generous gift from Dr. M. E. MacDonald and were prepared from wild-type mice and homozygous HdhQ111/Q111 knockin mice as described previously (27Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Culturing conditions were the same as described in our previous studies (28Milakovic T. Quintanilla R.A. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34785-34795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS Measurements—Clonal striatal cells were grow on polylysine-coated coverslips (30,000 cells/coverslip) and treated with 1 μm thapsigargin, 20 μm rosiglitazone, and/or 40 μm GW9662, as indicated. After treatment, the cells were incubated with the fluorescent probe 2,7-DCF at 10 μm for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) buffer supplemented with 5 mm glucose (29Ruan Q. Quintanilla R.A. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The coverslips were washed two times with PBS and fixed with 4% p-formaldehyde for 5 min. Cells were photographed using a Nikon fluorescence microscope integrated with a Spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). All photographs were taken using the same exposure time and gain to minimize the photobleaching of 2,7-DCF. Images were quantified using Image-Pro Plus 6 software. Results in intensity units were expressed as average of fluorescence signal (F) minus background fluorescence (F0) in every image (29Ruan Q. Quintanilla R.A. Johnson G.V. J.

Mitochondrial Potential Determination in Live Cells—Mitochondria membrane potential was determined using Mitotracker® Red CM-H2XRos (MitoRed) or TMRM (22Fuenzalida K. Quintanilla R.A. Ramos P.

Striatal cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated plates and cultured for 4 days. The cells were then loaded for 30 min with MitoRed or TMRM (100 nm) in KRH buffer supplemented with 5 mm glucose and containing 0.02% pluronic acid, then washed, and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min. Cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were then mounted on the stage of a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP2, Germany), and the fluorescence changes were determined using a 40× water immersion objective. MitoRed and TMRM fluorescence were detected exciting with a 563-nm He-Ne laser very heavily attenuated (30% laser power), and the emission was collected at >570 nm for every dye per separate measure. Signal from control cells and cells treated with different stimuli were compared using identical settings for laser power, and detector sensitivity for each separate experiment. The images were analyzed with LCS Leica confocal software and recorded as mean MitoRed or TMRM fluorescence signal per live cell. Estimation of fluorescence intensities were presented as the pseudoratio (ΔF/Fo), which was calculated using the following formula: ΔF/Fo = (F - Fbase)/(Fbase - B), where F is the measured fluorescence intensity of the indicator, Fbase is the fluorescence intensity before the stimulation, and B is the background signal determined from the average of areas adjacent to the cells (22Fuenzalida K.

Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Calcium Measurements—Cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes were loaded for 30 min (37 °C) with 5 μm Fluo-3 AM, and 10 μm Rhod-2 AM in KRH-glucose containing 0.02% pluronic acid. The fluorescence changes determined by Fluo-3 represent the cytoplasmic calcium changes (30Santos M.J. Quintanilla R.A. Toro A. Grandy R. Dinamarca M.C. Godoy J.A. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol.

Cells were washed three times and left in KRH-glucose for 10 min until cell fluorescence had equilibrated. Fluorescence was imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2) using a 40× water immersion lens, as described previously (28Milakovic T. Quintanilla R.A. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34785-34795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Images were acquired using a 488-nm Argon laser to excite Fluo-3 fluorescence and a 563 nm He-Ne laser to excite Rhod-2 fluorescence. The signals were collected at 505-530 nm (Fluo-3) and at 590 nm (Rhod-2). The fluorescence background signal was subtracted from cell fluorescence measurements in every experiment. The fluorescence intensity variation was recorded from 10-20 cells on average per experiment. Estimation of fluorescence intensities of Fluo-3 and Rhod-2 were presented as a pseudoratio (ΔF/Fo), as described previously (30Santos M.J. Quintanilla R.A. Toro A. Grandy R. Dinamarca M.C.

Immunofluorescence Staining—Striatal cells plated on polylysine-coated coverslips (25,000 cells/coverslip) were double immunostained using the rabbit polyclonal anti-PPARγ antibody (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA) (1:500), and a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma). The secondary antibodies used were 488 Alexa anti-mouse (Molecular Probes), for detection of actin and 593 Alexa anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) for PPARγ. Coverslips were mounted and analyzed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) integrated with an Axiocam CCD camera (Carl Zeiss). Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant striatal cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted total RNA was treated with RNase free-DNase I, Amplification Grade, (Invitrogen) to remove contaminating DNA, heat-treated to inactivate DNase I, and precipitated with ethanol to clean up the reaction. 2 μg of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The real-time PCR reaction was performed in triplicate in a real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 25 μl. Amplification conditions consisted of an initial hot start at 95 °C for 10 min followed by amplification of 45 cycles (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s). Melting curve analysis was performed immediately after amplification from 55 to 95 °C. The threshold cycle (CT) of PPARγ was normalized to the CT value of TBP, and the relative amounts of mRNA are shown. Western Blotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4% SDS, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were sonicated, cleared from cellular debris by centrifugation, and assayed to determine protein concentration using the BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins (10-100 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with the primary rabbit antibody against PPARγ (1:500 dilution, Cell Signaling) in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit (1:3000 dilution) in TBST containing 5% skim milk was added, followed by incubation, rinsing, and detection of the immunoreactive bands, by chemiluminescence. Luciferase Assays—4 × 104 wild-type striatal cells or 8 × 104 mutant striatal cells were plated into each well of a 24-well plate. The following day, a reporter plasmid ((PPRE) X3-TK-Luc) (Addgene, Cambridge, MA)) (36Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell lysates were put through one cycle of freeze-thaw and centrifuged. Luciferase activity was then measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E., and were analyzed using Student's t test, an unpaired Student's t test, or one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test as indicated. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.

We have examined the interplay between viral or human Bcl-2-like proteins and UVRAG and their opposite effects on Beclin1. We show that Beclin1 forms a dimer in solution via its coiled-coil domain both in vivo and in vitro. Viral Bcl-2 binds independently to two sites on the Beclin1 dimer, one with high affinity and one with lower affinity, whereas human Bcl-xL binds both sites equally with relatively low affinity. UVRAG disrupts the Beclin1-dimer interface, forming a heterodimer with Beclin1, suggesting that this is how UVRAG causes its effects on Beclin1 to activate autophagy. Both Bcl-2-like proteins reduce the affinity of UVRAG for Beclin1 ∼4-fold, suggesting that they stabilize the Beclin1 dimer. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation assays show that UVRAG substantially reduces Beclin1 dimerization in vivo. These data explain the concentration-dependent interplay between Bcl-2, UVRAG, and Beclin1, as both tumor suppressors, UVRAG and Beclin1, have single-copy mutations in human cancers. Furthermore, our data suggest that an alternative strategy for developing anti-cancer compounds would be to disrupt the Beclin1-dimer interface.

Autophagy is an intracellular vesicular pathway for the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles (1Levine B. Yuan J. J. Clin.

The bulk cytoplasm is engulfed in vesicles that mature into autophagosomes and are then targeted to the lysosome. This process is well conserved from yeast to mammals, and many of the autophagy-related (atg) genes that are involved were originally identified in yeast (2Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Many have mammalian homologues with conserved functions in autophagy. For example the mammalian protein Beclin1 is a homologue of yeast Atg6, and both form a lipid-kinase complex with class III phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI(3)KC3 4The abbreviations used are: PI(3)KC3class III phosphoinositide-3 kinaseCCDcoiled-coil domainBHBcl-2 homologyITCisothermal titration calorimetryKSHVKaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirusTCEPTris[2-carboxyethyphosphine] hydrochlorideSBPstreptavidin-binding peptide. ; Vps34 in yeast) that mediates vesicle nucleation. class III phosphoinositide-3 kinase coiled-coil domain Bcl-2 homology isothermal titration calorimetry Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Tris[2-carboxyethyphosphine] hydrochloride streptavidin-binding peptide. Autophagy is required during cell growth and development and is thought to be predominantly a pro-survival process. For example, it is induced in response to cellular stress such as starvation as well as during differentiation when large scale changes within cells are required. However, excessive autophagy also induces cell death by a morphologically distinct process to apoptosis, and increasing evidence suggests that autophagy can also function as a programmed-cell-death pathway that is distinct from apoptosis. For example, RNAi against atg5, atg7, or beclin1 prevents cell death in apoptosis-incompetent mouse cells (3Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 4Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). This suggests that cells can die by an alternative Beclin1-dependent pathway when apoptosis is inhibited. Beclin1 is monoallelically deleted in many sporadic human breast and ovarian cancers (5Aita V.M. Liang X.H. Murty V.V. Pincus D.L. Yu W. Cayanis E. Kalachikov S. Gilliam T.C. Levine B. Genomics. 1999; 59: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and beclin1 gene transfer inhibits tumorigenicity, suggesting that reduced Beclin1 expression increases breast cancer progression (6Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Heterozygous disruption of beclin1 in mice increases the formation of spontaneous tumors (7Yue Z. Jin S. Yang C. Levine A.J. Heintz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulate apoptosis (9Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2-like proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1, inhibit apoptosis, whereas the other Bcl-2 subfamilies, the Bax-like proteins, including Bax and Bak, and the Bcl-2-homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins are largely pro-apoptotic. Bcl-2-like proteins induce Bax and Bak to rearrange to form transmembrane pores that initiate the later stages of apoptosis, whereas BH3-only proteins bind to Bcl-2-like proteins and block their inhibition of apoptosis. Bcl-2-like proteins including Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 bind to Beclin1 (10Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Beclin1 contains a single BH3 domain, indicating that it is also a member of the BH3-only family (10Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol.

Troulinaki K. Tavernarakis N. Hickman J.A. Geneste O. Kroemer G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Therefore, Beclin1 may sequester Bcl-2, which may be responsible for the tumor suppressor activity of Beclin1 (11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13123-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The γ-herpesviruses, such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), encode a viral form of the cellular Bcl-2 oncogene (vBcl-2) which also bind to BH3-only proteins including Beclin1 to prevent apoptosis (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). As well as inhibiting apoptosis, Bcl-2 binding to Beclin1 also inhibits autophagy, as it blocks the lipid-kinase activity of the Beclin1-PI(3)KC3 complex and prevents vesicle initiation (14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Recently another tumor suppressor, UVRAG, has been shown to interact with Beclin1 and stimulate autophagy by activating the kinase activity of PI(3)KC3 (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Therefore, Bcl-2 and UVRAG have opposing effects on the Beclin1-PI(3)KC3 complex. Here we have analyzed the reasons for these antagonistic effects at the molecular level by examining Beclin1 and its interacting partners. We show that the central coiled-coil domain of Beclin1 dimerizes both in vivo and in vitro. Bcl-xL and viral Bcl-2 bind to Beclin1 by different mechanisms, but both proteins appear to stabilize the Beclin1 dimer interface, whereas UVRAG disrupts the Beclin1 dimer. Therefore, Beclin1 acts as a monomer-dimer“switch” regulated by UVRAG and Bcl-2-like proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequences coding for Beclin1, residues 133-266 and 95-266, and KSHV Bcl-2 residues 1-146 were isolated by PCR amplification and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Beclin1 residues 95-266 and KSHV Bcl-2 residues 1-146 were also cloned, respectively, into the BamHI and SalI and into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of pETDuet-1 (Novagen). UVRAG residues 189-275 and Beclin1 residues 133-266 were cloned, respectively, into the BamHI and SalI and into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of pETDuet-1. These pETDuet-1 constructs were subsequently modified to insert an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion with a PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) cleavage site instead of the N-terminal His tag into the upstream gene. The double mutant variant of KSHV Bcl-2 (N67D,V117A) was created by two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The individual proteins and complexes were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified from clarified crude cell extracts by cleaving from a glutathione affinity column using PreScission protease followed by ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Bcl-xL (residues 1-208, N52D, N66D) in pET29b was purified as described previously (11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13123-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of each expression clone was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients derived by summing the contributions from tyrosine and tryptophan residues. The 24-mer Beclin1-BH3 peptide (residues 107-129 and an additional N-terminal tyrosine to determine the concentration by UV spectroscopy) was purchased high performance liquid chromatography-purified (1st Base). Sedimentation Velocity—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a ProteomeLab XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with 2-channel centerpieces in an An-60Ti rotor at 42,000 rpm and 20 °C. Radial scans at a single wavelength (typically 280 nm) were taken every 300 s. The solvent density and viscosity and the protein partial specific volume were calculated using the program SEDNTERP. Protein samples were dialyzed into a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyphosphine] hydrochloride (TCEP). The data were fitted to the continuous size-distribution functions c(S) or c(M) using the program SEDFIT (15Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using a ProteomeLab XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using 6-channel centerpieces in an An-60Ti rotor at 20 °C. Protein samples were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP. Samples were centrifuged for ∼24 h until they reached equilibrium and no further change was seen in the distribution. Radial scans were measured at 280, 250, and 230 nm. The data were fitted to an ideal single-species model as well as a rapid monomer-dimer equilibrium using the program HETEROANALYSIS. The vBcl-2-Beclin1 BH3-CCD complex was also analyzed in terms of a heteroassociation model consisting of two sequential binding events. Where possible, scans were also taken after centrifugation at 42,000 rpm to measure the residual absorbance for initial offset values. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). Samples were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP. The cell was loaded with 10-20 μm Beclin1 sample, and the injection syringe was loaded with 200-400 μm UVRAG-(189-275) or Bcl-2-like protein. Typically titrations consisted of 28 injections of 10 μl, with 240-s equilibration between injections. The data were analyzed using Origin 7.0. Analytical Size-exclusion Chromatography—A superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP. Protein samples in the same buffer were injected onto the column and monitored at 210 nm. Mammalian Cell Transfection and Imaging—Full-length Beclin1, Beclin1-(95-266), Beclin1-(133-266), and full-length Bcl-xL were cloned into pXJ-YPet. This vector consists of the YPet coding sequence (16Nguyen A.W. Daugherty P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) in place of the FLAG tag in pXJ-FLAG (17Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length of BCL-xL were cloned into pXJ-YPet, pXJ-FLAG, and pXJ-mCherry vectors. UVRAG-(189-275) was cloned into pXJ-FLAG vector. Full-length Beclin1 was cloned into a vector with the streptavidin binding peptide pXJ-FLAG-SBP vector. 5Z.-S. Zhao, unpublished information. HeLa or COS-7 cells were plated on 18 × 18-mm glass coverslips at 30% cell density. Cells were incubated with a mixture of Optifect (Invitrogen) and plasmids according to the manufacturer's protocol for 4 h and cultured in fresh medium for 2 h before fixation. MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) was added at 1:10,000 from a 1 mm stock to cells maintained for 30 min at 37 °C and transferred to normal medium for 30 min at 37 °C before fixation. Images were captured on an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope using a NA1.45 60× oil lens. Streptavidin Bead Affinity Pulldown Assay and Western Blotting—COS-7 cells in 60-mm NUNC culture dishes were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 8 h fresh medium was added, and cells were cultured overnight. Total cell lysate was collected in 500 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1× Complete (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed through a 26G1/2 needle (10-) before clarification (10 min at 13,000 rpm). This Triton-X-100-soluble lysate (total cell lysate, ∼500 μg) was incubated with 25 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Upstate) and washed with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 (3×). Bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer. YPet- or FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with anti-green fluorescent protein and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively, by Western blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride. The Beclin1 CCD Forms a Dimer in Solution—Beclin1 is a tumor suppressor (6Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar) and contains a number of structural domains, including a BH3, a coiled-coil domain (CCD), and an evolutionarily conserved domain. The evolutionarily conserved domain binds to PI(3)KC3 (18Furuya N. Yu J. Byfield M. Pattingre S. Levine B. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and the CCD binds to a similar CCD of UVRAG (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), whereas the BH3 domain binds to Bcl-2 (11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13123-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 12Maiuri M.C. Le Toumelin G. Criollo A. Rain J.C. Gautier F. Juin P. Tasdemir E. Pierron G. Troulinaki K. Tavernarakis N. Hickman J.A. Geneste O. Kroemer G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that UVRAG binding to Beclin1 increases PI(3)KC3 kinase activity (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) and that Bcl-2 reduces this kinase activity (14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Here we have sought to understand how Bcl-2 and UVRAG cause these effects at the molecular level. First, to characterize the interactions between Beclin1, Bcl-2, and UVRAG, we expressed the CCD of Beclin1 (residues 133-266; Beclin1 CCD) or both the BH3 and CCD domains (residues 95-266; Beclin1 BH3-CCD) in E. coli and purified them to near homogeneity. The final purification step involved a size-exclusion column and the Beclin1 CCD/BH3-CCD samples eluted at a much higher molecular mass than would be expected for a compact monomer or even dimer (>100 kDa; data not shown). Therefore, we further characterized both Beclin1 fragments by analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1, Tables 1 and 2). Beclin1 CCD and Beclin1 BH3-CCD were both analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium over a wide concentration range. The data for both proteins fitted well to a single-species model, and both gave very similar weight-averaged molecular weights to the formula mass of a dimer showing that Beclin1 dimerizes via its CCD. No concentration dependence was seen over the concentration range used for either protein, indicating that the dimer interface is high affinity.TABLE 1Summary of sedimentation equilibrium dataProteinPartial specific volumeMrFitted MrConcentration rangeRotor speedsStoichiometryKaμMkrpmM−1Beclin1 CCD0.721116,66032,4303-16520, 23, 26DimerBeclin1 BH3-CCD0.721320,72041,8102-14516, 18, 20DimerUVRAG0.750710,49011,5102-2030, 32, 34MonomervBcl-20.743116,62017,3701-2220, 23, 26MonomerBeclin1 BH3-CCD + vBcl-20.7213, 0.743141,440, 16,2000.3-1514, 16, 182:25.55 × 1071.13 × 106Beclin1 BH3-CCD + Bcl-xL0.719941,440, 24,29065,0700.5-1714, 17, 202:2Beclin1 CCD + UVRAG CCD0.732610,490, 16,66030,01013-7418, 21, 241:1 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Summary of sedimentation velocity dataProteinSapp (from c(S))S20,wf/f0MrMr (from c(M))Beclin1 CCD1.952.021.961666034200Beclin1 BH3-CCD2.092.172.012072040000Beclin1 BH3-CCD vBcl-23.243.361.637384058800Beclin1 BH3-CCD Bcl-xL3.143.261.868999064600 Open table in a new tab UVRAG CCD (residues 189-275) and KSHV Bcl-2 (excluding the transmembrane domain; hereafter referred to as vBcl-2) were also analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium. As expected, both proteins were monomeric in solution (Table 1). Bcl-xL, lacking the transmembrane domain, has previously been shown to be monomeric (19Thuduppathy G.R. Hill R.B. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Beclin1 proteins were also analyzed by sedimentation velocity to confirm that the proteins are dimeric and to get an indication of the molecular shape (Fig. 1C, Table 2). The data were fitted using the continuous distribution functions c(S) and c(M). These functions fit the data to a continuous distribution of sedimentation coefficients or weight-averaged molecular weights, respectively (15Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that both Beclin1 proteins sedimented as single species with apparent molecular weights very close to that of a dimer. Surprisingly both proteins had very high frictional ratios of ∼2. Given that the Beclin1 CCD is largely α-helical in solution (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), this shows that both proteins are highly asymmetric. vBcl-2 Binds to Two Distinct Sites on the Beclin1 Dimer—To test whether Beclin1 remains dimeric on binding to Bcl-2-family proteins, we analyzed the binding of vBcl-2 and Bcl-xL to the Beclin1 BH3-CCD dimer by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). These Bcl-2 proteins were used because of their high solubility and because both human Bcl-xL and vBcl-2 bind to Beclin1 and inhibit autophagy (14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Double mutant variants of both Bcl-2-like proteins were used because this increases their solubility (11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13123-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 20Huang Q. Petros A.M. Virgin H.W. Fesik S.W. Olejniczak E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3428-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The titration curve for vBcl-2 clearly shows biphasic binding, and therefore, the data were fitted to a two-site binding model (Fig. 2A, Table 3). One high affinity interaction occurred at a molar ratio of ∼0.5, i.e. 1 vBcl-2 per Beclin1 dimer, and the second interaction occurred at a molar ratio of ∼1, i.e. 2 vBcl-2 per Beclin1 dimer. Therefore, these data show that the Beclin1 dimer contains two distinct vBcl-2 binding sites, one with high affinity and one with lower affinity. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for the higher affinity site is 25 nm, whereas for the lower affinity site it is 4.8 μm.TABLE 3Summary of isothermal titration calorimetry dataCell ligandInjectantnKaΔHTΔS (293K)M−1Kcal·mol−1Kcal·mol−1Beclin1 BH3-CCDvBcl-20.545 ± 0.0044.02 × 107 ± 6.8 × 106−1.242 × 104 ± 68−7.560.929 ± 0.022.08 × 105 ± 3.5 × 104−5.36 × 103 ± 2766.04Beclin1 BH3 peptidevBcl-20.964 ± 0.021.77 × 105 ± 1.0 × 104−7.10 × 103 ± 161−0.20Beclin1 BH3-CCDBcl-xL0.978 ± 0.0049.08 × 105 ± 4.6 × 104−1.09 × 104 ± 63−9.82Beclin1 BH3 peptideBcl-xL0.952 ± 0.0021.54 × 106 ± 3.0 × 104−1.32 × 104 ± 29−16.6Beclin1 BH3-CCDUVRAG CCD1.02 ± 0.012.04 × 105 ± 1.2 × 1041.12 × 104 ± 24062.4Beclin1 BH3-CCD (2× UVRAG CCD)vBcl-20.976 ± 0.0174.59 × 105 ± 5.6 × 104−500 ± 1188.83Beclin1 BH3-CCD (2× UVRAG CCD)Bcl-xL0.954 ± 0.0021.16 × 106 ± 2.2 × 104−1.14 × 104 ± 32−11.0Beclin1 BH3-CCD (2× vBcl-2)UVRAG CCD1.06 ± 0.064.99 × 104 ± 8.4 × 1031.58 × 104 ± 168075.5Beclin1 BH3-CCD (0.5× vBcl-2)UVRAG CCD1.02 ± 0.021.85 × 105 ± 1.2 × 1041.24 × 104 ± 31266.3Beclin1 BH3-CCD (2× Bcl-xL)UVRAG CCD1.04.66 × 104 ± 1.8 × 1035.53 × 104 ± 1254210 Open table in a new tab To confirm the existence of higher and lower affinity Bcl-2-binding sites, we co-expressed and purified a complex of vBcl-2 and Beclin1 BH3-CCD and analyzed it by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 2B, Tables 1 and 2). The sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed in terms of heteroassociation models with either a single vBcl-2 or two distinct vBcl-2 molecules binding to the Beclin1 dimer. The data could not be fitted to a single-association model but fitted very well to a model incorporating two separate binding events, and the dissociation constants were similar to those seen with the ITC data. Therefore, this confirms that Beclin1 binds two Bcl-2 molecules, one with high affinity and one with lower affinity. To examine whether the high affinity Bcl-2-binding site on Beclin1 is created by dimerization of Beclin1, we measured binding between vBcl-2 and a Beclin1-BH3 peptide residues 107-129, which has been shown to be bound tightly in a hydrophobic groove created by helices α2-α5 of Beclin1 (11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13123-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The data fitted to a single binding-site model with a very similar affinity to that seen for the lower affinity binding site on the Beclin1 dimer (Kd 5.6 μm). Therefore, dimerization is required to form the higher affinity vBcl-2 binding site on Beclin1. Bcl-xL Binds to Beclin1 by a Different Mechanism—Bcl-xL bound very differently to Beclin1, and only a single binding event was detected by ITC (Fig. 3), with a Kd of 1.1 μm. Therefore, Bcl-xL binds to each BH3 domain of the Beclin1 dimer with a similar affinity. To rule out the possibility that Bcl-xL binds to monomeric Beclin1, a complex of Beclin1 and Bcl-xL was purified by gel filtration and analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity (Tables 1 and 2). The equilibrium data globally fitted to a weight-averaged molecular mass of 65 kDa, and individual scans showed a concentration dependence and fitted to between 58 and 68 kDa. This is considerably greater than that for a Bcl-xL-Beclin1 heterodimer (Mr 45) showing that Beclin1 BH3-CCD remains dimeric and is capable of binding two Bcl-xL molecules. The velocity data were analyzed by the c(M) method, and the major species gave a similar molecular mass of ∼64 kDa. Binding between Bcl-xL and the Beclin1-BH3 peptide was also measured to examine the effect of Beclin1 dimerization on the Beclin1-Bcl-xL interaction (Fig. 3B, Table 3). Bcl-xL actually bound to the peptide with a higher affinity than to the Beclin1 dimer (Kd 0.65 versus 1.1 μm). This result shows that dimerization of Beclin1 is not required for Bcl-xL binding and suggests that Bcl-xL makes additional unfavorable interactions on binding to the Beclin1 dimer. UVRAG Binds to Beclin1 and Disrupts the Dimer Interface—The interaction between Beclin1 BH3-CCD and UVRAG CCD was also characterized by ITC (Fig. 4A). The titration curve for this interaction was fitted to a single-site model, and binding occurred at a molar ratio of 1, showing that Beclin1 and UVRAG bind with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Kd 4.9 μm). This interaction was highly endothermic and, therefore, was driven entirely by entropy at 20 °C (TΔS, 62 kcal·mol-1; Table 3). One possible explanation for this entropy-driven binding is that UVRAG disrupts an ordered Beclin1-dimer interface. To test this possibility we analyzed Beclin1 CCD, UVRAG CCD, and a mixture of the two by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4B). A peak corresponding to a lower molecular weight than the Beclin1 CCD dimer is seen when the two proteins are mixed that is not present when either is analyzed alone, indicating that the two proteins form a complex of an intermediate molecular weight. Only a small amount of the complex was detected, presumably due to the low affinity of the interaction and the fact that both proteins have very different shapes (data not shown). Nevertheless this result was reproducible and also occurred for Beclin1 BH3-CCD mixed with UVRAG. To confirm this finding, we also analyzed an equimolar mixture of Beclin1 CCD and UVRAG CCD by sedimentation equilibrium (Table 1). All the individual equilibria fitted to mass-averaged molecular masses of 26-33 kDa and globally fitted to 30 kDa, less than the Beclin1-dimer molecular mass of 33 kDa. Given that the molecular mass of 2:1 or 2:2 Beclin1·UVRAG complexes would be 44 or 54 kDa, respectively, this shows that the sample consists of an equilibrium between a Beclin1 homodimer and a Beclin1-UVRAG heterodimer, suggesting that UVRAG may disrupt the Beclin1-dimer interface. To further confirm that UVRAG really disrupts the Beclin1-dimer interface, binding between vBcl-2 and Beclin1 BH3-CCD was measured in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of UVRAG (Fig. 4C). If UVRAG disrupts the Beclin1 dimer interface, one would expect that the high affinity interaction between vBcl-2 and Beclin1 would be removed. This binding isotherm was substantially different from that seen in the absence of UVRAG (compare Fig. 2A with Fig. 4C), and a single binding event occurred at a molar ratio of 1 showing that UVRAG does indeed bind a Beclin1 monomer. The interaction fitted to a Kd of 2.2 μm, i.e. much more similar to the lower affinity site seen in Fig. 2A. A similar experiment performed for Bcl-xL binding to Beclin1 BH3-CCD in the presence of a 2-fold excess of UVRAG CCD (Table 3) showed that UVRAG had little effect on the interaction between Bcl-xL and Beclin1 BH3-CCD. Bcl-2-like Proteins Reduce the Affinity of UVRAG for Beclin1—To examine the effect of the Bcl-2-like proteins on the UVRAG-Beclin1 interaction, we performed further ITC titrations between UVRAG and Beclin1 BH3-CCD in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of vBcl-2 or Bcl-xL (Fig. 5; Table 3). The titrations both show that UVRAG still binds to Beclin1 but with a reduced affinity. The Kd is reduced from 4.9 to ∼20 μm in both cases. Therefore, both vBcl-2 and Bcl-xL reduce the affinity of UVRAG for Beclin1 to a similar extent. The entropy driving both interactions is increased with respect to the Beclin1-UVRAG interaction alone, consistent with UVRAG breaking additional interactions on binding to the Bcl-2-xL-Beclin1 complex. This is particularly apparent for UVRAG binding to the Bcl-xL-Beclin1 complex (TΔS, 210 kcal·mol-1). It is not clear why vBcl-2 and Bcl-xL affect the affinity of UVRAG for Beclin1 by the same amount given the different manner of vBcl-2 and Bcl-xL binding to Beclin1. Therefore, we tested whether occupation of the high affinity site on Beclin1 alone could affect the affinity of the UVRAG-Beclin1 interaction. To do this we measured binding between UVRAG CCD and Beclin1 BH3-CCD in the presence of a 0.5 molar ratio of vBcl-2 (i.e. 1 vBcl-2 per Beclin1 dimer), but the affinity and energetics of the UVRAG-Beclin1 interaction were unaffected (Table 3). This indicates that both vBcl-2 molecules need to be bound to reduce the affinity of UVRAG for Beclin1. Beclin1 Co-localizes with Bcl-xL in the Mitochondria and Dimerizes via Its CCD Domain in Vivo—To determine whether Beclin1 binds to Bcl-xL in vivo, we expressed full-length Beclin1 as a fusion with YPet in HeLa cells. Beclin1 localized mainly to the cytoplasm with no obvious specific subcellular features (Fig. 6A, a-c (21Liang X.H. Yu J. Brown K. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3443-3449PubMed Google Scholar)). When Beclin1 was co-expressed with Bcl-xL, then both proteins were predominantly co-localized at the mitochondria (Fig. 6A, d-f) agreeing with previous data showing that Beclin1 interacts with Bcl-xL in vivo (12Maiuri M.C. Le Toumelin G. Criollo A. Rain J.C. Gautier F. Juin P. Tasdemir E. Pierron G. Troulinaki K. Tavernarakis N. Hickman J.A. Geneste O. Kroemer G.

Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Localization to the mitochondria was confirmed by fluorescent Mito-Tracker staining of HeLa cells expressing Bcl-xL. Beclin1 BH3-CCD co-localized with Bcl-xL, but Beclin1 CCD, which lacks the BH3 domain, did not (Fig. 6B), showing that the Beclin1 interaction with Bcl-xL is dependent on the BH3 domain in vivo. To show that Beclin1 homodimerizes in vivo via its CCD domain, we performed streptavidin pulldown experiments, with FLAG-SBP-Beclin1, which contains a streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP, Fig. 7A). YPet-Beclin1, YPet-Beclin1 BH3-CCD, YPet-Beclin1 CCD, and YPet-Bcl-xL all interacted with FLAG-SBP-Beclin1, showing that Beclin1 dimerizes in vivo via its CCD domain. YPet alone did not interact with FLAG-SBP-Beclin1, showing that the interaction is specific. UVRAG Reduces Dimerization of Beclin1—To examine the effects of UVRAG and Bcl-xL on the homodimerization of Beclin1 in vivo, Beclin1 BH3-CCD (residues 95-266) and UVRAG CCD (residues 189-275) were used since the co-expressed full-length proteins were essentially Triton X-100-insoluble (data not shown). Beclin1 dimerization was assessed by the ability of the SBP-Beclin1 to bring down YPet-Beclin1. As shown in Fig. 7B, the dimerization of Beclin1 was unaffected by co-transfection of Bcl-xL but reduced significantly by UVRAG CCD co-expression. These results support the in vitro biophysical data, and together they provide strong evidence that UVRAG blocks Beclin1 dimerization. It has previously been shown that UVRAG and Bcl-2-like proteins have antagonistic effects on the activation of autophagy. UVRAG binds to the CCD of Beclin1 and activates PI(3)KC3 leading to the initiation of autophagy (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), whereas Bcl-2-like proteins inhibit Beclin1-dependent activation of PI(3)KC3 activity and autophagy (14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). In this work we have identified how these effects are conferred through Beclin1 by characterizing Beclin1 and its interactions with UVRAG and Bcl-2-like proteins in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that Beclin1 forms a high affinity dimer and that this dimerization can be regulated by the Bcl-2-like proteins Bcl-xL and vBcl-2 or by UVRAG. UVRAG disrupts the Beclin1-dimer, forming a heterodimer with Beclin1. Because UVRAG binding to Beclin1 activates PI(3)KC3 activity (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), it is very likely that monomerization of Beclin1 activates the kinase, possibly by allowing the kinase to bind to Beclin1. The Beclin1 dimer appears to be stabilized by the Bcl-2-like proteins, presumably by protein-protein interactions, but the molecular mechanism of this stabilization remains elusive. One possibility is that Bcl-xL forms a transient domain-swapped dimer on binding to Beclin1, thereby stabilizing the Beclin1 dimer. A domain-swapped dimer of Bcl-xL involving swapping of α-helix 1 at the N terminus has been observed in the recent crystal structure of Bcl-xL bound to the BH3 domain of Beclin1 (11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13123-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), but such a domain-swapped dimer has not been shown to occur in solution (11Oberstein A. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13123-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 24Feng W. Huang S. Wu H. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It may occur transiently when bound to dimeric BH3-only proteins, with a relatively low activation barrier such that its formation is reversible. Bcl-xL has also been shown to form a different domain-swapped dimer in solution, involving swapping the C-terminal α-helices 7 and 8 (22Denisov A.Y. Sprules T. Fraser J. Kozlov G. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23O'Neill J.W. Manion M.K. Maguire B. Hockenbery D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL is predominantly monomeric in vitro, and dimerization is promoted by heat and alkaline pH. The function of this dimer formation remains unclear, and dimers and higher order oligomers have been suggested to mediate pore formation in membranes during apoptosis (23O'Neill J.W. Manion M.K. Maguire B. Hockenbery D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The energy barrier for forming the C-terminal domain-swapped dimer is relatively high, and dimerization is inhibited by the BH3 domain from BID (22Denisov A.Y. Sprules T. Fraser J. Kozlov G. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems unlikely that this form of swapping occurs when bound to the Beclin1 dimer. The effects of Bcl-xL and UVRAG on Beclin1 are modest, probably so that the reaction is reversible. For example the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between UVRAG and Beclin1 is increased from ∼5 to ∼20 μm in the presence of Bcl-xL. This indicates that the change in Beclin1 monomer/dimerization is likely to be very sensitive to the local concentrations of Bcl-2-like proteins and UVRAG, as neither prevents the other from binding. An increase in UVRAG will push the equilibrium toward Beclin1 monomers, increasing the kinase activity and autophagy, whereas an increase in the Bcl-2-like protein pushes the equilibrium toward Beclin1 dimer and inhibition of autophagy. Therefore, we suggest that Beclin1 acts as a monomer-dimer switch to control autophagy. This would explain why both UVRAG and Beclin1 are haplo-insufficient tumor suppressors, i.e. loss of a single allele of each is found in human cancers (5Aita V.M. Liang X.H. Murty V.V. Pincus D.L.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Further research will be required to identify how this Beclin1 switch transmits its effects to PI(3)KC3. The PI(3)KC3 binding site on Beclin1 includes the CCD domain of Beclin1 as well as the evolutionarily conserved domain (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). It may be that Beclin1 must be monomeric for PI(3)KC3 to stably interact with the CCD domain and form an active complex to initiate autophagy. It is not clear whether this concentration-dependent switch mechanism is used by other BH3 proteins to regulate apoptosis, as there is little indication of other BH3-only proteins forming homodimers. However, a single-allele knock-out of another BH3 protein, Bim, is counteracted by a Bcl-2 deficiency (26Bouillet P. Cory S. Zhang L.C. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), showing that the relative levels of Bcl-2-like and BH3-only proteins is crucial in deciding whether programmed cell death occurs. The interplay between Bcl-2-like proteins and UVRAG also suggests novel approaches for the development of anti-cancer agents. An important consequence of this mechanism is that compounds that disrupt the Beclin1-dimer interface or stabilize the interaction with UVRAG would be expected to activate autophagy and autophagic cell death. It will be important in future research to demonstrate that monomerization of Beclin1 alone can activate autophagy and autophagic cell death and thereby demonstrate that this is a bona fide anti-cancer target.

https://openalex.org/W1986863731,"Background Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the fifth most common cancer in the U.S. and few causes have been identified. Genetic association studies may help identify environmental risk factors and enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings 768 coding and haplotype tagging SNPs in 146 genes were examined using Illumina GoldenGate technology in a large population-based case-control study of NHL in the San Francisco Bay Area (1,292 cases 1,375 controls are included here). Statistical analyses were restricted to HIV- participants of white non-Hispanic origin. Genes involved in steroidogenesis, immune function, cell signaling, sunlight exposure, xenobiotic metabolism/oxidative stress, energy balance, and uptake and metabolism of cholesterol, folate and vitamin C were investigated. Sixteen SNPs in eight pathways and nine haplotypes were associated with NHL after correction for multiple testing at the adjusted q<0.10 level. Eight SNPs were tested in an independent case-control study of lymphoma in Germany (494 NHL cases and 494 matched controls). Novel associations with common variants in estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and in the vitamin C receptor and matrix metalloproteinase gene families were observed. Four ESR1 SNPs were associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) in the U.S. study, with rs3020314 remaining associated with reduced risk of FL after multiple testing adjustments [odds ratio (OR) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23–0.77) and replication in the German study (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.06–0.94). Several SNPs and haplotypes in the matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) and MMP9 genes and in the vitamin C receptor genes, solute carrier family 23 member 1 (SLC23A1) and SLC23A2, showed associations with NHL risk. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest a role for estrogen, vitamin C and matrix metalloproteinases in the pathogenesis of NHL that will require further validation."
https://openalex.org/W2004878316,"The antithrombotic activity of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) is largely associated with the antithrombin (AT)-binding pentasaccharide sequence AGA(*)IA (GlcN(NAc/NS,6S)-GlcA-GlcN(NS,3,6S)-IdoUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)). The location of the AGA(*)IA sequences along the LMWH chains is also expected to influence binding to AT. This study was aimed at investigating the role of the structure and molecular conformation of different disaccharide extensions on both sides of the AGA(*)IA sequence in modulating the affinity for AT. Four high purity octasaccharides isolated by size exclusion chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, and AT-affinity chromatography from the LMWH enoxaparin were selected for the study. All the four octasaccharides terminate at their nonreducing end with 4,5-unsaturated uronic acid residues (DeltaU). In two octasaccharides, AGA(*)IA was elongated at the reducing end by units IdoUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (OCTA-1) or IdoUA-GlcN(NAc,6S) (OCTA-2). In the other two octasaccharides (OCTA-3 and OCTA-4), AGA(*)IA was elongated at the nonreducing side by units GlcN(NS,6S)-IdoUA and GlcN(NS,6S)-GlcA, respectively. Extensions increased the affinity for AT of octasaccharides with respect to pentasaccharide AGA(*)IA, as also confirmed by fluorescence titration. Two-dimensional NMR and docking studies clearly indicated that, although elongation of the AGA(*)IA sequence does not substantially modify the bound conformation of the AGA(*)IA segment, extensions promote additional contacts with the protein. It should be noted that, as not previously reported, the unusual GlcA residue that precedes the AGA(*)IA sequence in OCTA-4 induced an unexpected 1 order of magnitude increase in the affinity to AT with respect to its IdoUA-containing homolog OCTA-3. Such a residue was found to orientate its two hydroxyl groups at close distance to residues of the protein. Besides the well established ionic interactions, nonionic interactions may thus contribute to strengthen oligosaccharide-AT complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2095022910,"The West Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming regions on Earth, and, as a consequence, most maritime glaciers and ice shelves in the region have significantly retreated over the past few decades. We collected a multiyear data set on ice scouring frequency from Antarctica by using unique experimental markers and scuba diving surveys. We show that the annual intensity of ice scouring is negatively correlated with the duration of the winter fast ice season. Because fast ice extent and duration is currently in decline in the region after recent rapid warming, it is likely that marine benthic communities are set for even more scouring in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2168161204,"To understand how proteins fold in vivo, it is important to investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding on protein folding. Here, the influence of crowding on in vitro apoflavodoxin folding, which involves a relatively stable off-pathway intermediate with molten globule characteristics, is reported. To mimic crowded conditions in cells, dextran 20 at 30% (w/v) is used, and its effects are measured by a diverse combination of optical spectroscopic techniques. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy shows that unfolded apoflavodoxin has a hydrodynamic radius of 37 ± 3 Å at 3 m guanidine hydrochloride. Förster resonance energy transfer measurements reveal that subsequent addition of dextran 20 leads to a decrease in protein volume of about 29%, which corresponds to an increase in protein stability of maximally 1.1 kcal mol–1. The compaction observed is accompanied by increased secondary structure, as far-UV CD spectroscopy shows. Due to the addition of crowding agent, the midpoint of thermal unfolding of native apoflavodoxin rises by 2.9 °C. Although the stabilization observed is rather limited, concomitant compaction of unfolded apoflavodoxin restricts the conformational space sampled by the unfolded state, and this could affect kinetic folding of apoflavodoxin. Most importantly, crowding causes severe aggregation of the off-pathway folding intermediate during apoflavodoxin folding in vitro. However, apoflavodoxin can be over expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, where it efficiently folds to its functional native form at high yield without noticeable problems.

The spontaneous folding of an unfolded and thus expanded protein to its compact and functional native state is dictated by its amino acid sequence (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar). Numerous studies on the refolding of chemically and thermally denatured proteins have brought us closer to understanding how the complex process of protein folding works. However, these in vitro folding studies are generally performed in simple buffer systems with low concentrations of protein, whereas the environment in which a protein folds in vivo is very different. The cell interior is densely crowded with soluble and nonsoluble macromolecules, which are present in high concentrations (2Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 3Luby-Phelps K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 192: 189-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli cells, the total concentration of protein and RNA is in the range of 300–400 g/liter (4Zimmerman S.B. Trach S.O. J. Mol.

These macromolecules collectively occupy 10–40% of the total fluid volume, restricting the volume available to any given macromolecule. In crowded solutions, all processes that result in reduction of the total volume occupied by any given macromolecular species are favored, and this is expected to affect all macromolecular reactions and equilibria, including protein folding (2Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 5Minton A.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 8Minton A.P.

Sci. 2005; 94: 1668-1675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). First, crowding destabilizes expanded unfolded protein conformations. As a result, these expanded protein molecules collapse to more compact conformations, and consequently protein folding is enhanced. Compaction of unfolded conformations due to the presence of inert macromolecular crowding agents has been demonstrated for reduced and carboxyamidated RNase T1, cytochrome c, and RNase A (11Qu Y.X. Bolen D.W. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 101: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Tokuriki N. Kinjo M. Negi S. Hoshino M. Goto Y. Urabe I. Yomo T.

Destabilization of the unfolded state due to the presence of crowding agents should increase the stability of proteins against thermal and chemical denaturation, and this stabilizing effect has indeed been reported for proteins like lysozyme, FK506-binding protein, and apomyoglobin (12Sasahara K.

Irreversible unfolding due to aggregation of unfolded states in the presence of crowding agents has been observed for reduced lysozyme, rabbit muscle creatine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase, enolase, and green fluorescent protein (19Du F.

Flavodoxins are electron carriers and consist of a single structural domain that adopts the α-β parallel topology, also known as the flavodoxin-like fold, which is widely prevalent in nature (22Alagaratnam S. van Pouderoyen G.

Steensma E. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 79: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Bollen Y.J.M. Kamphuis M.B. van Mierlo C.P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The folding data show that apoflavodoxin autonomously folds to its native state and that FMN does not act as a nucleation site for folding. NMR spectroscopy shows that apoflavodoxin is structurally identical to flavodoxin except for considerable dynamics of residues in the flavin-binding region (31Steensma E. Nijman M.J. Bollen Y.J. de Jager P.A. van den Berg W.A. van Dongen W.M. van Mierlo C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Steensma E. van Mierlo C.P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 653-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the presence of FMN, binding of the FMN cofactor to native apoflavodoxin is the last step in flavodoxin folding. The GuHCl-induced equilibrium (un)folding of apoflavodoxin is described by the three-state mechanism N ⇔ U ⇔ Ioff, in which N is the native state, U is the unfolded state, and Ioff is an off-pathway folding intermediate (27Bollen Y.J. Sanchez I.E. van Mierlo C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10475-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The off-pathway intermediate has molten globule-like properties and populates to significant extents at denaturant concentrations ranging from about 1 to 3 m GuHCl. This folding species has ∼65% of the α-helical content observed for native apoflavodoxin but lacks the characteristic tertiary structure of the native state. Also in this state, the three tryptophans of apoflavodoxin are exposed to solvent as opposed to the situation in native protein (25van Mierlo C.P. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. Van-Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26van Mierlo C.P. van den Oever J.M. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Bollen Y.J. Sanchez I.E. van Mierlo C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10475-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Part of the conformation of the intermediate is ordered and exchanges between different conformers on the micro- to millisecond time scale, and another part of the folding species is unfolded. 4S. M. Nabuurs, personal communication. This relatively compact intermediate acts as a trap during kinetic folding of apoflavodoxin. The formation of such an off-pathway species, which needs to unfold to allow folding to proceed to the native state, is typical for the topology of apoflavodoxin (29Bollen Y.J. van Mierlo C.P. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 114: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite the considerable population of the folding intermediate, which is inferred to be highly aggregation-prone due to exposed hydrophobic groups, denaturant-induced apoflavodoxin unfolding is fully reversible up to a 6 μm protein concentration. An off-pathway intermediate is also likely to populate during thermally induced unfolding of apoflavodoxin (25van Mierlo C.P. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. Van-Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Currently, the impact of macromolecular crowding on the autonomous folding of A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin in vitro is unknown and is therefore addressed in this study. To investigate the effect of crowding on GuHCl-induced apoflavodoxin (un)folding, we made use of 30% (w/v) dextran 20, since this condition mimics the crowded circumstances in the cytoplasm of cells (4Zimmerman S.B. Trach S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) and because the use of dextrans as macromolecular crowding agents is well described (12Sasahara K. McPhie P. Minton A.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Ellis R.J. Minton A.P. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 33Laurent T.C. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 34Rivas G. Fernandez J.A. Minton A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9379-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Dextrans are uncharged, inert polysaccharides. The effects of added dextran on a variety of reactions have been attributed to excluded volume (34Rivas G. Fernandez J.A. Minton A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9379-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40Zimmerman S.B. Trach S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 949: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The effects of dextrans on the properties of the different apoflavodoxin folding species are investigated using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. Thermal denaturation of apoflavodoxin in the absence and in the presence of crowding agent was followed with fluorescence emission spectroscopy. The hydrodynamic radii of apoflavodoxin folding species are determined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). In addition, single-pair Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is measured to study whether crowding leads to compaction of unfolded apoflavodoxin molecules using protein molecules that are covalently labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores. Sample Preparation—Recombinant A. vinelandii wild-type and C69A flavodoxin were expressed in E. coli cells and purified as described previously (25van Mierlo C.P. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. Van-Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Apoflavodoxin was subsequently prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (25van Mierlo C.P. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. Van-Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove oligomeric species. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 29 mm–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. Purified apoflavodoxin was aliquoted and stored at –20 °C. In all experiments except for the ones utilizing dye-labeled protein molecules, the C69A variant of apoflavodoxin was used, in which the single cysteine residue 69 is replaced by an alanine residue to avoid covalent dimerization of apoflavodoxin. This protein variant is similar to wild-type apoflavodoxin regarding both redox potential of holoprotein and stability of apoprotein (25van Mierlo C.P. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. Van-Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Steensma E. Heering H.A. Hagen W.R. Van Mierlo C.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Wild-type apoflavodoxin was labeled with AlexaFluor 488 (A488) maleimide (Invitrogen) at cysteine 69. Freshly prepared apoflavodoxin was incubated overnight in the dark at 4 °C with the dye, at a molar ratio of 1:15, in 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8. The free label and protein were separated using an Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad) followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR column. The purified labeled protein in potassium pyrophosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6.0) was subsequently aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of the S178C variant of wild-type flavodoxin and subsequent site-specific labeling of Cys-69 with A488 and of Cys-178 with AlexaFluor 568 (A568) (Invitrogen) will be described elsewhere. GuHCl (Sigma) and dextrans with average molecular masses of 6 kDa (dextran 06), 20 kDa (dextran 20), and 70 kDa (dextran 70) (Fluka Biochemika, The Netherlands) were used without further purification. All stocks and samples were prepared in 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate (Sigma) buffer, at pH 6. Samples containing dextran were prepared by adding the required quantity of dextran stock, which ranged from 40 to 60% (w/v), to apoflavodoxin in buffer at different concentrations of GuHCl. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—FCS measurements were performed on a ConfoCor 2 setup (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The details of the setup have been described before (42Hink M.A. Borst J.W. Visser A.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Samples were excited with the 488-nm laser line from an argon-ion laser, which was focused with a water-immersion C-apochromat ×40 objective lens (Carl Zeiss). Fluorescence was detected by an avalanche photodiode after being filtered through a 505–550-nm band pass filter. Excitation power was ∼11 microwatts. Measurements were performed on samples contained in a glass bottom microplate with 8 wells (Nunc chambered cover-glass; Lab-tech, Wiesbaden, Germany), which was maintained at 25 °C with the help of a water bath. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before the start of each measurement. Each sample contained 25 nm dye-labeled apoflavodoxin. To minimize adsorption of dye-labeled protein, ∼4 μm nonlabeled protein was added to all samples. Five FCS data traces, each of 60 s duration, were recorded of each sample. FCS data were analyzed using FCS Data Processor version 1.5 (43Skakun V.V. Hink M.A. Digris A.V. Engel R. Novikov E.G. Apanasovich V.V. Visser A.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The autocorrelation function G(τ) was fitted with a model that describes Brownian motion of a single species in three dimensions with an additional term for fast fluctuations due to molecules entering a nonfluorescent triplet state (44Hess S.T. Huang S. Heikal A.A. Webb W.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). G(τ)=1+1N⋅(1+Ftripe−τ/Ttrip1−Ftrip)(1+ττd)1+(ωxyωz)2ττd Here, N represents the average number of molecules present in the confocal detection volume, τd is the diffusion time, ωxy and ωz are the equatorial and axial radii of the confocal volume, respectively, Ftrip is the fraction of molecules in the nonfluorescent triplet state, and Ttrip is the relaxation time of the triplet state. During analysis, τd values obtained from repeat FCS measurements using the same sample were linked. The ratio ωz/ωxy was determined by calibration with a solution containing free A488 molecules and varied between 5 and 8 for different samples. The diffusion time τd is related to the diffusion coefficient (D) according to Equation 2, τd=ωxy24D in which ωxy of the instrumental setup was calculated using rhodamine 110. For samples in buffer, ωxy was ∼150 nm. The Stokes-Einstein equation relates the diffusion time of a globular species to its hydrodynamic radius (rh), D=kT6π⋅n⋅rh in which k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and n is the viscosity of the solution. Taking τd obtained for native apoflavodoxin at 25 °C in buffer (n = 1 × 10–3 centipoises) and using Equations 2 and 3, the corresponding hydrodynamic radius of the native molecule was calculated. The hydrodynamic radius of apoflavodoxin at different GuHCl concentrations was calculated from the corresponding diffusion times of dye-labeled apoflavodoxin measured with FCS. Upon increasing the concentration GuHCl, solvent viscosity and refractive index also increase, and thus the dimensions of the confocal volume are affected, giving rise to an apparently larger τd (45Chattopadhyay K. Saffarian S. Elson E.L. Frieden C. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1413-1422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To correct for these changes, the ratio of τd of the dye-labeled protein at a specific GuHCl concentration and the τd of free A488 at exactly the same GuHCl concentration (τd apo,[GuHCl]/ τd A488,[GuHCl]) was calculated. Assuming that the hydrodynamic radius of A488 is unaffected by GuHCl, the change in τd of A488 is entirely due to viscosity and refractive index influences caused by GuHCl. Thus, the changes in apoflavodoxin-A488 diffusion relative to the diffusion of free A488 molecules are independent of refractive index and viscosity effects and are proportional to the real change in protein hydrodynamic radius as it unfolds. The average hydrodynamic radius of apoflavodoxin at a given GuHCl concentration (rapo,[GuHCl]) is calculated according to Equation 4, rapo,[GuHCl]=rapo,0M⋅(τd apo,[GuHCl]τd A488,[GuHCl])(τd A488,0Mτd apo,0M) in which τd apo and τd A488 are the diffusion times of dye-labeled apoflavodoxin and A488, respectively, and the subscript [GuHCl] refers to the concentration of GuHCl used. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Varian; Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands) equipped with a Peltier accessory (Varian) for temperature control. Emission spectra ranging from 300 to 700 nm of apoflavodoxin in different solvents were obtained by exciting samples at 280 nm. The emission and excitation slits were set at 5 nm. Protein concentration in all samples was 2 μm. Protein Refolding Followed by Fluorescence Emission—In the case of refolding measurements, fluorescence intensity of the different apoflavodoxin samples before and after dilution of denaturant was acquired for a period of 30 s at 340 nm and subsequently averaged. Before dilution, protein concentration in all samples was 2 μm. Crowding agent was added to 30% (w/v) to apoflavodoxin unfolded in a final concentration of 2 or 3 m GuHCl. After about 30 min, both solutions were diluted 10-fold through the addition of buffer that also contained 30% (w/v) dextran 20. The recovery of native protein in terms of percentage of fluorescence intensity at 340 nm was compared with the fully reversible recovery of native protein in an experiment in which no crowding agent was present. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Determination of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer in Dye-labeled Apoflavodoxin—S178C apoflavodoxin, labeled with A488 at Cys-69 and with A568 at Cys-178, was excited at 475 nm, and subsequently fluorescence emission spectra ranging from 480 to 700 nm were recorded in various solvent conditions at 25 °C. Protein concentration in all samples was 84 nm. The excitation slit was set at 2.5 nm, and the emission slit was set at 5 nm. To avoid loss of signal due to protein adsorption, 0.001% Tween 20 (v/v) was also added to the samples. This addition does not affect apoflavodoxin folding. Similarly, fluorescence emission spectra of wild-type apoflavodoxin labeled with A488 at position Cys-69 (donor only) and present in identical solvent conditions as double dye-labeled S178C apoflavodoxin were obtained under an identical instrumental setup. All fluorescence emission spectra were corrected by subtracting emission spectra of the corresponding blank solutions. The Förster radius (R0) of the A488/A568 pair attached to apoflavodoxin was calculated according to Ref. 46Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar, R06=8.785⋅1023⋅κ2⋅QD⋅J⋅η−4 in which, κ2 is the orientation factor for the donor and acceptor transition dipole moments, Qd is the quantum yield of the donor, J is the spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption (in m–1 cm3), and η is the refractive index of the medium between the two dyes. R0 was calculated according to Equation 5, taking into account that both donor and acceptor fluorophores are randomly oriented (κ2 = 2/3). Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of labeled apoflavodoxin molecules show that the dyes exhibit rapid rotational motions (data not shown). The values of Qd and J of the fluorophores attached to apoflavodoxin were determined at each solvent condition used. Qd for protein in buffer is 0.84 ± 0.03, and Qd for protein in buffer containing 30% (w/v) dextran is 0.74 ± 0.03. Upon the addition of GuHCl, Qd reduces; for protein in buffer containing 3 m GuHCl, Qd is 0.57 ± 0.02, and for protein in buffer containing 3 m GuHCl and 30% (w/v) dextran, Qd is 0.50 ± 0.02. J was calculated to be 3.0 ± 0.1 10–13 m–1 cm3 using a value of 91,300 m–1 cm–1 for the extinction coefficient of A568. We have used a value of 1.60 ± 0.02 for the refractive index for the folded protein (47Babul J. Stellwagen E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 28: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 48Knox R.S. van Amerongen H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 5289-5293Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 49Toptygin D. Savtchenko R.S. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Brand L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 3724-3734Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The solvent refractive indices are 1.389345 ± 0.000003 for 3 m GuHCl and 1.431550 ± 0.000003 for 3 m GuHCl containing 30% (w/v) dextran. Thus, the value of η used for the calculation is 1.50 ± 0.02 for protein in 3 m GuHCl, and η is 1.52 ± 0.02 for 3 m GuHCl containing 30% (w/v) dextran, assuming that the medium between the dyes is composed of 50% protein and 50% solvent (50Nienhaus G.U. Macromol. Biosci. 2006; 6: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using the values given above and Equation 5, we calculate that R0 for protein in 3 m GuHCl is 52.0 ± 0.5 Å, and R0 for denatured protein in 3 m GuHCl containing 30% (w/v) dextran is 50.4 ± 0.5 Å. A similar calculation for the protein in buffer, in the absence and in the presence of dextran, leads to R0 of 53.1 ± 0.5 and 52.0 ± 0.5 Å, respectively. FRET efficiencies (E) were calculated using Equation 6, E=1−FDAFD where FDA is the intensity of donor in the presence of acceptor, and FD is the intensity of donor only, both determined at the emission maximum of the donor (i.e. at 522 nm, when the donor is attached to Cys-69 of apoflavodoxin) and at equal absorbances at the excitation wavelength. The distance between donor and acceptor (R) was calculated using Equation 7, R=R01E−16 Thermal Unfolding Measurements—Thermal unfolding of apoflavodoxin was achieved by increasing the temperature from 25 to 65 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min, unless mentioned otherwise. The protein was excited at 280 nm, and fluorescence emission was recorded at 330, 340, and 350 nm. The excitation and emission slits were set at 5 nm. Protein concentration in all experiments was ∼2 μm. The unfolding curves obtained were globally fit to Equation 8, F=(an+bnT)+(au+buT)e−ΔGu(T)/RT1+e−ΔGu(T)/RT in which F is the observed fluorescence intensity at a given temperature T, and a and b are the intercept and slope, respectively, of pretransition (subscript n) and post-transition (subscript u) base lines. R is the molar gas constant. ΔGu(T) is the change in free energy upon protein unfolding and is defined as follows, ΔGu(T)=[ΔHm(1−T/Tm)−ΔCp((Tm−T)+Tln(T/Tm))] in which ΔHm and ΔCp are the changes in enthalpy and heat capacity associated with protein unfolding, respectively. Tm is the midpoint of the thermal unfolding curve, the temperature at which ΔGu(T) = 0. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) using quartz cuvettes (Starna, Hainault, UK) with 1-mm cell length. In case of far-UV CD measurements, 10 wavelength scans of 4 μm protein were acquired, and the resulting spectra were subsequently averaged. In case of near-UV measurements, 15 wavelength scans of 23.5 μm protein were acquired, and the resulting spectra were averaged. All scans were obtained at a rate of 20 nm/min. All CD spectra of apoflavodoxin were corrected by subtracting the CD spectra of the corresponding blank solutions. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Hydrodynamic Radii of Apoflavodoxin Folding Species in the Absence of Crowding—The hydrodynamic radius of apoflavodoxin molecules at various stages of GuHCl-induced denaturation was determined using A488-labeled apoflavodoxin and FCS. Labeling with A488 only marginally destabilized native apoflavodoxin (data not shown). A model that describes diffusion of a single protein species in three dimensions with diffusion time τd (Equation 1) fits very well to the FCS data obtained for apoflavodoxin at all concentrations GuHCl used. Consequently, in the range of 1–3 m denaturant, τd is an averaged property that reflects the contribution of the various apoflavodoxin states that are populated (Fig. 1B). Using the average diffusion time τd as input, the hydrodynamic radius of protein molecules can be derived using Equations , 2 and 3. However, increasing the concentration of GuHCl led to alterations in viscosi"

Here we show that phosphorylation of human HsMis13 by Aurora B kinase is required for functional kinetochore assembly in HeLa cells. Aurora B interacts with HsMis13 in vitro and in vivo. HsMis13 is a cognate substrate of Aurora B, and the phosphorylation sites were mapped to Ser-100 and Ser-109. Suppression of Aurora B kinase by either small interfering RNA or chemical inhibitors abrogates the localization of HsMis13 but not HsMis12 to the kinetochore. In addition, non-phosphorylatable but not wild type and phospho-mimicking HsMis13 failed to localize to the kinetochore, demonstrating the requirement of phosphorylation by Aurora B for the assembly of HsMis13 to kinetochore. In fact, localization of HsMis13 to the kinetochore is spatiotemporally regulated by Aurora B kinase, which is essential for recruiting outer kinetochore components such as Ndc80 components and CENP-E for functional kinetochore assembly. Importantly, phospho-mimicking mutant HsMis13 restores the assembly of CENP-E to the kinetochore, and tension developed across the sister kinetochores in Aurora B-inhibited cells. Thus, we reason that HsMis13 phosphorylation by Aurora B is required for organizing a stable bi-oriented microtubule kinetochore attachment that is essential for faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis.

Thus, we reason that HsMis13 phosphorylation by Aurora B is required for organizing a stable bi-oriented microtubule kinetochore attachment that is essential for faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis. The kinetochore is a super-molecular complex assembled at each centromere in eukaryotes. It provides a chromosomal attachment point for the mitotic spindle, linking the chromosome to the microtubules and functions in initiating, controlling, and monitoring the movements of chromosomes during mitosis. The kinetochore of animal cells contains two functional domains; that is, the inner kinetochore, which is tightly and persistently associated with centromeric DNA sequences throughout the cell cycle and the outer kinetochore which is composed of many dynamic protein complexes that interact with microtubules only during mitosis. The stable propagation of eukaryotic cells requires each chromosome to be accurately duplicated and faithfully segregated. During mitosis, attaching, positioning, and bi-orientating kinetochores with the spindle microtubules play critical roles in chromosome segregation and genomic stability (see Refs. 1Cleveland D.W.

The key switch for the onset of mitosis is the archetypal cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. In addition to the master mitotic kinase Cdk1, three other protein serine/threonine kinase families are also involved, including the Polo kinases, Aurora kinases, and the NEK 3The abbreviations used are: NEKNIMA-related kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasesiRNAsmall inhibitory RNADAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: NEKNIMA-related kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasesiRNAsmall inhibitory RNADAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of NEK kinase in stabilization of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment (e.g. Ref. 5Fu G. Ding X. Yuan K. Aikhionbare F. Yao J. Cai X. Jiang K. Yao X. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the critical role of Aurora B kinase in kinetochore bi-orientation (e.g. Ref. 6Tanaka T.U. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whereas the mechanism ensuring chromosome bi-orientation lies at the heart of chromosome segregation control, the molecular details remain elusive.Early studies to isolate temperature-sensitive fission yeast mutants that displayed high loss rates of mini-chromosomes at permissive or semi-permissive temperatures led Yanagida and co-workers (7Takahashi K. Yamada H. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) to identify 12 genetic loci (Mis1-12). Their subsequent studies show that centromere proteins Mis12 and Mis6 determine the proper metaphase spindle length and are required for faithful chromosome segregation in yeast (e.g. Ref. 8Goshima G. Saitoh S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Initial studies of the Mis12 orthologue in human cells suggest that it is required for proper chromosome alignment and segregation (9Goshima G. Kuyomitsu K. Yoda D. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 60: 25-39Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the Mis12 complex contains four components (Mis12, Dsn1, Nsl1, and Nnf1), which are conserved from yeast to human (Refs. 10Chesseman I.M. Niessen A. Anderson S. Hyndman F.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2919-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; for clarity we referred them as HsMis12, HsMis13, HsMis14, and HsMis15, respectively). These four proteins function at the inner kinetochores are required for proper chromosome alignment and chromosome segregation in mitosis (13Kline S.L. Cheeseman I.M. Hori T. Fukagawa T. Desai A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Mis12 complex assembly to the kinetochore and the regulation of its association with other kinetochore complexes such as Ndc80 remained elusive.Recent studies suggest a critical role for Aurora B in kinetochore bi-orientation and aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachment correction. To delineate the regulatory function of Aurora B in kinetochore protein-protein interactions, we adopted a quick search for Aurora B-binding proteins using a “high content” Far Western assay that had successfully identified NEK2A-Sgo1 and NEK2A-Hec1 interactions (5Fu G. Ding X. Yuan K. Aikhionbare F. Yao J. Cai X. Jiang K. Yao X. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14He X. Rines D.R. Espelin C.W. Sorger P.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This approach led to the identification of an interrelationship between Aurora B and HsMis13. Our biochemical characterization demonstrated that HsMis13 is a novel substrate of Aurora B. Most importantly, the phosphorylation of HsMis13 by Aurora B is essential for assembly of functional kinetochore. We propose that Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of HsMis13 provides a regulatory mechanism underlying kinetochore assembly and bi-orientation essential for faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa and 293T cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained as subconfluent monolayers in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Cells were synchronized at G1/S with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and cultured in thymidine-free medium for 12 h to release. After another round of thymidine treatment for 12 h, cells were released for 9 h to reach prometaphase and 11 h to synchronize at telophase. In some cases 100 nm nocodazole was added to cell culture for 18 h to synchronize cells in prometaphase.cDNA Construction—To generate GFP-tagged full-length HsMis13, PCR-amplified HsMis13 cDNA was digested with BgLII and SalI and then cloned into pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech). The bacterial expression constructs of HsMis13 were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) with SmaI digestion. FLAG-tagged HsMis13 cDNA was cloned by inserting the PCR product into the p3XFLAG-myc-CMV-24 vector (Sigma) with EcoRV digestion. GFP-tagged non-phosphorylatable and phosphormimetic HsMis13 mutants were created by standard PCR methods as described previously (e.g. Ref. 15Cao X. Ding X. Guo X. Zhou R. Forte J.G. Teng M. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13584-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced in full.Recombinant Protein Expression—Human HsMis13 was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein. Briefly, 500 ml of LB media was inoculated with bacteria Rosetta (DE3) pLysS transformed with GST-HsMis13. The protein expression was initiated by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation at 16 °C for 12 h. Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) followed by sonication and clarification. The GST fusion protein in bacteria in the soluble fraction was purified by using glutathione-agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol.Antibodies—Affinity purification of CENP-E rabbit antibody was described previously (16Yao X. Anderson K. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody to Nuf2 was purchased from Abcam and diluted at 1:1000 for Western blot and 1:300 for immunofluorescence. Mouse monoclonal antibody to Hec1 was purchased from Abcam and diluted at 1:1000 for Western blot and 1:500 for immunofluorescence. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to GST was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blot. Mouse monoclonal antibody to GFP was obtained from BD Biosciences.Purified His-HsMis13 from inclusion body was used to immunize rabbit and Balb/C mice according to the general protocol. The purified IgG was obtained by affinity purification using an HsMis13 affinity matrix based on CNBr-activated agarose beads (Sigma).Immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (e.g. Ref. 17Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells growing on 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected with appropriate plasmids for 36 h. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 25 μl of 50% slurry of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) for 4 h at 4°C. After washing 3 times in cold lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. For immunoblotting, mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was diluted 1:2000 and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal (Sigma) was diluted to 3 μg/ml.In some instances HeLa cells were synchronized at prophase and telophase as described above. The cells were then lysed using lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added before use). HsMis13 antibody was incubated with protein A/G beads. Protein-bound protein A/G beads were washed 3 times by wash buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added just before use) to prepare for the immunoprecipitation experiment. These antibody-bound A/G beads were added to cell lysate and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. After incubation, beads were washed four times with wash buffer and once with PBS. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane to perform Western blot.For immunoprecipitation of transiently transfected cells, HeLa cells were generally collected 42 h after transfection of GFP-HsMis13 and GFP-HsMis13AA, which included an 18-h nocodazole synchronization. Cellular proteins were solubilized in lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation. GFP-HsMis13 proteins were precipitated using a rabbit anti-GFP antibody bound to protein-A/G beads (Pierce). Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and then boiled in protein sample buffer for 2 min. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with antibodies against GFP and phospho-serine (Sigma) as described (5Fu G. Ding X. Yuan K. Aikhionbare F. Yao J. Cai X. Jiang K. Yao X. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Transfection and Immunofluorescence—Cells were transfected with small inhibitory RNA (siRNA)- or GFP-tagged plasmids in a 24-well plate by Oligofectamine reagent and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacture's manuals.For immunofluorescence, HeLa cells were seeded onto sterile, acid-treated 12-mm coverslips in 24-well plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, New York). Double thymidine-blocked and -released HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 premixed with 1 μg of various plasmids as described above. In general, 36-48 h after transfection, HeLa cells were rinsed for 1 min with PHEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 4 m glycerol) and permeabilized for 1 min with PHEM plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Extracted cells were then fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PHEM and rinsed three times in PBS. Cells on the coverslips were blocked with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). These cells were incubated with various primary antibodies in a humidified chamber for 1 h and then washed three times in TPBS. Primary antibodies were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. DNA was stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma).Antibodies against HpX, GFP, Nuf2, Hec1, ACA, HsMis12, and HsMis13 were used at the dilution of 1:500, 1:300, 1:300, 1:500, 1:500, 1:100, and 1:100, respectively. Images were acquired using an Axiovert200 inverted Microscope (Carl Zeiss) with Axiovision 3.0 software.In Vitro Kinase Assay—His-tagged Aurora B kinase was expressed in bacteria and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The kinase reactions were performed in 40 μl of 1× kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm di-thiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA) containing 1 μl of eluted Aurora B kinase, 5 μl of glutathione bead-bound GST-Mis13, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm ATP. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped with 2× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and dried, and the 32P incorporation into HsMis13 proteins was quantified by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The specific incorporation of 32P into wild type HsMis13 and non-phosphorylatable HsMis13S100A/S109A was normalized to protein levels and expressed as relative activity to the wild type protein.siRNA—For the siRNA studies, the 21-mer of siRNA duplexes against HsMis13 and Aurora B were synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO) as previously described (11Obuse C. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13Kline S.L. Cheeseman I.M. Hori T. Fukagawa T. Desai A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Johnson V.L. Scott M.I.F. Holt S.V. Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 117: 1577-1589Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As a control, either a duplex targeting cyclophilin or scramble sequence was used (11Obuse C. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).The transfection efficiency was judged based on the uptake of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated oligonucleotides, whereas the efficiency of siRNA-mediated protein suppression was judged by Western blotting analysis (e.g. Ref. 11Obuse C. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). After trial experiments using a series of concentration and time course assay, treatment of 150 nm for 36 h was finally selected as the most efficient conditions for repressing target proteins.Fluorescence Intensity Quantification and Kinetochore Distance Measurement—Fluorescence intensity of kinetochore protein labeling was measured by using the confocal microscope LSM510 NLO (Carl Zeiss) scan head mounted transversely to an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss) with a 100 × 1.3 NA PlanApo objective. The images from double labeling were collected using a dichroic filter set with Zeiss image processing software (LSM 5, Carl Zeiss). The distance between sister kinetochores marked with ACA was measured as the distance between the peak fluorescence as previously described (17Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).The quantification of the level of kinetochore-associated protein was conducted as described by Johnson et al., (18Johnson V.L. Scott M.I.F. Holt S.V. Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 117: 1577-1589Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and more recently by Liu et al. (24Liu D. Ding X. Du J. Cai X. Huang Y. Ward T. Shaw A. Yang Y. Hu R. Jin C. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21415-21424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, the average pixel intensities from at least 100 kinetochore pairs from five cells were measured, and background pixel intensities were subtracted. The pixel intensities at each kinetochore pair were then normalized against ACA pixel values to account for any variations in staining or image acquisition. The values of specific siRNA-treated cells were then plotted as a percentage of the values obtained from cells transfected with a control siRNA duplex.RESULTSHsMis13 Is a Novel Aurora B Binding Partner—To delineate the molecular mechanism underlying Aurora B regulation in kinetochore protein-protein interaction networks, we immobilized bacterially recombinant kinetochore proteins onto a nitrocellulous membrane to conduct a quick search for Aurora B-binding proteins using a high content Far Western assay (5Fu G. Ding X. Yuan K. Aikhionbare F. Yao J. Cai X. Jiang K. Yao X. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14He X. Rines D.R. Espelin C.W. Sorger P.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The Aurora B binding activity was then detected by an anti-Aurora B monoclonal antibody. One advantage of such a high-content assay is to screen a large number of potential interacting proteins in parallel yet avoid initial intensive labor spent on purifying large quantities of proteins required for pull-down assays. This assay has detected the binding activity of several known Aurora B-interacting proteins, such as Hec1, validating the sensitivity of such an assay (supplemental Fig. 1). This assay is very specific, as Aurora B was never found to be associated with GST tag, maltose-binding protein tag, or bovine serum albumin. Interestingly, Aurora B was found to associate with HsMis13 immobilized onto the membrane (supplemental Fig. 1, C1), suggesting a potential interaction between Aurora B kinase and HsMis13 protein.To examine whether HsMis13 forms a cognate complex with Aurora B in cells, we carried out an immunoprecipitation using mitotic lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected to express FLAG-HsMis13 and GFP-Aurora B (both wild type and kinase death mutant). As shown in Fig. 1A, Western blot using GFP antibody confirmed that Aurora B was pulled down by FLAG-HsMis13 (lanes 5 and 6; upper blot). However, a greater amount of wild type Aurora B was recovered in FLAG-HsMis13 immunoprecipitates compared with that of kinase-death Aurora B mutant. No GFP tag was precipitated with FLAG-HsMis13 (lane 4). Thus, we conclude that HsMis13 interacts with Aurora B in vivo.If HsMis13 is a cognate binding partner of Aurora B, they should co-distribute to kinetochore of mitotic cells. To this end we performed an immunocytochemical staining in which an anti-HsMis13 rabbit antibody and an anti-Aurora B mouse antibody were employed to mark their kinetochore distribution. As shown in Fig. 1B, Aurora B displayed a typical inner kinetochore distribution from prophase to metaphase in HeLa cells (arrows; c, g, and k), whereas HsMis13 exhibited a typical pair of separated kinetochore spots (arrowheads; a, e, and i).The merged image confirmed their relative co-distribution at the centromere (arrow; d, h, and l). HsMis13 Is a Novel Substrate of Aurora B—Because HsMis13 binds to Aurora B in vivo, we sought to test if HsMis13 is a substrate of Aurora B. Our computational analysis suggests that Ser-100 and Ser-109 are potential substrates of Aurora B (19Xue Y. Zhou F. Lu H. Chen G. Yao X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which are conserved among vertebrate HsMis13 proteins. To test whether Ser-100 and Ser-109 are substrates of Aurora B, we performed in vitro phosphorylation on recombinant GST-HsMis13 fusion proteins, including both wild type HsMis13 and non-phosphorylatable HsMis13 mutants in which Ser-100 and Ser-109 were both replaced by alanine (HsMis13S100A/S109A). Both GST fusion proteins, wild type and mutant HsMis13S100A/S109A, migrated to about the predicted 68 kDa as shown in Fig. 1C. Incubation of the fusion proteins with [32P]ATP and His-Aurora B resulted in the incorporation of 32P into wild type but not HsMis13S100A/S109A mutant (Fig. 1C, upper panel). This Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation is specific, as incubation of HsMis13 with [32P]ATP in the absence of Aurora B resulted in no detectable incorporation of radioactivity into the wild type protein (data not shown). The specific incorporation of 32P into wild type protein versus non-phosphorylatable mutant was quantified and shown in Fig. 1D, which show that only background level 32P was incorporated into non-phosphorylatable HsMis13 protein in the presence of active Aurora B kinase. Thus, we conclude that both Ser-100 and Ser-109 on HsMis13 are substrates of Aurora B in vitro.If HsMis13 is a substrate of Aurora B in vivo, suppression of Aurora B kinase activity using chemical inhibitors, such as VX-680 (20Harrington E.A. Bebbington D. Moore J. Rasmussen R.K. Ajose-adeogun A.O. Nakayama T. Graham J.A. Demur C. Hercend T. Diu-Hercend A. Su M. Grolec J.M. Miller K.M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), would alter endogenous HsMis13 phosphorylation. Indeed, suppression of Aurora B using VX-680 reduced serine phosphorylation of HsMis13 immunopurified from mitotic HeLa cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that HsMis13 is a cognate substrate of Aurora B in mitosis.To validate if Ser-100 and Ser-109 are Aurora B substrates in vivo, we conducted an anti-GFP immunoprecipitation of nocodazole-arrested mitotic cell lysates from HeLa cells transiently transfected to express GFP-HsMis13 and GFP-HsMis13S100A/S109A proteins. Importantly, GFP-HsMis13 protein but not GFP-HsMis13S100A/S109A mutant protein contains serine phosphorylation judging by anti-phosphoserine Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1F). Thus, we conclude that Ser-100 and Ser-109 of HsMis13 are endogenous substrates of Aurora B in mitotic cells.Aurora B Kinase Activity Controls the Kinetochore Localization of HsMis13—To investigate the possible influence of Aurora B on the localization of HsMis13 to the kinetochore, we introduced siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes to Aurora B by transfection into HeLa cells. Trial experiments revealed that treatment of HeLa cells with 150 nm siRNA for 36 h produced an optimal suppression of the target protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blot with an anti-Aurora B antibody revealed that the siRNA oligonucleotide caused remarkable suppression of Aurora B protein levels at 36 h. This suppression is relatively specific as it did not alter the levels of other proteins such as tubulin and HsMis13.FIGURE 2Aurora B kinase determines the kinetochore localization of HsMis13. A, Aurora B siRNA suppressed the Aurora B protein accumulation. Aliquots of HeLa cells were transfected with Aurora B siRNA and scramble control as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were then harvested for SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting analyses of the efficiency on suppression of Aurora B protein (upper panel) and specificity of this siRNA-mediated Aurora B depletion (middle and lower panel). B, suppression of Aurora B prevented kinetochore distribution of HsMis13. Aliquots of HeLa cells were transfected with Aurora B siRNA and scramble control as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were then harvested for immunofluorescence staining of HsMis13 (green), Aurora B (red), and DNA (blue). HsMis13 co-distributes with Aurora B to the kinetochore of scramble-transfected cells (d and h). Suppression of Aurora B by siRNA eliminates the kinetochore localization of Mis13 (a′ and e′). Note that Aurora B siRNA-treated cells displayed a typical chromosome congressional defect in mitotic cells. The scale bar represents 10 μm. C, inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity eliminated kinetochore localization of HsMis13. Aliquots of HeLa cells were treated with an Aurora B inhibitor VX-680 and DMSO as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were then harvested for immunofluorescence staining of HsMis13 (green), phospho-Ser-10-histone 3 (red), and DNA (blue). Phospho-Ser-10-histone labeling distributes to the mitotic chromosome arms in DMSO-treated cells (c). Inhibition of Aurora B by 1 μm VX-680 suppressed phosphorylation of Ser-10 of histone 3 and eliminated the kinetochore localization of HsMis13 (a′). The scale bar represents 10 μm. D, quantitation of HsMis13 levels at kinetochores of control, Aurora B siRNA-treated, and VX-680-treated and hesperadin (Hersp.)-treated cells. The pixel intensities of HsMis13 normalized to the ACA signal in control, and Aurora B-repressed and Aurora B kinase activity-inhibited cells were measured. Values represent the means ± S.E. of at least 100 kinetochores in 10 different cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we examined the effect of repressing Aurora B on the localization of HsMis13 to the kinetochore. HeLa cells were subcultured on coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with siRNA. In control scramble siRNA-transfected cultures, Aurora B and HsMis13 were co-distributed to the kinetochore of prometaphase and metaphase cells (Fig. 2B, a-h). In cells in which Aurora B had been suppressed, the levels of kinetochore-bound HsMis13 appeared reduced (Fig. 2B; a′-h′). Quantification of normalized pixel intensities shows that, when Aurora B was reduced to less than 11% that of its control value, HsMis13 levels were reduced to ∼29%, indicating that Aurora B is required for efficient kinetochore localization of HsMis13 (Fig. 2D).Because Aurora B and HsMis13 form a stable complex, failure of HsMis13 localization to the kinetochore could be mediated by their physical interactions. To assess whether Aurora B kinase activity rather than its physical interaction with HsMis13 controls the kinetochore localization of HsMis13, we sought to use Aurora B inhibitor VX-680 and hesperadin to suppress Aurora kinase activity and then assess the effect of Aurora B inhibition on the localization of HsMis13 to the kinetochore. As shown in Fig. 2C (c′), 1 μm VX-680 almost completely suppressed histone 3 phosphorylation on"

Although Southern Hemisphere records do not reveal a distinct climate reversal during the late glacial period, many mountain glaciers readvanced. We show that the Puerto Bandera moraine (50 degrees S), which records a readvance of the Southern Patagonian Icefield (SPI), formed at, or shortly after, the end of the YD. The exposure age (10.8 +/- 0.5 thousand years ago) is contemporaneous with the highest shoreline of Lago Cardiel (49 degrees S), which records peak precipitation east of the Andes since 13 thousand years ago. Absent similar moraines west of the Andes, these data indicate an SPI response to increased amounts of easterly-sourced precipitation-reflecting changes in the Southern Westerly circulation-rather than regional cooling."
https://openalex.org/W1972485223,"Colicins are cytotoxic proteins secreted by certain strains of Escherichia coli. Colicin M is unique among these toxins in that it acts in the periplasm and specifically inhibits murein biosynthesis by hydrolyzing the pyrophosphate linkage between bactoprenol and the murein precursor. We crystallized colicin M and determined the structure at 1.7A resolution using x-ray crystallography. The protein has a novel structure composed of three domains with distinct functions. The N-domain is a short random coil and contains the exposed TonB box. The central domain includes a hydrophobic alpha-helix and binds presumably to the FhuA receptor. The C-domain is composed of a mixed alpha/beta-fold and forms the phosphatase. The architectures of the individual modules show no similarity to known structures. Amino acid replacements in previously isolated inactive colicin M mutants are located in the phosphatase domain, which contains a number of surface-exposed residues conserved in predicted bacteriocins of other bacteria. The novel phosphatase domain displays no sequence similarity to known phosphatases. The N-terminal and central domains are not conserved among bacteriocins, which likely reflect the distinct import proteins required for the uptake of the various bacteriocins. The homology pattern supports our previous proposal that colicins evolved by combination of distinct functional domains."

The C-terminal PH-C1 tandem of ROCKs has been implicated to play an autoinhibitory role by sequestering the N-terminal kinase domain and reducing its kinase activity. The binding of lipids to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain not only regulates the localization of the protein but also releases the kinase domain from the close conformation and thereby activates its kinase activity.

In this study, we demonstrate that ROCK is a new member of the split PH domain family of proteins. The ROCK split PH domain folds into a canonical PH domain structure. The insertion of the atypical C1 domain in the middle does not alter the structure of the PH domain. We further show that the C1 domain of ROCK lacks the diacylglycerol/phorbol ester binding pocket seen in other canonical C1 domains. Instead, the inserted C1 domain and the PH domain function cooperatively in binding to membrane bilayers via the unconventional positively charged surfaces on each domain.

It was demonstrated in α-syntrophin that the PDZ domain insertion functions synergistically with the split PH domain in binding to lipid membranes (1Yan J. Wen W. Xu W. Long J.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) insertion in the split PH domain of PIKE was found to coordinate with the split PH domain in the membrane attachment of the protein, and the PHN-NLS-PHC supramodule may function as a cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling switch to regulate the subcellular localization of both PIKE-L and PIKE-A (4Yan J. Wen W. Chan L.N. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although the SH2-SH2-SH3 tandem insertion in the split PH domain of PLCγ was implicated in the regulation of the lipase activity of the enzyme, the mechanistic basis of this regulation is still unclear (2Wen W.

Rho kinases (ROCKs) are the major downstream effectors of Rho GTPase. They are involved in many aspects of cellular processes, such as stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, cell morphology, cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, cytokinesis, membrane ruffling, smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, and neurite outgrowth (7Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 8Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Two ROCK isoforms, ROCK I (also known as ROKβ and p160 ROCK) and ROCK II (also known as ROKα), have been identified, and they share 65% amino acid sequence identity and 95% homology (9Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Among protein kinase neighbors, ROCKs are most closely related to myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) and citron Rho-interacting kinase (CRIK) (12Leung T. Chen X.Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All of these kinases share the same domain organization, which consists of an N-terminal kinase domain, a central coiled-coil region, and various functional motifs at their respective C termini. In ROCKs, these motifs include a Rho binding (RB) domain and a PH domain that is split into two halves by an internal cysteine-rich C1 domain (also referred to as the CRD, supplemental Fig. 1A). MRCK and CRIK also each contain a C-terminal PH and C1 domain, but the two domains are arranged next to each other instead of in the split PH domain arrangement (supplemental Fig. 1B). Another common feature of these kinases is that their catalytic activities are tightly regulated by autoinhibitory mechanisms. In MRCK, the kinase inhibitory motif acts as a negative regulator by directly binding to the kinase catalytic domain (14Ng Y. Tan I. Lim L. Leung T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34156-34164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, the C1 and PH domains have also been implied to inhibit the activity of MRCK (15Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the binding of diacylglycerol (DAG)/phorbol ester to the C1 domain somehow releases the kinase inhibition by the kinase inhibitory motif (16Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Choi S.H. Czifra G. Kedei N. Lewin N.E. Lazar J. Pu Y. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10543-10549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CRIK has a similar C1 domain that more closely resembles the MRCK C1 domain than the ROCK C1 domain, and the CRIK C1 domain might play a regulatory role to the kinase activity of the enzyme (13Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T.

Narumiya S. Matsumura F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1745-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanism of the kinase activity of ROCK is somewhat better studied. The C-terminal RB domain and the PH-C1 domain of ROCK sequester its N-terminal kinase domain and thus suppress its kinase activity (20Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The deletion of the C-terminal RB and PH-C1 domains renders the mutant kinase constitutively active in vitro (9Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In vivo, ROCK I can be activated by the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of its C-terminal domains (22Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The binding of GTP-bound active Rho to the RB domain also releases the autoinhibition of the kinase (11Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Finally, lipids, such as arachidonic acid and PI(3,4,5)P3, have been reported to activate ROCK as well as to regulate its subcellular localization, presumably by binding to its PH domain (23Feng J. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Ichikawa K. Amano M. Isaka N. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how the ROCK PH domain interacts with the lipids. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the ROCK PH domain does not contain the signature phosphoinositide-binding motif found in typical lipid binding PH domains (25Thomas C.C. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26Ferguson K.M. Kavran J.M. Sankaran V.G. Fournier E. Isakoff S.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Additionally, it is not known whether the C1 domain of ROCK can also bind to DAG/phorbol ester and thereby regulate its kinase activity, as the ROCK C1 domain is distinct from the C1 domains of MRCK and CRIK. Finally, the functional implications and their underlying molecular mechanisms of the splitting of the PH domain by the C1 insertion in ROCK are not known. In this study, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the split PH domain and the C1 domain of ROCK II. Structural analysis revealed that the C1 domain of ROCK adopts an atypical structure and that the domain cannot bind to DAG/phorbol ester. Instead, the C1 domain functions synergistically with the PH domain in binding to membrane bilayers with a mechanism distinct from all other known lipid binding PH domains. Protein Expression and Purification—The ROCK I PHN-C1-PHC tandem (residues 1119-1319), the ROCK II PHN-C1-PHC tandem (residues 1142-1342), the joined PHN-PHC (residues 1142-1227, 1312-1342), the C1 domain (residues 1228-1311), and various mutants of the PHN-C1-PHC tandem were PCR-amplified from the rat hippocampal cDNA library with specific primers. The amplified DNA fragments were inserted into a modified version of the pET32a vector (Novagen) in which the DNA sequences encoding the S tag and thioredoxin were removed. The resulting proteins each contained a His6 tag in their N termini. The C1-PHN-PHC and PHN-PHC-C1 mutants were constructed, respectively, by connecting the C1 domain and the joint PHN-PHC domain with a 10-residue “Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser” linker. The recombinant plasmids harboring the respective target genes were individually transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) host cells for large scale protein production. Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacteria in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl with or without [13C6]glucose as stable isotope sources and 20 μm ZnCl2. The His-tagged fusion proteins were purified under native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography. After dialysis in 30 mm MES buffer (pH 5.5, with 75 mm Na2SO4, 20 μm ZnCl2, and 10 μm β-mecaptoethanol) overnight, the proteins were purified using size-exclusion chromatography (Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200, preparation grade). The N-terminal His-tagged peptide fragment was then cleaved by digesting the fusion protein with 3C protease, and the proteins were purified by another step of size-exclusion chromatography. NMR Structure Determination—The NMR samples used contained ∼1.0 mm of the joint PHN-PHC or C1 domain in 30 mm MES (pH 5.5, with 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 75 mm Na2SO4). All NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Varian Inova 500- and 750-MHz spectrometers. The backbone and side-chain resonance assignments of the protein were obtained by standard heteronuclear correlation experiments (29Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). The side chains of aromatics were assigned using 1H two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy/NOESY experiments (30Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from the NOESY spectra (two-dimensional 1H NOESY, three-dimensional 15N-NOESY, and three-dimensional 13C-NOESY). Hydrogen bonding restraints were generated from the standard secondary structures of the protein based on the NOE patterns and backbone secondary chemical shifts. The backbone dihedral angle restraints (φ and ψ angles) were derived from the chemical shift analysis program TALOS (31Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). CYANA was used to calculate 20 structures from random starting conformers. The calculations of the C1 domain structures were first performed in the absence of zinc ligation restraints. The conformer with the lowest penalty function value was then used as input for refinement using torsion angle-simulated annealing calculations in CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Zincs were incorporated into the calculations by the introduction of the covalent restraints to maintain their tetrahedral geometry. Sγ-Zn and Nϵ2-Zn bond lengths were constrained to 2.3 and 2.0 Å, respectively, with force constants of 250 kcal mol-1Å-2. Bond angles defining the zinc coordination sites were constrained to the following values: 112° for Sγ-Zn-Sγ bond angles, 108° for Cβ-Sγ-Zn angles, 111° for Sγ-Zn-Nϵ2 angles, and 102° for Nϵ2-Zn-Nϵ2 angles. A total of 200 structures were calculated with the final set of restraints, and the 20 structures with the lowest NOE energies were selected. Lipid Binding Assay—A liposome stock consisting of total bovine brain lipids was prepared by resuspending bovine brain lipid extracts (Folch fraction I, Sigma B1502) at 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm Na2SO4. The sedimentation-based assay followed the method described earlier (1Yan J. Wen W. Xu W. Long J.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Defined liposomes were reconstituted from synthetic l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) (Avanti Polar Lipids) with or without various PIPs (Echelon Biosciences; see Ref. 1Yan J. Wen W. Xu W. Long J.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar for details). Split PH Domain of the PHN-C1-PHC Tandem from ROCK II Adopts the Same Fold with or without the C1 Domain Insertion—To evaluate the effect of the cysteine-rich C1 domain insertion on the conformation of the PH domain in ROCK II, we compared the structures of the PH domains with and without the insertion of the C1 domain using NMR spectroscopy. To achieve this, we produced and purified the PHN-C1-PHC tandem (residues 1142-1342, referred to hereafter as PHN-C1-PHC), the isolated PH domain (PHN-PHC, residue 1142-1227 and 1312-1342), and the C1 domain (residue 1227-1311) of ROCK II. Each of the three recombinant proteins was eluted at their molecular mass indicative of a stable monomer when analyzed by analytical gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, each of the three proteins had a well dispersed 1H and 15N HSQC spectrum, indicating that they are well folded (Fig. 1A). The HSQC spectra of the joined PHN-PHC domain (Fig. 1A, red peaks) and C1 domain (Fig. 1A, green peaks) overlap very well with the vast majority of the peaks from the HSQC spectrum of the PHN-C1-PHC tandem (Fig. 1A, black peaks). Only a small set of peaks did not overlap in this analysis. After assigning the chemical shifts of the PHN-C1-PHC tandem as well as the isolated PH and C1 domains, we plotted the chemical shift differences of backbone amides as a function of residue number between the PHN-C1-PHC tandem and the isolated PH and C1 domains (Fig. 1B). The largest chemical shift differences were located in the linker regions that connect the two halves of the PH domain with the C1 domain, an observation that is reasonable considering that the C1 domain was removed from the PHN-C1-PHC tandem. Minimal chemical shift changes were observed in the C1 domain, indicating that insertion of the C1 domain in the middle of PH domain does not cause appreciable conformational changes to the C1 domain. The shift changes in the β4/β5-loop of PH domain might result from the intrinsic rigidity of this loop and its close proximity to the split site in the β6/β7-loop (Fig. 1C). To further confirm that the folded C1 domain has no influence on the structure of the PH domain, we treated the PHN-C1-PHC tandem with EDTA (Fig. 1D). In the presence of EDTA, the removal of Zn2+ ions led to the complete unfolding of the C1 domain. Correspondingly, the peaks representing the folded C1 domain (Fig. 1A, green peaks) completely disappeared. Concomitantly, a new set of peaks (Fig. 1D, blue peaks) appeared at the random coil region of the spectrum. In contrast, the peaks corresponding to the split PH domain showed no significant changes upon EDTA treatment, indicating that the inserted C1 domain, folded or unfolded, does not affect the structure of the PH domain. Taken together, analogous to what have been observed in the split PH domains of α-syntrophin, PLCγ, and PIKE (1Yan J. Wen W. Xu W. Long J.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Wen W. Yan J. Zhang M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2008; 378: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), our biochemical and NMR spectroscopic data indicate that the two complementary parts of the split PH domain in ROCK II interact intramolecularly to fold into a stable structure and that the inserted C1 domain does not alter the structure of the split PH domain. Structure of the Isolated PHN-PHC Domain of ROCK II—The PHN-C1-PHC tandem aggregates heavily and is prone to precipitation at high concentrations (>0.5 mm; data not shown), and thus the protein is not friendly for NMR-based structural determination. Because both PH and C1 domains fold into the same structures in tandem and in their isolated states (Fig. 1), we decided to solve the three-dimensional structures of the joined PHN-PHC and the isolated C1 domains using NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3A and Table 1).FIGURE 3Structure of the ROCK II C1 domain.

Open table in a new tab Except for an additional short α-helix in the β3/β4-loop, the PHN and PHC fragments interact with each other to form a canonical PH domain fold containing seven β-strands and a characteristic C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 2B). The PHN half is composed of six β-strands (β1-β6) and the short α-helix (α1), and the PHC half contains the remaining β-strand (β7) and the C-terminal α-helix (α2). Because of the short linking sequence (7 residues to be precise) connecting the β6- and β7-strands, the β6/β7-loop of the joint PH domain is relatively rigid and well defined. Among all known split PH domains, this is only the second example of a PH domain that is split into two halves by the insertion of a protein module between the β6- and β7-strands of the domain (the other is the split PH domain of VPS36) (1Yan J.

https://openalex.org/W2170420016,"The luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor plays an essential role in male and female gonadal function. Together with the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors, the LH receptor forms the family of glycoprotein hormone receptors. All glycoprotein hormone receptors share a common modular topography, with an N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain and a C-terminal seven-transmembrane transduction domain. The ligand binding domain consists of 9 leucine-rich repeats, flanked by N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions. Recently, crystal structures have been published of the extracellular domains of the FSH and TSH receptors. However, the C-terminal cysteine-rich region (CCR), also referred to as the “hinge region,” was not included in these structures. Both structure and function of the CCR therefore remain unknown. In this study we set out to characterize important domains within the CCR of the LH receptor. First, we mutated all cysteines and combinations of cysteines in the CCR to identify the most probable disulfide bridges. Second, we exchanged large parts of the LH receptor CCR by its FSH receptor counterparts, and characterized the mutant receptors in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. We zoomed in on important regions by focused exchange and deletion mutagenesis followed by alanine scanning. Mutations in the CCR specifically decreased the potencies of LH and hCG, because the potency of the low molecular weight agonist Org 41841 was unaffected. Using this unbiased approach, we identified Asp330 and Tyr331 as key amino acids in LH/hCG mediated signaling. The luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor plays an essential role in male and female gonadal function.

In both sexes, LH regulates the production of gonadal androgens, which in women are almost completely converted to estrogens. Furthermore, in women the mid-cycle LH peak triggers ovulation of the mature oocyte ready to be fertilized, whereas the closely related pregnancy hormone, chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), supports the corpus luteum of pregnancy. Both LH and hCG act by binding and activating the LH receptor. The LH receptor has a modular architecture consisting of an ectodomain or extracellular hormone binding domain (ECD), linked to a seven-transmembrane signal transduction domain (7TMD). Together with the receptors for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), the LH receptor belongs to the glycoprotein hormone receptor family. The extracellular ligand binding domain of this family consists of a stretch of nine leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine-rich clusters (NCR and CCR, respectively). The crystal structures that have been determined for major parts of FSHR and TSHR ECDs show that the LRRs are organized as β sheets, and give rise to a curved helical tube of which the concave surface forms the hormone-binding surface (1Sanders J. Chirgadze D.Y. Sanders P. Baker S. Sullivan A. Bhardwaja A. Bolton J. Reeve M. Nakatake N. Evans M. Richards T. Powell M. Miguel R.N. Blundell T.L. Furmaniak J. Smith B.R.

The NCR provides an additional β strand to the binding surface.

LRRs are considered versatile binding motifs often involving protein-protein interactions, and are observed in a large variety of proteins (3Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Also the non-glycoprotein hormone receptor LRRs contain an NCR and CCR and in those LRR proteins of which crystal structures have been resolved, the NCR and CCR form β strands that combine seamlessly with the β sheets formed by the LRRs (5Barton W.A. Liu B.P. Tzvetkova D. Jeffrey P.D. Fournier A.E. Sah D. Cate R. Strittmatter S.M. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Thus, the CCR of the glycoprotein hormone receptors may also be expected to form a prolongation of the LRR β sheets. The function of the CCR has been addressed in more detail by receptor mutagenesis studies. Ligand binding studies with mutant rat LH receptors indicate that LRR1–6 contribute most to high-affinity ligand binding, whereas a combined deletion of LRR9 and the CCR did not alter hCG affinity (7Thomas D. Rozell T.G. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation of the rat LH receptor demonstrates that neither the 7TMD nor the CCR are essential to high affinity binding (8Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A similar approach in the human LH receptor, systematically truncating the receptor at exon boundaries showed a stepwise decrease in affinity loss with severity of truncation (9Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, deleting both 7TMD, and the C-terminal part of the CCR, did not alter hCG affinity. Notably, the above mentioned deletion and truncation mutants failed to be expressed at the plasma membrane. In most LRR proteins the CCR has four cysteines, of which the first two are either directly adjacent or separated by one amino acid resulting in two disulfide bonds (10Matsushima N. Tachi N. Kuroki Y. Enkhbayar P. Osaki M. Kamiya M. Kretsinger R.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2771-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also in the CCR of the LH receptor the first two (of a total of six) cysteines are located adjacently. Because the CCR is a conserved feature, yet is not required for high-affinity ligand binding, its role may be to structurally preserve the ECD structure, and/or to selectively transduce signals from the ECD to the 7TMD. Crystal structures of the glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) suggest a role for the CCR in responding to ligand binding: a 16-residue β-hairpin (β-switch) is formed in the CCR of GPIbα upon binding of the von Willebrand factor (6Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, all disease-causing gain-of-function mutations are present in this β-switch (11Miller J.L. Cunningham D. Lyle V.A. Finch C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Russell S.D. Roth G.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also for the TSH receptor such a concept has been proposed. Based on a series of constitutively active TSH receptors, Mueller and co-workers (13Mueller S. Kleinau G. Jaeschke H. Neumann S. Krause G. Paschke R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31638-31646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) proposed an activation mechanism in which the CCR is key. The authors propose that the CCR acts as a lever linking the ECD LRRs to the 7TMD, in which the conserved cysteine tandem of the CCR serves as a fulcrum. Modification on either site of the lever, by mutation, ligand interaction, or tryptic clipping, changes the conformation of the CCR, and results in 7TMD activation (13Mueller S. Kleinau G. Jaeschke H. Neumann S. Krause G. Paschke R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31638-31646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also in the LH receptor, mutation of Ser277 close to the CCR leads to constitutive receptor activation (14Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30264-30271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), supporting a similar mechanism in this receptor as well. Besides via the extracellular domain, the LH receptor can also be activated directly via the 7TMD. Illustrating for this phenomenon is that most of activating LH receptor mutations observed in patients are single amino acid changes within the transmembrane helices (for reviews see Refs. 15Themmen A.P.N. Reproduction. 2005; 130: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 16Themmen A.P.N. Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 551-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, some thienopyr(im)idine derivatives (i.e. Org 41841 and Org 42599) were characterized as a novel class of low molecular weight LH receptor agonists (17van Straten N.C. Schoonus-Gerritsma G.G. van Someren R.G. Draaijer J. Adang A.E. Timmers C.M. Hanssen R.G. van Boeckel C.A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Kelder J. Wagener M. Timmers M. Noordik J.H. Cheminformatics Developments. 1. IOS Press, Amsterdam2004: 111-127Google Scholar). These ligands can activate the receptor by interacting directly with the 7TMD, rather than with the receptor ectodomain (19Jäschke H. Neumann S. Moore S. Thomas C.J. Colson A.O. Costanzi S.

In the present study we unravel the constellation of disulfide bridges in the CCR, and further set out to characterize the requirements of the CCR for hormone-induced signaling. Hereto we exchanged and deleted (parts of) the LH receptor CCR, followed by detailed alanine scanning. This led to the identification of two amino acid residues, Asp330 and Tyr331, as key CCR residues, involved in LH/hCG mediated signaling. In addition we introduce the low molecular weight agonists Org 41841 and Org 42599 as tools to evaluate intrinsic receptor functionality. Materials—Unless stated otherwise, cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK): restriction enzymes and polymerases from Roche; fine chemicals from Sigma; oligonucleotides were from Biolegio (Nijmegen, The Netherlands). hCG, LH, Org 41841, and Org 42599 are kind gifts of NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands. Construction of WT and Mutant LH Receptor Expression Plasmids—Construction of the expression plasmid pSG5-hLHRWT is described elsewhere (21Kraaij R. Post M. Kremer H. Milgrom E. Epping W. Brunner H.G. Grootegoed J.A. Themmen A.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3168-3172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An N-terminal HA tag was inserted immediately C-terminal to the signal peptide by inserting the primer-dimer (5′GTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGC and complement) into the Eco47III site at position 84 in the LH receptor cDNA. In this background, the deletion or domain-exchange LH receptor mutants were created by a series of fusion PCRs (see supplemental materials). In short, two or three separate PCR were done to amplify different domains of the LH receptor or, if required, other receptors (pSG5-FSHR (22Minegishi T. Igarashi S. Nakamura K. Nakamura M. Tano M. Shinozaki H. Miyamoto K. Ibuki Y. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), pSVL-TSHR (23Costagliola S. Swillens S. Niccoli P. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Ludgate M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 75: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), pCDNA3-GP1bα (6Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P.

Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). By using extended oligos in these PCRs, overlap was created between bordering PCR fragments and in a second series of PCR, this overlap was used to fuse individual fragments and amplify the fusion product. The resulting product was subcloned into the pSG5-5′HA-hLHR WT construct. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are depicted in supplemental materials. All constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were maintained in culture medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 + Glutamax supplemented with 1 × 105 IU/liter penicillin, 0.1 mg/liter streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Two days prior to transfection, cells are plated at a density of 20% in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). For transfection, 7 μg of LH WT/mutant receptor cDNA (in pSG5), 1.4 μg of pCRE6lux, and 1.4 μgof pRL-SV40 was added to 350 μl of 150 mm NaCl and mixed with 350 μl, 0.03 mg/liter polyethyleneimine (linear Mr ∼ 25,000; Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in 150 mm NaCl. Medium was replaced by serum-free medium and supplemented with a cDNA/polyethyleneimine mixture. After 4 h, medium was supplemented with fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 10%. Reporter Gene Analysis—To analyze LH receptor activity, WT and mutant expression constructs were transfected to HEK 293 cells (see above). 24 h post-transfection, cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA, and transferred to white μClear TC-treated plates (Greiner Bio-one Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands), 48 h post-transfection, medium was replaced by serum-free culture medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES and a 2-fold dilution series of LH, hCG, Org 41841, or Org 42599. For mass to mole conversion for LH and hCG, molecular masses of 29.5 and 36.7 kDa were assumed, respectively (24Basu A. Shrivastav T.G. Maitra S.K. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2005; 26: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Roseman D.S. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9949-9954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After 6 h stimulation, wells were aspired and cells were lysed with 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and analyzed for luciferase (cAMP-responsive element driven) and Renilla luciferase (transfection control) activities using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Data were analyzed using Prism3 (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Only ≥3-fold changes in EC50 (compared with WT) are considered relevant, and are tested for statistical significance by Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). ELISA—WT and mutant expression constructs were transfected to HEK 293 cells (see above). 24 h post-transfection, cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA, and transferred to 96-well clear plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) that were polylysine coated for ELISA. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (30 min, 22 °C) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (1 h, 37 °C). Wells were washed 4 times with PBS and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with 1:1000 dilution of Anti-HA-peroxidase, (3F10, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin. Wells were washed 6 times for 10 min with PBS and peroxidase activity was assayed using 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Constellation of Disulfide Bridges in the CCR—Despite the apparent structural resemblance of glycoprotein hormone receptors, the overall sequence identity in the ECD is low, approximately 40% (26Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, several sequence motifs are conserved: 4 cysteines in the N-terminal part of the ECD, 9 leucine-rich repeat motifs (XXLXLXX), and 6 cysteines at the C-terminal side of the extracellular domain. These cysteines are always present in even numbers, suggesting that they are conserved as disulfide pairs. To study the importance of the 6 cysteines in the CCR we individually mutated them to alanine and assayed the mutant receptors for functionality in a CRE-driven reporter gene assay. Mutation of Cys304 or Cys336 to alanine does not affect the maximum response to LH (Fig. 1A), and only results in a small (3–5-fold) decrease in LH potency (supplemental materials Fig. S1). In contrast, mutation of Cys279, Cys280, Cys343, or Cys353 completely abolished LH-mediated signaling (Fig. 1A), and mutant receptors could not be detected at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, CRE signaling remained possible after stimulation of these mutant receptors with Org 42599 (Fig. 1A). Org 42599 is a low molecular weight LH receptor agonist, based on lead optimization of Org 41841 (18Kelder J. Wagener M. Timmers M. Noordik J.H. Cheminformatics Developments. 1. IOS Press, Amsterdam2004: 111-127Google Scholar) and, as Org 41841 binds to and activates the receptor directly at the 7TMD (17van Straten N.C. Schoonus-Gerritsma G.G. van Someren R.G. Draaijer J. Adang A.E. Timmers C.M. Hanssen R.G. van Boeckel C.A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Jäschke H. Neumann S. Moore S. Thomas C.J. Colson A.O. Costanzi S.

Kleinau G. Neumann S. Costanzi S. Jiang J.K. Childress J. Raaka B.M. Colson A. Paschke R. Krause G. Thomas C.J. Gershengorn M.C. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and does not require the ECD. It should be noted that, compared with WT, not only the maximal effect, but also the potency of Org 42599 was reduced (supplemental materials Fig. S1). We observed similar shifts in potencies and maximal effects of both Org 42599 and LH when we transfected decreasing amounts of WT LH receptor plasmid (supplemental Fig. S2). We utilized the residual Org 42599 responsiveness of individual Cys to Ala mutant LH receptors to probe disulfide bridges in the CCR. We argued that mutation of both cysteines of the same disulfide bridge would have the same effect as mutation of only one cysteine, because in both cases only one bridge is broken. In contrast, mutating two cysteines that are not interconnected would break two disulfide bridges and would aggravate the effect of the individual mutations. To test this hypothesis we substituted the following pairs of cysteines by alanines: Cys279 + Cys343, Cys279 + Cys353, Cys280 + Cys343, and Cys280 + Cys353. As is clearly illustrated by Fig. 1C, only the combinations C279A + C343A and C280A + C353A responded to Org 42599, suggesting that disulfide bonds are present between cysteines 279 and 343, and between 280 and 353. A third disulfide bridge is possible between Cys304 and Cys336. Both single cysteine to alanine mutants as well as the double alanine substitution C304A, C336A only result in a small (maximum 5-fold) decrease in potency of LH. From these data we cannot conclude whether a disulfide bridge is present or there is no disulfide bridge at all. Clear, however, is that the contribution of Cys304 and Cys336 to the overall receptor structure is limited. Assuming the third disulfide bridge between Cys304 and Cys336, an overall structure results as depicted in Fig. 2. LH/hCG-mediated Signaling Requires CCR of Glycoprotein Hormone Receptor—Because sequence homology between the glycoprotein hormone receptors is relatively low, we defined the CCR as the region between LRRs and 7TMD, ranging from the first to the last cysteine (in the LH receptor: Cys279 to Cys353). To probe the specific relevance of the LH receptor CCR for the function of the LH receptor, we deleted it, or replaced it by CCRs of other related (FSH receptor and TSH receptor) or unrelated proteins (Nogo66 receptor (NgR) and GPIbα). The latter two are not 7TMD receptors, but do contain LRRs with flanking CCR and NCR of which crystal structures are available (5Barton W.A. Liu B.P. Tzvetkova D. Jeffrey P.D. Fournier A.E. Sah D. Cate R. Strittmatter S.M. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that the introduction of non-related CCRs (NgR and GPIbα), as well as the complete deletion of the CCR, rendered the mutant receptors completely unresponsive to LH. Analysis of cell surface expression (by ELISA) showed that these mutant receptors were not expressed at the cell surface (data not shown). In contrast, the CCR of the FSH and TSH receptors are much better tolerated as replacements of the original CCR. These exchange mutants are well expressed (not shown). Furthermore, the mutant LH receptor in which the complete CCR is replaced by that of the FSH receptor (hereafter referred to F281–352) responds to LH and hCG with unaltered potency (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Using the TSH receptor as CCR donor, the mutant receptor is also functional, but the potency of LH and the maximal effect are reduced (Fig. 3 and Table 1).TABLE 1LH or hCG activation of WT or CCR exchange mutants of the LH receptor Open table in a new tab Fragment Exchange within CCR Shows That Amino Acids 305–335 Are of Key Importance in LH/hCG-mediated Activation—The six cysteines in the CCR of the receptor define four intercysteine stretches consisting of amino acids 281–303, 305–335, 337–342, and 344–352 (Fig. 2). To unravel the function of the CCR we replaced several of these stretches of the LH receptor with the corresponding sequences of the FSH receptor and tested the mutant receptors in our CRE-driven reporter gene assay. Replacing the first intercysteine domain or a combination of domains 1, 2, and 3 by their FSH receptor counterparts (F281–303 and F281–342) did not alter the potency of LH, whereas replacement of intercysteine domains 2, 3, and 4 (F305–352) resulted in an 8-fold decrease of LH potency (Table 1). Zooming in on this region, we individually replaced intercysteine stretches 2, 3, and 4 (F305–335, F337–342, and F344–352, respectively). Replacement of intercysteine stretch 2 (F305–335) resulted in a nearly 30-fold decrease in LH potency, whereas the other exchanges were relatively ineffective (Table 1). Using the homologous hormone hCG a similar trend is observed, although effects are generally more moderate (Table 1). None of the intercysteine replacement mutants displayed altered receptor expression (supplemental Fig. S3). Focused Deletion within the CCR Leads to Complete Nonresponsiveness to LH/hCG—As reported earlier (27Müller T. Gromoll J. Simoni M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 2242-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), deletion of the exon 10-encoded part of the LH receptor (Δ290–316), resulted in a mutant receptor for which potencies of especially LH, and to a lesser extent hCG, were reduced (15- and 4-fold, respectively, Table 2). Because replacement of the second intercysteine stretch with its FSHR counterpart (F305–335) also effectively reduced the potencies of LH and hCG (28- and 13-fold, respectively), we expected the overlap with exon 10 to be involved. However, deleting this overlap, i.e. the C-terminal 12 amino acids of exon 10 (Δ305–316), left the LH and hCG potencies unaffected (Table 2). Because the patient phenotype could not be mimicked by deleting amino acids 305–316, we also set out to delete the other amino acids encoded by exon 10 (Δ290–303). Remarkably, also this deletion did not result in large changes of LH/hCG potencies (Table 2).TABLE 2LH or hCG activation of WT or partial CCR deletion mutants of the LH receptor Open table in a new tab Apparently, the exon 10-encoded part of the second intercysteine stretch does not mediate the decreased potency observed for FSH receptor exchange mutant F305–335. In sharp contrast, deleting the exon 11-encoded part of this second intercysteine stretch (Δ317–335) rendered the LH receptor completely unresponsive to both hCG and LH (Fig. 4A and Table 2) without altering its plasma membrane expression (Fig. 4C). Because the mutation may cause intrinsic incapability of the receptor to signal, we applied the low molecular weight agonist Org 41841. In contrast to the glycoprotein hormones, Org 41841 binds directly to the transmembrane region and may therefore activate the receptor irrespective of mutations in the CCR. Indeed, despite the complete abolishment of the response to LH and hCG, the Δ317–335 mutant receptor responded with unaltered potency to Org 41841 (Fig. 4B). Deletion of the N-terminal amino acids of intercysteine domain 2, Δ317–324 did not result in changes in LH/hCG potencies, indicating the importance of amino acids 325–335 in LH/hCG mediated signaling. Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis Shows That Asp330 and Tyr331 Are Crucial Residues in CCR—Because deletion of amino acids 317–335, but not 317–324, was deleterious to LH/hCG induced signaling, we applied alanine scanning on amino acids 325–335 to identify important residues in the 324–335 region. Hereto, amino acids Glu325 to Phe335 were individually mutated to alanines. Major changes in potency for LH, but not for Org 41841 were observed for D330A and Y331A mutant LH receptors (22- and 75-fold, respectively; Fig. 5 and Table 3). For mutant receptors W329A and F335A, decreases in LH potency were smaller (3- and 4-fold, respectively). None of the other mutations resulted in a major change in LH potency. Again, for hCG similar, but milder, changes were observed, whereas potencies of Org 41841 remained unaltered for all mutant receptors (Table 3).TABLE 3Alanine scanning of residue 325 to 335 of the LH receptor Open table in a new tab Recently, structures of the extracellular domain of both FSH (2Fan Q.R.

Unfortunately, the CCR was not included in these crystallization attempts and the structure of the CCRs thus remains elusive.

Because disulfide bridges may be critical in upholding the structure of the CCR, we set out to unravel the constellation of the six cysteines in this domain. Mutation of individ"
https://openalex.org/W2035088344,"20S RNA virus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We previously observed that the virus generated in vivo from a launching vector possessed the correct RNA termini without extra sequences. Here we present evidence that the SKI1/XRN1 5′-exonuclease plays a major role in the elimination of the non-viral upstream sequences from the primary transcripts. The virus, once generated, however, is fairly unaffected by overexpression or deletion of SKI1/XRN1. By contrast, the copy number of the L-A double-stranded RNA virus in the same host is greatly increased by the deletion of SKI1/XRN1, and overexpression of the gene cured L-A virus from the cells at a high frequency. 20S RNA virus, unlike L-A virus, has a strong secondary structure at its 5′-end: the first four nucleotides are G, and they are buried at the bottom of a long stem structure, features known to inhibit the SKI1/XRN1 5′-exonuclease progression. Mutations that weakened the 5′-stem structure made 20S RNA virus vulnerable to SKI1/XRN1. These results, together with the data on L-A virus, indicate a strong anti-RNA virus activity of SKI1/XRN1. Given that 20S RNA virus resides and replicates in the cytoplasm without a protective capsid, our results suggest that the strong secondary structure at the 5′-end is crucial for the 20S RNA virus to evade the host SKI1/XRN1 defense. 20S RNA virus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Narnavirus 20S RNA is one of the simplest positive strand RNA viruses found in nature. The small genome (2514 nucleotides (nt) 3The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotidesdsRNAdouble-stranded RNAWTwild typeEMelectron microscopy. ) only encodes a single 91-kDa protein (p91), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (1Rodríguez-Cousiño N.

Despite its simplicity, the virus prospers and is widespread among laboratory strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a persistent virus. All the information necessary to replicate and persist in the host is packed within its small RNA genome. The viral genome lacks a poly(A) tail at the 3′-end (3Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and has perhaps no cap structure at the 5′-end, resembling an intermediate of mRNA degradation. The reading frame for p91 spans almost the entire length of the genome, and there are no genes for capsid proteins. Therefore, the RNA genome is not encapsidated into an intracellular virion structure (4Widner W.R. Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol.

It raises the question of how the virus avoids its RNA genome destruction by the enzymes involved in mRNA degradation pathways. nucleotides double-stranded RNA wild type electron microscopy. mRNA degradation in eukaryotes usually begins with the shortening of the poly(A) tail at the 3′-end, followed by decapping at the 5′-end by the Dcp1p-Dcp2p-decapping enzyme (6Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 7Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins (Lsm1p-7p, Pat1p, Dhh1p, etc.) are known to assist this reaction. Then, the decapped RNA is degraded by the XRN1 5′-exonuclease. Alternatively, deadenylated RNA is digested by a multiprotein complex with 3′-exo-nuclease activity called the exosome (8Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 9Jacobs Anderson J.S. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In yeast, the XRN1 5′-exonuclease plays a major role in mRNA degradation. Although xrn1 mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes, common 5′-exonuclease motifs (motifs I–III) are identified in Xrn1p, and mutations of two critical residues in motif II (D206A, D208A) abolish the 5′-exonuclease activity rather specifically without affecting functions unrelated to RNA turnover (10Solinger J.A. Pascolini D. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5930-5942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme digests the RNA processively in the 5′ to 3′ direction (11Stevens A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3080-3085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its progression is inhibited by a G tract or by a strong secondary structure on the RNA (12Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Stevens A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A genetic approach has identified several chromosomal SKI genes affecting the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus L-A and its satellite RNA M (14Toh-e A. Guerry P. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wickner R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recessive mutants of these genes exhibit a super-killer phenotype due to the derepressed production of a toxin encoded on the satellite RNA. SKI1 and XRN1 have been assigned to the same gene (16Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that a higher toxin production in this mutant is due to the stability of viral RNA that has neither 5′ cap structure nor a 3′ poly(A) tail. Although the 20S RNA virus has no capsid protein, the viral genome does not exist as naked RNA in cells. Instead, it forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with p91 in a 1:1 stoichiometry and resides in the cytoplasm (5García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that formation of complexes contributes to the stability of the 20S RNA genome in the cell. Recently, we have analyzed p91 in the complex and found that p91 interacts with 20S RNA at the 5′- and 3′-end regions and, to a lesser extent, at the central region as well (18Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19011-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutations in the 5′ or 3′ cis sites reduced the formation of complexes to a basal level (10% compared with the full activity), and a combination of them did not further reduce the activity. This suggests that the interactions of p91 at both sites are coordinated and that the central cis site is responsible for the basal level of complex formation. Further study indicated that the 3′ cis site is identical to or overlaps with the 3′ cis signal for replication (Fig. 1A). Especially, the third and fourth nucleotides (both are C) from the 3′-end are essential for both replication and formation of complexes. By contrast, mutations at the 3′-terminal or penultimate position did not affect either activity. Furthermore, viruses recovered from the latter experiments had regained the wild-type nucleotide C by replacing the modified nucleotide at the terminal or penultimate position. This suggests that, although the 3′-terminal and penultimate nucleotides may be removed for repair, such nibbling would not go further inside because of p91 binding. In contrast to the 3′ cis site, the 5′ cis site for complex formation is located not at the very 5′-terminus but at the second stem-loop structure (nt 72–104) from the 5′-end (Fig. 1A) (18Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19011-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The terminal region (nt 1–71) forms an intricate secondary structure, and the terminal nucleotide is buried at the bottom of a long stem (Fig. 1B). This stem also contains the initiation codon for p91. If p91 bound to the first stem structure, it is feasible that this binding might interfere with p91 translation from the initiation codon. In this work, we show that the 20S RNA virus is quite resistant to the SKI1 5′-exonuclease because of the secondary structure at the 5′-end of the genome. Weakening the 5′-terminal stem structure made the virus susceptible to SKI1. By contrast, L-A virus has no strong secondary structure but an AU-rich sequence at the 5′-end of the positive strand (Fig. 1C) and can easily be eliminated from the cells by overexpression of SKI1. These results indicate that the SKI1 5′-exonuclease plays a critical role in defense against RNA viruses. During the course of reverse genetics using the in vivo 20S RNA virus launching system, we observed that the 5′-exonuclease activity of Ski1p plays a major role in removing non-viral upstream sequences from primary transcripts containing the 20S RNA genome. DHH1 was also found to be involved in this process. Our 20S RNA virus launching system thus provides a convenient method to analyze mRNA processing in vivo. Strains and Media—20S RNA-negative strain 2928-4 (a ura3 trp1 his3, 20S RNA-o, 23S RNA-o, L-A-o) has been described previously (19Esteban R. Vega L. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33725-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Standard strain BY4741 (a ura3Δ0, leu2Δ0 his3Δ1, met15Δ0 20S RNA-o, 23S RNA-o, L-A) and a haploid deletion series (BY4741 background) from the yeast knockout collection were a kind gift from Dr. J. L. Revuelta (Salamanca). For cytoplasmic mixing experiments (cytoduction), we used strain 1101 (α kar1-1, his4, L-A, M1, 20S RNA) (20Ridley S.P. Sommer S.S. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). L-A-o derivatives of the strains were constructed during this work by overexpression of the SKI1 gene. Cells were grown in rich YPAD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.04% adenine sulfate, and 2% glucose) or synthetic medium deprived of uracil or histidine, or both (21Wickner R.B. Cell. 1980; 21: 217-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Induction of 20S RNA virus under nitrogen starvation was performed as described previously (22Wejksnora P.J. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic Methods—Standard methods for yeast genetics were used (23Mortimer R.K. Hawthorne D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cytoduction was carried out using a strain carrying the karyogamy-deficient kar1-1 mutation (24Conde J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3651-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Pull-down Assay—Immunoprecipitation of ribonucleoprotein complexes with anti-p91 antiserum, RNA extraction, slotblotting, and detection by Northern hybridization were described previously (18Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19011-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Titration of 20S RNA transcripts in complex with p91 or in the lysates is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Hybridization with the [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligodeoxy probe RE365, that was complementary to nt 1–22 of the 20S RNA genome, was done as described (25Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide RE368 (5′-CCTCATAAAACTGATACGAGCTTCTGCTATCC-3′) was used to detect 25S rRNA. In Vitro Mutagenesis—Site-directed in vitro mutagenesis was done as described (26Esteban R. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Northern Hybridization—Cells were broken with glass beads as described previously (18Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19011-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Phenol-extracted lysates were separated in a native agarose gel, denatured in the gel, blotted, and hybridized with 32P-labeled RNA probes as described (27Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To analyze SKI1 transcripts, RNA samples were separated in a formaldehyde-containing denaturing gel (28Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E. F., and Sambrook, J. (1993) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, pp. 202–203, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar) instead of using a native agarose gel. 32P-labeled probes to detect 20S RNA and L-A positive strand genomes were made by T3 run-off transcription using SmaI-digested pALI18 (complementary to the full sequence of 20S RNA) and PvuII-digested pRE687 (complementary to nt 1323–1786 of L-A), respectively. The SKI1 specific probe was T3 run-off transcripts from SpeI-digested pRE908 that were complementary to the second half of the SKI1 gene (nt 2240–4587, numbered from the AUG initiation codon). Launching Plasmids—pRE763 is a derivative of the 20S RNA launching vector pRE740 previously described (19Esteban R. Vega L. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33725-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). pRE763 has a 1.1-kb fragment containing the URA3 gene inserted into the unique EcoRV site in the TRP1 marker of pRE740. The rest of the launching plasmids were made from pRE763 by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis. The changes introduced into the vector or 20S RNA sequence are indicated in Table 1.TABLE 1PlasmidsA.

Open table in a new tab Cloning of SKI1—The SKI1 gene was amplified by PCR from strain 2928-4 with oligos RE298 (5′-AATTAGGATCCAATCCAAACATTGTGCCCAC-3′) and RE299 (5′-AATTAGGATCCGGTTTGCTAAGCAAAATGAG-3′). The DNA fragment (5.5 kb) contains the SKI1 open reading frame flanked by a 0.5-kb upstream sequence with the SKI1 promoter and a 0.25-kb downstream sequence with polyadenylation and transcription termination signals. The PCR fragment was cloned into the unique BamH1 site of the pRS313 centromeric vector (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pRE908. The cloned sequence of the SKI1 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SKI1 overexpression vector pRE914 was constructed as follows: A 4.7-kb DNA fragment containing the SKI1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from strain 2928-4 with oligos RE296 (5′-AATTAGGATCCCAGTACGGTATGGGTATTC-3′) and RE297 (5′-AATTAGGATCCGTCGTATGTTCTAAGTAGA-3′). Nucleotides corresponding to the initiation and termination codons are underlined. The amplified fragment was cloned downstream of the PGK1 promoter of vector pRE910, giving plasmid pRE914. Vector pRE910 is a derivative of pI2 (30Wickner R.B. Icho T. Fujimura T. Widner W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has a 1.1-kb fragment containing the HIS3 marker inserted into the unique EcoRV site, interrupting the TRP1 gene of pI2. SKI1 Contributes to the Efficient Generation of 20S RNA Virus in Vivo—We have recently established an in vivo launching system for 20S RNA virus from a yeast expression vector (19Esteban R. Vega L. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33725-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The vector contains the entire 20S RNA cDNA sequence downstream of the PGK1 promoter. The hepatitis delta virus antigenomic ribozyme sequence is directly attached to the 3′-end of the viral genome in the vector to facilitate the creation of the precise viral 3′-end termini in the transcripts (Fig. 2A). Although the vector contained a non-viral sequence between the major transcription start site for the PGK1 promoter and the 5′-end of the viral genome, the virus generated had the authentic 5′-terminus without this non-viral vector sequence. Using this launching system, we examined the effects of host genes on virus generation. When a ski1Δ mutant strain was used as a host, we found that the standard launching plasmid failed to generate the virus (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Although this mutant strain showed severe defects in mating and meiosis, we found that the cells could support replication of 20S RNA when the virus was introduced by a cytoplasmic mixing (cytoduction) (not shown). Furthermore, two tetrads obtained from a cross with a 20S RNA-carrying strain produced a 4+:0 segregation of 20S RNA virus (Fig. 2C), indicating that the virus does not require SKI1 for its replication. Because the primary transcripts from the vector contain the 5′ cap structures as well as 47 nt of non-viral upstream sequences, we suspected that the failure in generating virus from the standard launching plasmid was caused by the inefficient removal of the non-viral 5′ sequence from the transcripts. When this upstream sequence was reduced from 47 to 19 nt or to 9 nt, the vectors successfully generated the virus in the ski1Δ strain (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). In particular, the shortest one generated the virus almost as efficiently as in the isogenic wild-type strain (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 6). Translation of p91 was not affected by these modifications in the upstream sequence (not shown). Once the virus was generated, ski1Δ cells could maintain it stably even after curing the launching plasmid. Next, we amplified a 5.5-kb DNA fragment encompassing the SKI1 gene from the wild-type strain 2928-4 and cloned it into a single copy centromeric vector. The authenticity of the gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. When the ski1Δ strain was transformed with the vector expressing Ski1p, now the cells could generate 20S RNA virus from the standard launching plasmid (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Furthermore, cells transformed with the vector containing ski1-D206A, D208A failed to generate the virus under the same conditions (Fig. 2D, lane 3). These mutations are known to abolish the 5′-exonuclease activity of the gene product (10Solinger J.A. Pascolini D. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5930-5942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the inability of the ski1Δ strain to generate the virus is indeed caused by the deletion of SKI1 and point out the importance of eliminating the non-viral 5′-upstream sequence for virus generation. Because decapping precedes 5′-exonuclease cleavage in mRNA turnover, we examined the effects on 20S RNA virus generation of the genes involved in mRNA decapping. Among them, we chose some components of the Lsm1p-7p/Pat1p complex (Lsm1p, Lsm6p, Lsm7p, and Pat1p), Dhh1p, an RNA helicase that is necessary for the decapping activity of Dcp1p-Dcp2p, and Edc1p, an enhancer of the decapping activity (31Bonnerot C. Boeck R. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sánchez M.A. Parker R.

We did not test deletions of DCP1 and DCP2 because these are essential genes. Strains deleted in LSM1, LSM6 (not shown), LSM7 (not shown), PAT1, or EDC1 could generate 20S RNA virus from the standard launching plasmid (Fig. 3A) or from a launching plasmid with a 9-nt upstream sequence (not shown). However, we were unable to launch 20S RNA in the dhh1Δ mutant from either plasmid (Fig. 3A, lane 5; and not shown). To examine whether the failure of the dhh1Δ strain to generate virus is caused by the inability to support 20S RNA replication or by its defect in RNA processing, we introduced 20S RNA virus into dhh1Δ cells by cytoduction. As shown in Fig. 3B, cytoductants received the virus from the donor strain and maintained it during the subsequent colony isolation procedure. We observed no effects of dhh1Δ on the level of 20S RNA introduced. This indicates that the dhh1Δ strain has no defects in supporting 20S RNA virus replication. These results demonstrate that host genes involved in RNA processing could affect 20S RNA virus generation in this launching system. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish them from those genuinely involved in virus replication by genetic or other means.FIGURE 3Effects of genes involved in mRNA decapping on 20S RNA launching. A, control strain BY4741 (lane 1) or a strain deleted in LSM1 (lane 2), PAT1 (lane 3), EDC1 (lane 4), or DHH1 (lane 5) was transformed with the standard launching plasmid. 20S RNA virus generated was detected as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. B, 20S RNA virus was introduced from strain 1101 (Donor) into a dhh1Δ strain (Recipient) by cytoduction. 20S RNA in two cytoductants and in the donor and recipient strains was analyzed as described in Fig. 2B. Ethidium bromide staining of the gel is also shown (EtBr).

We observed that the amount of L-A virus is 5–10 times higher in the ski1Δ strain than in the isogenic SKI1 wild-type strain (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 4). SKI1 on a centromeric vector reduced the amount of L-A to the wild-type level, while ski1-D206A, D208A showed no such suppressive activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3). We subcloned the SKI1 open reading frame into a2 μm based multicopy vector, downstream of the constitutive PGK1 promoter. The expression of the SKI1 transcripts is at least 50 times higher than that from the centromeric vector or from the single gene in the yeast chromosome (Fig. 4B). When the ski1Δ strain was transformed with the SKI1 multicopy vector, the transformants lost the L-A virus at a high frequency (7 of 10) (Fig. 4C, lanes 3–12). We confirmed the loss of L-A virus by curing the plasmid. By contrast, transformants with the vector alone (not shown) or with ski1-D206, D208A retained a high amount of L-A virus as the original non-transformed cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2). These results demonstrate a strong anti-L-A virus activity of the SKI1 5′-exonuclease. We also analyzed the effects of SKI1 on 20S RNA virus. Because the copy number of L-A virus is very high in the ski1Δ strain, its presence affects the copy number of 20S RNA in the same cell, perhaps by competing for resources such as nucleotide precursors, energy, etc. In the following experiments, therefore, we used an L-A-o strain. SKI1 on the centromeric vector had almost no effect on 20S RNA virus, and SKI1 even on the multicopy vector only slightly reduced the amount of 20S RNA virus (Fig. 5A). In the latter case, we did not observe any segregation of 20S RNA-free colonies. In contrast to L-A virus, therefore, 20S RNA virus is quite resistant to SKI1.FIGURE 5Effects of SKI1 on 20S RNA virus. A, wild-type 20S RNA virus is quite insensitive to SKI1 overexpression. ski1Δ strain carrying wild-type 20S RNA virus was transformed with a SKI1 centromeric vector (lane 2) or with a SKI1 multicopy vector (lane 3). Lane 1, 20S RNA virus-carrying ski1Δ strain without plasmid as control. B, 20S RNA with the 69GG69 mutation becomes sensitive to SKI1 suppression. ski1Δ strain carrying wild-type 20S RNA virus (lanes 1–4) or virus with the 68GG69 mutation (lanes 5–8) was transformed with a SKI1-overexpressing multicopy vector (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) or the vector alone (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). Two transformants from each experiment were analyzed. 20S RNA was detected as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. The lower panel shows 25S and 18S rRNAs stained with ethidium bromide as loading control. The photograph was taken before blotting. The strains used in A and B have no L-A virus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 5′-Terminal Structure Contributes to Resistance of 20S RNA Virus to SKI1—We wondered why 20S RNA and L-A viruses differentially respond to the SKI1 5′-exonuclease. The dsRNA genome of L-A virus is encapsidated into intracellular viral particles. Isolated particles protect the RNA genome from RNase A treatment (27Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). EM studies indicated that the capsid has holes with a size large enough for newly synthesized transcripts to pass through into the cytoplasm, but too small for the entry of globular proteins (34Cheng R.H. Caston J.R. Wang G.-J. Gu F. Smith T.J. Baker T.S. Bozarth R.F. Trus B.L. Cheng N. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Caston J.R. Trus B.L. Booy F.P. Wickner R.B. Wall J.S. Steven A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 975-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, it is the non-encapsidated cytoplasmic stage of L-A positive strand transcripts that appears to be vulnerable to the 5′-exonuclease. The 5′-terminal region of the L-A positive strand contains an AU-rich sequence and does not show strong secondary structures (Fig. 1C). By contrast, 20S RNA has a strong secondary structure at the 5′-end, and the 5′-terminal nucleotide is buried at the bottom of the stem (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the first four nucleotides at the 5′-terminus are G. It is known that oligo G tracts and strong secondary structures inhibit the progression of the 5′ SKI1 exonuclease (13Stevens A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). We therefore, hypothesized that this strong secondary structure contributes to the insensitivity of 20S RNA virus to SKI1 suppression. To examine this hypothesis, we introduced mutations in the launching plasmid to destabilize the 5′-end structure of the 20S RNA genome. Because the ski1Δ strain failed to generate 20S RNA virus from the standard launching plasmid (Fig. 2B), we used the plasmid having a shorter (9 nt) non-viral upstream sequence. The first mutant plasmid (G69) contains a single substitution at the position 69 (C to G) and creates a single mismatch at the lower part of the stem (Fig. 6A). This mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence of p91. The second plasmid (68GG69) harbors two substitutions (68UC69 to GG), destabilizing the stem more profoundly and encodes p91 modified at codon 19, from wild-type Val to Gly (Fig. 6A). We transformed the SKI1 strain with these plasmids as well as with the control plasmid having the wild-type 20S RNA sequence. Transformants with the first plasmid (G69) generated 20S RNA virus, but its amount was less compared with the control (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 2). Their ratio remains similar after curing the plasmid (not shown), indicating that the virus with this mutation is less stable. More significantly, the second plasmid (68GG69) failed to generate virus (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Because this second plasmid encodes a modified p91, its failure to generate virus could be attributed to the amino acid change (V19G) in the protein. To eliminate this possibility, the fol"
https://openalex.org/W2062441923,"The thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα) exhibits a dual role as an activator or repressor of its target genes in response to thyroid hormone (T3). Previously, we have shown that TRα, formerly thought to reside solely in the nucleus bound to DNA, actually shuttles rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm. An important aspect of the shuttling activity of TRα is its ability to exit the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. TRα export is not sensitive to treatment with the CRM1-specific inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) in heterokaryon assays, suggesting a role for an export receptor other than CRM1. Here, we have used a combined approach of in vivo fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments, in vitro permeabilized cell nuclear export assays, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays to investigate the export pathway used by TRα. We show that, in addition to shuttling in heterokaryons, TRα shuttles rapidly in an unfused monokaryon system as well. Furthermore, our data show that TRα directly interacts with calreticulin, and point to the intriguing possibility that TRα follows a cooperative export pathway in which both calreticulin and CRM1 play a role in facilitating efficient translocation of TRα from the nucleus to cytoplasm."

WASp/Scar family proteins, the prototypical NPFs, contain a C-terminal region termed VCA (verprolin homology, central, acidic), which is the minimal fragment required to activate nucleation by Arp2/3 complex. Crystallographic and electron microscopic data suggest that a conformational change reorients the two actin-related subunits, Arp2 and Arp3, like two successive actin subunits along the short pitch helix of an actin filament to create the nucleus for polymerization of the daughter filament (9Rouiller I.

Expression of recombinant human Arp2/3 complex subunits in insect cells demonstrated that ARPC2 and ARPC4 are essential for the integrity of the complex and that both of these subunits and Arp3 are necessary to assemble a complex that can nucleate actin filaments (21Gournier H.

Here, we show that a complex lacking the Arp2 subunit (ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex) can be isolated from fission yeast. Except for the absence of Arp2, the loss of Arp2 did not perturb the crystal structure of Arp2/3 complex. ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex bound Wsp1-VCA but did not nucleate actin filaments, so Arp2 is essential to initiate a branch.

Purification of S. pombe Arp2/3 Complex—We purified native Arp2/3 complex from Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain TM011 typically starting with 500 g of wet cells. Ten milliliters of a turbid culture of cells was inoculated per liter of media made from 35 g/liter YES (Q-biogene) and grown with vigorous shaking overnight at 30 °C. In the morning, an additional 70 g/liter YES was added, and the cultures were grown to an optical density of ∼6.0 at 600 nm. Cells were then pelleted and washed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Pellets of cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer per gram of wet cells and stored at -80 °C until lysis. After thawing, an additional 0.4 ml of lysis buffer plus DTT (to 1 mm) and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science, 1 tablet per 50 ml) were added per gram of cells. All subsequent steps were at 0–4 °C. Cells were lysed using a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, model 110EH). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm, and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged a second time at 125,000 × g for 1 h, filtered through cheesecloth, and loaded onto a 150-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 1.5 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 1 mm DTT, and protein eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Protein was precipitated from the eluted fractions with 40% ammonium sulfate, pelleted, and resuspended in 50 ml of PKME (25 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm ATP) and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The sample was then loaded onto an 8-ml column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) pre-charged with GST-N-WASp-VCA and equilibrated with PKME. GST-N-WASp-VCA was purified as described for GST-WASp-VCA (23Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Arp2/3 complex was eluted with a linear 60-ml gradient of 50–1000 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm MgCl2 and fractionated on a 0.5- × 5-cm column of Mono Q (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm MgCl2 and eluted with a linear 20-ml gradient of 100–400 mm NaCl. Pooled fractions were concentrated to 1.0 ml with Amicon Ultra-15 concentrators (Millipore) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR16/60 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted 2-fold with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm DTT before concentrating and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm with extinction coefficients determined by the Von Hippel method (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal.

Purification of S. pombe Wsp1-VCA Constructs—pGV67-Wsp1-VCA was constructed by amplifying S. pombe Wsp1 residues 497–574 with 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI restriction sites and cloning into pGV67, a plasmid derived from p21d (Novagen) and containing an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag followed by a tobacco etch virus cleavage site. pGV67-Wsp1-Cys-VCA was constructed using the same procedure, with a single cysteine inserted 5′ to the 497–574 fragment. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with either pGV67-Wsp1-VCA or pGV67-Wsp1-Cys-VCA, grown to A600 nm of 0.8, and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for overnight expression at 22 °C. Cells from an 8-liter culture were harvested and lysed in 300 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing four protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml. Cells were lysed with a Branson sonicator, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was loaded onto a 35-ml column DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated in lysis buffer and eluted with a linear 300-ml gradient of 25–700 mm NaCl. Fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled and diluted with lysis buffer lacking NaCl to reduce the salt to 140 mm. The sample was then loaded onto a 10-ml column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT (binding buffer) and washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer.

Protein was released from the column during incubation with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Eluted protein was pooled and loaded onto a 0.5- × 5-cm Mono Q column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Protein was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 100–800 mm NaCl, concentrated, and purified by size-exclusion chromatography onto a Superdex 75 HR16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT before re-concentrating and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Preparation of Rhodamine-labeled Sp-Wsp1-Cys-VCA—Sp-Wsp1-Cys-VCA was purified as the SpWsp1-VCA construct, except that DTT was excluded from the final gel filtration buffer. A fresh 20 mm stock of tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (Invitrogen) in dimethylformamide was added dropwise to the pooled peak fractions of Sp-Wsp1-Cys-VCA while stirring on ice. Reaction was stopped after 1 h by the addition of 1 mm DTT. Labeled protein was separated from free dye by ion-exchange chromatography on a 0.5- × 5-cm Mono Q column and through repeated concentration and dilution in an Amicon Ultra protein concentrator. Concentration of SpWsp1-Rho-VCA (Rho-VCA) was determined by measuring absorbance at 552 nm with an extinction coefficient of 44,660 m-1cm-1 (14Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat.

For ARPC5 mutants, cassettes containing a KanMX6 module and the P3nmt1 thymine-repressible promoter were amplified with long primers to generate a 5′-flanking sequence complimentary to a region 330 nucleotides upstream from the ARPC5 start codon. The 3′-flanking sequence was complimentary to either the first 60 nucleotides of the ARPC5 coding region (with codon 3 mutated to change arginine to glutamic acid) or to a region 42 nucleotides downstream from the start codon (for ARPC5ΔN). Cassettes were transformed into the TM011 strain of S. pombe using the lithium acetate method (29Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie 3rd, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P.

Transformed cells were plated on YES plates and incubated for ∼18 h at 30 °C before replica plating onto YES plates containing 100 mg/liter G418/Geneticin (Invitrogen). Replica plates were incubated for 2–3 days, and large colonies were re-streaked on fresh YES plates. Genomic DNA was isolated from mutant strains (29Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G.

ARPC3-YFP and arp2-CFP strains were provided by Chris Beltzner, and were constructed by replacing the ARPC3 or arp2 stop codon in FY527 (h- leu1–32 ura4-D18 his3-D1 ade6-M216) or FY528 (h+ leu1–32 ura4-D18 his3-D1 ade6-M210) with a pFA6a-YFP-kanMX6 or pFA6a-CFP-kanMX6 cassette, crossing, and analyzing tetrads. Fluorescence Anisotropy Assays—We used an Alphascan fluorometer with a T-format for fluorescence measurements (Photon Technology International). Samples were excited at 552 nm, and anisotropy was measured at 578 nm. The excitation monochromometer bandwidth was 6 nm, and the emission bandwidth was 4 nm. Fixed concentrations of Rho-VCA were titrated with SpArp2/3 complex, and the fluorescence was measured for both filter positions at 0.1 points/s for 40 s. Photon Technology International Felix software was used for data collection and to calculate average anisotropy. For FRET measurements fixed concentrations of OG-actin were titrated with Rho-VCA with excitation at 480 nm, emission at 517 nm, and 3 nm slit widths. Actin Polymerization Assays—We measured the nucleation activity of wild-type and mutant Arp2/3 complex from the time course of actin polymerization. Polymerization reactions of 100 μl were assembled as follows: 2 μl of 10 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2 were added to 20 μl of 20 μm 15% pyrene actin monomers in G-buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.01% NaN3) followed immediately by adding 78 μl of a solution containing Arp2/3 complex, SpWsp1-VCA with buffers, and salts to bring the final reaction conditions to 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence measurements were made at 15-s intervals in a 96-well plate using a Gemini XPS spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 407 nm. The rate of polymerization was determined from the slope of the polymerization curve at 50% polymer formation. The concentration of barbed ends was calculated by setting the rate of polymer formation equal to k+[ends][actin monomer], where k+ = 10 μm-1s-1 and solving for [ends]. Determination of Equilibrium Binding Constants—Binding constants were determined by fitting the anisotropy curves to Equation 1, r=rf+(rb-rf)((Kd+[R]+[L])-(Kd+[R]+[L])2-4[R][L]2[L])(Eq. 1) where rf is the signal of the free receptor (R), rb is the signal of the bound receptor, and [L] is the total concentration of the ligand (species titrated). rb and Kd were fit using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Determination of binding constants for unlabeled SpWsp1-VCA measured using competition assay is described in the supplemental materials. Crystal Growth and Structure Determination—Crystals of ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex grew in 750 mm ammonium sulfate, 50 mm sodium citrate, and 7% glycerol at 4 °C to an average size of 150 × 80 × 80 μm. ATP and calcium chloride were present in the crystallization drop at 0.5 mm each. The crystals diffracted weakly and were indexed to the P4222 space group with a large unit cell (a = 219.1 Å, b = 219.1 Å, c = 315.2 Å) and two molecules in the asymmetric unit (76% solvent). Attempts to dehydrate crystals by increasing the precipitant concentration did not improve diffraction. We used a homology model of the S. pombe Arp2/3 complex based on the crystal structure of bovine Arp2/3 complex (31Beltzner C.C. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the Arp2 subunit removed as a molecular replacement search model. We also removed inserts and regions with high B-factors in the bovine complex structure from the search model. We found one solution using the program Phaser (32McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn L.C. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar) with a translational Z-score of 25.6. The initial model was improved through three successive rounds of rebuilding and restrained refinement carried out using REFMAC with a weighting parameter of 0.005. B-factors were refined by TLS refinement using one TLS group for each subunit (33Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit were symmetrically constrained throughout the refinement. To improve density for model building, B-factors were sharpened using a value of 70 Å2. The final model had an Rfree of 34.4% and an Rwork of 32.4%. Coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 3DWL. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown to A595 = 0.2–0.5 in YE5S at 25 °C and washed in Edinburgh minimal medium (potassium phthalate (3 g/liter), Na2SO4 (0.04 g/liter), ZnSO4 (0.4 mg/liter), Na2HPO4 (2.2 g/liter), pantothenic acid (1 mg/liter), FeCl2 (0.2 mg/liter), NH4Cl (5 g/liter), nicotinic acid (10 mg/liter), molybdic acid (40 μg/liter), dextrose (20 g/liter), myo-inositol (10 mg/liter), potassium iodide (0.1 mg/liter), MgCl2 (1.05 g/liter), biotin (1 mg/liter), CuSO4 (40 μg/liter), CaCl2 (14.7 mg/liter), boric acid (0.5 mg/liter), citric acid (1 mg/liter), KCl (1 g/liter), MnSO4 (0.4 mg/liter)) before mounting on 25% gelatin pads (34Wu J.Q. Kuhn J.R. Kovar D.R. Pollard T.D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on an UltraView RS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) spinning disk confocal system installed on an Olympus IX-71 microscope with a 100×, 1.4 numerical aperture PlanApo lens (Olympus), and analyzed using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Z-series were collected in 0.6-μm steps with 200-ms sequential excitation of YFP and CFP. Isolation of S. pombe Arp2/3 Complex Lacking Arp2—Arp2/3 complex from S. pombe purified as a single component during ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose) and affinity chromatography on GST-N-WASp-VCA on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column but split into two peaks during anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q. The first Mono Q peak eluted at a conductivity of 22 mS/cm, and the second peak eluted at 29 mS/cm (Fig. 1A). We completed the purification of the two fractions of Arp2/3 complex by gel filtration on a column of Superdex 200. Both peaks contained Arp2/3 complex subunits, but the band on SDS-PAGE previously shown to contain both Arp2 and ARPC1 (7Sirotkin V. Beltzner C.C. Marchand J.B. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was less intense in pool A (Fig. 1B). Two-dimensional PAGE (Fig. 1C) showed that pool A lacked a cluster of four spots corresponding to Arp2 (theoretical pI = 5.8). Immunoblots with an S. pombe Arp2 antibody verified that Arp2 was missing (data not shown). The fraction of complex lacking Arp2 (ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex) ranged from 5 to 35% (average = 13%) of total Arp2/3 complex in five preparations from wild-type cells. Arp2 Is Required for Arp2/3 Complex Nucleation Activity—Polymerization assays showed that 200 nm ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex did not nucleate actin filaments, whereas 200 nm of complete Arp2/3 complex (pool B) increased the concentration of barbed ends to a maximum of 3.5 nm in the presence of 1.6 μm SpWsp1-VCA and 4 μm chicken skeletal muscle actin (Fig. 2A). Even 1 μm ΔArp2Arp2/3 complex had no detectable nucleation activity (data not shown). The ΔArp2 Arp2/3 Complex Binds SpWsp1-VCA and Actin Monomer—To determine the basis for the inactivity of ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex, we used fluorescence anisotropy to measure the affinity of rhodamine-labeled SpWsp1-VCA (Rho-VCA) for complete and ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex. Rho-VCA bound complete Arp2/3 complex with a dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) of 49 ± 5 nm and the ΔArp2 complex with an affinity of 120 ± 13 nm (Fig. 2B, inset). Because the rhodamine label can affect the affinity of VCA for Arp2/3 complex (14Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we carried out competition assays using unlabeled SpWsp1-VCA (VCA) (Fig. 2B). VCA had a slightly higher affinity (Kd = 0.4 ± 0.1 μm) for ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex than native Arp2/3 complex (Kd = 0.9 ± 0.1 μm). Therefore, the Arp2-less complex is not inactive due to a loss of ability to bind this nucleation-promoting factor. We next sought to determine if VCA bound to ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complex could recruit an actin monomer to form the ternary complex of Arp2/3 complex, NPF, and an actin monomer. This ternary complex is thought to assemble before binding to an actin filament to initiate a branch (14Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To detect interaction of the VCA NPF with actin, we used fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) from an Oregon Green 488 label on Cys-374 of actin (OG-actin) to Rho-VCA (Fig. 2C) (35Beltzner C.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 7135-7144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This assay gave a Kd of 16 ± 2 nm for Rho-VCA binding OG-actin in the absence of Arp2/3 complex (Fig. 2D). FRET was then measured in the presence of 3 μm Arp2/3 complex, so that >98% of the Rho-VCA was bound to Arp2/3 complex. The presence of 3 μm complete Arp2/3 complex slightly increased the Kd of Rho-VCA and OG-actin to 24 ± 1 nm, whereas the presence of 3 μm ΔArp2Arp2/3 complex had no effect on the binding (Kd = 12 ± 2 nm). These results indicate that both complete and ΔArp2 Arp2/3 complexes can form a ternary complex with a VCA nucleation-promoting factor and an actin monomer. Because excess Arp2/3 complex does not increase the affinity of actin for Rho-VCA, we conclude that actin does not make productive contacts with Arp2/3 complex in the ternary complex. Structure of ΔArp2 Arp2/3 Complex—To determine whether loss of the Arp2 subunit perturbs the structure of Arp2/3 complex, we solved the crystal structure of ΔArp2Arp2/3 complex using molecular replacement with a homology model based on the crystal structure of bovine Arp2/3 complex (31Beltzner C.C. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to estimate initial phases. We used this model to generate a solvent-flattened electron density map averaged using the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The map showed density for a number of features not included in the original model, including a section of 33 residues of random coil inserted into ARPC1 and ATP in the Arp3 cleft (see “Discussion”). Three successive rounds of rebuilding and restrained refinement improved the model. Of the 1615 total residues per complex, 1308 were modeled, but 287 of these were lacking density for side chains and were"

Typically, gelsolin-related proteins have three or six repeats of gelsolin-like (G) domain, and each domain plays a distinct role in severing, capping, and nucleation. The Caenorhabditis elegans gelsolin-like protein-1 (gsnl-1) gene encodes an unconventional gelsolin-related protein with four G domains. Sequence alignment suggests that GSNL-1 lacks two G domains that are equivalent to fourth and fifth G domains of gelsolin. In vitro, GSNL-1 severed actin filaments and capped the barbed end in a calcium-dependent manner. However, unlike gelsolin, GSNL-1 remained bound to the side of F-actin with a submicromolar affinity and did not nucleate actin polymerization, although it bound to G-actin with high affinity. These results indicate that GSNL-1 is a novel member of the gelsolin family of actin regulatory proteins and provide new insight into functional diversity and evolution of gelsolin-related proteins.

Actin cytoskeleton is essential for a wide variety of cellular functions, such as cell motility, phagocytosis, cell division, and muscle contraction. A tremendous number of molecules regulate the function of actin cytoskeleton. Regulation of polymerization and depolymerization of actin is crucial for the function of the actin cytoskeleton.

The actin cytoskeleton is highly differentiated into sarcomeric structures in striated muscle, and polymerization and depolymerization of actin must be precisely regulated in order to assemble and maintain striated myofibrils. Functional significance of ADF/cofilin in organized assembly of actin filaments in striated muscle has been demonstrated (1Ono S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 258: 1-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A muscle-specific ADF/cofilin isoform, M-cofilin/cofilin-2, is expressed in mammalian striated muscle (3Ono S. Minami N. Abe H.

Gelsolin-related proteins are also expressed in striated muscle, but their function in muscle is not clearly understood. Gelsolin localizes to the thin filaments in vertebrate striated muscle (10Dissmann E. Hinssen H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 336-344PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yin H.L. Albrecht J.H. Fattoum A. J.

Abe H. Obinata T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), suggesting that actin severing activity of gelsolin is inhibited or that actin filaments are protected from severing. In Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans, mutations of Flightless-1, a gelsolin-related protein with N-terminal leucine-rich repeats (14Campbell H.D. Schimansky T. Claudianos C. Ozsarac N. Kasprzak A.B. Cotsell J.N. Young I.G. de Couet H.G. Miklos G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, significance of actin severing activity of Flightless-1 has not been demonstrated. Gelsolin strongly severs actin filaments, caps the barbed ends and nucleates actin polymerization in a calcium-dependent manner (17McGough A.M. Staiger C.J. Min J.K. Simonetti K.D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Silacci P. Mazzolai L. Gauci C. Stergiopulos N. Yin H.L. Hayoz D. Cell. Mol.

The gelsolin family proteins have repeats of homologous domains of 100–120 amino acids, which are designated as gelsolin-like (G) domains. Many gelsolin-related proteins, including gelsolin, villin, Flightless-1, and adseverin/scinderin, have six G domains, whereas Physarum fragmin, Dictyostelium severin, and vertebrate CapG have three G domains (see Refs. 1Ono S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 258: 1-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and 17McGough A.M. Staiger C.J. Min J.K. Simonetti K.D.

Thus, it has been speculated that gelsolin-related proteins with six G domains have evolved from gene duplication of the three-G-domain proteins (20Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Schleicher M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, recently, unconventional gelsolin-related proteins with two, four, or five G domains have been discovered (21Gloss A.

Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1930-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Actin binding protein29 (ABP29) from Lilium pollen has only two G domains; nevertheless it has severing, nucleating, and capping activities (23Xiang Y. Huang X. Wang T. Zhang Y. Liu Q. Hussey P.J. Ren H. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1930-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, biochemical properties of other unconventional gelsolin-related proteins are not clearly understood. C. elegans has three genes that encode gelsolin-related proteins. fli-1 encodes a homolog of Flightless-1 (24Goshima M. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Okada T. Shibatohge M. Shima F. Fujimoto E. Kataoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). FLI-1 is widely expressed in many tissues, and fli-1 mutations cause a number of developmental defects (15Deng H. Xia D. Fang B. Zhang H. Genetics. 2007; 177: 847-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Viln-1 (C10H11.1) encodes a villin-like protein with six G domains and a C-terminal villin headpiece, but its function is currently under investigation. K06A4.3 encodes a gelsolin-related protein with four G domains. Because K06A4.3 was most closely related to conventional gelsolin among the three genes, this gene has been designated as gsnl-1 (gelsolin-like protein-1) in this study. We are particularly interested in the function of gsnl-1, because biochemical properties of a gelsolin-related protein with four G domains have not been characterized, and mRNA of gsnl-1 is enriched in body wall muscle (25Fox R.M. Watson J.D. Von Stetina S.E. McDermott J. Brodigan T.M. Fukushige T. Krause M. Miller 3rd, D.M. Genome Biology. 2007; 8: R188Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that the GSNL-1 protein is a strong candidate of a muscle-specific regulator of actin reorganization. Our biochemical analysis indicates that GSNL-1 is a novel gelsolin-like actin severing and capping protein but, unlike gelsolin, stays bound to the side of actin filaments, binds to G-actin in a 1:1 molar ratio, and does not nucleate actin polymerization. These results provide a new aspect of functional diversity of gelsolin-related proteins. Proteins—Rabbit muscle actin was purified from acetone powder as described (26Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled rabbit muscle G-actin was prepared as described (27Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Alexa488-labeled rabbit muscle G-actin (1.5 labels/molecule on amines) was purchased from Invitrogen. Rhodamine-labeled rabbit muscle G-actin (0.5 labels/molecule on amines) was purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. Gelsolin was purified from newborn calf serum (N4637, Sigma) as reported by Kurokawa et al. (28Kurokawa H. Fujii W. Ohmi K. Sakurai T. Nonomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After gelsolin was eluted from DEAE-cellulose, it was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using Mono Q (4.6/100PE column, Amersham Biosciences). Gelsolin was dialyzed against F-buffer (0.1 m KCl, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2) containing 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Bacterially expressed C. elegans UNC-60B was prepared as described previously (29Ono S. Benian G.M. J. Biol.

Bacterially expressed chicken CapZ (a gift of Dr. Takashi Obinata, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan) was prepared as described previously (30Soeno Y. Abe H. Kimura S. Maruyama K. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of GSNL-1—A full-length cDNA clone for GSNL-1 (yk1613a08) was obtained from Dr. Yuji Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). A full-length coding region of the GSNL-1 cDNA was amplified with PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T using an infusion cloning kit (BD Biosciences). The sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pGEX-GSNL-1 and cultured in M9ZB (18.7 mm NH4Cl, 22 mm KH2PO4, 42.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Tryptone, 85.6 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.4% glucose) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.6 cm-1. Then the culture was cooled to room temperature, and expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and homogenized by a French Pressure cell at 360–580 kg/cm2 in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4). The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were applied to a glutathione Uniflow (Clontech) column (1.5-ml bed volume). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 15 units of thrombin (Roche Applied Science) was added to cleave the N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag, and GSNL-1 eluted from the column. GSNL-1 was dialyzed against F-buffer containing 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay (23225, Pierce). Actin Filament Severing and Capping Assays with Fluorescence Microscopy—Observation of actin filament severing activity by fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (31Ichetovkin I.

Previously, we used anti-biotin antibody (Invitrogen) to immobilize biotin-labeled actin on the glass surface. However, this antibody has been discontinued by the company, and we found that several other commercially available anti-biotin antibodies were not very efficient in tethering actin filaments. Instead, unlabeled actin (1.6 μm) and Alexa488-labeled actin (0.4 μm) were co-polymerized and attached to a glass coverslip using heavy meromyosin (MH01, Cytoskeleton Inc.). Other procedures were the same as our previous reports. Capping activity of GSNL-1 was monitored as described previously (32Ono S. Mohri K. Ono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14207-14212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, Alexa488-labeled actin filaments were incubated with GSNL-1 in a perfusion chamber for 3 min, then 0.4 μm rhodamine-labeled G-actin (AR05, Cytoskeleton Inc.) was infused and allowed to elongate from free barbed ends for 3 min. Unincorporated actin was washed with anti-bleaching buffer containing 0.2 μm cytochalasin D, and micrographs of Alexa488- and rhodamine-actin from the same field were taken. Filaments were observed by epifluorescence using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope with a 60× Plan Apo objective (oil, NA = 1.4), and images were captured by a SPOT RT Monochrome CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and processed by IPLab (BD Biosciences Bioimaging) and Adobe Photoshop CS3. Light Scattering and Fluorescence Assays for Actin Depolymerization and Polymerization—Kinetics of actin depolymerization induced by gelsolin or GSNL-1 were monitored by light-scattering measurements. 10 μm actin was polymerized in the presence of 100 nm CapZ for 2 h at room temperature in F-buffer containing 0.1 mm CaCl2. CapZ-F-actin was diluted to 0.5 μm actin in F-buffer containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA in the presence of 1 μm latrunculin A (Biomol) and various concentrations of gelsolin or GSNL-1. Intensity of light scattering was monitored at a wavelength of 400 nm and at an angle of 90° with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. Kinetics of actin polymerization were monitored by measuring fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. 20 μm pyrene-labeled G-actin (20% labeled) was diluted to 2.5 μm with G buffer (0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) in the presence of gelsolin or GSNL-1. After 5 min, salt and buffer were adjusted to final concentrations of 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and actin was diluted to 2 μm. Fluorescence of pyrene (excitation at 366 nm and emission at 384 nm) was monitored for 20 min with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. To determine the critical concentration for actin polymerization, varying concentrations (0.1–1 μm) of pyrene-labeled G-actin (20% labeled) was polymerized for 18 h at room temperature in the presence of a constant concentration of GSNL-1 or CapZ in F-buffer containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Final fluorescence intensity of pyrene (excitation at 366 nm and emission at 384 nm) was measured. F-actin Sedimentation Assay—Varying concentrations of gelsolin or GSNL-1 were added to 5 μm F-actin in 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 0.1 mm EGTA. 1 mm EGTA was used for gelsolin. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the mixtures were ultracentrifuged at 436,000 × g for 15 min at 20 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were adjusted to the same volumes and subjected to SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Gels were scanned by a UMAX Powerlook III scanner at 300 dots per inch, and band intensity was quantified using Image J. Actin Monomer Binding Assays—Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described (34Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). G-actin and GSNL-1 were incubated in G-buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were supplemented with 0.25 volume of a loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed using a Bicine/triethanolamine buffer system. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (National Diagnostics). To analyze stoichiometry of actin and GSNL-1, a mixture of 10 μm actin and 10 μm GSNL-1 was applied to nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein composition of each band was examined by SDS-PAGE. Core regions of the observed six bands were excised and cut into small pieces. After washing with deionized water, 50 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added. The gel pieces were then extensively sonicated and heated at 98 °C for 5 min. The extracted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and relative band density of actin and GSNL-1 was compared with a standard (a 1:1 mixture of actin and GSNL-1). The change in the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled G-actin was used to detect binding of GSNL-1 to G-actin. A dissociation constant (Kd) for binding of GSNL-1 with G-actin was determined by a modification of the method that was developed for 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-labeled actin by Carlier et al. (35Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Varying concentrations of GSNL-1 (0.05–2 μm) were incubated with 1 μm G-actin (20% pyrene-labeled) in G-buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Then the pyrene fluorescence (F) (excitation at 366 nm and emission at 384 nm) was measured, and relative fluorescence (E) was calculated as E=(F-F0)(Fmax-F0)(Eq. 1) where F0 is fluorescence of 1 μm actin alone, and Fmax is the maximal fluorescence when GSNL-1 saturated binding to 1 μm actin. Second, the data were fitted to Equation 2, E=12c+12z-12(c+z)2-4z(Eq. 2) where z=[GSNL-1]total[actin]total(Eq. 3) and c=1+Kd[actin]total(Eq. 4) curve fitting was performed with SigmaPlot 10 (SYSTAT Software, Inc.). GSNL-1 Has Four Gelsolin-like Domains—The C. elegans gene K06A4.3 encodes a 55-kDa protein that has four gelsolin-like (G) domains (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we designated this gene as gsnl-1. Previously, Der f 16, an allergen from the house dust mite, has been reported to have four G domains (22Kawamoto S. Suzuki T. Aki T. Katsutani T. Tsuboi S. Shigeta S. Ono K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, gelsolin-related proteins typically have three or six G domains, and a protein with four G domains has not been biochemically characterized. Sequence alignment by the ClustalW2 method (36Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (21916) Google Scholar) indicates that GSNL-1 is highly homologous to Der f 16 (31% identity) and that the first three G domains (G1-G3) are very similar to the corresponding domains of human gelsolin, a six-G-domain protein, and CapG, a three-G-domain protein with no severing activity (Fig. 1B). Two regions of gelsolin, LDDYLNG in G1 and GFKHVV in a linker between G1 and G2 (boxed in Fig. 1B), are important for its actin filament severing activity. CapG does not sever actin filaments because these sequences are not conserved (37Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GSNL-1 has very similar sequence to gelsolin in these two regions (boxed in Fig. 1B), suggesting that GSNL-1 possesses severing activity. Interestingly, the ClustalW2 method aligned the fourth G domain (G4) of GSNL-1 with the sixth G domain (G6) of gelsolin (Fig. 1B). Indeed, individual comparison of GSNL-1 G4 with gelsolin G4, G5, or G6 indicated that GSNL-1 G4 is most closely related to gelsolin G6 (data not shown). One notable difference between gelsolin and GSNL-1 was that gelsolin has a flexible linker of ∼50 amino acids between G3 and G4 that acts like a hinge during calcium activation (38Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas GSNL-1 has only a very short linker of ∼10 amino acids between G3 and G4 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that gelsolin and GSNL-1 undergo different conformational changes upon calcium activation. Thus, GSNL-1 is an unconventional gelsolin-related protein that apparently lacks two G domains that are equivalent to G4 and G5 of gelsolin. GSNL-1 Severs Actin Filaments in a Calcium-dependent Manner—To elucidate whether GSNL-1 possesses actin filament severing activity, a microscopic perfusion assay (31Ichetovkin I. Han J. Pang K.M. Knecht D.A. Condeelis J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Ono S. Mohri K. Ono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14207-14212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Yamashiro S. Gimona M. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3022-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was employed. Alexa488-labeled F-actin was attached to a heavy meromyosin-coated coverslip, and GSNL-1 was infused and incubated for 3 min. Incubation of actin filaments with buffer only in the presence (Fig. 2A, a and b) or absence (Fig. 2A, k and l) of Ca2+ caused no major alteration in the morphology of the actin filaments. In the presence of 100 μm Ca2+, GSNL-1 caused fragmentation of actin filaments (Fig. 2A, c and d, e and f, g and h, i and j). Fragmentation was detected at 5 nm GSNL-1 (Fig. 2A, c and d). As the concentrations of GSNL-1 were increased, actin filaments became shorter and nearly completely disassembled at 30 nm GSNL-1 (Fig. 2A, i and j). Similar actin filament severing activity of GSNL-1 was observed when calcium concentration was decreased to 1 μm (data not shown). However, when calcium was removed by EGTA, 5–30 nm GSNL-1 did not sever actin filaments (Fig. 2A, m and n, o and p, q and r, s and t). Thus, these microscopic assays demonstrate that GSNL-1 severs actin filaments in a calcium-dependent manner. Allen et al. (39Allen P.G. Laham L.E. Way M. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4665-4670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported that gelsolin, the six-G-domain protein, severs ADP-actin more strongly than ADP-Pi actin filaments. Therefore, we tested whether GSNL-1 also preferentially severs ADP-actin. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) reversibly binds to ADP-actin filaments with a millimolar affinity (40Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin filaments in a perfusion chamber were preincubated with a buffer with or without 10 mm potassium phosphate for 5 min, then they were incubated with 40 nm GSNL-1 in the absence of Pi for 2 min. In the absence of GSNL-1, Pi caused no major alteration in the actin filaments (compare Fig. 2B, a and b, and e and f). GSNL-1 only weakly severed the filaments that were preincubated with Pi (Fig. 2B, c and d), whereas it strongly severed filaments that were preincubated in a buffer without Pi (Fig. 2B, g and h). These results indicate that GSNL-1 preferentially severs ADP-bound actin filaments in a similar manner to gelsolin (39Allen P.G. Laham L.E. Way M. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4665-4670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Next, we compared the severing activities of GSNL-1 and gelsolin by measuring the kinetics of actin depolymerization (Fig. 3). CapZ-capped actin filaments were diluted to 0.5 μm actin in the presence of GSNL-1 or gelsolin. Latrunculin A was included in the reactions to sequester actin monomers. Because 0.5 μm actin is below the critical concentration (Cc) at the pointed end, severing should increase the number of pointed ends and accelerate the rate of depolymerization. In the presence of calcium, GSNL-1 increased the light scattering signal at time 0 and gradually decreased the signal over time (Fig. 3A). Because we manually assembled the reactions in a cuvette and set in a fluorometer, there was a delay of 10–15 s before time 0. Therefore, we interpreted that the initial increase is due to rapid association of GSNL-1 to the side of actin filaments before time 0 (see below) and that the following decrease is caused by filament severing in a similar manner to ADF/cofilin (41Yamashiro S. Mohri K. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14238-14247Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the absence of calcium, 400 nm GSNL-1 did not cause significant alteration in the depolymerization kinetics (Fig. 3B). In contrast, 30 nm gelsolin decreased the initial level of light scattering in the presence of calcium (Fig. 3C, blue curve). By reducing gelsolin to 15 nm, we were able to detect a rapid decrease in light scattering within 10 s (Fig. 3C, red curve). In the presence of EGTA 30 nm gelsolin did not alter the depolymerization kinetics (Fig. 3C, green and purple curves). These results suggest that gelsolin instantaneously severs actin filaments. Our direct comparison of GSNL-1 and gelsolin revealed two major differences; 1) GSNL-1 severs actin filaments more slowly and requires higher concentrations than gelsolin, and 2) GSNL-1 initially associates with the side of filaments and gradually severs them, whereas gelsolin instantaneously severs filaments. GSNL-1 Caps the Barbed Ends of Actin Filaments—Gelsolin caps the barbed ends of actin filaments, thus preventing polymerization and depolymerization from these ends (42Harris H.E. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 177: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 43Yin H.L. Hartwig J.H. Maruyama K. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether GSNL-1 caps the barbed ends, we examined the effect of GSNL-1 on the Cc of actin. Cc at the barbed end is ∼0.1 μm, whereas Cc at the pointed end is ∼0.6 μm (44Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the barbed ends are capped, Cc of total actin will be close to the Cc value at the pointed end. When actin alone was polymerized, amounts of F-actin as measured by pyrene fluorescence, linearly increased at above 0.2 μm actin in the presence (Fig. 4A, black circles) or absence of calcium (Fig. 4B, black circles). In the presence of calcium and GSNL-1, the critical concentration was shifted, and the amounts of F-actin increased at above 0.6 μm actin, whereas at below 0.6 μm actin, fluorescence of pyrene remained constant (Fig. 4A, open circles and squares). CapZ, which is known to cap the barbed ends (45Casella J.F."
https://openalex.org/W1997882620,"We report a role for CA repeats in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in regulating CD154 expression. Human CD154 is encoded by an unstable mRNA; this instability is conferred in cis by a portion of its 3'-UTR that includes a polypyrimidine-rich region and CA dinucleotide repeat. We demonstrate similar instability activity with the murine CD154 3'-UTR. This instability element mapped solely to a conserved 100-base CU-rich region alone, which we call a CU-rich response element. Surprisingly, the CA dinucleotide-rich region also regulated reporter expression but at the level of translation. This activity was associated with poly(A) tail shortening and regulated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L levels. We conclude that the CD154 3'-UTR contains dual cis-acting elements, one of which defines a novel function for exonic CA dinucleotide repeats. These findings suggest a mechanism for the association of 3'-UTR CA-rich response element polymorphisms with CD154 overexpression and the subsequent risk of autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2049119046,The development of single-molecule tools has significantly impacted the way we think about biochemical processes. Watching a single protein in action allows us to observe kinetic details and rare subpopulations that are hidden in ensemble-averaging techniques. I will discuss here the pros and cons of the single-molecule approach in studying ligand binding in macromolecular systems and how these techniques can be applied to characterize the behavior of large multicomponent biochemical systems.
https://openalex.org/W2072318622,"The dynamic expression of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kvs) at the cell surface is a fundamental factor controlling membrane excitability. In exploring possible mechanisms controlling Kv surface expression, we identified a region in the extracellular linker between the first and second of the six (S1-S6) transmembrane-spanning domains of the Kv1.4 channel, which we hypothesized to be critical for its biogenesis. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, patch clamp electrophysiology, and mutagenesis, we identified a single threonine residue at position 330 within the Kv1.4 S1-S2 linker that is absolutely required for cell surface expression. Mutation of Thr-330 to an alanine, aspartate, or lysine prevented surface expression. However, surface expression occurred upon co-expression of mutant and wild type Kv1.4 subunits or mutation of Thr-330 to a serine. Mutation of the corresponding residue (Thr-211) in Kv3.1 to alanine also caused intracellular retention, suggesting that the conserved threonine plays a generalized role in surface expression. In support of this idea, sequence comparisons showed conservation of the critical threonine in all Kv families and in organisms across the evolutionary spectrum. Based upon the Kv1.2 crystal structure, further mutagenesis, and the partial restoration of surface expression in an electrostatic T330K bridging mutant, we suggest that Thr-330 hydrogen bonds to equally conserved outer pore residues, which may include a glutamate at position 502 that is also critical for surface expression. We propose that Thr-330 serves to interlock the voltage-sensing and gating domains of adjacent monomers, thereby yielding a structure competent for the surface expression of functional tetramers.

The function of the S1-S2 extracellular linker, however, is less clear. Mutational studies suggest the S1-S2 loop is not a major determinant of channel conductance or kinetics (6Long S.B.

Although, in many cases, a consensus site (NX(S/T)) mediating N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 1, NLG) lies within its midsection (18Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr.

Goldin A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, inspection of the entire S1-S2 linker reveals a region that is juxtaposed to the S1 transmembrane domain, which is highly conserved between Kv channels (17Li-Smerin Y. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and which, based on the Kv1.2 crystal structure, may lie in close proximity to extracellular pore mouth residues emerging from the tip of S5 in an adjacent monomer (6Long S.B.

Based on the above information, we hypothesized that conserved residues proximal to S1, in the S1-S2 linker, serve a novel and undisclosed role in Kv function. Using site-directed mutagenesis, whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, flow cytometry, and detailed imaging of eYFP-tagged Kv1.4 expressed in cell lines, we now report the identification of a highly conserved threonine residue at the S1/S1-S2 linker interface that is absolutely required for cell surface expression of Kv channels. Materials—Monoclonal antibodies GM130 and anti-calnexin were purchased from BD Biosciences and anti-HA.11 from Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA. Polyclonal anti-GFP was obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or higher purity. Molecular Biology—A clone encoding Kv1.4, tagged with eYFP at the amino terminus (Swiss-Prot P15385 (22Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar)) (wild type (WT) eYFP-Kv1.4) has been described previously (23Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The rat Kv3.1 clone was a gift from Dr. R. Joho, Dallas, TX. A construct bearing mRFP attached to the amino terminus of Kv1.4 (mRFP-Kv1.4) was prepared in two stages. First, WT eYFP-Kv1.4 was digested with NheI/HindIII to remove the sequence encoding eYFP. A PCR fragment corresponding to mRFP (forward primer: 5′-CGT CAG ATC CGC TAG CGG CAC CAT GGC CTC CT-3′; Reverse primer: 5′-ACC TCC ATA GAA GCT TGA GAA TTC CAC CAC ACT GG-3′) was then inserted into NheI/HindIII-digested WT eYFP-Kv1.4 using the BD In-fusion™ Dry-Down PCR cloning kit (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A, T330S, T330D, T330K, T330E, E502T, E502K, and Kv3.1:T211A mutations 3Numbering refers to position in reported (non-tagged) Kv sequence. were performed using the QuikChange™ II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted into the S3-S4 linker using a PCR fusion protocol and cloned in-frame into HindIII/HindII-digested eYFP-Kv1.4. The first PCR fragment extended from the 5′-HindIII site to the Gly-432 codon in Kv1.4, plus a sequence encoding the 3′ YPYDVPD portion of the HA epitope (forward primer 1: 5′-CTC AGA TCT CGA GCT CAA GCT TC-3′; reverse primer 1: 5′-TCT GGA ACA TCA TAT GGA TAG CCA CCC CCC TGC TG-3′). The second PCR product extended 5′ from the Gly-432 codon to a 3′ HindII site and contained the coding sequence for PYDVPDYA (forward primer 2: 5′-CCA TAT GAT GTT CCA GAT TAT GCT AAC GGC CAG C-3′; reverse primer 2: 5′-GCT GCA ATA AAC AAG TT-3′) overlapping the first PCR fragment. Both PCR fragments were used as templates for a third round of PCR using forward primer 1 and reverse primer 2. The resulting fragment was then cloned into digested WT eYFP-Kv1.4 using the BD In-fusion™ Dry-Down PCR cloning kit (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. A construct encoding eYFP fused to the amino terminus of Kv3.1 was prepared through PCR cloning as described above. The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by in-house sequencing. Tissue Culture—HEK293 and COS-7 cells (ECACC) were subcultured every 3-4 days and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v), 2 mml-glutamine (w/v), and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. All transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to transfection, cells from a confluent T75 flask were resuspended, seeded at a ratio of 1:4 into a 6-well plate, and grown to 50% confluency overnight at 37 °C. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells, were reseeded at a ratio of 1:4 onto collagen-coated coverslips for immunofluorescence and electrophysiology or into 25-cm3 flasks for FACS analysis. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell currents were recorded in transfected HEK293 cells using the voltage clamp configuration of the patch clamp technique. Single, moderately green-fluorescing cells were selected for recording 48 h after transfection. The bathing solution contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH (320-330 mosm). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 110 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 K4-BAPTA, 2 K2-ATP and 10 HEPES, adjusted with KOH to pH 7.2 (300-310 mosm). Pipettes were manufactured from borosilicate glass using a model P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments) and displayed a resistance of 2-3 megohms when filled with pipette solution. Currents were evoked from a holding potential of -80 mV in 20-mV voltage steps of 1500 ms, between -60 mV and + 60 mV, with an intersweep interval of 15 s. Command and acquisition was performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, Digidata 1322A analogue-digital converter, and Clampex 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). Capacitative transients were cancelled by analog compensation. Series resistance was typically <10 megohms and was not compensated. The +60mV voltage step was used to determine peak and steady-state (end of step) current densities. Current traces were fit as described (23Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of Transfected HEK293 and COS-7 Cells—Transiently transfected HEK293 and COS-7 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 48 h post-transfection and mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold anti-fade (Molecular Probes). The surface expression of HA-tagged Kv1.4 proteins was determined by incubating live cells with anti-HA antibodies (1:1000) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to fixation and subsequent detection with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch and Stratech Scientific, Cambridgeshire, UK). Intracellular staining of organelles and total (intracellular + surface) protein detection was performed by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde (as described above), and permeabilizing with 0.5% saponin for 5 min followed by incubation with primary antibodies raised against the appropriate markers at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 0.01% (v/v) saponin/PBS-. Detection of specific staining was performed with the appropriate Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200). All imaging was done within 1 day of fixation. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—For surface expression analysis (24McKeown L. Robinson P. Greenwood S.M. Hu W. Jones O.T. BMC Biotechnol. 2006. 2006; 6: 15Google Scholar), cells at 48-72 h post-transfection were resuspended and the concentration adjusted to 5 × 107 cells/ml with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% FBS (v/v). Aliquots (100 μl) of cells were then incubated with anti-HA primary antibody (10 μg/ml in Dulbecco's PBS with calcium and magnesium (PBS+)) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes with 300 μl of PBS+ containing 1% FBS (v/v), samples were incubated with Cy5-conjugated goat secondary anti-mouse IgG1 (1:200) diluted in 10% FBS and 90% PBS+ (v/v) for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were then fixed with 100-μl aliquots of 2% (w/v) formaldehyde, 100 μl of PBS-, and 300 μl of PBS+. The dilutions of antibodies used were saturating as confirmed by titration. Cells (20,000/sample) were analyzed in a FACScaliber® flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and mean fluorescence intensity values were taken. DeltaVision Deconvolution Microscopy—Cells on mounted coverslips were visualized using a DeltaVision restoration microscope system (Applied Precision Instruments, Seattle, WA) comprising an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope fitted with a ×100 UPLAN objective (NA 1.35) and Photometrics CH350L charge-coupled device camera interfaced to a Unix-based computer system equipped with SoftWoRx, version 3.5.0, acquisition software. Epifluorescence was recorded using filter sets for DAPI/FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)/Texas Red and Cy3/Cy5. Wide field optical sections of 0.2 μm were acquired throughout the z plane of the cells. The resulting z stacks were then deconvolved using a constrained iterative algorithm assigned by DeltaVision (24McKeown L. Robinson P. Greenwood S.M. Hu W. Jones O.T. BMC Biotechnol. 2006. 2006; 6: 15Google Scholar). Surface and intracellular fluorescence analyses were performed by comparing fluorescence intensity-distance (pixels) profiles (line scans) on color-split RGB images for red (surface), where applicable (HA-tagged Kvs), green (total Kv), and blue (nuclei) from a point of origin (Xo) on the nucleus to an end point (Xe) beyond the cell margin, noting the positions of the nuclear (Xn) and plasma (Xm) membrane (supplemental Fig. S1). Mean intracellular (Ic) intensities (fluorescence intensity/pixel) were then calculated as the total green fluorescence integrated over distance Xm - Xn divided by the distance (Xm - Xn) in pixels. Mean membrane intensities (Im) for green Kv fluorescence were derived similarly, averaging green Kv fluorescence between membrane boundaries defined by either the peak red (surface) fluorescence (anti-HA images) or (for non-anti-HA images) assuming an average membrane width of ±10 pixels about Xm (a conservative assumption, which overestimates Im particularly when surface expression is low). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for n samples. Curve fits and regression analysis were done using SigmaPlot software (Systat, San Jose, CA). Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's or Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc analysis with SigmaStat and Microsoft Excel software. Mutation of Threonine 330 to Alanine Localizes Kv1.4 to the ER and Reduces Its Surface Expression—Mammalian Kv channels contain an S1-S2 extracellular linker that is highly variable both in length and composition (1Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Lazdunski M. Mckinnon D. Pardo L.A. Robertson G.A. Rudy B. Sanguinetti M.C. Stühmer W. Wang X. Pharmacol.

Watanabe I. Poholek A. Koss M. Gomez B. Yan C. Recio-Pinto E. Thornhill W.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, sequence comparisons identify an extracellular region flanking, the S1 transmembrane-spanning domain (residues in Kv1.4, LETL) that is highly conserved between all members of the rat Kv1 family (Fig. 1) and, within this region, a threonine residue conserved across other voltage-gated Kv family members (17Li-Smerin Y. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, boxed and asterisk). To define the role of the threonine residue, we tested its functional contribution in Kv1.4 modified with an amino-terminal eYFP tag (hereafter, WT eYFP-Kv1.4), a model Kv channel that shows efficient surface expression and assembly in diverse expression systems (23Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Kupper J. Eur. J.

Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we first replaced the corresponding residue, Thr-330,3 with an alanine (construct eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A). For the bulk of our analysis, expression was conducted in HEK293 cells owing to their lack of endogenous Kvs (23Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), ability to recapitulate phosphorylation-dependent Kv regulation (27Mohapatra D.P. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and neuronal origin (28Shaw G. Morse S. Ararat M. Graham F.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of HEK293 cells with WT eYFP-Kv1.4 and subsequent fluorescence imaging revealed strong fluorescence at the margins of all cells examined (n = 200), commensurate with cell surface localization. Detailed line scan analysis (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) showed that the ratio of surface (Im) to intracellular (Ic) WT eYFP-Kv1.4 fluorescence was constant, regardless of expression level (supplemental Fig. S1, G and H). Identical to previous reports, we also saw some intracellular labeling consistent with the presence of WT eYFP-Kv1.4 in intracellular trafficking organelles (23Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, i). In contrast, HEK293 cells transfected with eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A showed a pattern of fluorescence resembling that for localization in the ER (29Jones V.C. McKeown L. Verkhratsky A. Jones O.T. BMC Neurosci. 2008. 2008; 9: 10Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, ii (n = 180)). Line scan analysis (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D) showed that the ratio of surface (Im) to intracellular (Ic) eYFP-Kv1.4: T330A fluorescence was significantly (p < 0.001, t test) lower (Im/Ic = 0.46 ± 0.03 (n = 15)) compared with WT-eYFP-Kv1.4 (Im/Ic = 1.5 ± 0.13 (n = 12)), and constant, regardless of expression level (supplemental Fig. S1, G and H). Following transfection of COS-7 cells, WT eYFP-Kv1.4 was localized to ruffles at the cell periphery and the planar surface (Fig. 2A, iii), and eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A was restricted to an intracellular compartment, most likely the ER (Fig. 2A, iv). Thus, WT- and eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A show very different distributions regardless of the host cell in which they are expressed and of the construct expression levels. In no case did we find evidence for aggregation within the ER or the cytoplasm such as that reported for expression of highly misfolded Kv channels (3Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Rajamani S. January C.T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1418-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or cytotoxicity (not shown). To confirm that eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A was localized to the ER, transfected HEK293 cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry using antibodies raised against calnexin (an ER-localized protein) and GM130, a protein localized to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2B) (24McKeown L. Robinson P. Greenwood S.M. Hu W. Jones O.T. BMC Biotechnol. 2006. 2006; 6: 15Google Scholar). Neither WT eYFP-Kv1.4 nor eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A labeling co-localized with the Golgi marker (Fig. 2B, i and iii, respectively), nor was there significant overlap between WT eYFP-Kv1.4 expression and calnexin staining (Fig. 2B, ii). However, eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A labeling completely overlapped that of calnexin (Fig. 2B, iv), indicating that the mutant channel was indeed localized to the ER and not expressed at the cell surface. Further evidence for the lack of eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A channels at the cell surface was obtained through whole-cell patch clamping of transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3). Within 48 h of transfection, cells expressing WT eYFP-Kv1.4 displayed large outward K+ currents in response to depolarization (Fig. 3A, left). In contrast, cells expressing eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A showed negligible currents (Fig. 3A, right) similar to those obtained in mock transfected cells (not shown). To facilitate the comparison and compensate for differences in cell size, currents (in pA) were standardized to corresponding capacitances (in pF) to yield current densities (23Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with WT eYFP-Kv1.4 showed peak and steady-state current densities of 1279 ± 144 pA/pF (n = 7) and 748 ± 104 pA/pF (n = 7), respectively, whereas those for cells transfected with eYFP-Kv1.4:T330A were 22-28 fold lower (peak, 45.2 ± 11.2 pA/pF (n = 5); steady state, 33.2 ± 9.0 pA/pF (n = 5)) (p < 0.01, Tukey) (Fig. 3B). The effects of the Thr-to-Ala mutation are also independent of the eYFP tag, because cells transfected with a Kv1.4:Thr → Ala construct lacking eYFP showed peak and steady-state currents of 18 ± 7 pA/pF (n = 5) and 12 ± 5 pA/pF (n = 11) (p < 0.01, Tukey (data not shown)), some 30-fold lower than reported for WT Kv1.4 (25Kupper J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3908-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen.

https://openalex.org/W2025870536,"The intrinsic activity of coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa) is dependent on Ca2+ binding to a loop (residues 210–220) in the protease domain. Structural analysis revealed that Ca2+ may enhance the activity by attenuating electrostatic repulsion of Glu296 and/or by facilitating interactions between the loop and Lys161 in the N-terminal tail. In support of the first mechanism, the mutations E296V and D212N resulted in similar, about 2-fold, enhancements of the amidolytic activity. Moreover, mutation of the Lys161-interactive residue Asp217 or Asp219 to Ala reduced the amidolytic activity by 40–50%, whereas the K161A mutation resulted in 80% reduction. Hence one of these Asp residues in the Ca2+-binding loop appears to suffice for some residual interaction with Lys161, whereas the more severe effect upon replacement of Lys161 is due to abrogation of the interaction with the N-terminal tail. However, Ca2+ attenuation of the repulsion between Asp212 and Glu296 keeps the activity above that of apoFVIIa. Altogether, our data suggest that repulsion involving Asp212 in the Ca2+-binding loop suppresses FVIIa activity and that optimal activity requires a favorable interaction between the Ca2+-binding loop and the N-terminal tail. Crystal structures of tissue factor-bound FVIIaD212N and FVIIaV158D/E296V/M298Q revealed altered hydrogen bond networks, resembling those in factor Xa and thrombin, after introduction of the D212N and E296V mutations plausibly responsible for tethering the N-terminal tail to the activation domain. The charge repulsion between the Ca2+-binding loop and the activation domain appeared to be either relieved by charge removal and new hydrogen bonds (D212N) or abolished (E296V).

FVIIa, behaves zymogen-like with low enzymatic activity as opposed to other, constitutively active serine proteases of the coagulation cascade.

In the active conformation of FVIIa, a salt bridge is formed between the N-terminal α-amino group of Ile153 and the side chain of Asp343 in the activation pocket of the activation domain. 3Amino acid sequence numbering (FVIIa, chymotrypsinogen) is as follows: 153, 16; 156, 19; 157, 20; 158, 21; 161, 24; 210, 70; 211, 71; 212, 72; 213, 73; 214, 74; 217, 77; 219, 79; 220, 80; 283, 140; 295, 153; 296, 154; 297, 155, 298, 156; 306, 164; 312, 170; 343, 194. The latter is positioned next to the active site Ser344 (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). FVIIa is only fully active upon TF binding and Ca2+ binding to nine sites located in three different domains, including the Ca2+-binding Glu210–Glu220 loop in the protease domain (10Wildgoose P. Foster D. Schiødt J. Wiberg F.C. Birktoft J.J. Petersen L.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Sabharwal A.K. Birktoft J.J. Gorka J. Wildgoose P. Petersen L.C. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Upon binding of the cofactors, an activity increase of several 1,000-fold is observed, in part by shifting the equilibrium from the zymogen-like form toward the catalytically active conformation of FVIIa (12Bom V.J.J. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding alone leads to a more than 10-fold increase in activity (14Persson E. Petersen L.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activating effect of TF has been partially mimicked by means of grafting (see Ref. 15Soejima K. Mizuguchi J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (see Ref. 16Persson E. Bak H. Østergaard A. Olsen O.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) of the loop succeeding the TF-interactive helix (residues 306–312) yielding FVIIa variants with increased intrinsic activity. Replacements of residues in the vicinity of the activation domain have also improved FVIIa activity. Notably, the residues Val158, Glu296, and Met298 appear to form a zymogenicity-determining triad close to the activation domain. Replacements by the corresponding three residues in homologous coagulation factors have resulted in FVIIa variants with substantially increased intrinsic activity (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. J. Biol.

The most dramatic increase requires conversion of the entire 3-residue motif to that found in thrombin and factor IXa (V158D/E296V/M298Q-FVIIa) (FVIIaDVQ) (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu296 to Val reduced the dependence on Ca2+ suggesting a link to the stimulatory Ca2+ effect, possibly via insertion of the N terminus (20Persson E. Olsen O.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5950-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, residue 296 has been linked to macromolecular substrate-induced maturation of the catalytic cleft as inferred from a conformational change upon binding of a monoclonal antibody (21Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using a change-of-function mutagenesis and crystal structural approach, we have further investigated the zymogenicity and Ca2+ dependence of FVIIa. We hypothesized that the effects of Ca2+ on FVIIa activity are through stabilization of the Ca2+-binding loop, i.e. stabilization of the interaction(s) of Asp217/Asp219 with Lys161 in the N-terminal tail, and through alleviation of charge repulsion between the loop, primarily Asp212, and the nearby Glu296. The latter residue had been mutated in an earlier study (20Persson E. Olsen O.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5950-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the other four were replaced in the present study to obtain a complete set of variants to test the hypothesis. Lys161, Asp217, and Asp219 were replaced by Ala to remove the charges without introducing new interactions (van der Waals or hydrogen bonds). Asp212 was replaced by Asn hereby removing the charge with minimal alteration. Our data suggest that Ca2+ binding to the 210–220 loop in the protease domain of FVIIa promotes the intrinsic activity through stabilization of electrostatic interactions of Asp217 and Asp219 with Lys161 in the N-terminal tail and mitigation of the repulsion by Asp212 of Glu296 located close to loop 1 of the activation domain. Indeed, Asp212 was identified as a new zymogenicity determinant, because the charge removal led to an increased intrinsic activity and degree of N terminus burial. Protein Preparations—The construct pLN174 consisting of the cDNA encoding wild-type human FVII inserted into pZem219b was previously described (23Persson E. Nielsen L.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced into pLN174 using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following primers (only sense primers given), with base substitutions in italics and the affected codons underlined, were used to introduce the indicated mutations: K161A, 5′-G GGG GGC AAG GTG TGC CCC GCA GGG GAG TGT CCA TGG CAG GTC C; D212N, 5′-C CTG ATC GCG GTG CTG GGC GAG CAC AAC CTC AGC GAG CAC G; D217A, 5′ C CTC AGC GAG CAC GCC GGG GAT GAG C; D219A, 5′ G CAC GAC GGG GCT GAG CAG AGC C. Baby hamster kidney and Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cell lines producing the FVIIa mutants were generated as described (24Bolt G. Steenstrup T.D. Kristensen C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 98: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The baby hamster kidney cell line producing the V158D/E296V/M298Q mutant was previously described (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Purification of wild-type and mutant FVII from cell culture medium was carried out essentially as described (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) using an anion-exchange and immunoaffinity based purification process. Activation of zymogen FVII was performed either by autoactivation or by the use of Sepharose-coupled FXa or soluble FIXa. The latter was separated from FVIIa using an immunoaffinity column. FVIIa concentrations were estimated from absorbance measurements at 280 nm. Active FVIIa enzyme concentrations were determined by an amidolytic activity assay; the activities of the FVIIa variants, diluted to 10 nm and mixed with 50 nm sTF, were compared with those of mixtures of 10 nm sTF and 50 nm FVIIa variant (from which the activity of excess FVIIa variant had been subtracted). If the activities of the two mixtures were indistinguishable, the originally estimated concentration of FVIIa variant equaled the active concentration and if not, the active concentration was adjusted ([active FVIIa] = estimated [FVIIa] multiplied by the activity ratio (10 nm FVIIa plus 50 nm sTF/10 nm sTF plus 50 nm FVIIa)). This method allows for the calculation of relative activities (Table 1). Plasma-derived FX and FXa were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Active site-inhibited FVIIa variants were obtained by incubation with the inhibitor PhePheArg-chloromethylketone essentially as described (26Sørensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgård P.O. Kjalke M.

Soluble TF (sTF, residues 1–209) was produced as described (27Freskgård P.-O. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Amidolytic and Proteolytic Activity Assays—All measurements were performed at room temperature in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The amidolytic activity of variant/wild-type FVIIa (100 nm) was measured with or without 1 μm sTF. Initial kinetic rates were determined from absorbance (405 nm) development using the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (2.5 mm) (H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Chromogenix) monitored for 5–30 min with readings every 30 s in a SpectraMax 340 microplate reader (Global Medical Instrumentation, Inc., MN). The proteolytic activities were measured by incubating 50 nm FVIIa variant with 1 μm FX for 40 min, stopping the reaction with excess EDTA, and measuring the resulting FXa activity by adding 0.5 mm S-2765 (Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Chromogenix). The rate of substrate hydrolysis catalyzed by a FVIIa mutant was divided by the rate seen with wild-type FVIIa to obtain the relative activity. Carbamylation Assay—The carbamylation of Ile153 was performed by incubation of 100 nm to 2 μm variant/wild-type FVIIa with 0.2 m potassium cyanate in assay buffer (see above) without bovine serum albumin. Samples were withdrawn at different time points and diluted 10-fold in assay buffer containing 5 mm S-2288 and hydrolysis was monitored for 2–5 min as described for the amidolytic assay. AT Inhibition Assay—AT inhibition was performed by incubation of 100 nm variant/wild-type FVIIa with 100 μg/ml AT and 1 unit/ml heparin in assay buffer. Samples were withdrawn at different time points and diluted 2-fold in assay buffer containing 5 mm S-2288 and hydrolysis monitored for 2–5 min. Crystallization Conditions—Active site-inhibited FVIIa mutants in complex with sTF-(1–209) were purified using a Superdex75 16/60 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences). A buffer composition of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 15 mm CaCl2 was used. Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 16% (w/v) PEG4000, 12% (v/v) 1-propanol, and a protein concentration of 3–4 mg/ml (28Zhang E. St. Charles R. Tulinsky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2089-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The crystals grew as thin plates with dimensions up to 0.4 × 0.6 × 0.05 mm. Crystal Data Collection and Processing—Crystallographic data collection was performed at the synchrotron beam lines MaxLab 711/911 (MaxLab, Lund, Sweden) (29Cerenius Y. Stahl K. Svensson L.A. Ursby T. Oskarsson A. Albertsson J. Liljas A. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2000; 7: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Crystals were flash frozen in a cryoprotective solution composed of precipitating solution with 20% (v/v) glycerol. Data reduction calculations were performed with the XDS software package (30Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3240) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using the Molrep program, part of the CCP4 package (31Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4173) Google Scholar, 32Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19795) Google Scholar), and PDB code 1DAN as a search model (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Model building was performed using the Coot program (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23586) Google Scholar) and maximum likelihood based iterative refinement, initially performed as a rigid body refinement, using the Refmac5 program, part of the CCP4 package (32Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19795) Google Scholar, 34Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (35DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) was used for structure analysis and creation of figures. Functional Characterization—The intrinsic amidolytic activities were measured for FVIIaD212N, FVIIaDVQ, and Ala mutants at positions Lys161, Asp217, and Asp219 using the peptidyl substrate S-2288 (Table 1). It is worth mentioning that none of the removed Asp residues (212, 217, and 219) are side chain Ca2+ ligands (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The amidolytic activity of free FVIIaD212N was increased 2-fold compared with wild-type FVIIa, whereas that of FVIIaDVQ was considerably higher as previously reported (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Persson E. Olsen O.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5950-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The three Ala mutants exhibited reduced amidolytic activities. In the presence of sTF-(1–209), no significant difference in activity between FVIIaD212N, FVIIaDVQ, and wild-type FVIIa could be observed, indicating that the activity-enhancing effects of the mutations are manifested only in the absence of the cofactor. In contrast, FVIIaK161A, FVIIaD217A, and FVIIaD219A displayed a similar reduction in amidolytic activity whether bound to sTF or not. To further characterize the variants with increased intrinsic activity, we performed inhibition experiments using the serpin AT in the presence of heparin. Previous studies have demonstrated that TF enhances the susceptibility to inhibition by AT/heparin 33-fold compared with the free form of FVIIa as a result of TF-induced maturation of the active site (36Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 767-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rao L.V. Rapaport S.I. Hoang A.D. Blood. 1993; 81: 2600-2607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, increased AT inhibition rates of FVIIa variants with increased intrinsic activities have also been shown to correlate with the levels of intrinsic amidolytic activity (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Persson E. Olsen O.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5950-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In line with this, FVIIaD212N and FVIIaDVQ displayed ∼2- and 5-fold faster inhibition compared with wild-type reflecting their relative activities (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This supports the notion that the amino acid changes in the Ca2+-binding loop and those close to the activation domain surrounding the N terminus affect the degree of maturation of the active site. With sTF-(1–209), the AT inhibition of FVIIaD212N and FVIIaDVQ was indistinguishable from that of wild-type FVIIa (data not shown). The proteolytic activity of free FVIIaD212N was significantly decreased compared with wild-type FVIIa (Table 1). We perceive this as an apparent Km effect, because FVIIaD212A in the presence of sTF has previously been reported to have an equally decreased proteolytic activity (38Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The three Ala mutants exhibited reductions of proteolytic activity in parallel with the amidolytic activities. It has been shown that the activating effect of TF on FVIIa is directly linked to insertion of the N terminus into the activation pocket (39Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18891-18898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical modification of the exposed α-amino group of the NH-terminal Ile153 of FVIIa prevents formation of the salt bridge with Asp343. We used carbamylation to assess the extent of burial of the N terminus in the activation pocket and found that FVIIaD212N and FVIIaDVQ were modified about 2- and 10-fold slower than wild-type FVIIa, respectively, indicating a more stably buried N terminus in both variants (Fig. 2 and Table 1). This suggests that the conformational equilibria of FVIIaD212N and FVIIaDVQ are shifted toward the catalytically active conformation compared with that of wild-type FVIIa. We have previously shown that Ca2+ has a reduced influence on the amidolytic activity of FVIIaDVQ due to the E296V mutation (20Persson E. Olsen O.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5950-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Removal of Ca2+ resulted in the loss of ∼30% of the activity of FVIIaDVQ, whereas the amidolytic activities of all the other mutants, including FVIIaD212N, and FVIIa were reduced by more than 90%. To pinpoint the reason for the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on FVIIa activity, we studied the importance of the interactions between Asp217 and Asp219 in the Ca2+-binding loop and Lys161 in the N-terminal tail. Replacing either Asp217 or Asp219 by Ala reduced the amidolytic activity by 40–50% in the presence of Ca2+ (Table 1). The substitution of Lys161 for Ala reduced the activity even further (about 20% residual activity). The reduced activity of the Ala mutants precluded differentiation from wild-type FVIIa in terms of AT inhibition and carbamylation, which occurs very slowly and rapidly, respectively, already in FVIIa. The intermediate activities of the two Asp to Ala mutants indicate that one Asp residue suffices for some residual interaction with Lys161, whereas the more severe effect upon substitution of Ala for Lys161 is due to abrogation of the interaction of the Asp residues in the Ca2+-binding loop with the N-terminal tail. However, the activity of FVIIaK161A in the presence of Ca2+ was still higher than that of FVIIa in the absence of Ca2+ probably because the repulsion between Asp212 and Glu296 becomes attenuated by Ca2+. Structure Determinations of FVIIaD212N and FVIIaDVQ in Complex with sTF-(1–209)—The structures of active site-inhibited FVIIaD212N and FVIIaDVQ in complex with sTF-(1–209) were determined to 2.70- and 2.20-Å resolution, respectively (Table 2). In the case of FVIIaDVQ, the cell parameters indicated higher symmetry space groups, but scaling of intensities in the XDS program package showed the actual symmetries to be monoclinic. Due to high diffraction anisotropy, the FVIIaDVQ structure displayed an overall completeness of 80.3%. This was primarily due to low completeness of the outermost resolution bins, despite acceptable I/σ-values (>2.0) in these bins. Completeness for data below 2.4 Å was, however, above 96%.TABLE 2Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticssTF1-209-FVIIaDVQsTF1-209-FVIIaD212NSpace groupP1211 (sg 4)P1211 (sg 4)Unit cell (Å/o)a/α78.36/90.0078.41/90.00b/β68.56/90.2268.79/98.28c/γ78.82/90.00148.58/90.00Wavelength (Å)1.081.05Resolution range (Å)29.19-2.2019.90-2.70No. of measured reflections63,917140,643No. of unique reflections34,71942,930Redundancy1.83.3Completeness (%)80.3 (26.0)98.9 (97.9)I/σ(I)6.9 (2.1)6.9 (2.5)RmergeaRmerge = ∑hkl| — 〈Ihkl〉|/∑hklIhkl, where Ihkl and 〈Ihkl〉 are the diffraction intensity value of the individual measurement and the corresponding mean value for reflection hkl, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The structures were solved by means of the molecular replacement method using amino acid coordinates of the previously published PhePheArg-cmk inhibited FVIIa-TF structure (PDB code 1DAN) as a search model (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). One outstanding solution in the molecular replacement search was obtained for each of the scaled datasets of FVIIaDVQ and FVIIaD212N with one and two molecules, respectively, per asymmetric unit. Refinements were initially performed using rigid body minimization and followed by several cycles of restrained refinement. In the case of FVIIaD212N, non-crystallographic symmetry-restrained refinement was used with medium restraints for both main chain and side chain atoms. The protein models were inserted into the electron densities and further model building of the covalently bound inhibitor PhePheArg-cmk was performed followed by addition of water molecules. The mutated residues were identified in the electron density. Because of poor or lacking density, a large N-terminal portion (Ala1–Gly47 in both FVIIaD212N and FVIIaDVQ) of the light chain and several loops of the second fibronectin-like domain of TF (different in the FVIIaD212N- and FVIIaDVQ-sTF structures) were excluded in the final structure models. Altogether, 1073 of 1230 and 539 of 615 residues in total were defined in a 2Fo – Fc electron density map at 1σ cut-off of FVIIaD212N/sTF-(1–209) (crystallographic dimer) and FVIIaDVQ/sTF-(1–209), respectively. High flexibility in these parts is assumed to be the reason for absent or poorly defined electron density. All mutations were located in the well defined protease domain, distant from the poorly defined parts, and did not appear to influence the overall fold of the protease domain as such. The protease domains of both variants displayed an excellent trace, which was also reflected in the lowest overall domain flexibility as judged from temperature factors. The overall conformations of sTF-(1–209) and the FVIIa variants and the arrangements of the light and heavy chains of the FVIIa variants were very similar to the published structure of Banner and colleagues (PDB code 1DAN) (9Banner D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2049160531,"There is a lack of experimental structural information about folding intermediates of multidomain proteins. Tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI) is a small, disulfide-rich protein consisting of two domains that fold and unfold autonomously through the formation of two major intermediates, IIIa and IIIb. Each intermediate contains three native disulfide bonds in one domain and six free cysteines in the other domain. Here we have determined the NMR structures of these two intermediates trapped and isolated at acidic pH in which they are stable and compared their structures with that of the native protein analyzed under the same conditions. Both IIIa and IIIb were found to contain a folded region that corresponds to the N- and C-terminal domains of TCI, respectively, with structures very similar to the corresponding regions of the native protein. The remainder of the polypeptide chains of the intermediates was shown to be unfolded in a random coil conformation. Solvent exchange measurements further indicated that the two protein domains are not completely independent, but affect each other in terms of dynamics and stability, in agreement with reported inhibitory activity data. The derived results provide structural evidence for symmetric TCI folding and unfolding mechanisms that converge in IIIa and IIIb and reveal the structural basis that accounts for the strong and simultaneous accumulation of both intermediates. Altogether, this work has important implications for a better understanding of the folding mechanisms of multidomain, disulfide-rich proteins. There is a lack of experimental structural information about folding intermediates of multidomain proteins. Tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI) is a small, disulfide-rich protein consisting of two domains that fold and unfold autonomously through the formation of two major intermediates, IIIa and IIIb. Each intermediate contains three native disulfide bonds in one domain and six free cysteines in the other domain. Here we have determined the NMR structures of these two intermediates trapped and isolated at acidic pH in which they are stable and compared their structures with that of the native protein analyzed under the same conditions.

Altogether, this work has important implications for a better understanding of the folding mechanisms of multidomain, disulfide-rich proteins. Understanding the sequence of folding events that lead to a biologically active protein from its amino acid sequence is one of the major challenges in structural and molecular biology. The initial theoretical efforts devoted to the study of protein folding have been reinforced in the last several years by the discovery of a wide range of pathological diseases associated with protein misfolding and the increasing pharmacological interest in protein drug design (1.Cheng Y. LeGall T. Oldfield C.J. Mueller J.P. Van Y.Y. Romero P. Cortese M.S. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K.

Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). The structural characterization of partially folded intermediates and the analysis of the interactions that stabilize them are of fundamental importance to unveil the folding mechanisms (3.Creighton T.E. Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Faseb. J. 1996; 10: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4.Religa T.L. Markson J.S. Mayor U. Freund S.M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 2005; 437: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). But these studies are hampered by the rapid and cooperative nature of protein folding, and therefore, the short half-life of the intermediates arising during the folding reaction. It is however possible to trap and isolate discrete intermediates from the oxidative folding of disulfide-rich proteins because of the particular chemistry of disulfide bond formation that takes place as an integral part of disulfide folding (5.Creighton T.E. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Narayan M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4207-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). A large set of single domain, disulfide-rich proteins has been investigated to date in terms of oxidative folding; among them, outstanding examples such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), 5The abbreviations used are: BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; TCI, tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor; ΔGex, free energy of exchange; DTT, dithiothreitol; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; (M)CP, (metallo)carboxypeptidase; N, native protein; R, fully reduced/unfolded protein; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RNase A, ribonuclease A; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography; TAFI, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 5The abbreviations used are: BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; TCI, tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor; ΔGex, free energy of exchange; DTT, dithiothreitol; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; (M)CP, (metallo)carboxypeptidase; N, native protein; R, fully reduced/unfolded protein; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RNase A, ribonuclease A; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography; TAFI, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; PDB, Protein Data Bank. ribonuclease A (RNase A), hirudin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), or conotoxins (7.Bulaj G.

These folding studies have involved the trapping (either by acidification or alkylation), isolation by liquid chromatography, and final disulfide analysis of the intermediates that accumulate. The extent of heterogeneity of intermediates, together with their number and type (native or non-native) of disulfide bonds has been used as a general premise to classify the folding landscape of these proteins (12.Arolas J.L. Aviles F.X. Chang J.Y. Ventura S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13.Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4522-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Structural studies of disulfide folding intermediates have been mostly focused on analogs of single domain proteins, such as BPTI, RNase A, or lysozyme, with the cysteines of the missing disulfide bond(s) mutated to alanines or serines (14.Kortemme T.

However, many disulfide-rich proteins are of a multidomain nature, for which the folding processes are expected to be more complicated. According to this scenario, there is a need for structural studies of genuine intermediates of multidomain, disulfide-rich proteins to shed light on their folding mechanisms. Of special interest is to clarify to what extent the folding pathways of this kind of polypeptides are modulated by interdomain interactions. Tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI) is a small protein of 75 residues that tightly inhibits metallocarboxypeptidases (MCPs) of the A/B subfamily with nanomolar Ki (27.Arolas J.L. Lorenzo J. Rovira A. Castella J. Aviles F.X. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3441-3448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Its strong inhibition of plasma CPB, also known as thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), stimulates the fibrinolysis of blood clots making it a promising adjuvant for use in thrombolytic therapies based on the tissue-type plasminogen activator (28.Arolas J.L. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of TCI in complex with bovine CPA, human CPB, and bovine TAFI have revealed the presence of two domains that are structurally similar despite sharing a low sequence homology (29.Arolas J.L. Popowicz G.M. Lorenzo J. Sommerhoff C.P. Huber R. Aviles F.X. Holak T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30.Sanglas S. Valnickova Z. Arolas J.L.

The NMR solution structure of free TCI at pH 5.5 has recently shown that the two globular domains are joined by a flexible linker (31.Pantoja-Uceda D. Arolas J.L. García P. López-Hernández E. Padró D. Aviles F.X. Blanco F.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7066-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Each domain comprises three disulfide bonds of identical pattern that constrain the TCI structure contributing to its extremely high stability against temperature and denaturing agents. The oxidative folding and reductive unfolding pathways of TCI and its individual domains have been examined in a previous study by acid-trapping and further chromatographic analysis of the occurring intermediates (32.Arolas J.L. Bronsoms S. Ventura S. Aviles F.X. Calvete J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22906-22916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TCI folding proceeds through a sequential oxidation of cysteines that leads to the formation of a complex population of non-native 6-disulfide (scrambled) isomers. The reshuffling of these forms into the native protein represents the strongest kinetic trap of the folding reaction. Importantly, the two domains of TCI appear to fold and unfold autonomously based on the predominant accumulation of two 3-disulfide intermediates (termed IIIa and IIIb) that contain, respectively, the three native disulfide bonds of the N- and C-terminal domains of TCI. The current work reports the solution structures of the IIIa and IIIb intermediates trapped by acidification and purified from the folding process by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The ensemble of NMR structures, determined at pH 3.5, showed for both species a native-like fold in the domain crosslinked by the three native disulfide bonds and an unfolded conformation in the other domain containing the six free cysteines. Amide proton exchange experiments revealed a decreased stability of native TCI at acidic pH and an increased backbone dynamics in the folded domain of each intermediate with respect to the native form. This indicates that the two protein halves are not completely independent of each other in the folded state, which is in agreement with reported stability and inhibitory activity data. To our knowledge, this study represents the first structural determination of genuine folding intermediates of a two-domain, disulfide-rich protein, providing interesting insights into the molecular rules that account for symmetry in the oxidative folding and reductive unfolding of TCI. Protein Expression and Purification—TCI was expressed and purified as previously reported (27.Arolas J.L. Lorenzo J. Rovira A. Castella J. Aviles F.X. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3441-3448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pBAT-4-OmpA-TCI plasmid, transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), was grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium (0.5% glycerol) supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids and induced at A600 = 1.0 with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration). The secreted TCI was refolded by overnight incubation of the supernatant with 2 mm cystine and 4 mm cysteine (final concentration) at pH 8.4 to obtain the maximum amount of native protein. The native TCI was initially purified by hydrophobic chromatography in a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), followed by cation exchange chromatography in a Sep-Pak Accell Plus CM cartridge (Waters), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in a 4.6-mm Protein C4 column (Vydac Grace). The protein was finally loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex Peptide, GE Healthcare) using 30% acetonitrile as solvent and kept lyophilized. Protein identity and purity were confirmed by mass spectrometry and automated Edman degradation. The concentration of TCI in solution was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using a calculated absorption coefficient E0.1% = 0.97. The native inhibitor was fully active (>95%) as determined by titration with bovine carboxypeptidase A (Sigma), assuming an equimolar interaction between inhibitor and enzyme. Oxidative Folding and Reductive Unfolding Experiments—Native TCI (N) was reduced and unfolded in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 6 m guanidine thiocyanate and 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 2 h at 23 °C. To initiate oxidative folding, the protein was passed through a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25; GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and immediately diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the same buffer, both in the absence and presence of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The refolding reaction was monitored by removing aliquots of the sample at various time intervals and quenching with the same volume of 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Acid-trapped intermediates were subsequently analyzed by RP-HPLC using a linear 10–40% gradient of acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 50 min in a 4.6-mm Jupiter C4 column (Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. In the reductive unfolding experiments, native TCI (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved at 23 °C in either 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4 or 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing different concentrations (5, 20, and 100 mm) of DTT or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), respectively. To monitor the unfolding reaction, time course aliquots of the samples were trapped with 4% trifluoroacetic acid and similarly analyzed by RP-HPLC. NMR Sample Preparation—Approximately 2.5 mg of IIIa and IIIb intermediates and of fully reduced/unfolded protein (R) were obtained by reducing 15 mg of native TCI with 5 mm DTT, trapping the intermediates after 1 h of unfolding reaction with 4% trifluoroacetic acid, and isolating the species using RP-HPLC as detailed under “Oxidative Folding and Reductive Unfolding Experiments.” The NMR samples (1 mm N, IIIa, IIIb, or R) were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein powder in 300 μl of H2O:D2O (19:1, ratio by volume), and adjusting the pH to 3.5 with concentrated HCl and NaOH. The TCI samples were analyzed at acidic pH to maintain the free cysteines in a reduced form and prevent their oxidation. For the amide proton exchange experiments, the samples prepared at pH 3.5 were lyophilized and resuspended in 300 μl of 99.98% D2O. Measurements were always conducted using 5-mm susceptibility matched NMR tubes (Shigemi). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker AV 700 spectrometer. Homonuclear two-dimensional TOCSY (mixing time of 80 ms) and NOESY (mixing time of 150 ms) spectra were acquired for both, the determination of the sequence-specific polypeptide backbone chemical shift assignments and structure calculations of the native and intermediate forms of TCI. NMR data were processed with the program TOPSPIN (Bruker Biospin), and the program NMRView (33.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar) was used for interactive spectrum analysis. Chemical shifts were measured relative to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt used at 50 μm as internal reference for 1H. The stability of the native and IIIa and IIIb intermediates during the time necessary to perform the NMR measurements was checked by comparing one-dimensional spectra recorded before and after the two-dimensional experiments. Within the resolution provided by these spectra, no significant changes in the frequencies of the signals were detected, suggesting that the conformation of the intermediates, and the redox state of their cysteines, had not changed over time. Furthermore, in the series of two-dimensional TOCSY spectra spanning 5 days to measure the exchange rates for each of the two intermediates, no frequency changes or appearance of new signals were observed, again indicating that the intermediates were stable over this time period. Structure Calculation—The NMR-based constraints used for the structure calculation of TCI and the two intermediates were derived from the homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY spectra. Peak picking of the spectra were carried out manually, and peak volumes were determined using the automatic integration function of NMRView (33.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). In the spectra of the IIIa and IIIb intermediates, only peaks corresponding to the folded domains were picked and used for the structure calculation. The three-dimensional structures were determined by combined automated NOESY cross-peak assignment (34.Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) and structure calculation with torsion angle dynamics (52.Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar) implemented in the program CYANA (53.Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The standard CYANA protocol of seven iterative cycles of NOE assignment and structure calculation, followed by a final structure calculation, was applied. The consistency between the automated NOE assignment and structure calculation was based on two criteria. First, that the chemical shift assignment should cover close to 90% of the protons, and second, that the backbone root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) to the mean for the structure ensemble after the first cycle of structure calculation should be smaller than 3 Å (36.Jee J. Guntert P. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments for some isopropyl methyls and methylene groups were determined by the GLOMSA method (54.Guntert P. Braun W. WuthrichJ. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) and before the final structure calculation by analyzing the structures obtained in the preceding seventh NOE assignment/structure calculation cycle. Pseudoatoms with appropriate distance corrections were used for distance restraints involving protons with no stereo-specific assignment (37.Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). A set of upper and lower distance limits was introduced for each pair of cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds (2.1/2.0 Å for Sγ(i)-Sγ(j) and 3.1/3.0 Å for Cβ(i)-Sγ(j) and Sγ(i)-Cβ(j)). The compatibility of the disulfide bond pattern identified in each protein (32.Arolas J.L. Bronsoms S. Ventura S. Aviles F.X. Calvete J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22906-22916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with the structures from the initial rounds of automated calculation was evaluated before introducing these restraints in the subsequent structure calculations. Several intercysteine NOE connectivities confirm the disulfide paring of the intermediates. IIIa: Cys3(Hβ2)-Cys31(Hβ2), Cys10(Hα,Hβ2)-Cys27(Hα,Hβ3), and Cys16(Hβ3)-Cys32(Hβ3,Hβ2). IIIb: Cys40(Hβ2)-Cys70(Hβ2,Hβ3), and Cys54(Hβ2,Hβ3)-Cys71(Hβ2,Hβ3). Only the disulfide bond between Cys47 and Cys64 in intermediate IIIb could not be confirmed by NOEs because of signal overlap. This connectivity was however consistent with the full set of measured NOEs, which produced three-dimensional structures where the two cysteine side chains were at the distance necessary for the formation of the disulfide bond (see below). Weak constraints on (Φ,Ψ) torsion angle pairs and on side chain torsion angles between tetrahedral carbon atoms were used temporarily during the NOE assignment/structure calculation cycles to favor the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and staggered rotamer conformations, respectively (35.Pantoja-Uceda D. Lopez-Mendez B. Koshiba S. Inoue M. Kigawa T. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Tanaka A. Seki M. Shinozaki K. Yokoyama S. Guntert P. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In each cycle, the structure calculation started from 100 randomized conformers and the standard CYANA-simulated annealing schedule was used with 10,000 torsion angle dynamics steps per conformer. The 20 conformers with the lowest values of the final CYANA target function were subjected to restrained energy minimization in explicit water using the AMBER 9.0 program (38.Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6412) Google Scholar). TIP3P model was used to describe a 9-Å thick cubic box of water molecules surrounding the TCI molecule under periodic boundary conditions. Initially, the protein was subjected to 2000 cycles of restrained energy minimization in vacuum. In a second step a standard protocol of preparation and equilibration of water was used. Finally, the whole system was minimized. The 20 minimized conformers were used to validate the final structure using the program PROCHECK-NMR (39.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar). The program MOLMOL (40.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Google Scholar) was used to visualize the structures and prepare the figures. Amide Proton Exchange—The exchange of native TCI amide protons with solvent deuterons was measured at pH 3.5 and 298 K by dissolving the lyophilized sample in 300 μl of 99.98% D2O. NMR data acquisition was started within 15 min of the initiation of the exchange reaction. A series of TOCSY spectra (80 ms mixing time, 2048 complex data points, 512 t1 increments, 8 scans per increment) were collected over the course of twelve days. The acquisition time for each experiment was 1 h and 24 min. Amide exchange experiments for the IIIa and IIIb intermediates were acquired under the same conditions over a time period of 5 days. For the reduced/unfolded form, exchange of the amide protons was complete during the acquisition of the first TOCSY spectrum. All the spectra were processed with NMRPipe (41.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11446) Google Scholar) using the same processing scheme and parameters. The amide proton exchange rate constants were obtained from the intensity of the HNi-Hαi cross-peaks corresponding to each residue in the TOCSY spectra. The decay in cross-peak intensities over time was fitted to a single exponential equation of the form: I = A × exp(-kext) + C, where I represents the intensity of the cross-peak, A is the amplitude of the exchange curve, kex is the observed exchange rate, t is the time expressed in min, and C is a constant which takes into account the residual non-deuterated water. The intensity of the cross-peaks, and the data were fitted with the rate analysis module of NMRView (42.Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). The fastest values of kex were estimated based on the duration of the first experiment, and assuming that we could not reliably measure a remaining intensity ≤ 10%. For both the native and intermediate forms of TCI we could measure kex ≥ 0,154 min-1. According to the Linderstrøm-Lang model (43.Linderstrøm-Lang K.U. Chem. Soc. Spec. Publ. 1955; 2: 1-20Google Scholar), the exchange reaction of a protected amide proton takes place when the protection is lost, and the proton is exposed to the solvent as a result of a structural fluctuation. There are two limiting mechanisms for the exchange (44.Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar): EX1, when each opening event leads to exchange, and EX2, when exchange itself is the rate-limiting step of the exchange process. The exchange mechanism of native TCI at pH 5.5 is of the EX2 type (31.Pantoja-Uceda D. Arolas J.L. García P. López-Hernández E. Padró D. Aviles F.X. Blanco F.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7066-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), therefore we may assume that the same occurs at pH 3.5. Under an EX2 exchange mechanism, the apparent free energies of exchange can be calculated from the equation ΔGex = -RTln(kex/kint), where R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. The intrinsic exchange constant, kint, was calculated for every amino acid of the TCI sequence using the SPHERE web tool. Oxidative Folding and Reductive Unfolding of TCI—The oxidative folding of fully reduced and unfolded TCI (R) was carried out in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.4 in the absence and presence of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The folding reaction was monitored by acid-trapping of the occurring intermediates and further RP-HPLC analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A high number of intermediates populate the initial stages of the oxidative process (up to 5 h), with similar RP-HPLC chromatograms regardless of the presence or absence of reducing agent (Fig. 1A). The addition of 2-mercaptoethanol only influences the final steps of the folding process by promoting disulfide rearrangement of scrambled isomers into the native form (N). This effect increases enormously the efficiency of the reaction with more than 80% of protein recovered as native TCI after 72 h, compared with ∼20% obtained in the absence of reducing agent. As previously shown (32.Arolas J.L. Bronsoms S. Ventura S. Aviles F.X. Calvete J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22906-22916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), TCI refolds through the sequential formation of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-disulfide intermediates that finally render two products: the Xa scrambled isomer and the native form. This sequential oxidation of disulfide bonds is thought to take place autonomously for each domain, leading to the predominant accumulation of two major intermediates (IIIa and IIIb), which contain three native disulfide bonds in one domain and six free cysteines in the other one (32.Arolas J.L. Bronsoms S. Ventura S. Av"
