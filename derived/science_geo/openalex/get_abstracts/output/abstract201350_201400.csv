https://openalex.org/W1996175153,THE biological significance of lysozyme is not yet fully established. Its properties suggest that it has a role in immunism against bacterial infections. Lysozyme also seems to show antiviral activity. Previous observations support this possibility.

https://openalex.org/W1979115927,"RECENTLY, Fletcher, Alcorn and Raymond1 presented evidence that gibberellins had no effect on the nodulation of white clover (Trifolium repens) grown either in aseptic agar or in soil. In concentrations from 1 to 1,000 p.p.m., gibberellic acid was also without effect on the growth of the nodule-forming organism Rhizobium trifolii. These combined results seemed to contradict a previous report of Thurber, Douglas and Galston2, who had found a marked depressive effect of potassium gibberellate on nodulation in dwarf beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)."

https://openalex.org/W1963799851,"IN the course of a survey of the parasite fauna of gadoid fishes in the northern North Sea, I have examined 28 cod (Gadus callarias L.) from various localities along the east coast of Scotland in the second half of 1958. The fish were all less than one year old and ranged in size from 12.4 to 18.6 cm. Three of these fish were infested by a species of Gyrodactylus (Trematoda: Monogenea), not hitherto recorded from British waters. The parasites were attached to the gills (rakers, bars and filaments) and within the buccal cavity of their hosts. One cod was found to harbour five specimens of Gyrodactylus in its nostrils—a somewhat unusual habitat for this trematode genus. The numbers of parasites varied from host to host, the lowest being 6 and the highest 197 specimens. All three infested fish were caught relatively near the shore: one was taken in the Firth of Forth, 5 miles east of May Island, and two about 15 miles south-east of Stonehaven, at a depth between 55 and 68 m."

1 reported the survival for 150 days of CBA mice subjected to a dose of 950 r. X-radiation and treated with spleen or liver suspensions from new-born or unborn C57BL mice. In an attempt to clarify the secondary phase of the irradiation death syndrome, Uphoff2 observed the 90-day survival of (C57BL × DBA/2)F
1 hybrids subjected to 800 r. X-radiation following injections of suspensions made from C57BL or DBA/2 tissues. She reported that the use of fœtal haematopoietic tissues precluded the secondary phase of the irradiation syndrome for 90 days after irradiation, whereas injection of bone marrow suspensions did not."

https://openalex.org/W2026078700,"PREVIOUS experiments have shown that when clotting begins in human plasma containing platelets (‘platelet-rich plasma’), adenosine triphosphate rapidly disappears from platelets with little or none of it appearing in the serum1. Other experiments suggested that in such plasma a phospholipoprotein is formed which is later broken down, and that this may be plasma thromboplastin2."

https://openalex.org/W2043824810,"THE diffraction of X-rays in the case of teeth can be investigated by a modification of the standard X-ray powder method, by producing biophysical specimens in the form of wires of tooth material by the careful cutting and filing of suitable pieces of tooth material. A 9 cm. camera of the Van Arkel type with filtered copper radiation has been used in comparing the diffraction lines from two specimens of teeth (one from a male and one from a female) which had been extracted following decay."

https://openalex.org/W2088602254,"RECENTLY, we described a multiple fibroma of the skin in the newt Triturus taeniatus which was characterized by an enlargement of the adepidermal reticular network1–4 and appeared to be transplantable in the same animal3,4. The preliminary transplantation experiments were continued to establish the effect of a colchicine treatment. The material for these experiments was obtained by breeding the normal animals of the first litter in which the tumour was observed3,4. Fragments of tumour tissue from the surroundings of small tumours, in which an enlargement of the nodular swellings of the adepidermal reticular network could already be expected, were transplanted to a perfectly tumour-free area of the same animal, preferably in the tail base region. In 105 of the 128 cases a distinct tumour developed after about 3 weeks at the location of the transplantation, whereas in the 23 negative cases the transplanted material had been almost completely resorbed. After 3 weeks in 83 of the 105 tumour cases treatment with colchicine was applied, the remaining 22 animals being used as controls. This colchicine treatment consisted in giving once a week an intraperitoneal injection of colchicine–saline solution (0.0017 mgm. colchicine). The method of preparing the solution for injection was as usual5–7. The experiment lasted 70 days."
