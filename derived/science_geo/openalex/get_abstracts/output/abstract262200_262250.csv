https://openalex.org/W1991320836,"MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression with critical functions in health and disease. Psoriasis is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease in adults, with a substantial negative impact on the patients' quality of life. Here we show for the first time that psoriasis-affected skin has a specific microRNA expression profile when compared with healthy human skin or with another chronic inflammatory skin disease, atopic eczema. Among the psoriasis-specific microRNAs, we identified leukocyte-derived microRNAs and one keratinocyte-derived microRNA, miR-203. In a panel of 21 different human organs and tissues, miR-203 showed a highly skin-specific expression profile. Among the cellular constituents of the skin, it was exclusively expressed by keratinocytes. The up-regulation of miR-203 in psoriatic plaques was concurrent with the down-regulation of an evolutionary conserved target of miR-203, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), which is involved in inflammatory responses and keratinocyte functions. Our results suggest that microRNA deregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and contributes to the dysfunction of the cross talk between resident and infiltrating cells. Taken together, a new layer of regulatory mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases."

We demonstrated that Klotho and βKlotho, homologous single-pass transmembrane proteins that bind to FGFRs, are required for metabolic activity of FGF23 and FGF21, respectively. Here we show that, like FGF21, FGF19 also requires βKlotho. Both FGF19 and FGF21 can signal through FGFR1–3 bound by βKlotho and increase glucose uptake in adipocytes expressing FGFR1. Additionally, both FGF19 and FGF21 bind to the βKlotho-FGFR4 complex; however, only FGF19 signals efficiently through FGFR4. Accordingly, FGF19, but not FGF21, activates FGF signaling in hepatocytes that primarily express FGFR4 and reduces transcription of CYP7A1 that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis. We conclude that the expression of βKlotho, in combination with particular FGFR isoforms, determines the tissue-specific metabolic activities of FGF19 and FGF21.

FGF15/19 expression is induced upon feeding in intestinal epithelial cells in response to bile acid released into the intestinal lumen. FGF15/19 then acts on hepatocytes to reduce bile acid synthesis through suppressing transcription of CYP7A1, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis (2Inagaki T. Choi M.

Thus, FGF15/19 functions as an essential component in a postprandial negative feedback loop for bile acid synthesis and release (2Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G.

Conversely, FGF21 expression is induced upon fasting in the liver (4Inagaki T. Dutchak P. Zhao G. Ding X. Gautron L. Parameswara V. Li Y. Goetz R. Mohammadi M. Esser V. Elmquist J.K. Gerard R.D.

FGF21 secreted from the liver then acts on adipose tissues to induce metabolic adaptation to fasting. Specifically, FGF21 stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes to release fatty acids, which in turn converted to ketones in the liver. FGF21 was originally identified as a hormone that stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes (6Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L. Koester A. Ford A.M. Micanovic R. Galbreath E.J. Sandusky G.E. Hammond L.J.

The FGF23 gene was identified as the gene mutated in patients with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (7White K.E. Evans W.E. O'Rlordan J.L.H. Speer M.C. Econs M.J. Lorenz-Deplereux B. Grabowski M. Meitinger T. Storm T.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets patients carry a missense mutation in the FGF23 gene that confers resistance to proteolytic inactivation of FGF23 protein, resulting in increased blood FGF23 levels. Because of its inhibitory activity on phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D biosynthesis in the kidney, high FGF23 blood levels in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets patients result in phosphate wasting and defects in bone mineralization (8Quarles L.D.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The weak heparin binding affinity of the FGF19 family members enables them to avoid being captured in extracellular matrices and thus to function as endocrine factors. On the other hand, this weak heparin binding activity reduces the capacity of heparin/heparan sulfate to promotes direct interaction between FGFs and FGFRs (14Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Indeed, attempts to demonstrate a direct interaction between FGFRs and the FGF19 family proteins in vitro have failed. These observations imply that FGF19 subfamily members require additional cofactors, besides heparin/heparan sulfates, to stably bind to their cognate FGFRs in their target tissues. We and others identified the Klotho protein as a cofactor necessary for FGF23 binding to FGFRs and for efficient activation of FGF signaling (15Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A.

The klotho gene was originally identified in mice as an aging-suppressor gene that extends life span when overexpressed and accelerates the development of aging-like phenotypes when disrupted (17Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y.

Shimomura I. Takayama Y. Herz J. Kahn C.R. Rosenblatt K.P. Kuro-o M. Science. 2005; 309: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). The klotho gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein and is expressed in limited tissues, most notably in the distal convoluted tubules in the kidney (17Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y. Nature. 1997; 390: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar). The Klotho protein physically interacts with FGFR1c, 3c, and 4 as well as with FGF23 itself (14Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) to stabilize FGF23-FGFR interactions. Forced expression of Klotho conferred responsiveness to FGF23 upon various cell types (15Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Baum M.G. Schiavi S. Hu M.C. Moe O.W. Kuro-o M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6120-6123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The fact that Klotho is essential for efficient activation of FGF signaling by FGF23 may explain why Klotho-deficient mice and FGF23-deficient mice show many overlapping phenotypes, including hyperphosphatemia, hypervitaminosis D, and multiple aging-like symptoms (19Shimada T. Kakitani M. Yamazaki Y. Hasegawa H. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Tomizuka K. Yamashita T. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 20Razzaque M.S. Sitara D. Taguchi T. St-Arnaud R. Lanske B. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 720-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that βKlotho, a Klotho family member protein, functions as a cofactor necessary for FGF21 binding to FGFRs and effective activation of FGF signaling (21Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). βKlotho shares 41% amino acid identity with Klotho and is expressed in adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas (22Ito S. Kinoshita S. Shiraishi N. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Fujimori T. Nabeshima Y. Mech. Dev. 2000; 98: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). βKlotho also physically interacts with multiple FGFRs and significantly increases the affinity of FGF21 for the FGFRs in a manner similar to FGF23, Klotho, and FGFRs (21Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in βKlotho expression have overlapping phenotypes with mice deficient in FGF15 or FGFR4 expression, including increased bile acid synthesis and increased hepatic expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, which encode two key enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis (2Inagaki T.

Thus, the genetic evidence strongly suggests that FGF15/19, FGFR4, and βKlotho are essential components in the negative regulation of bile acid synthesis. In this report, we provide molecular and cellular evidence indicating that FGF19, like its subfamily member FGF21, requires βKlotho to stably bind to FGFRs and effectively activate FGF signaling. The salient difference between FGF19 and FGF21 activities lies in their distinct receptor binding specificity and the tissue-specific distribution of their cognate receptors. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which the FGF19 subfamily of ligands exert distinct metabolic activities in different target organs. Expression Vectors—Expression vectors for βKlotho and FGFRs designed with a V5 epitope tag at their C terminus were generated by polymerase chain reaction of cDNAs as described previously (15Kurosu H.

Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), rat hepatoma cells (H4IIE), and rat myoblastic cells (L6) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfection of expression vectors was performed 36 h prior to the experiments using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) for HEK293 cells and L6 cells, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols. Preparation of FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23—Human recombinant FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 (R179Q) were expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded in vitro, and purified by affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatographies as previously described (25Plotnikov A.N.

HEK293 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid using the FuGENE transfection reagent and selected in medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich). Clones of stable transformants were isolated and plated on 96-well plates, stimulated with FGF2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 24 h, and lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Fluorescence of the cell lysates was measured using a microplate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtechnologies, Inc., Durham, NC) in the fluorescence mode (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm). Background signal was determined as fluorescence from the well without cells and subtracted to obtain net fluorescence generated from cells. A clone (E2-7) that showed robust response to FGF2 was cotransfected with human βKlotho and puromycin-resistant vectors and selected in the medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 0.6 μg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Clones of the double-transfectants were isolated and stimulated with FGF21 and subjected to the enhanced green fluorescent protein assay as described. A clone (Eβ2) that showed robust response to FGF21 was used for testing FGF19 activity. Immunoblot Analysis of FGF Signaling—Cells cultured on multi-well plates were serum-starved overnight and then treated for 10 min with human recombinant FGF19, FGF21, FGF23 (R179Q), or FGF2. The cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lysed in a buffer containing inhibitors for phosphatases and proteases, and processed for immunoblot analysis using antibodies against phospho-FRS2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), phospho-44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) (Cell Signaling), and ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) as previously described (15Kurosu H.

The signal intensity was quantified using an image analysis software (ImageQuant, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Male 129sv mice at 8 weeks of age were administered either FGF19 (1 μgg–1 body weight), FGF21 (0.3 μgg–1 body weight), or vehicle (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) by injection into the inferior vena cava. Liver, perigonadal fat pads, kidneys, and hind limb muscles were excised 15, 17, 19, and 21 min, respectively, after the injection. The tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in the lysis buffer, and subjected to immunoblotting. All of the animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. FGF19 Pull-down—Cell lysates were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with FGFR alone or cotransfected with FGFR and βKlotho and incubated with anti-V5-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated with FGF19 (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 3 h. There-after, the beads were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (15Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Baum M.G. Schiavi S. Hu M.C. Moe O.W. Kuro-o M. J.

Bead-bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against V5 tag (Invitrogen), βKlotho (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or FGF19 (R & D Systems). Knock-down of βKlotho Expression by RNA Interference— 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with siRNA duplexes by electroporation as previously described and then used for immunoblot analysis and for glucose uptake assay (21Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were transfected by electroporation as well. Briefly, the cells were harvested using trypsin, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) (1 × 107 cells/ml), mixed with 10 nmol/107 cells of siRNA oligonucleotides (see supplemental Table S1), and electroporated with a gene pulser system (0.24 kV and 960 microfarads capacitance) (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min before reseeding onto 6-well plates. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved overnight and used for immunoblot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. Glucose Uptake Assay—3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with siRNA were stimulated with FGF19 (1 μg/ml), FGF21 (1 μg/ml), or FGF2 (0.1 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% free fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 18 h at 37 °C and subjected to the glucose uptake assay as described previously (21Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For quantification of CYP7A1 and SHP mRNA, H4IIE cells transfected with siRNA were stimulated with FGF19, FGF21, or vehicle for 18 h before RNA isolation. 4 μg of total RNA was treated with 0.2 unit of DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) and then reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using the ThemoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specific primers used to quantify gene expression were listed in supplemental Table S2. Quantitative RT-PCR reactions contained 25 ng of cDNA, 150 nm of each primer, and 5 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a total volume of 10 μl. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT sequence detection system, and relative mRNA levels were calculated by the comparative threshold cycle method using cyclophilin as the internal control. Immunoprecipitation—Liver (200 mg) and white adipose tissue (1000 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. The homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C after the addition of Triton X-100 (final, 1.2% w/v) and then centrifuged twice for 12 min at 18,000 × g to remove debris. The supernatant of liver and white adipose tissue were precleared with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with 20 μg of normal goat or rabbit IgG for 3 h at 4 °C, respectively. The precleared lysates of liver and white adipose tissues, respectively, were incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose conjugated with 20 μgof anti-FGFR4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or normal goat IgG and with anti-FGFR1 antibody (Santa Cruz) or normal rabbit IgG for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and three times with TBS. Bead-bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-βKlotho, anti-FGFR1 (R & D Systems), and anti-FGFR4 (R & D Systems) antibodies. FGF19 Requires βKlotho to Activate FGF Signaling—Like FGF21 and FGF23, FGF19 failed to robustly activate FGF signaling in HEK293 cells as measured by induction of FRS2α and ERK phosphorylation. Forced expression of Klotho in HEK293 cells caused a selective response to FGF23 but not to FGF19 or FGF21. Conversely, forced expression of βKlotho conferred responsiveness to both FGF21 and FGF19 but not FGF23 (Fig. 1A). Because activation of FGF signaling with FGF23 increases promoter activity and expression of the Egr-1 (early growth response-1) gene in Klotho-expressing cells (16Urakawa I. Yamazaki Y. Shimada T. Iijima K. Hasegawa H. Okawa K. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Nature. 2006; 444: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar), we tested whether FGF19 and FGF21 also increase Egr-1 promoter activity in βKlotho-expressing cells. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1A, FGF19 and FGF21 activated the Egr-1 promoter only in βKlotho-expressing HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas FGF2 activated it independently of βKlotho expression (Fig. 1B). These observations indicate that FGF19 requires βKlotho to activate FGF signaling. We have shown that βKlotho and Klotho enhance binding affinity of FGF21 and FGF23, respectively, to their cognate FGFRs (15Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Baum M.G.

We therefore tested whether βKlotho also enhances binding of FGF19 to its cognate FGFRs. As previously reported, βKlotho binds to FGFR1c and FGFR4 more avidly than does to FGFR2c and FGFR3c (Fig. 1C) and does not interact with “b” isoforms of FGFRs (21Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In the absence of βKlotho, FGF19 did not bind to FGFR1c and FGFR4 and bound poorly to FGFR2c and 3c. In the presence of βKlotho, binding of FGF21 to FGFR1c and FGFR4 was significantly increased, whereas binding to FGFR2c and FGFR3 was only slightly increased (Fig. 1C). These observations are reminiscent of our previous findings for FGF21 (21Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and indicate that FGF19 also requires βKlotho for binding to FGFR1c and FGFR4 and for robust activation of FGF signaling. Adipocytes Respond to Both FGF19 and FGF21—Because differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes express βKlotho endogenously and respond to FGF21 (21Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), we tested whether FGF19 also activates FGF signaling in these cells. Dose-responsiveness of FRS2α and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by FGF19 was comparable with that induced by FGF21 (Fig. 2A). We observed significant attenuation of FGF19- and FGF21-induced FRS2α and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by knocking down βKlotho expression using two independent siRNAs (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that endogenous βKlotho is required for both FGF19 and FGF21 to activate FGF signaling in adipocytes. Quantification of mRNA levels of mouse FGFR1–4 revealed that 3T3-L1 adipocytes predominantly express FGFR1 (Fig. 2D). These observations indicate that activation of FGF signaling by FGF19 and FGF21 in these cells is mediated through the βKlotho-FGFR1 complex. Because FGF21 increases glucose uptake in adipocytes independently of insulin (6Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L. Koester A. Ford A.M. Micanovic R. Galbreath E.J. Sandusky G.E. Hammond L.J. Moyers J.S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), we next tested whether FGF19 exerts similar activity upon adipocytes. Indeed, FGF19 significantly increased glucose uptake within 18 h, which was comparable with that induced by FGF21 (Fig. 2E). These activities of FGF19 and FGF21 are also dependent on βKlotho because they were abolished by knocking down βKlotho expression using two independent siRNAs (Fig. 2E). Hepatocytes Respond to FGF19 but Not FGF21—Because the rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE also expresses βKlotho endogenously, we tested whether FGF19 and FGF21 activate FGF signaling in these cells. The dose-response characteristics of FGF19-induced phosphorylation for FRS2α and ERK1/2 in H4IIE cells were similar to that observed in adipocytes (Fig. 3A). In addition, we noted significant attenuation of FGF19-induced FRS2α and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by knocking down βKlotho expression using two independent siRNAs (Fig. 3, B and C), confirming that endogenous βKlotho is required for FGF19 to activate FGF signaling in hepatocytes as well as in adipocytes. However, in contrast to adipocytes, H4IIE hepatocytes are ∼100-fold less sensitive to FGF21 in terms of induction of FRS2α and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Quantification of mRNA levels of rat FGFR1–4 demonstrated that H4IIE hepatocytes predominantly express FGFR4 (Fig. 3D), indicating that FGF19 can activate FGF signaling through"

Loss of estrogens or androgens accelerates the effects of aging on bone by decreasing defense against oxidative stress. Age-related loss of bone mass and strength is an invariable feature of human biology, affecting women and men alike. Moreover, population-based studies demonstrate that substantial bone loss begins as early as the 20s in young adult women and men, long before any hormonal changes (1Looker A.C. Wahner H.W. Dunn W.L.

Atkinson, and S. Khosla personal communication. The extent to which estrogen deficiency contributes to age-related bone loss and the slower rate of decline of bone mass and strength during the late postmenopausal years, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms of such putative interactions, are unknown. The universality of age-associated bone loss irrespective of sex steroid status notwithstanding, age is by far a more critical determinant of fracture risk than bone mass in humans indicating that age-related increase in fracture risk reflects a loss of bone strength that is only partly accounted for by loss of bone mass (2Hui S.L. Slemenda C.W. Johnston Jr., C.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 1804-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Whereas an increased propensity to fall due to age-related decline in neuromuscular function is a factor, there are also age-related changes in the bone itself. Such changes include disrupted architecture, altered composition of the bone mineral and matrix, delayed repair of fatigue micro-damage, excessive turnover, and inadequate bone size (3Kleerekoper M.

Suppl. 2004; 91: S41-S49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Suppression of bone turnover results from attenuating effects of sex steroids on the birth rate of osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors. Maintenance of a focal balance between formation and resorption results from opposite effects on the lifespan of osteoblasts/osteocytes and osteoclasts: an anti-apoptotic effect on the former and a pro-apoptotic effect on the latter cell type. Conversely, loss of sex steroids increases the rate of remodeling by up-regulating osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Specifically, we have shown that estrogen loss rapidly up-regulates osteoblastogenesis in mice, and this effect is at least in part cell autonomous, and independent of the increased osteoclastic resorption, as it is manifested in ovariectomized (OVX) mice treated with bisphosphonates, known inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption (16Jilka R.L. Takahashi K. Munshi M. Williams D.C. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1942-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, the adverse effects of estrogen or androgen withdrawal on bone seem to be mediated, at least in part, by cells of the osteoblastic lineage and are obviated by constraints on osteoblastogenesis, whether genetic (17Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Takahashi K. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1732-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) or acquired (18Weinstein R.S. Jia D. Powers C.C. Stewart S.A. Jilka R.L. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1980-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), most likely because of the critical dependence of osteoclastogenesis on osteoblastogenesis (19Abe E. Yamamoto M. Taguchi Y. Lecka-Czernik B. O'Brien C.A. Economides A.N. Stahl N. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 20Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. Bellido T. O'Brien C.A. Parfitt A.M. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the effect of the loss of estrogens on the rate of remodeling and the up-regulation of osteoblastogenesis and bone formation in animals and humans wanes with time (5-10 years in women and 6-8 weeks in mice) to about the same rate as in elderly eugonadal males, raising the possibility that aging might be overriding the acute effects of estrogen deficiency. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) influence numerous cellular processes, including the timing of death by apoptosis; and have been linked to aging and the development of age-related diseases. Moreover, oxidative stress has been strongly correlated with longevity in flies, nematodes, and mammals (21Quarrie J.K. Riabowol K.T. Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2004; 2004: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7426) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor and the adapter protein p66shc represent key components of a signal transduction pathway that not only is activated by increased intracellular ROS and converts oxidative signals into apoptosis but also generates ROS in the mitochondria (23Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar, 24Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A.

Strikingly, an activating mutation of p53 causes early onset of aging-associated phenotypes in mice (26Tyner S.D. Venkatachalam S. Choi J. Jones S. Ghebranious N. Igelmann H. Lu X. Soron G. Cooper B. Brayton C. Hee P.S. Thompson T. Karsenty G. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Nature. 2002; 415: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Conversely, deletion of p66shc increases resistance to oxidative stress, as well as lifespan, by as much as 30% (23Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms used by cells to defend against oxidative damage involves the reduction of peroxides to harmless alcohols in a reaction in which glutathione peroxidase oxidizes glutathione (GSH) to the disulfide GSSH, and glutathione reductase (GSR) converts it back into GSH (27Dickinson D.A. Forman H.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 488-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The above lines of evidence have strongly suggested to us the possibility that organismal aging per se, rather than an age-associated failure of other organs and tissues, may be the predominant mechanism of the bone fragility disease, which has become synonymous with osteoporosis, just one of the many features and risk factors underlying the problem of fractures. And, that loss of estrogens or androgens may exaggerate the adverse effects of organismal aging on bone. We report several previously unappreciated age-related changes in both female and male C57BL/6 mice that may provide critical clues into the mechanisms of the age-related decline of bone strength and mass, and the influence of sex steroid deficiency in the process. Chemicals and Reagents—l-Buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), diethyl maleate (DEM), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), etoposide, flutamide, H2O2, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and E2 were purchased from Sigma. PD98059 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). ICI 182,780 was purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ellisville, MO), PP1 from Biomol International P.A. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and U0126 from Promega (Madison, WI). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α recombinant protein was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Sixty-day slow-release pellets containing DHT were purchased from Innovative Research of America (Sarasota, FL). Estradiol was assayed with a kit from DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN) and testosterone with a kit from MP Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Glutathione reductase was assayed with a kit from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Intracellular ROS were quantified using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye (28Huang X. Frenkel K. Klein C.B. Costa M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 120: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), using bone marrow cells flushed from femurs and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Animal Experimentation—Male and female C57BL/6 mice 4-31 months old were purchased from Harlan Inc. from a cohort maintained with support from the National Institute of Aging. The age-associated changes of intact animals were studied in three separate experiments: two with females (the first at 8, 16, 25, and 31 months old; and the second at 4, 8, 16, and 25 months old) and one with males (4, 8, 16, 25, and 31 months old). For the studies examining the effects of sex steroid deficiency, 5 month-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc. Two to 3 days before surgery, all animals were electronically tagged (Biomedic Data System Inc., Maywood, NJ), BMD measurements were performed on each, and they were then allocated to various experimental groups to achieve equivalent mean femur BMD values. Animals were then sham-operated, OVX, or orchidectomized (ORX). Sham-operated animals were administered vehicle or BSO (2 mmol/kg intraperitoneally) twice a day (n = 12 per group). BSO was also included in the drinking water (20 mm). OVX and ORX animals were subcutaneously injected with vehicle or with replacement doses of E2 (30 ng/g) or NAC (100 mg/kg/day) twice a day or were implanted with 60-day slow-release pellets containing DHT (10 mg) (n = 12 per group). After 6 weeks of treatment, animals were sacrificed and the tissues dissected for further analyses. BMD, bone geometry measurements, histo-morphometry, and osteoblast/osteocyte apoptosis were performed as previously described (29Kousteni S. Chen J.-R. Bellido T. Han L. Ali A.A. O'Brien C.

Biomechanical Testing—The load bearing properties of L6 were measured using a single column material testing machine and a calibrated tension/compression load cell (model 5542, Instron Corp., Canton, MA). Load cell calibration was verified in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials E74-02 standards and traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Data were recorded and analyzed using the Merlin IX software package (Instron Corp.). The L6 specimens were cleaned of surrounding soft tissue, wrapped in gauze soaked in 37 ± 0.5 °C normal saline, and tested on the day of sacrifice. The length, width, and depth of the bones were recorded with a digital caliper at a resolution of 0.01 mm (Mitutoyo number 500-196, Ace Tools, Ft. Smith, AR). The cross-sectional area was assumed to be an ellipse and calculated as A = 0.25 π (width) (depth). Articular and spinous processes that would interfere with compression were excised using an iris scissors. After pre-seating with less than 0.5 newtons (N) of applied load, vertebrae were compressed between screw-driven loading platens using a lower-platen, customized miniature spherical seat that minimizes shear by adjusting to irregularities in the end plates of the specimens. Best seating was obtained with the load applied along the caudocephalad axis at a speed of 0.5 mm/min until failure. Standard materials for compression were run before each set of determinations. Three-point bending of the femur was also performed at 37 ± 0.5 °C using a miniature bending apparatus with the posterior femoral surface lying on lower supports (7 mm apart) and the left support immediately proximal to the distal condyles. Load was applied to the anterior femoral surface by an actuator midway between the two supports moving at a constant rate of 3 mm/min to produce a physiological in vivo stain rate of 1% for the average murine femur. The external measurements (length, width, and thickness) of the femora were recorded with a digital caliper. Measurements of the internal marrow cavity (greater and lesser diameters) were obtained with a hand-held microscope at ×100 magnification using a calibrated linear reticule eyepiece (Klarmann Rulings, Manchester, NH). Maximum load (N) and displacement (mm) were recorded. The mechanical properties were normalized for bone size and ultimate strength or stress (N/mm2; in megapascals) was calculated. Standard precision steel piano wire with stiffness in the same range as murine femoral bone was evaluated before each set of determinations. Western Blot Analysis—The phosphorylation status of p53, p66shc, and ERK1/2 was analyzed by immunoblotting in fifth lumbar vertebra lysates, as previously described (32Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J.-R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were: a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing Ser15-phosphorylated p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA), a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing Ser36-phosphorylated p66shc (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein levels of p-53, p66shc, and ERK1/2 were analyzed using a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing p53 (Cell Signaling), a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing p66shc (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing total ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz). Cell Culture—OB-6 cells, an osteoblastic cell line derived in our laboratory from the murine bone marrow (33Lecka-Czernik B. Gubrij I. Moerman E.J. Kajkenova O. Lipschitz D.A. Manolagas S.C.

C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics as above, and 1% sodium pyruvate. Osteoclasts were derived from bone marrow cells cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 30 ng/ml macrophage-colony stimulations factor and 30 ng/ml soluble RANK ligand. For the quantification of osteoblast apoptosis, OB-6 cells were treated for 1 h with BSO or DEM followed by the steroids for 1 and 6 h with the pro-apoptotic agent etoposide (5 × 10-5 m), TNFα (10-9 m), or H2O2 (5 × 10-5 m). Osteoclast apoptosis was assayed in cells treated with BSO or DEM for 1 h followed by the steroids for 24 h. Apoptotic cells were quantified by measuring caspase 3 activity as described previously (32Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J.-R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For quantification of osteoclasts, after 4 days in culture, cells were treated for 1 h with BSO or DEM followed by the steroids for 24 h. Osteoclasts were enumerated after staining for TRAPase; both mononucleated and multinucleated cells were counted. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tibia or calvaria using Ultraspec RNA (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX) and reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probes for estrogen receptor (ER) α, ERβ, androgen receptor (AR), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were manufactured by the TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays service (Applied Biosystems). Transient Transfections—C2C12 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of green fluorescent protein, 0.1 μg of empty vector or wild-type p66shc plasmid, and 0.2 μg of pcDNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Statistical Analysis—Effects of age and gender on BMD and strength of the spine and the femur were evaluated by two-way ANOVA. The time of onset of the changes was determined by linear regression followed by a test for significant lack of fit or departure from linearity (34Netter J. Wasserman W. Kutner M.H. Irwin Richard D. Applied Linear Statistical Models. 3rd ed. Inc., Homewood, IL1990Google Scholar). Whenever there was significant departure from linearity for the entire data set, data from one or two earlier time points (4 month or both 4 and 8 months) were excluded from the analysis so that linearity could be established within the remaining set of data. Subsequently, the earliest time point that was used to establish linearity, i.e. 8 or 16 months, was compared with 4 or 4 and 8 months by Student's t test or ANOVA. If no different from the preceding time points, the earliest time point of the linearity plot was declared the time after which a particular change was manifested and the change was continuous from that time point on; if, on the other hand, differences were detected, we concluded that the change began at the earliest time point, but it was discontinuous. ANOVA was used to detect other age-related changes, and effects of various in vivo and in vitro treatments, after establishing that the data were normally distributed and equivalency of variances. Bonferroni's method was used to perform appropriate pairwise comparisons of treatment groups. In cases when one or both of the requirements for performing ANOVA were not met, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on Ranks test was used followed by Dunn's method to perform pairwise comparisons of treatment groups. Similar Age-associated Changes in BMD and Strength in Female and Male Mice—Both female and male C57BL/6 mice exhibited loss of bone mass, as determined by the surrogate measurement of BMD, and loss of strength in the spine and femur between ages of 4 and 31 months (Fig. 1, A and B). Strength in these experiments was assessed by obtaining load-to-failure estimates of the 6th lumbar vertebra (L6) and the left femur, using compression and 3-point bending, respectively. The decline in bone strength occurred earlier as compared with the loss of BMD, with the exception of the spine in females in which both changes began simultaneously. Furthermore, the decline of BMD and strength was progressive (i.e. the data fit linear regression) in all instances other than vertebral and femoral strength in males, which were discontinuous. The fall in spinal BMD and femoral strength occurred earlier in females than in males. Age-associated Changes in Osteoblast and Osteoclast Number, Bone Formation, and Osteoblast and Osteocyte Apoptosis—As evidenced from histomorphometric analysis (Fig. 2) of the vertebrae of the first of the two experiments with female C57BL/6 mice, advancing age from 8 to 31 months was associated with decreased cancellous bone area and trabecular width and increased trabecular separation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, advancing age was associated with decreased wall width, decreased osteoblast and osteoclast number, as well as a decrease in bone formation rate. All these changes are unmistakable indications of a low turnover state, with resorption exceeding formation; and are clearly distinct from the high turnover state caused by loss of estrogens or androgens in rodents and humans. Furthermore, advancing age was associated with an increase in osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis (Fig. 2B). The increase in osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis with age in females was confirmed in the experiment with the males between the ages of 4 and 31 months. As is the case in humans (35Ahlborg H.G.

Res. 2003; 18: 1766-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), both female and male mice exhibited an age-dependent increase in both the external and internal diameter of the femoral diaphysis, indicating ongoing periosteal apposition and endocortical resorption, respectively (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3The external and internal diameters of the femoral diaphysis increase with age in both female and male C57BL/6 mice. The geometry of the left femurs from the two experiments with females and the single experiment with males was determined after performance of the 3-point bending test at the diaphyseal breakpoint by measuring the diameters depicted in the inset. The anterior-posterior external diameter (AP) and lateral exterior diameter (L) were measured using a digital caliper; and the corresponding internal diameters, (AP′) and (L′), were measured with a hand-held microscope, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” † indicates significant difference only between 6 and 18 months by ANOVA. ‡ indicates a progressive increase after 16 months of age. * indicates progressive increase after 4 months of age without significant departure from linearity for the entire data set.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Age-related Increase of Oxidative Stress in the Bone of Females and Males—Consistent with the evidence for a critical role of oxidative damage in age-related diseases in general, and of the p53/p66shc signaling cascade in apoptosis, the changes in bone mass, strength, osteoblast/osteocyte apoptosis, osteoblast number, and bone formation rate with age in the aging murine model were associated with age-dependent decreased activity of GSR (Fig. 4A) and increased levels of ROS in the bone marrow (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the pattern of all these changes was temporally associated with a progressive increase in the phosphorylation of p53 (Fig. 4C) and p66shc (Fig. 4D) in lysates from vertebrae. In agreement with published studies by others showing no change in circulating estrogen or androgen levels with age in C57BL/6 mice (37Mobbs C.V. Cheyney D. Sinha Y.N. Finch C.E. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Nelson J.F. Latham K.R. Finch C.E. Acta Endocrinol. 1975; 80: 744-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we found no evidence of a decline in estrogen or androgen status between 4 and 31 months of age, as measured by the sensitive estrogen and androgen status indicators, uterine and seminal vesicle weight, respectively (Fig. 5, A-C). Likewise, transcript levels of the ERα or -β or the androgen receptor in bone were not altered with age (Fig. 5D). In addition, using commercially available radioimmunoassays, we attempted to measure serum levels of testosterone and 17β-estradiol. Detectable levels of testosterone were found in all males from which we have available serum and at all ages, and there was no difference among ages (4 months = 0.09 ng/ml ± 0.11, 8 months = 0.04 ng/ml ± 0.03, 16 months = 0.06 ng/ml ± 0.04, 25 months = 0.17 ng/ml ± 0.34, and 31 months"

A recent study has reported that interleukin (IL)-33 is a specific ligand of ST2L and induces production of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines. Although soluble ST2 is highly produced in sera of asthmatic patients and plays a critical role for production of Th2 cytokines, the function of soluble ST2 in relation to IL-33 signaling remains unclear.

The ST2 gene is a member of the IL-1 receptor family, producing a soluble secreted form and a transmembrane form, soluble ST2 and ST2L, respectively (1Tominaga S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Klemenz R. Hoffmann S. Werenskiold A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These proteins are generated by alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. The structure of ST2L is similar to that of IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI), consisting of three extracellular immunoglobulin domains and an intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain. Although the extracellular domain is common to soluble ST2 and ST2L, soluble ST2 lacks the transmembrane and intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domains. The ST2 gene is expressed in several cells including fibroblasts and mast cells (1Tominaga S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4Gächter T. Werenskiold A.K. Klemenz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 124-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In particular, ST2L is preferentially expressed in murine and human Th2 cells and can be utilized as a specific marker of Th2 cells in in vitro experiments (5Yanagisawa K. Naito Y. Kuroiwa K. Arai T.

Therefore, the function of ST2L has been suggested to correlate with Th2 cell-mediated immunological responses. However, ST2L has been an orphan receptor ever since it was first reported (5Yanagisawa K. Naito Y. Kuroiwa K. Arai T. Furukawa Y. Tomizuka H. Miura Y. Kasahara T. Tetsuka T. Tominaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Late in 2005, IL-33, a newly discovered member of the IL-1 cytokine family, was finally reported as a specific ligand for ST2L (9Schmitz J. Owyang A. Oldham E. Song Y. Murphy E. McClanahan T.K.

The IL-33 gene, also described as a nuclear factor expressed in high endothelial venules (NF-HEV) (10Baekkevold E.S. Roussigné M. Yamanaka T. Johansen F.E. Jahnsen F.L. Amalric F. Brandtzaeg P.

Previous study has demonstrated the processing and function of the IL-33 protein (9Schmitz J. Owyang A. Oldham E. Song Y. Murphy E. McClanahan T.K. Zurawski G. Moshrefi M. Qin J. Li X. Gorman D.M.

The precursor 31-kDa protein (pre-IL-33) was cleaved by caspase-1 into a mature 18-kDa protein (IL-33) in in vitro experiments using a recombinant protein. Functional analysis has shown that IL-33 bound to murine mast cells expressing ST2L and stimulated the intracellular signaling pathway, leading to the activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In addition, the production of Th2 cytokines and severe pathological changes in mucosal organs were induced by administration of IL-33 to mice. Previous studies before the discovery of IL-33 had already shown that ST2L is associated with the production of Th2 cytokines. Levels of Th2 cytokines were decreased in asthmatic mice by administration of the antibody that blocks ST2L and in a pulmonary granuloma model using mice lacking the ST2 gene (7Löhning M. Stroehmann A. Coyle A.J. Grogan J.L. Lin S. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Levinson D. Radbruch A. Kamradt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 2000; 191: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that IL-33 signaling via ST2L plays important roles in Th2 cell-mediated immunological responses including the production of Th2 cytokines. On the other hand, previous studies in human patients and animal models have shown that the level of soluble ST2 in sera was elevated in asthmatic disease (14Oshikawa K. Kuroiwa K. Tago K. Iwahana H.

Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 1520-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that soluble ST2 may also play a critical role in Th2 cell-mediated diseases. In fact, administration of a recombinant soluble ST2-Fc fusion protein or a soluble ST2 expression vector to asthmatic mice effectively attenuated inflammatory responses and production of Th2 cytokines (7Löhning M. Stroehmann A. Coyle A.J. Grogan J.L. Lin S. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Levinson D. Radbruch A. Kamradt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Allergy. 2002; 32: 1520-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results of therapeutic experiments indicate that soluble ST2 negatively regulates the Th2 cell-mediated immunological responses, in opposition to ST2L. However, the molecular mechanism of negative regulation by soluble ST2 remains unclear. In addition, it has not been addressed whether soluble ST2 is associated with IL-33 signaling. In this study, using a murine thymoma cell line, EL-4, stably expressing ST2L and a murine model of asthma, we demonstrated that soluble ST2 had a negative function in IL-33 signaling. Binding and functional analyses showed that soluble ST2 inhibited the binding of IL-33 to ST2L-positive cells and that the activation of NF-κB and the production of Th2 cytokines in the IL-33 signaling were suppressed in the presence of soluble ST2. Our data suggest that soluble ST2 negatively modulates the production of Th2 cytokines through IL-33 signaling in allergic airway inflammation. Animals—Male and female BALB/c mice, 7–8 weeks of age, were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). All of the mice were housed in an animal research facility of the Jichi Medical University under pathogen-free conditions. All of the experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of Jichi Medical University. Sensitization and Aeroallergen Challenge—The mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection with 100 μg of ovalbumin (OVA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 mg of aluminum potassium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) in saline or 20 mg of aluminum potassium sulfate alone in saline on days 0 and 7. On days 14 and 15, the mice were challenged twice daily at intervals of 4 h with 1% (w/v) OVA in saline or saline alone for 30 min using an ultrasonic nebulizer (Omron Corp., Tokyo, Japan) (15Oshikawa K. Yanagisawa K. Tominaga S. Sugiyama Y. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 1520-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed 3–48 h after the last aeroallergen challenge, and sera and tissues were obtained for further analyses. Briefly, blood was drawn from the caudal vena cava and left for 30 min, and then the serum was separated by centrifugation. The sera were stored at -80 °C until assay. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Electron, Melbourne, Australia). Murine thymoma EL-4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (RPMI 1640 growth medium). Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from murine tissues using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). The total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I; then first-strand cDNA was synthesized as described previously (16Hayakawa M. Yanagisawa K. Aoki S. Hayakawa H. Takezako N. Tominaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1728: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed using 0.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA), 0.5 μm each of the forward and reverse primers, and the first-strand cDNAs derived from 0.25 μg of DNase I-treated RNA. After cDNAs were treated at 94 °C for 10 min, PCR was carried out for 25 (β-actin), 28 (IL-33), or 33 (ST2 and ST2L) cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by treatment at 72 °C for 10 min. The nucleotide sequences of primers used were as follows: ST2, forward 5′-TGGCATGATAAGGCACACCATAAGGCT-3′ and reverse 5′-GTTAGTGTCTCTCTCCCTCCCATGC-3′; ST2L, forward 5′-TGCGTACATCATTTACCCTCGGGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTTGTGCCACAAGAGTGAAGTAGG-3′; IL-33, forward 5′-ATGAGACCTAGAATGAAGTATTCCA-3′ and reverse 5′-TTAGATTTTCGAGAGCTTAAACATA-3′; and β-actin, forward 5′-ATCTACGAGGGCTATGCTCT-3′ and reverse 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCA-3′. Seven microliters of PCR products were developed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, and then the gels were stained with ethidium bromide. The intensity of DNA bands was quantified using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health). The size of PCR products was as follows: ST2 (754 bp), ST2L (739 bp), IL-33 (801 bp), and β-actin (576 bp). Construction of Plasmids—Constructions of pET-21-mIL-33 and pET-21-mIL-1β proceeded as follows. The coding regions of mature IL-33 and IL-1β proteins were obtained from cDNA derived from spleens of BALB/c mice by PCR amplification. The nucleotide sequences of primers containing an EcoRI or an XhoI site were as follows: IL-33, forward 5′-GAATTCACATTGAGCATCCAAGGAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCGAGGATTTTCGAGAGCTTAAACA-3′; IL-1β, forward 5′-GAATTCGTTCCCATTAGACAGCTGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCGAGGGAAGACACAGATTCCATGG-3′. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then ligated into an EcoRI/XhoI-digested pET-21a (+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Expression vectors of murine soluble ST2 were constructed using pEF6-V5-His (Invitrogen) and pEF6-FLAG-His. Construction of pEF6-FLAG-His proceeded as follows. A fragment containing FLAG and His tags (FLAG-His) was created by annealing a sense oligonucleotide (5′-GCGGCCGCTGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGCGTACCGGTC-3′) and an antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GTTTAAACTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGACCGGTACGCTTGT-3′), and the annealed fragment was elongated and subcloned into a pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen). A NotI/PmeI-digested FLAG-His fragment was ligated into a NotI/PmeI-digested pEF6-V5-His. Murine ST2 (mST2) cDNA was amplified from pEF-BOS-mST2 (17Takagi T. Yanagisawa K. Tsukamoto T. Tetsuka T. Nagata S. Tominaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) by PCR using a forward primer containing a KpnI site (5′-GGTACCATGATTGACAGACAGAGAAT-3′) and a reverse primer containing a NotI site (5′-GCGGCCGCAGCAATGTGTGAGGGACACT-3′). A KpnI/NotI-digested PCR product was ligated into a KpnI/NotI-digested pEF6-V5-His and pEF6-FLAG-His to obtain final products pEF6-mST2-V5-His and pEF6-mST2-FLAG-His, respectively. Constructions of pEF6-mST2L-FLAG and pEF6-mIL-1RI-FLAG proceeded as follows. Murine ST2L (mST2L) cDNA was amplified from pEF-BOS-mST2L (5Yanagisawa K. Naito Y. Kuroiwa K. Arai T. Furukawa Y. Tomizuka H. Miura Y. Kasahara T. Tetsuka T. Tominaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by PCR using a forward primer containing a BamHI site (5′-GGATCCATGATTGACAGACAGAGA-3′) and a reverse primer containing a NdeI site (5′-CATATGAAAGTGTTTCAGGTCTAA-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into a pCR2.1 TOPO (pCR2.1-mST2L). A FLAG fragment containing a stop codon was created by annealing FLAG-s (5′-TATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGTAGA-3′) and FLAG-as (5′-CTAGTCTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCA-3′), and the annealed fragment was ligated into a NdeI/SpeI-digested pCR2.1-mST2L. Finally, the mST2L-FLAG fragment was digested with BamHI and SpeI and ligated into a BamHI/SpeI-digested pEF6/V5-His. Murine IL-1RI (mIL-1RI) cDNA was obtained from cDNA derived from EL-4 cells by PCR amplification using primers containing a KpnI or a NdeI site (forward 5′-GGTACCATGGAGAATATGAAAGTGCTA-3′ and reverse 5′-CATATGGCCGAGTGGTAAGTGTGTTGC-3′). Murine ST2L cDNA in pEF6-mST2L-FLAG was replaced with mIL-1RI cDNA, using KpnI and NdeI digestion. All of the constructs were confirmed to be correct by DNA sequencing analysis. Purification of Recombinant IL-33 and IL-1β Proteins—Recombinant murine IL-33 and IL-1β proteins containing a T7 tag at the N terminus and a His tag at the C terminus (rIL-33 and rIL-1β) were produced in bacteria. BL-21 Codon-Plus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was transformed with pET-21-mIL-33 or pET-21-mIL-1β. The bacteria were cultured at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6; then expression of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Three hours after culture at 25 °C, the bacteria were harvested, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After sonication, the soluble cytoplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation. The fraction was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column. The proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). After dialysis against T7 tag binding buffer (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.3), the proteins were purified using a T7 tag affinity purification kit (Novagen). The proteins were eluted from the column with 0.1 m citric acid (pH 2.2) and neutralized with 2 m Tris base (pH 10.4). After desalting and concentrating the protein using Centricon YM-3 (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS (8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad) with calibration using bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein purity was evaluated using a silver staining kit (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). Purification of Recombinant Soluble ST2 Proteins—Recombinant soluble ST2 proteins containing V5-His or FLAG-His tags at the C terminus (ST2-V5 and ST2-FLAG) were purified as described previously (18Takezako N. Hayakawa M. Hayakawa H. Aoki S. Yanagisawa K. Endo H. Tominaga S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pEF6-mST2-V5-His or pEF6-mST2-FLAG-His using the calcium-phosphate method. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h. The secreted recombinant proteins in the culture supernatant were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The proteins were eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Desalting and concentrating the proteins were performed using Centricon YM-30 (Millipore). Finally, the purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS. The method for measuring the protein concentration is described under “Measurement of Soluble ST2 and Cytokines. ” Deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) was performed as described previously (17Takagi T. Yanagisawa K. Tsukamoto T. Tetsuka T. Nagata S. Tominaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein purity was evaluated using a silver staining kit. Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—Empty vector (pEF6-V5-His) and expression vectors (pEF6-mST2L-FLAG and pEF6-mIL-1RI-FLAG) were linearized with FspI. EL-4 cells (1 × 107 cells) were mixed with 50 μg of linearized plasmid DNA in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and the mixtures were left for 10 min on ice. Electroporation was carried out using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 270 V and 960 microfarads, and then the cells were left on ice for 10 min. The transfected cells were returned to the RPMI 1640 growth medium and were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the transfected cells were selected with blasticidin (Invitrogen). Stable clones were cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium containing 6 μg/ml blasticidin. Flow Cytometry—Splenocytes (1 × 106 cells) and stably transfected EL-4 cells (5 × 105 cells) were used for flow cytometric analysis. Preparation of splenocytes proceeded as follows. The spleen was homogenized into a single-cell suspension in PBS by filtration through nylon mesh (70 μm). After depletion of erythrocytes by osmotic lysis, the splenocytes were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody (BD Biosciences PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was mixed with the splenocytes to block the Fc receptor for 5 min on ice. Binding analysis of IL-33 and IL-1β on the cell surface was performed as follows. The cells were mixed with 100 or 500 ng of rIL-33 or rIL-1β for 1 h on ice, followed by staining with biotinylated anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen) for 1 h on ice. Then the cells were stained with R-phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated streptavidin (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min on ice. In case of binding analysis in the presence of soluble ST2, 1 μg of ST2-V5 was added to the cells at 1 h before, at 1 h after, or at the same time as the addition of rIL-33 or rIL-1β. Binding of ST2-V5 was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h on ice. ST2L or IL-1RI was stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse T1/ST2 antibody (MD Biosciences, Zürich, Switzerland), RPE-conjugated anti-mouse IL-1RI antibody (BD Biosciences PharMingen), or each isotype control antibody for 1 h on ice. After the stained cells were washed twice with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum, the cells were resuspended in PBS and filtered through nylon mesh (35 μm). Analysis was performed on Becton Dickinson LSR using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Five hundred ng of ST2-V5 was mixed with 2 μg of rIL-33 or rIL-1β in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS), and the mixture was agitated overnight at 4 °C. The protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with 40 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry of anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose (Novagen). After the protein-bound agarose was washed three times with RIPA buffer, binding protein complexes were eluted with 0.1 m citric acid (pH 2.2) and neutralized with the addition of 2 m Tris (pH 10.4). The eluted proteins were subjected to Western blotting. Western Blotting—The protein samples were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-T7 tag (Novagen), rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-33 (Adipogen Inc., Seoul, South Korea), goat polyclonal anti-IL-1β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (Invitrogen), mouse monoclonal anti-His (C Term) (Invitrogen), rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα (Santa Cruz), or mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz) antibody as the primary antibody. The proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Bio-Rad), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-goat Ig (Vector, CA), or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized using Immobilon Western detection reagents (Millipore), and the membranes were exposed to x-ray films (RX-U; Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts—Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from stably transfected EL-4 cells was performed as described previously (16Hayakawa M. Yanagisawa K. Aoki S. Hayakawa H. Takezako N. Tominaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1728: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested and rinsed with PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of a buffer solution (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), cytoplasmic extracts were separated by centrifugation. The nuclei were resupended in 2.5 volumes of a buffer solution (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and mixed by agitation. The debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were dialyzed against a buffer solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the supernatants were harvested as nuclear extracts. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were stored at -80 °C until assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously, with some modifications (16Hayakawa M. Yanagisawa K. Aoki S. Hayakawa H. Takezako N. Tominaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1728: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Tago K. Funakoshi M. Mano H. Yanagisawa K. Hayakawa M. Kuroiwa K. Iwahana H. Kasahara T. Tominaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 15 μl containing nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) and 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Supershift assay was carried out using antibodies against p50, p52, p65, and c-Rel (Santa Cruz). The protein-DNA complexes were separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 100 V in 0.5 × TGE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The dried gels were exposed to Imaging plates (Fuji Photo Film Co.) and analyzed using Typhoon 9410 (Amersham Biosciences). The oligonucleotide probe containing an NF-κB binding site was created by annealing NF-κB-s (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and NF-κB-as (5′-AGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAAC-3′). Luciferase Assay—The luciferase assay was performed as described previously (16Hayakawa M. Yanagisawa K. Aoki S. Hayakawa H. Takezako N. Tominaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1728: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). EL-4 cells stably expressing ST2L or IL-1RI (1 × 107 cells) were transfected with plasmid DNAs (40 μg of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, pNF-κB-Luc, containing an NF-κB binding site in the promoter, and 4 μg of the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI)) by electroporation. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed and cultured in serum-free medium for 15 h. The transfected cells were treated with 500 ng/ml of ST2-V5 for 3 h, followed by stimulation with 10 ng/ml rIL-33 or rIL-1β for 24 h. Then the cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase assay using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer (Lumat LB9507; Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized against the respective Renilla luciferase activity. Stimulation of Splenocytes—Splenocytes were prepared as described under “Flow Cytometry” and resuspended in RPMI 1640 growth medium. Splenocytes (4 × 107 cells/well) were stimulated with 200 μg/ml OVA for 48 h in 6-well plate. The OVA-stimulated cells were washed with PBS and resuspended with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at 2.5 × 106 cells/well in 48-well plate. After incubation for 15 h, ST2-FLAG was added to a final concentration of 500 ng/ml for 3 h. Then the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml rIL-33 or rIL-1β for 48 h. The culture supernatant was harvested and stored at -80 °C until assay. Measurement of Soluble ST2 and Cytokines—The concentrations of soluble ST2 in sera and purified recombinant proteins were measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously (15Oshikawa K. Yanagisawa K. Tominaga S. Sugiyama Y. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 1520-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IFN-γ in culture supernatants were measured using ELISA kits (BIOSOURCE International Inc., Camarillo, CA). Statistical Analysis—The data are represented as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by the Turkey-Kramer test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Specific Binding of IL-33 to ST2L-positive Cells—To study the binding and function of IL-33, we developed systems for the expression and purification of mature IL-33 as a recombinant protein (designated as rIL-33) (Fig. 1A). In this study, recombinant mature IL-1β (designated as rIL-1β) was also used for control experiments, because IL-1β has binding activity for IL-1RI, but not for ST2L."

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which oxidative stress exerts such adverse effects, we have tested the hypothesis that induction of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors by reactive oxygen species may antagonize Wnt signaling, an essential stimulus for osteoblastogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, we report herein that the expression of FoxO target genes increases, whereas the expression of Wnt target genes decreases, with increasing age in C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, we show that in osteoblastic cell models, oxidative stress (exemplified by H2O2) promotes the association of FoxOs with β-catenin, β-catenin is required for the stimulation of FoxO target genes by H2O2, and H2O2 promotes FoxO-mediated transcription at the expense of Wnt-/T-cell factor-mediated transcription and osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, β-catenin overexpression is sufficient to prevent FoxO-mediated suppression of T-cell factor transcription. These results demonstrate that diversion of the limited pool of β-catenin from T-cell factor- to FoxO-mediated transcription in osteoblastic cells may account, at least in part, for the attenuation of osteoblastogenesis and bone formation by the age-dependent increase in oxidative stress.

Recent studies from our group and others provide compelling evidence that the age-associated increase in oxidative stress is a pivotal pathogenetic mechanism for skeletal involution. Indeed, in the accompanying manuscript by Almeida et al. (52Almeida M. Han L. Martin-Millan M. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Roberson P.K. Kousteni S. O'Brien C.A. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Weinstein R.S.

These changes are temporally associated with increased osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis, decreased osteoblast number and bone formation rate, increased levels of ROS, and a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of p53 and p66shc, two key components of a signaling cascade that influences apoptosis and lifespan in invertebrates and mammals. In agreement with our findings, others have shown that H2O2 suppresses osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow progenitors and promotes osteoblast apoptosis in an ERK-dependent manner in vitro; and that an increase in ROS leads to osteopenia in other murine models and, perhaps, in humans (1Bai X.C.

Importantly, it has been recently shown that FoxO-mediated transcription requires binding of β-catenin (18Essers M.A. Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), a scaffold protein that is also required for the transcriptional activity of the T-cell factor (Tcf) family of transcription factors, which are the downstream effectors of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (19Staal F.J.

This background and in particular the evidence for the utilization of β-catenin by both FoxO- and Tcf-mediated transcription led us to hypothesize that ROS may suppress osteoblast differentiation by antagonizing the Wnt/Tcf pathway.

Primers and probes for alkaline phosphatase (AP), Axin2, osteoprotegerin (Opg), catalase, Mn-SOD, Gadd45, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ribosomal protein S2 were manufactured as Assays-by-Demand™ (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—C2C12 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104/cm2 in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, the medium was replaced with 5% serum-containing medium and the cells were either pre-treated with vehicle or H2O2 for 1 h. Vehicle and Wnt3a were added to the cells and cultures were continued for 24 h. Cells were lysed in 100 mm glycine, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 at pH 10. AP activity in the cell lysate was determined using a buffer containing 2-amino-2-methylpropanol and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by analysis of variance, using SigmaStat (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). All experiments were repeated at least three times.

Conversely, the transcripts for the FoxO target gene Gadd45 (10Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E.

H2O2 Reproduces the Reciprocal Changes in FoxO- and Wnt-mediated Transcription in Osteoblastic Cells—Encouraged by the in vivo findings, we proceeded to examine whether increased activation of FoxO transcription factors by ROS attenuates Wnt/Tcf-mediated transcription, using two different cell models: an uncommitted mesenchymal cell line, C2C12, capable of differentiating toward the osteoblastic lineage (31Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar), and an osteoblastic cell line derived from the bone marrow, OB-6 (32Lecka-Czernik B. Gubrij I. Moerman E. Kajkenova O. Lipschitz D. Manolagas S. Jilka R.L. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 74: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). H2O2 increased the expression of transcripts for Gadd45 and Catalase in C2C12 cells, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR; whereas treatment with Wnt3a had no effect on the expression of these two genes (Fig. 2A). Likewise, H2O2 increased the expression of transcripts for Mn-SOD in OB-6 cells and Wnt3a promoted this effect (supplemental materials Fig. S1A). On the other hand, H2O2 decreased the basal levels, as well as Wnt3a-stimulted levels, of Axin2, AP, and Opg transcripts (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained in OB-6 cells (supplemental materials Fig. S1B). As a more direct measure of FoxO- and Tcf-mediated transcription, we next determined whether H2O2 altered the activity of either a FoxO- or a Tcf-transcriptional reporter construct, respectively. H2O2 dose dependently attenuated Wnt3a-stimulated Tcf-luc activity in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3A). Conversely, H2O2 dose-dependently stimulated the activity of the FoxO-luc construct in the same cell line (Fig. 3B) and in OB-6 cells (supplemental materials Fig. S1C). The H2O2-induced suppression of Tcf transcription could be mediated by inhibition of the pathway upstream from β-catenin activation or by direct inhibition of β-catenin action. To distinguish between these possibilities, we activated Tcf transcription by co-expressing a mutant of β-catenin (S33Y) that cannot be targeted for degradation. The β-catenin mutant dramatically stimulated Tcf-luc activity. Moreover, similar to the effect of Wnt3a, H2O2 dose-dependently attenuated the transcriptional effect of the β-catenin mutant (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that H2O2 simultaneously activates FoxO-mediated transcription and suppresses Tcf-mediated transcription, and that the effect of H2O2 on canonical Wnt signaling is downstream of β-catenin. Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Is Required for and Potentiates FoxO-mediated Transcription—Next, we sought to determine whether β-catenin and FoxO physically interact in osteoblastic cells. As shown in Table 1, both C2C12 and OB-6 cells express FoxO1, -3a, and -4, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Immunoprecipitation of protein extracts from C2C12 (Fig. 4A) or OB-6 cells (data not shown) demonstrated that β-catenin was present in precipitates obtained using anti-FoxO3a antibody; and that this FoxO family member was present in precipitates obtained with anti-β-catenin antibody. These findings indicate that FoxO and β-catenin exist in a complex in these two cell lines. Moreover, treatment of cells with H2O2 enhanced the association of β-catenin and FoxO3a (Fig. 4A).TABLE 1FoxO1, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 mRNA expression in osteoblastic cellsCell linesFoxO1FoxO3aFoxO42−ΔCtC2C120.79 ± 0.090.12 ± 0.010.58 ± 0.01OB-60.22 ± 0.010.53 ± 0.050.32 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab To determine whether β-catenin influences FoxO-mediated transcription in osteoblastic cells, we modulated β-catenin levels and determined the effect on FoxO-luc activity. H2O2-stimulated FoxO-luc activity was attenuated by blockade of Wnt signaling, and thereby reduction of β-catenin levels, via either treatment of C2C12 with the soluble LRP5/LRP6 inhibitor protein Dkk1, or by overexpression of Axin, an intracellular inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this, Dkk1 also blocked the increase in FoxO-mediated transcription promoted by co-transfection of a FoxO3a plasmid in C2C12 (Fig. 4C) or OB-6 cells (supplemental materials Fig. S2A). Having confirmed the requirement of the canonical Wnt signaling for FoxO-mediated transcription, we examined whether activation of canonical Wnt signaling and the downstream increase in β-catenin levels enhanced FoxO-mediated transcription. Co-transfection of C2C12 or OB-6 cells with the β-catenin S33Y mutant or treatment with Wnt3a significantly increased FoxO-luc activity (Fig. 4D and supplemental materials Fig. S2B). The enhancing effect of the S33Y mutant or Wnt3a on FoxO-mediated transcription was reproduced in cells overexpressing FoxO3a (Fig. 4D and supplemental materials Fig. S2B). β-Catenin Overexpression Prevents the Suppressive Effect of H2O2 on Tcf-mediated Transcription—The results presented thus far suggest that H2O2 suppresses Tcf-mediated transcription in a manner that depends on the activation of FoxO-mediated transcription. Therefore, both events may utilize a limited pool of available β-catenin. Such a model would predict that overexpression of β-catenin would restore Tcf-mediated transcription suppressed by H2O2. To determine whether this was the case, increasing amounts of the β-catenin mutant S33Y were co-expressed with Tcf-luc in cells exposed to H2O2.As shown in Fig. 5A, β-catenin dose dependently increased Tcf-mediated transcription in the presence of H2O2. A similar result was obtained when FoxO transcriptional activity was stimulated by overexpression of FoxO3a (Fig. 5B). ROS and FoxO Suppress Osteoblast Differentiation—Finally, we sought to determine whether increased levels of ROS were capable of suppressing osteoblastic differentiation of uncommitted precursors, as suggested by the decrease in osteoblast number with age in the C57BL/6 mice. To pursue this, we determined the effect of H2O2 on Wnt3a-induced osteoblast differentiation, as measured by AP activity. Wnt3a stimulated AP activity in C2C12 cells and this was suppressed by H2O2 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, overexpression of FoxO3a suppressed Wnt3a-induced AP activity (Fig. 6B). ROS-activated FoxOs utilize β-catenin, a scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in skeletal homeostasis when bound to an alternative transcription factor, Tcf (19Staal F.J. Clevers H. Hematol. J. 2000; 1: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Prompted by this evidence, we have tested herein the hypothesis that ROS suppress osteoblast differentiation by antagonizing Wnt/Tcf-mediated transcription, and that this mechanism may be an important pathogenetic factor for the skeletal involution that is associated with old age. We report that advancing age in C56BL/6 mice is associated with increased expression of Gadd45, a target gene of FoxOs and decreased expression of the Wnt target genes Axin2 and Opg. Consistent with the in vivo findings, we found that β-catenin and FoxO3a physically associate in osteoblastic cells models and that H2O2 enhances this association. Exposure of osteoblastic cells to H2O2 in vitro stimulated the activity of a FoxO-luc reporter construct and the expression of Gadd45, Catalase, or Mn-SOD. On the other hand, H2O2 attenuated the activity of a construct driven by Tcf, as well as the expression of Axin2, Opg, and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, stimulation of FoxO transcription by H2O2 in osteoblastic cells was abrogated by the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 as well as Axin, which accelerates β-catenin degradation. Conversely, β-catenin overexpression abrogated the suppressive effect of H2O2 on Tcf-mediated transcription. Last, Wnt-induced osteoblastic differentiation was abrogated by H2O2 or overexpression of FoxO. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ROS suppresses osteoblast differentiation by diverting a limited pool of β-catenin from Tcf to FoxO complexes. It is widely accepted that decreased wall width, the histologic index of the amount of bone made by a team of osteoblasts, is the hallmark of age-associated osteoporosis and decreased bone formation in animals and humans, and results from decreased osteoblastogenesis (33Manolagas S.C. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). This is caused, at least in part, from a switch in the fate of mesenchymal stem cell progenitors that can give rise to either adipocytes or osteoblasts, to the former phenotype at the expense of the latter (34Kajkenova O. Lecka-Czernik B. Gubrij I. Hauser S.P. Takahashi K. Parfit A.M. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Lipschitz D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This reciprocal change may account for the well established phenomenon of increased bone marrow adiposity with age. Wnt binding to the Frizzled-LRP5/6 receptor complex halts the proteolytic destruction of β-catenin, which then moves into the nucleus where it binds to and activates the Tcf family of transcription factors (Fig. 7). Importantly, among its many other biologic roles in development, β-catenin is a sine qua non factor for the commitment of mesenchymal stem cell progenitors to the osteoblast lineage and differentiation (21Rodda S.J.

Chan L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). This process continues throughout adult life and is essential for the regeneration of the skeleton. We have also shown earlier that Wnt-signaling prevents apoptosis of both uncommitted osteoblast progenitors and differentiated osteoblasts by β-catenin-dependent (as well as independent) signaling cascades involving Src/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (27Almeida M. Han L. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41342-41351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Collectively, all these actions as well as the ability of Wnt/β-catenin signaling to suppress osteoclastogenesis lead to a positive balance between bone formation and resorption and increased bone mass. On the other hand, Wnt/β-catenin suppresses adipocyte differentiation (42Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite possible that the antagonism of Wnt signaling in osteoblast precursors by the diversion of β-catenin from Tcf- to FoxO-mediated transcription may be responsible not only for the decreased osteoblastogenesis and bone formation, but also the increased marrow adiposity associated with old age (Fig. 7). In full support of the conclusions of the present report, high bone mass mutants of the LRP5 receptor, or Wnt10b overexpression in the marrow, prevents osteoblast apoptosis and the age-associated bone loss and strength in mice (35Babij P.

Besides antagonizing mesenchymal progenitor commitment toward the osteoblastic lineage, oxidative stress operating through the molecular mechanism elucidated in the present paper may affect other aspects of osteoblastogenesis. Indeed, Tothova et al. (44Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P. Lazo-Kallanian S. Williams I.R. Sears C. Armstrong S.A. Passegue E. DePinho R.A. Gilliland D.G. Cell. 2007; 128: 325-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar) have recently provided compelling evidence from studies of hematopoiesis in mice with conditional deletion of FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 that FoxO deficiency depletes hematopoietic stem cells by inducing their apoptosis and by driving them into the cell cycle and terminal differentiation. More important, these workers were able to reverse completely the changes of the FoxO-deficient hematopoietic stem cell phenotype by the administration of the anti-oxidant n-acetyl cysteine, demonstrating that oxidative stress is a critical determinant of the long term regenerative potential of stem cells. In view of this evidence, it is tempting to speculate that increased levels of ROS with advancing age may also have deleterious effects on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) self-renewal by increasing apoptosis and transiently enhancing MSC entry into the cell cycle and terminal differentiation. In studies by Almeida et al. (52Almeida M. Han L. Martin-Millan M. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Roberson P.K. Kousteni S. O'Brien C.A. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27285-27297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) reported in the accompanying manuscript, we have found that loss of sex steroids acutely increases oxidative stress in mice. In addition, we have obtained evidence that both sex steroid deficiency and aging exert their adverse effects on bone by oxidative stress and that, in fact, sex steroid deficiency accelerates the effect of organismal aging on osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast and osteoclast survival. Nonetheless, whereas acute estrogen or androgen deficiency is a state of high bone turnover and increased bone formation (albeit, unbalanced by the increased resorption), aging is a state of low turnover and decreased bone formation. We and others had previously established that acute loss of estrogens increases the rate of remodeling by up-regulating osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. The effect of the loss of estrogens on the rate of remodeling and the up-regulation of osteoblastogenesis and bone formation in animals and humans, however, wanes with time (5-10 years in women and 6-8 weeks in mice) raising the possibility that aging might be overriding the acute effects of estrogen deficiency. Considering the evidence that unopposed oxidative stress promotes premature hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, it is possible that following acute loss of estrogens, the increased ROS levels in MSCs may promote their exit from quiescence, replication, and development of transit amplifying osteoblast progenitors, the latter already confirmed by our earlier work (45DiGregorio G. Yamamoto M. Ali A. Abe E. Roberson P. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These mechanisms, lead to up-regulation of osteoblast differentiation and thereby increased bone formation. However, this effect would be reversed with time because the gradual buildup of ROS production with aging (accelerated by estrogen deficiency) antagonizes Wnt signaling and also leads to a decrease in the size of the MSC compartment by increasing MSC apoptosis. In support of this scenario, we have developed methods of expanding the self-renewal of MSC progenitors of osteoblasts, whereas preserving stemness (46Chen X.-D. Dusevich V. Feng J.Q. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar), and using this technology have determined that their replication capacity is significantly lower in old versus young mice. 3X-D. Chen, M. Almeida, L. Han, M. Martin-Millan, C. A. O'Brien, and S. C. Manolagas, unpublished observations. Hence, we propose that an acute increase in ROS may transiently stimulate osteoblast differentiation, whereas a long term increase in ROS may lead to depletion of the pool of osteoblast progenitors, accounting for the self-limiting effect of estrogen deficiency on osteoblastogenesis. Diversion of β-catenin from Tcf to FoxO may also represent an important molecular mechanism of the age-dependent increase in osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis, which is well documented in aging mice and in humans (47Frost H.M. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1960; 42: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 48Dunstan C.R. Somers N.M. Evans R.A. Calcif.

Recently, during the writing of our paper, Mani and co-workers (49Mani A. Radhakrishnan J. Wang H. Mani A. Mani M.A. Nelson-Williams C. Carew K.S. Mane S. Najmabadi H. Wu D. Lifton R.P. Science. 2007; 315: 1278-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) reported a missense mutation in LRP6, a co-receptor for the Wnt-signaling pathway, in a family with autosomal dominant early coronary artery disease, features of the metabolic syndrome (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes), as well as osteoporosis. Similar to the effects of H2O2 on Wnt transcription in the osteoblastic cells described in our paper, the LRP6 mutation in the report by Mani et al. (49Mani A. Radhakrishnan J. Wang H. Mani A. Mani M.A. Nelson-Williams C. Carew K.S. Mane S. Najmabadi H. Wu D. Lifton R.P. Science. 2007; 315: 1278-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) impaired Wnt-induced transcription in NIH 3T3 cells. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that the antagonism of Wnt signaling by oxidative stress with increasing age may play a role not only in the development of involutional osteoporosis, but other common age-dependent diseases like coronary artery disease, Type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (50Manolagas S.C. Almeida M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the results of the present report, it has recently been shown that H2O2 can also activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, via a mechanism involving binding of disheveled (Dvl) to nucleoredoxin. Specifically, Funato et al. (51Funato Y. Michiue T. Asashima M. Miki H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) show that nucleoredoxin is a strong inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and that the binding of nucleoredoxin to Dvl is inhibited by treatment with H2O2. One explanation for the apparent discrepancy between this study and the present work is the time frame of the events: Funato et al. (51Funato Y. Michiue T. Asashima M. Miki H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) found that H2O2 induces a rapid increase in Wnt signaling that peaks ∼20 min after stimulation, but the strength of this response is reduced when cells are analyzed several hours later. In contrast our studies were performed 5-24 h after H2O2 and Wnt3a treatment. Additional studies will, of course, be needed to fully elucidate the impact of acute versus chronic oxidative stress on Wnt signaling. In closing, the evidence presented herein provides molecular details of a pathogenetic mechanism linking the increased oxidative stress that is associated with old age to the development of skeletal involution (Fig. 7). Ironically, in this particular instance, the diversion of β-catenin away from Tcf to the ROS-induced FoxO suggests that the adverse effects of aging on bone may be mediated by the same factor that was used during development and growth to build skeletal assets.

In addition, regulated expression of human MMP13 in hyaline and joint cartilages induces OA in genetically modified mice (9Neuhold L.A. Killar L. Zhao W. Sung M J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a MMP inhibitor that preferentially inhibits MMP13 has been shown to block the degradation of explanted human osteoarthritic cartilage (5Billinghurst R.C. Dahlberg L. Ionescu M.

Based on these findings, it is likely that MMP13 is the direct cause of irreversible cartilage damage in OA. osteoarthritis matrix metalloprotease musculoskeletal syndrome catalytic domain full-length area under the curve from time 0 to 24 h. osteoarthritis matrix metalloprotease musculoskeletal syndrome catalytic domain full-length area under the curve from time 0 to 24 h. The clinical development of drugs that inhibit the actions of MMPs has been plagued by the association of a painful, joint-stiffening tendonitis-like side effect, termed “musculoskeletal syndrome” (MSS), with these inhibitors (10Clark I.M. Parker A.E. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2003; 7: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Drummond A.H. Beckett P. Brown P.D. Bone E.A. Davidson A.H. Galloway W.A. Gearing A.J.H. Huxley P. Laber D. McCourt M. Whittaker M. Wood L.M. Wright A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Such joint side effects are not unique to humans. Rats dosed with non-selective MMP inhibitors (i.e. compounds that inhibit several or all MMPs) also display MSS-like side effects such as soft tissue fibroplasias, inflammation, and pain (12Renkiewicz R. Qiu L. Lesch C. Sun X. Devalaraja R. Cody T. Kaldjian E. Welgus H. Baragi V. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1742-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although the human joint side effects are reversible upon withdrawal of drug, MSS has halted clinical trials of many non-selective MMP inhibitors (10Clark I.M. Parker A.E. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2003; 7: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We began a search for MMP13-selective inhibitors with the hypothesis that they would effectively prevent cartilage degradation without causing MSS-like side effects. MMP Activity Assays-MMP13 activity and MMP selectivity assays employed a thioester substrate, acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-[2-mercapto-4-methyl-pentanoyl]-Leu-Gly-O-ethyl ester (Bachem Corp. #H-7145) (13Weingarten H. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and reaction mixtures containing 50 mm N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.1 mm substrate, 0.005% Brij 35, and test compounds dissolved in Me2SO (1% final). A recombinant human MMP13 catalytic domain (CD) construct encompassing Tyr-104 to Asp-270 (SWISS-PROT P45452) was generated by synthetic gene methods and bacterial expression (14Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and was used for both high throughput screening and crystallographic studies. In the MMP IC50 assays the enzyme was used at a level at least 10-fold lower than the IC50. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 412 nm on a microplate reader thermostatted at 25 °C. The % of control activity was plotted against inhibitor concentration and fit to the equation % of control activity = 100/(1 + ([I]/IC)slope50), where [I] is the inhibitor concentration, IC50 is the inhibitor concentration where the rate is 50% reduced relative to the control, and slope is the slope of the curve at its inflection point. Steady-state Kinetics of Inhibition of MMP13-Recombinant full-length (FL) human MMP13 was expressed as the latent proenzyme in a baculovirus expression system, purified to homogeneity, and activated by incubating it with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 37 °C for 1 h. To determine the kinetic mechanism of inhibition by Compound 1, MMP13FL (5 nm) was assayed at 25 °C in reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0–200 μm thioester substrate, 0.005% Brij 35, and various concentrations of Compound 1. Steady-state kinetics data were fit by global non-linear least squares regression using GraFit Version 5 software (15Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. 2005; Google Scholar) to the equation for noncompetitive inhibition (16Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. 1975; : 125Google Scholar), 1/v = [(Km/ Vmax)(1 + ([I]/Ki))(1/[S])] + [(1/Vmax)(1 + ([I]/Ki))], where [I] and [S] are the concentrations of inhibitor and substrate, respectively, v is the initial velocity, Km is the Michaelis constant, Vmax is the maximal rate, and Ki is the inhibition constant. To rule out a more elaborate model, we also fit the data to the equation for mixed inhibition (16Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. 1975; : 125Google Scholar), 1/v = [(Km/Vmax)(1 + ([I]/Ki))(1/[S])] + [(1/Vmax)(1 +([I]/αKi))], where α is the factor by which the Ki is changed when the substrate is bound to the enzyme. Type II Collagen Cleavage Assay-Reaction mixtures to assay for inhibition of MMP13-catalyzed hydrolysis of type II collagen contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml soluble bovine collagen (Elastin Products Co. # CJ385), 0.005% Brij 35, and inhibitor in Me2SO (1% final). Activated MMP13FL (2 nm) was added, and the reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 18 h. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample loading buffer. Proteins were separated by denaturing electrophoresis (8% Trisglycine) and then visualized with Coomassie R-250. The ¾-length product protein bands were scanned and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer with Quantity One Version 4.0 software. The IC50 was defined from a plot of the % of control ¾-length product density against inhibitor concentration. Crystallography-MMP13CD protein for crystallography was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pLysS and pGEMEX-1/MMP13CD. Cells were grown in a 20-liter fermentor thermostatted to 30 °C and sparged with ∼8 liters of air/min. The medium (15 liters) contained 260 g of Difco 0127 yeast extract, 260 g of acidicase peptone (BBL 211843), 260 g of Difco 0259 casitone, 260 g of gelysate peptone (BBL 211870), 26 g of KH2PO4, 26 g K2HPO4, 26 g of Na2HPO4 •7 H2O, and 1.5 g of ampicillin and was titrated to pH 6.8. The culture was stirred with an impeller at 600 rpm and was maintained at pH 6.8 ± 0.2 by the addition of 85% lactic acid, whereas foam was reduced using Antifoam 289. At a culture A600 ∼ 10, the temperature was raised to 37 °C, and protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 3.2 mm. After 3 h the cells were collected by centrifugation. The wet cells (400 g) were suspended in 1.3 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) plus 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, and 40 μl of Benzonase. The cells were twice passed through a Dyno-Mill (Glenn Mills Type KDL 0.6-liter chamber) with 0.5 liters of 0.25–0.50-mm glass beads at an impeller speed of 4200 rpm and a flow rate of 100 ml/min. Insoluble material was washed by sequentially suspending it in 2 liters each of the following solutions and centrifuging the washed mixtures: 1) 50 mm glycine buffer (pH 10.0), 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (3 times); 2) 50 mm glycine buffer (pH 10.0), 10 mm EDTA; 3) 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol; 4) deionized water (2 times). The protein pellet was dissolved by suspending it in 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.6) plus 6 m guanidine and stirring the solution at room temperature. After centrifugation, the protein in the soluble fraction was brought to ∼0.15 mg/ml and was refolded at –15 °C by diafiltration into 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 10% glycerol using an Amicon S3Y10 membrane. The refolded protein was passed through a 0.2-μm filter, concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml, and frozen in aliquots at –70 °C. For crystallization, inhibitors in Me2SO were mixed in a 5:1 molar ratio with MMP13CD (1 mg/ml) (Me2SO, <5% final). Acetohydroxamic acid was added to 0.1 m, and the solutions were incubated 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the soluble protein was concentrated to 7–20 mg/ml, and 2–4-μl hanging drops of 1:1 protein:reservoir solution were equilibrated over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution. The reservoir solution for Compound 1 contained 18–22% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000 and 0.2 m Li2SO4 in 0.1 m Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), whereas that for Compound 2 contained 2.1 m (NH4)2SO4 in 0.1 m Hepes buffer (pH 7.5). After several weeks, crystals were cryo-preserved in 15% glycerol, 85% well solution and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using the MARCCD-165 detector installed on the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallographer Associations beamline 17-ID at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, IL. Data were integrated with HKL2000 and reduced using SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). During structure solution and refinement, initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure coordinates of human MMP3 (PDB 1CIZ) as a search model (19Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27327) Google Scholar), modified for sequence differences. After several rounds of model refinement using REFMAC5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar) and manual correction, the inhibitor, acetohydroxamate, and water molecules were placed using QUANTA-2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Cytokine-stimulated Cartilage Explant Degradation Assay- Bovine nasal cartilage explants (1 × 3 mm, 9 per group) were cultured for 2 weeks with interleukin-1α (50 ng/ml) and oncostatin M (50 ng/ml) in the presence of vehicle or up to 10 μm Compound 2. The culture medium was refreshed twice weekly, and the conditioned medium was pooled and collected for quantification of hydroxyproline (21Prockop D.J. Udenfriend S. Anal. Biochem. 1960; 1: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). At the end of the study, the remaining cartilage was digested with papain, and the hydroxyproline in this sample was measured. In Vivo Cartilage Degradation Induced by Exogenous MMP13-To assess the ability of orally dosed Compound 2 to reach the knee joint target tissue and inhibit MMP13-induced degradation of cartilage, rats (12 per group) were dosed orally with vehicle or various doses of Compound 2. After 3 h, the knee joints were injected with 12 μg of activated MMP13FL enzyme. The animals were sacrificed 2 h later, the knee joints were opened, and the synovial space was lavaged twice with 80 μl of saline. The type II collagen neoepitope biomarker in the lavage fluid was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22Otterness I.G. Downs J.T. Lane C. Bliven M.L. Stukenbrok H. Scampoli D.N. Milici A.J. Mézes P.S. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Surgical Model of OA-To assess the ability of an MMP13 inhibitor to prevent cartilage damage in vivo in a chronic disease model, Compound 2 was tested in a surgically induced model of OA in rabbits. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee reviewed and approved the protocol for this rabbit study. Animals were male specific-pathogen-free New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2.5–3.5 kg. The rabbits (12 per group) were individually housed in stainless steel caging in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited facility. Rooms were environmentally controlled to provide a temperature of 61–71 °F, a relative humidity of 35–65%, 100% fresh air at a rate of 10–12 room exchanges per h, and a light:dark cycle of 12:12 h. The rabbits were fed a designated amount of rabbit chow (LabDiet 5321, PMI Nutrition, Brentwood, MO) and provided with a continuous supply of deionized drinking water. The anterior cruciate ligament of one knee joint was transected, and ∼70% of the medial meniscus was excised. The joints were closed, and the animals were allowed to recover. Beginning 1 day post-operation, the animals were dosed orally twice daily with 30 mg/kg of Compound 2 or vehicle. Five weeks later, the animals were sacrificed, and the knee joints were removed and stained with India ink to evaluate the presence and severity of cartilage lesions as follows. After joint removal and separation of the femoral condyle from the tibial plateau, the joint was wrapped in a paper towel moistened with saline and kept on ice. Each bone was unwrapped and dipped into waterproof drawing India ink (Sanford no. 4418) to immerse the entire articular surface. The bone was then briefly rinsed in a beaker of normal saline then blotted with a clean paper towel to remove excess ink. The remaining ink reveals damage, fibrillation, and fissuring of the cartilage. Each articular surface of the joint was then imaged using three different angles for the femoral condyle and one for the tibial plateau. Images of the lesions were captured using a Nikon SMZ800 dissecting microscope (1× setting) with a SPOT Insight color CCD camera (Diagnostics Instruments Model 320) and a Cadmet MS2000 light source. Images were saved as bitmap files (1600 × 1200, 24 bits per pixel) using SPOT Version 4 software using auto-exposure setting. Images were burned onto compact discs, and lesions were demarcated in blinded fashion by two independent, trained investigators. Calibration was performed using images of standards taken on the same microscope at the same time. Rat Fibroplasia Model of Musculoskeletal Joint Side Effects- To determine the propensity of an MMP13 inhibitor to induce joint side effects, Compound 2 was tested in a rat model of MSS that has been used previously to demonstrate joint toxicities of the non-selective MMP inhibitor, marimastat (12Renkiewicz R. Qiu L. Lesch C. Sun X. Devalaraja R. Cody T. Kaldjian E. Welgus H. Baragi V. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1742-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We orally dosed Sprague-Dawley rats (6/sex) with vehicle or 2000 mg/kg of Compound 2 per day (i.e. the maximum feasible dose) for a period of 2 weeks. A third group of rats given a single daily oral dose of 2000 mg/kg of a non-selective hydroxamic acid MMP inhibitor, Compound 4, (R)-2-(4′-bromobiphenyl-4-sulfonylamino)-N-hydroxy-3-methylbutyramide (23O'Brien P.M. Ortwine D.F. Pavlovsky A.G. Picard J.A. Sliskovic D.R. Roth B.D. Dyer R.D. Johnson L.L. Man C J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), served as the positive control. The calcaneon tendon and femorotibial, tibiotarsal, and humeroradial joints were prepared bilaterally for microscopic assessment of potential joint-related lesions. After 14 days of oral dosing to rats of either vehicle, MMP13 inhibitor Compound 2 or non-selective MMP inhibitor Compound 4 representative samples of femorotibial joints were collected at necropsy, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, decalcified, and processed with hematoxylin and eosin for light microcopy to assess any compound-induced changes in joint histology. Statistical Analyses-For the MMP13 inhibitor kinetic mechanism of inhibition study, the initial rate data were fit to the various models for inhibition using GraFit software (15Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. 2005; Google Scholar). This program globally fits the rate data at the various inhibitor concentrations and provides a reduced X2 value representing the goodness of fit of the data to the kinetic model. For the statistical analysis of animal model data, SigmaStat® software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) was used. One-way analysis of variance was carried out to see if differences existed among the experimental groups, and Dunnett's test was used to see if the mean responses of the experimental groups were statistically significantly different from control group. Statistical tests were two-tailed and carried out at the p = 0.05 level of statistical significance. The rabbit OA study consisted of at least two groups, and the normality and equal variance tests used for data analysis indicated that the samples satisfied the standard statistical assumptions required. Discovery and Biochemical Characterization of MMP13 Inhibitors-We screened our compound library for inhibitors of the hydrolytic activity of human MMP13CD and found Compound 1 (6-benzyl-5,7-dioxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-thiazolo[3,2-c]pyrimidine-2-carboxylic acid benzyl ester) to be a potent inhibitor with an IC50 = 30 ± 2 nm (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, when we tested Compound 1 at up to 100 μm against nine other MMPs, we found that this novel inhibitor chemotype did not inhibit these closely related proteases (Table 1). Also highlighted in Table 1 is the improved potency (IC50 = 0.67 nm) and extremely selective inhibition of MMP13 by an advanced derivative, Compound 2 (4-[1-methyl-2,4-dioxo-6-(3-phenyl-prop-1-ynyl)-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-ylmethyl]-benzoic acid). The high selectivity of Compounds 1 and 2 for MMP13 is in stark contrast to the lack of selectivity of Compound 3, a hydroxamic acid-containing broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor known as GM-6001, or Galardin. In addition, when tested against isolated human ADAMTS4 and -5 in in vitro assays where cleavage of native aggrecan substrate was quantified with the BC-3 neoepitope antibody, Compound 2 showed IC50 > 25 μm with both of these aggrecanases. 4G. Munie, A. Wittwer, and M. Tortorella, unpublished data.TABLE 1Contrasting the MMP selectivity of two MMP13 selective inhibitors with that of the non-selective MMP inhibitor, Compound 3 (GM-6001) Inhibition of MMP activity was assayed at least in triplicate inhibitor titrations using the thiopeptolide substrate (13Weingarten H. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).*, Compound 2 precipitation was observed in these assays at 100,000 nm. Open table in a new tab *, Compound 2 precipitation was observed in these assays at 100,000 nm. In some of the MMP selectivity assays, which are carried out in pH 7 Hepes buffer, Compound 2 showed visible insolubility at 100 μm, as noted in Table 1. In routine solubility tests carried out in phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 and 6.5, however, Compound 2 showed solubility of less than 3 μm, whereas in pH 6 phosphate buffer it was soluble to 20 μm. Compound 1, on the other hand, showed no sign of insolubility up to 100 μm, the highest concentration tested in the MMP selectivity assays. Thus, the solubility of Compound 2 is sensitive to the buffer system and pH used. In steady-state kinetics experiments, Compound 1 is a linear noncompetitive inhibitor of MMP13FL (Figs. 1, B and C) with Ki = 64 ± 1 nm, Vmax = 402 ± 2 pmol min–1, Km = 48 ± 1 μm, and a goodness-of-fit reduced X2 value of 0.0262. In noncompetitive inhibition the inhibitor and the substrate bind independently and simultaneously to the enzyme at non-overlapping sites, and the inhibitor binds with equal affinity to the free enzyme and to the enzyme·substrate complex. The presence of bound substrate does not alter the binding affinity of the inhibitor and vice versa. Attempts to fit the data to the rate equations for mixed, competitive, and uncompetitive inhibition models resulted in less satisfactory reduced X2 values of 0.0270, 0.2947, and 0.1439, respectively. In addition, we determined that Compound 2 is also a linear noncompetitive inhibitor of MMP13. 5A. R. Johnson, unpublished observations. During MMP-catalyzed peptide bond hydrolysis, it is thought that the carbonyl oxygen atom or oxyanion of the scissile amide group binds to, and is polarized by the catalytic zinc ion. Nearly all MMP inhibitors described to date possess a hydroxamic acid, carboxylic acid, or other metal-chelating group that binds to this catalytic zinc ion and competes with substrate binding (24Skotnicki J.S. DiGrandi M.J. Levin J.I. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2003; 6: 742-759PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition of MMP13 displayed by Compounds 1 and 2 indicates that these inhibitors do not bind to the catalytic zinc ion or to the peptide binding active site cleft. We confirmed that inhibition of MMP13 by Compound 2 is rapidly and fully reversible using enzyme-inhibitor preincubation-dilution activity studies.5 Furthermore, when tested in an assay using a more physiologically relevant macromolecular substrate such as type II collagen, Compound 1 retains its ability to potently inhibit MMP13-catalyzed proteolysis with an IC50 = 51 ± 6 nm (Fig. 2). Crystal Structures of Inhibitors Bound to MMP13-The noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition of MMP13 by these new chemotypes indicated that they did not bind to the catalytic zinc ion. Thus, we could not use crystal structure data for MMPs bound to zinc binding inhibitors to construct reliable models to predict where these MMP13 inhibitors bind. We, therefore, determined the mode of binding of these unique MMP13 inhibitors by crystallography using MMP13CD. 6The atomic coordinates of MMP13 in complex with Compounds 1 and 2 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entries 2OW9 and 2OZR, respectively. Diffraction data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table 2 for co-crystals of Compounds 1 and 2 with a complex of MMP13CD plus acetohydroxamic acid, a ligand added to prevent autolysis. The secondary and tertiary structures for MMP13CD (Fig. 3A) in general resemble those previously described for MMP13 crystallized with zinc binding inhibitors (25Roswell S. Hatwin P. Minshull C.A. Jepson H. Brockbank S.M.V. Barratt D.G. Slater A.M. McPheat W.L. Waterson D. Henney A.M. Pauptit R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Lang R.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar)). In various MMP13 crystals we have prepared, including those described here, the N terminus of the protein can adopt different orientations depending on the inhibitor used, the crystallization conditions, and/or the resultant space group observed. 7A. G. Pavlovsky, unpublished observations. However, it is the unique disposition of the S1′-specificity loop that is most relevant to our drug discovery efforts. We observed that the non-zinc binding MMP13 inhibitors described here confer an ordered structure to the S1′-specificity loop that is otherwise flexible and poorly defined.TABLE 2Data collection and crystallographic refinement statisticsCompound 1Compound 2Data collection Wavelength (Å)1.00 Source/detectorAPS 17-ID/MARCCD-165APS 17-ID/MARCCD-165 Space groupC2C2 Unit cell: a, b, c (Å)140.76, 36.68, 71.68161.84, 71.97, 138.13 β (°)93.5124.6 Resolution range (Å) (highest resolution shell)70-1.72 (1.78-1.72)50-2.1 (2.18-2.1) Measured/unique reflections110,901/37,780173,489/66,624 Completeness (%)97.5 (67.5)90.7 (62.8) RmergeaRmerge = Σhkl|I - 〈I〉|/ΣhklI, where I is the intensity of unique reflection hkl, and 〈I〉 is the average over symmetr"
https://openalex.org/W2167301573,"The pluripotent nature of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) widens their potential for tissue regeneration and as vehicles for cell therapy in molecular medicine. Although the MSC are relatively easier to obtain and propagate in culture, a major impediment remains in their engraftment to target tissues on autologous transfer. We report here that transient, ectopic expression of alpha4 integrin (CD49d) on MSC greatly increases bone homing in an immunocompetent mouse model. Heterodimerization of the alpha4 integrin with endogenous beta1 integrin (CD29) was confirmed to influence this targeting. In addition to retaining their stem cell property, the engrafted MSC were also found to form osteoblasts and osteocytes in the growth plate of recipient mouse limb bones (femur/tibia) in vivo. These findings provide evidence for a novel strategy to achieve bone homing of genetically engineered MSC, which may broadly benefit in targeted therapies for osteopenic bone defects and cancer bone metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1989847998,"The collagens of the extracellular matrix are the most abundant structural proteins in the mammalian body. In tissue remodeling and in the invasive growth of malignant tumors, collagens constitute an important barrier, and consequently, the turnover of collagen is a rate-limiting process in these events. A recently discovered turnover route with importance for tumor growth involves intracellular collagen degradation and is governed by the collagen receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP or Endo180). The interplay between this mechanism and extracellular collagenolysis is not known. In this report, we demonstrate the existence of a new, composite collagen breakdown pathway. Thus, fibroblast-mediated collagen degradation proceeds preferentially as a sequential mechanism in which extracellular collagenolysis is followed by uPARAP/Endo180-mediated endocytosis of large collagen fragments. First, we show that collagen that has been pre-cleaved by a mammalian collagenase is taken up much more efficiently than intact, native collagen by uPARAP/Endo180-positive cells. Second, we demonstrate that this preference is governed by the acquisition of a gelatin-like structure by the collagen, occurring upon collagenase-mediated cleavage under native conditions. Third, we demonstrate that the growth of uPARAP/Endo180-deficient fibroblasts on a native collagen matrix leads to substantial extracellular accumulation of well defined collagen fragments, whereas, wild-type fibroblasts possess the ability to direct an organized and complete degradation sequence comprising both the initial cleavage, the endocytic uptake, and the intracellular breakdown of collagen.

Thus, fibroblast-mediated collagen degradation proceeds preferentially as a sequential mechanism in which extracellular collagenolysis is followed by uPARAP/Endo180-mediated endocytosis of large collagen fragments. First, we show that collagen that has been pre-cleaved by a mammalian collagenase is taken up much more efficiently than intact, native collagen by uPARAP/Endo180-positive cells. Second, we demonstrate that this preference is governed by the acquisition of a gelatin-like structure by the collagen, occurring upon collagenase-mediated cleavage under native conditions. Third, we demonstrate that the growth of uPARAP/Endo180-deficient fibroblasts on a native collagen matrix leads to substantial extracellular accumulation of well defined collagen fragments, whereas, wild-type fibroblasts possess the ability to direct an organized and complete degradation sequence comprising both the initial cleavage, the endocytic uptake, and the intracellular breakdown of collagen. Collagens are the most abundant protein constituents of the extracellular matrix. The sheet-like collagens of the basement membrane and the fibrillar matrix collagens all incorporate into dense, insoluble protein networks that form a critical barrier against processes of cell migration such as those connected to tissue remodeling, including the invasive growth of cancer. Consequently, the degradation of these matrices is one of the rate-limiting steps in cancer invasion (1Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar).The physiological mechanisms responsible for collagen degradation have long been subject to investigation. Due to their unique structural features, collagens can only be degraded by a minority of mammalian extracellular proteases, but certain matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), 3The abbreviations used are:MMPmatrix metalloproteaseuPARAPurokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (also designated Endo180)suPARAPsoluble uPARAP fusion proteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateAPMA4-aminophenylmercuric acetate 3The abbreviations used are:MMPmatrix metalloproteaseuPARAPurokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (also designated Endo180)suPARAPsoluble uPARAP fusion proteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateAPMA4-aminophenylmercuric acetate such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, and the membrane-bound MMP-14 and -15, are indeed active against native collagens (2Stricklin G.P.

The initial attack of these proteases leads to the generation of well defined collagen fragments, which, while still in the extracellular environment, may be subject to further degradation by gelatinases, MMP-2 or MMP-9, or other types of proteases (11Mohamed M.M.

This new observation underscores the importance of understanding the function of uPARAP and the interplay between cellular and extracellular events in collagen and matrix turnover.uPARAP is a type-1 transmembrane protein and a member of the mannose receptor protein family of constitutive endocytosis receptors (reviewed in Refs. 19East L.

The extracellular portion includes a cysteine-rich domain, a fibronectin type-II domain, and eight consecutive C-type lectin-like domains (20Behrendt N. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The receptor binds directly to various types of collagen through interactions governed, wholly or in part, by the fibronectin type-II domain (15Behrendt N. Jensen O.N. Engelholm L.H. Mortz E. Mann M.

Sporstol M. Smedsrod B. Berg T. Kojima N. Senoo H. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Following endocytosis from clathrin-coated pits (30Isacke C.M. van der G.P.

Thus, the receptor is expressed in osteoblasts of developing bone (33Engelholm L.H. Nielsen B.S. Netzel-Arnett S. Solberg H. Chen X.D. Lopez Garcia J.M. Lopez-Otin C. Young M.F. Birkedal-Hansen H.

In connection with cancer, expression is observed in the myoepithelium of mammary carcinoma in situ, in the myofibroblasts of invasive mammary carcinoma, and in fibroblast-like cells in oral cancer (35Schnack N.B.

In this work, we show that fibroblasts, a dominant cell type in collagen turnover, direct an organized degradation pathway that combines extracellular cleavage and uPARAP-mediated endocytosis. These observations assign a new function to uPARAP as an efficient endocytic receptor for early collagen cleavage products.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins and Cultured Cells—Skin fibroblasts from newborn homozygous uPARAP-deficient mice and littermate control wild-type mice were isolated and cultured as published previously (17Engelholm L.H.

Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) were isolated and cultured in the same manner, in each case accompanied by wild-type control cultures obtained from littermate control mice. Recombinant, soluble uPARAP fusion protein (suPARAP), comprising the extracellular portion (Met1–Ser1402) of the human uPARAP sequence fused to a purification tag (the third domain of the urokinase receptor), was expressed in Drosophila Schneider S2 cells and purified as described (39Gardsvoll H. Hansen L.V. Jorgensen T.J. Ploug M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 52: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The monoclonal mouse anti-uPARAP antibody 2.h.9:F12 was raised against purified suPARAP and produced as described previously (36Sulek J. Wagenaar-Miller R.A. Shireman J. Molinolo A. Madsen D.H. Engelholm L.H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The following proteins were purchased from the commercial sources indicated: native trypsin-resistant collagen type-I from rat tail (BD Biosciences), FITC-collagen type I from MD Biosciences (Zürich, Switzerland), cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d and recombinant, human pro-MMP-13 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) (Sigma-Aldrich), interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and polyclonal rabbit antibody against collagen type-I (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA).Cleavage of Collagen under Non-denaturing Conditions—For activation of pro-MMP-13, the pro-enzyme was diluted to 50 μg/ml in reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). APMA was added from a freshly prepared 20 mm stock solution in 0.1 m NaOH to a final concentration of 1 mm, after which the sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For the removal of APMA after the activation step, the sample was subjected to four rounds of buffer exchange, each cycle including centrifugation through an Amicon Ultra-free-MC 10,000 NMWL Filter Unit, to 10% of the starting volume and replenishment of reaction buffer to 100% volume. For cleavage of collagen, collagen was diluted to 250 μg/ml in reaction buffer, after which the freshly activated MMP-13 was added to a final concentration of 8.75 μg/ml (∼175 nm). The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h.Internalization Studies with Collagen and Collagen Fragments—Labeling of proteins with 125I and radioligand internalization assays with cultured newborn mouse fibroblasts were performed as described before (17Engelholm L.H. List K. Netzel-Arnett S. Cukierman E. Mitola D.J. Aaronson H. Kjoller L. Larsen J.K. Yamada K.M. Strickland D.K. Holmbeck K. Dano K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and included incubation of cells with radioligand in 24-well tissue culture plates for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by isolation of the intracellular fraction and quantification of the internalized radioactivity. Before the assay, the protein concentration and the specific radioactivity of each of the radiolabeled protein preparations was estimated by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, by careful comparison with a narrow dilution series of a known standard of the same protein preparation in the non-labeled form, run on the same gel. 30 ng of labeled intact or cleaved collagen was added to each well with near-confluent cells in a volume of 300 μl. In some experiments, the labeled collagen ligands were preincubated at elevated temperature before the assay, as indicated. Incubation of cultured fibroblasts with FITC-labeled intact and cleaved collagen-I (15 μg/ml) followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was performed as described previously for fluorescence-labeled, intact collagen-IV (28Kjoller L. Engelholm L.H. Hoyer-Hansen M. Dano K. Bugge T.H. Behrendt N. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), using an incubation period of 22 h in the presence of 20 μm E-64d.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Interaction analyses with intact and cleaved collagen and immobilized suPARAP were done using a BIAcore2000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Before interaction analysis, the monoclonal antibody 2.h.9:F12, against uPARAP (36Sulek J. Wagenaar-Miller R.A. Shireman J. Molinolo A. Madsen D.H. Engelholm L.H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was coupled to the surface of a CM5-type BIAcore chip by amine-directed coupling, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. This chip was then used as a catching support for suPARAP, injected subsequently, to obtain a level of immobilized suPARAP of ∼5500 resonance units. Due to the binding characteristics of the 2.h.9: F12 antibody, this non-covalent immobilization step was irreversible under the conditions used, because the elution conditions for collagen (below) led to no release of bound suPARAP from the chip. Cleaved or intact collagen type-I was preincubated in assay buffer (0.01 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) at 37 °C, or at elevated temperature as indicated, after which various concentrations of the protein were injected. After each round of binding and dissociation, the chip was regenerated by injection of 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0, to obtain complete dissociation of all bound collagen material. A parallel flow channel, containing coupled antibody but no suPARAP, served as a control for unspecific binding and buffer bulk subtraction. No binding of intact or cleaved collagen was obtained with antibody alone. The BIAcore interaction analyses were otherwise performed as described (40Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), monitoring binding and dissociation at 20 °C in assay buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Curve fitting to kinetic models and calculation of kinetic parameters were done using the BIAeval software, version 3.2 RC1, supplied with the instrument.Analysis of Collagen Turnover in Growing Fibroblasts—A stock solution of collagen type-I in 0.02 m acetic acid was brought to neutral pH by addition of the appropriate volume of phosphate buffer to obtain a final concentration of 300 μg/ml collagen, after which a trace amount of 125I-labeled collagen type-I was added to obtain a radioactivity of ∼1,500,000 cpm/ml. Immediately thereafter, each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate was coated with 350 μl of the tracer-containing collagen solution. The collagen was gelled by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h and allowed to dry in a flow hood. For rehydration, the dried gel was washed with three changes of water, after which the wells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 24 h. Phosphate-buffered saline was removed, and 1 × 105 cells were added to each well in a volume of 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, covering the bottom of the well. The cells were allowed to attach for 4 h, after which the medium was removed and replaced with 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, including 1 nm interleukin 1β and 10 nm tumor necrosis factor-α. After 5 days of cell culture, the conditioned medium from each well was collected. The media were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting or automated phosphorimaging analysis as described previously (17Engelholm L.H. List K. Netzel-Arnett S. Cukierman E. Mitola D.J. Aaronson H. Kjoller L. Larsen J.K. Yamada K.M. Strickland D.K. Holmbeck K. Dano K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After harvest of the media, the cells and residual matrix were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then detached by trypsinization, after which the matrix was stained with Coomassie Blue for visualization of zones of collagen clearance, as described before (7Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar).RESULTSuPARAP-dependent Internalization and Degradation of Collagen Fragments—Because the extracellular routes of collagen turnover are initiated by a well defined cleavage in the triple helical structure (41Highberger J.H. Corbett C. Gross J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we wanted to learn whether the same initial event might serve as a starting point for the endocytic collagen degradation route in fibroblasts. Consequently, we tested whether defined collagen fragments, resulting from treatment of native collagen with a mammalian collagenase, can serve as ligands for uPARAP-mediated internalization.Trypsin-resistant rat tail collagen type-I was treated with recombinant collagenase-3 (MMP-13) at 25 °C to obtain complete cleavage into ¼ and ¾ fragments (Fig. 1A), in accordance with the pattern known for the cleavage of native collagen (42Messent A.J. Tuckwell D.S. Knauper V. Humphries M.J. Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111 (Pt 8): 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Chung L. Dinakarpandian D. Yoshida N. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. Visse R. Nagase H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).For the subsequent internalization studies, the intact collagen and the collagen fragments were labeled with 125I (Fig. 1B). Analyses of uPARAP-mediated internalization were then undertaken, studying the endocytic activity of fibroblasts from newborn mice using radiolabeled collagen and collagen fragments as the ligands. This setup allowed studies on endocytosis in a system which, in the case of intact collagens, has been shown previously to be completely uPARAP-dependent (17Engelholm L.H. List K. Netzel-Arnett S. Cukierman E. Mitola D.J. Aaronson H. Kjoller L. Larsen J.K. Yamada K.M. Strickland D.K. Holmbeck K. Dano K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the use of parallel cultures of fibroblasts from wild-type and littermate control uPARAP-deficient mice (uPARAP-/-) enabled us to also test this uPARAP dependence for unknown samples, such as the collagen fragments.This study revealed that both the intact and the cleaved collagen are taken up by wild-type (uPARAP+/+) cells (Fig. 2A, black columns). Strikingly, however, the uptake of the cleaved protein (column 5) was much more efficient than the internalization of the untreated collagen (column 1). This increased efficiency was indeed the result of proteolytic cleavage, because preincubation of intact collagen at 25 °C without collagenase-3 did not affect the internalization (column 3). The uptake of both cleaved and uncleaved collagen was completely uPARAP-dependent, because fibroblasts from littermate uPARAP-/- mice displayed no internalization (gray columns). To ensure that the uptake of the collagen fragments was indeed part of a degradation pathway, we also studied the effect of blocking lysosomal cysteine proteases in the fibroblasts. To this end, a similar experiment was set up with the inclusion of E-64d (Fig. 2B), an inhibitor that has been shown previously to block lysosomal degradation of internalized collagen-IV (28Kjoller L. Engelholm L.H. Hoyer-Hansen M. Dano K. Bugge T.H. Behrendt N. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Comparison of parallel samples obtained in the absence and presence of E-64d revealed that the blocking of intracellular degradation led to a marked increase in intracellular radioactivity in the uPARAP+/+ cells (Fig. 2B, black columns). Whereas this was the case both for intact collagen (columns 1 and 3) and cleaved collagen (columns 5 and 7), the amount of collagen fragments accumulated in the cells was much larger than the amount of intact collagen, also in the presence of the inhibitor. The presence of E-64d did not affect collagen uptake in uPARAP-/- cells (gray columns).FIGURE 2uPARAP-dependent internalization of labeled collagen and collagen fragments. A, increased uptake after cleavage. 125I-Labeled untreated, mock incubated, or cleaved collagen type-I (30 ng/well) was added to fibroblast cultures derived from wild-type (uPARAP-expressing) mice (+/+, black columns) or from littermate mice with homozygous uPARAP deficiency (-/-, gray columns). After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the intracellular fraction of each cell sample was isolated and the amount of internalized labeled protein was determined by gamma counting. All samples were analyzed in triplicate. The data are represented as the internalized fraction of the added radioactivity; note that the same amount of protein material was added to all samples. Error bars indicate standard deviations. B, internalized collagen fragments are routed to intracellular degradation. Fibroblast cultures were incubated with 125I-labeled intact or cleaved collagen type-I as in A, except that incubation was performed in the absence or presence of 20 μm E-64d, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To enable the visualization of the collagen fragments after endocytosis, FITC-labeled collagen type-I was treated with collagenase-3, leading to complete cleavage into fluorescent products with an electrophoretic migration pattern indistinguishable from that obtained with unlabeled collagen (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). The fluorescent fragments, as well as FITC-labeled intact collagen, were added to live fibroblasts from wild-type mice or littermate uPARAP-deficient mice, after which endocytosis was allowed to proceed in the presence of E-64d (Fig. 3). Examining the wild-type cells by fluorescence microscopy after 22 h of endocytosis, a strong fluorescence was observed in intracellular vesicles in the cells incubated with the cleaved FITC-collagen (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2136407975,"Imitative learning has received great attention due to its supposed role in the development of culture and the cognitive demands it poses on the individual. Evidence for imitation in non-human primate species, therefore, could shed light on the early origins of proto-cultural traits in the primate order. Imitation has been defined as the learning of an act by seeing it done or, more specifically, as the copying of a novel or otherwise improbable act. But despite a century of research and the detection of mirror neurons the empirical basis for this most advanced form of observational learning is weak. Few, if any, studies have shown that the observer has learned the response topography, i.e., the specific action by which the response is made. In an experimental set-up we confronted marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) with a conspecific model that was previously trained to open a plastic box in a peculiar way. Employing detailed motion analyses we show that the observers precisely copied the movement patterns of the novel action demonstrated by the model. A discriminant analysis classified 13 out of 14 observer movements (92.86%) as model movements and only one as non-observer movement. This evidence of imitation in non-human primates questions the dominant opinion that imitation is a human-specific ability. Furthermore, the high matching degree suggests that marmosets possess the neuronal mechanism to code the actions of others and to map them onto their own motor repertoire, rather than priming existing motor-templates."
https://openalex.org/W2152994370,"Concerns about possible undesired environmental effects of transgenic crops have prompted numerous evaluations of such crops. So-called Bt crops receive particular attention because they carry bacteria-derived genes coding for insecticidal proteins that might negatively affect non-target arthropods. Here we show a remarkable positive effect of Bt maize on the performance of the corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis, which in turn enhanced the performance of parasitic wasps that feed on aphid honeydew. Within five out of six pairs that were evaluated, transgenic maize lines were significantly more susceptible to aphids than their near-isogenic equivalents, with the remaining pair being equally susceptible. The aphids feed from the phloem sieve element content and analyses of this sap in selected maize lines revealed marginally, but significantly higher amino acid levels in Bt maize, which might partially explain the observed increased aphid performance. Larger colony densities of aphids on Bt plants resulted in an increased production of honeydew that can be used as food by beneficial insects. Indeed, Cotesia marginiventris, a parasitoid of lepidopteran pests, lived longer and parasitized more pest caterpillars in the presence of aphid-infested Bt maize than in the presence of aphid-infested isogenic maize. Hence, depending on aphid pest thresholds, the observed increased susceptibility of Bt maize to aphids may be either a welcome or an undesirable side effect."
https://openalex.org/W2022668043,"Although principally produced by the pancreas to degrade dietary proteins in the intestine, trypsins are also expressed in the nervous system and in epithelial tissues, where they have diverse actions that could be mediated by protease-activated receptors (PARs). We examined the biological actions of human trypsin IV (or mesotrypsin) and rat p23, inhibitor-resistant forms of trypsin. The zymogens trypsinogen IV and pro-p23 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Enteropeptidase cleaved both zymogens, liberating active trypsin IV and p23, which were resistant to soybean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin. Trypsin IV cleaved N-terminal fragments of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 at sites that would expose the tethered ligand (PAR1 = PAR4 > PAR2). Trypsin IV increased [Ca2+]i in transfected cells expressing human PAR1 and PAR2 with similar potencies (PAR1, 0.5 μm; PAR2, 0.6 μm). p23 also cleaved fragments of PAR1 and PAR2 and signaled to cells expressing these receptors. Trypsin IV and p23 increased [Ca2+]i in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons that responded to capsaicin and which thus mediate neurogenic inflammation and nociception. Intraplantar injection of trypsin IV and p23 in mice induced edema and granulocyte infiltration, which were not observed in PAR –/–1(trypsin IV) and PAR –/–2 (trypsin IV and p23) mice. Trypsin IV and p23 caused thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia in mice, and these effects were absent in PAR –/–2 mice but maintained in PAR –/–1 mice. Thus, trypsin IV and p23 are inhibitor-resistant trypsins that can cleave and activate PARs, causing PAR1- and PAR2-dependent inflammation and PAR2-dependent hyperalgesia.

Trypsinogens are a diverse gene family with considerable interspecies variability. In humans, three serine protease (PRSS) genes encode trypsinogens: PRSS1 encodes trypsinogen I (cationic trypsin), PRSS2 encodes trypsinogen II (anionic trypsin), and PRSS3 encodes mesotrypsinogen (1Emi M. Nakamura Y. Ogawa M. Yamamoto T. Nishide T. Mori T. Matsubara K. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Nyaruhucha C.N. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol.

Muller-Hill B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequences of mesotrypsinogen and trypsinogen IV are dissimilar, because they derive from different exons, but the predicted activated C-terminal proteases, mesotrypsin and trypsin IV, are identical (3Wiegand U. Corbach S. Minn A. Kang J. Muller-Hill B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Toth M. J. Biol.

In rats, there are two forms of anionic trypsinogen, and one cationic trypsinogen. p23 trypsinogen, like mesotrypsinogen, is a minor form within the pancreas (5Schick J. Kern H. Scheele G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1569-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The PRSS1 and PRSS2 gene products are major digestive enzymes. Trypsinogens I and II and small quantities of mesotrypsinogen are secreted from pancreatic acinar cells into the intestinal lumen, where enteropeptidase (enterokinase, PRSS7) cleaves these zymogens to generate active proteases that participate in digestion (6Kunitz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1939; 22: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Yamashina I. Acta Chem. Scand. 1956; 10: 739-743Crossref Google Scholar). Although PRSS3 evolved late in history, by inter-chromosomal duplication that occurred after the divergence of Old World monkeys and hominids, and was maintained as an active entity (8Rowen L. Williams E. Glusman G. Linardopoulou E. Friedman C. Ahearn M.E. Seto J. Boysen C. Qin S. Wang K. Kaur A. Bloom S. Hood L. Trask B.J. Mol. Biol.

Trypsinogen IV is expressed by neurons and glial cells, mainly astrocytes, of human brain and spinal cord, as well as by epithelial cells of the human intestine, airway, and prostate, which also express enteropeptidase (3Wiegand U.

Res. 2007; 32: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of this widely expressed protease are unknown. Trypsinogen IV has an unconventional translation initiation site at a CUG codon, with an N-terminal leucine rather than a methionine, and the N terminus may serve to regulate protein expression (13Nemeth A.L. Medveczky P. Toth J. Siklodi E. Schlett K. Patthy A. Palkovits M. Ovadi J. Tokesi N. Nemeth P. Szilagyi L. Graf L. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Trypsinogen IV lacks a discernable signal peptide, and it is not known whether the enzyme is secreted and activated. However, immunoreactive trypsinogen IV has been detected in extracellular matrix of human brain, supporting the possibility of secretion at certain sites (12Toth J. Siklodi E. Medveczky P. Gallatz K. Nemeth P. Szilagyi L. Graf L. Palkovits M. Neurochem. Res. 2007; 32: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the physiological functions of trypsin IV/mesotrypsin and p23 remain to be discovered, several unusual features of these enzymes suggest important biological actions. Trypsin IV/mesotrypsin is resistant to polypeptide inhibitors, such as pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), 3The abbreviations used are: SBTIsoybean trypsin inhibitorPARprotease-activated receptorDRGdorsal root gangliaMPOmyeloperoxidaseAPactivating peptideChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidhhumanrratKNRKrat kidney epithelial cellpNAp-nitroanilide.3The abbreviations used are: SBTIsoybean trypsin inhibitorPARprotease-activated receptorDRGdorsal root gangliaMPOmyeloperoxidaseAPactivating peptideChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidhhumanrratKNRKrat kidney epithelial cellpNAp-nitroanilide. and can degrade these inhibitors (2Nyaruhucha C.N.

Thus, whereas endogenous inhibitors regulate trypsins I and II, trypsin IV/mesotrypsin may remain active in tissues for prolonged periods. p23 is also more resistant to these inhibitors than rat anionic trypsin (15Fukuoka S. Nyaruhucha C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1588: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B, which prematurely activates trypsinogens in acinar cells to initiate pancreatitis, preferentially activates mesotrypsinogen over trypsinogen I and II, suggesting a role for trypsin IV/mesotrypsin in pancreatic disease (4Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Toth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48580-48589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). p23 is also up-regulated in the inflamed rat pancreas (5Schick J. Kern H. Scheele G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1569-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PRSS3 is up-regulated in metastatic non-small cell lung cancers (16Diederichs S. Bulk E. Steffen B.

Overexpression of trypsinogen IV in neurons of the mouse brain results in a remarkable overexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes, suggesting a role for trypsin IV in astrocyte proliferation (19Minn A. Schubert M. Neiss W.F. Muller-Hill B. Glia. 1998; 22: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Trypsin IV also degrades myelin basic protein, the autoantigen of multiple sclerosis, suggesting an involvement in human disease (20Medveczky P. Antal J. Patthy A. Kekesi K. Juhasz G. Szilagyi L. Graf L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, trypsin IV/mesotrypsin and p23 are up-regulated and prematurely activated during inflammation and in tumors, where the sustained, inhibitor-resistant activity of these proteases could contribute to inflammation, tumor formation, and disease progression by mechanisms that remain to be discovered. soybean trypsin inhibitor protease-activated receptor dorsal root ganglia myeloperoxidase activating peptide 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid human rat rat kidney epithelial cell p-nitroanilide. soybean trypsin inhibitor protease-activated receptor dorsal root ganglia myeloperoxidase activating peptide 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid human rat rat kidney epithelial cell p-nitroanilide. Certain serine proteases regulate cells by cleaving protease-activated receptors (PARs), a family of four G-protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref. 21Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). PARs are widely expressed and regulate the critically important processes of hemostasis, angiogenesis, inflammation, pain, and repair in many tissues (21Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of great interest to identify and characterize the proteases that can activate these receptors. Trypsin I and II potently activate PAR2 (22Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 23Bohm S.K.

Impure preparations of trypsin IV activate human PAR2 and PAR4 in transfected cell lines (10Cottrell G.S. Amadesi S. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13532-13539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, whereas trypsin I and II signal to human epithelial cell lines expressing PAR1 and PAR2, mesotrypsin is inactive (30Grishina Z. Ostrowska E. Halangk W. Sahin-Toth M. Reiser G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, mesotrypsin signals to rat brain astrocytes by cleaving PAR1 but not PAR2 (31Wang Y. Luo W. Wartmann T. Halangk W. Sahin-Toth M. Reiser G. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the capacity of trypsin IV/mesotrypsin to activate PARs depends on the preparation of proteases, the cell type, and the species. To our knowledge, the effects of trypsin IV/mesotrypsin have not been examined in intact tissues, and it is not known if p23 activates PARs. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether trypsin IV and p23 cleave and activate PAR1 and PAR2. To do so, we examined the ability of recombinant proteases to cleave synthetic peptides corresponding to extracellular, N-terminal domains of PAR1 and PAR2, and to activate the receptors in transfected cells. Trypsin IV and p23 are activated and up-regulated during inflammation (4Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Toth M. J. Biol.

Therefore, we also determined whether trypsin IV and p23 can signal to primary spinal afferent neurons isolated from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by activating PAR1 and PAR2. By administering these proteases to wild-type and PAR-deficient mice, we determined whether they cause inflammation and hyperalgesia by activating PAR1 and PAR2.

Human pancreatic trypsin I was from Sigma. Trypsinogen IV and p23 Expression Vectors—We generated vectors for expressing trypsinogen IV and pro-p23 in Escherichia coli as N-terminally truncated and His-tagged fusion proteins, which would facilitate purification of the zymogens by immobilized-metal ion-affinity chromatography. To generate the trypsinogen IV expression vector, an Image expressed sequence tag clone (accession number BC030238, clone ID 4537998) was obtained from Invitrogen. The open reading frame for the catalytic domain and a part of the propeptide of trypsinogen IV was amplified by PCR using the overlapping forward primers (5′ to 3′): GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATAACCATG and CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATAACCATGcatcaccatcaccatcaccatcacgtcccctttgacgatgatgacaagattg; and the reverse primer: GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAgctgttggcagcgatggtgtccttaatcc. This also introduced an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pDONR201 using GatewayTM Technology (Invitrogen), forming the plasmid pAM1265. The Gateway-adapted vector pT7#3.3GW (pZen2314, AstraZeneca) was used as the destination vector, and the open reading frame of pAM1265 was transferred into pZen2314 with a LR reaction (Invitrogen), forming the plasmid pAM1270. To generate an expression vector for pro-p23, cDNA for rat prepro-p23 (preprotrypsinogen p23, accession number X15679) was obtained using synthesized primers and rapid gene construction technology (Cytomyx Ltd., Cambridge, England) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.0 (EcoRI/NotI). The open reading frame for the catalytic domain and a part of the propeptide of prepro-p23 was amplified by PCR using the overlapping forward primers (5′ to 3′): GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATAACCATG, CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATAACCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACGTCCCCTTTGACGATGATGAC, and CACGTCCCCTTTGACGATGATGACAAGATTGTTGGAGGCTACAC; and the reverse primer: GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAGTTGTTCGCCATAGTCTCCTGAATCCAGCTCAGG. This also introduced an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag. The PCR fragment was subcloned, and an expression vector, pAM1579, was generated as described for trypsinogen IV. Expression and Purification of Trypsinogen IV and Pro-p23—BL21 Star cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pAM1270 or pAM1579. Cells were grown in LB medium containing 12 μg/ml tetracycline and induced with 100 μm isopropyl-βd-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4.5 h at 37 °C. The cell pellet from 1 liter of medium was resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 0.8% Chaps, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 units/ml benzonase), stirred (10 min, room temperature), frozen at –80 °C for >30 min, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min). The pellet was dissolved in buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8), stirred (1 h, room temperature), and centrifuged. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid fast-flow resin column (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer C (buffer B, pH 6.3), 2.5 volumes of buffer D (buffer B, pH 5.9), and the zymogens were eluted with buffer E (buffer B, pH 4.5). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–12% Bis-Tris Gel, NuPAGE System, Invitrogen), and proteins were identified by Coomassie staining. Fractions containing trypsinogen IV or pro-p23 fractions were pooled, and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Refolding of Trypsinogen IV and Pro-p23—Buffer exchange into 6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA, 30 mm dithiothreitol was accomplished with a PD10 chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The final concentration of trypsinogen IV or pro-p23 was adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and samples were reduced by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were diluted 30-fold with refolding buffer (0.9 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm l-cysteine, 1 mm l-cystine) and stirred (overnight, 4 °C). Samples were dialyzed against 2.5 mm HCl, the dialysate was centrifuged (10,000 g, 30 min), and the supernatant was concentrated with Spin Concentrators (Millipore, Billerica, MA, molecular mass cut-off, 5 kDa). The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (1 mg/ml equals an A280 nm of 1.512 for trypsinogen IV and 1.28 for pro-p23). Enteropeptidase Activation of Trypsinogen IV and Pro-p23 and Purification of Trypsin IV and p23—Trypsinogen IV and Pro-p23 (1 mg) were activated with 40–50 units/ml of EKmax enteropeptidase according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Buffer exchange into MES-buffer 1 (50 mm MES, pH 6, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v)) was accomplished with PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Trypsin IV and p23 were purified by ion exchange chromatography using a SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteases were loaded onto the column that was equilibrated in MES-buffer 1. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of MES-buffer 1, and trypsin IV and p23 were eluted using a linear gradient up to 1 m NaCl in MES-buffer 1. Fractions containing active trypsin IV and p23 were pooled, concentrated using spin concentrators, and buffer was exchanged to 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (1 mg/ml equals an A280 nm of 1.6 for trypsin IV and 1.4 for p23). N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—Samples were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), stained with Amido Black, and N-terminal residues were sequenced (Applied Biosystems Procise 494, Foster City, CA), using Procise2.1 and SequencePro 2.1 software. Trypsin IV and p23 Activity Assays—Protease activity was measured using tosyl-GPR-pNA or tosyl-GPK-pNA as substrates (Sigma, 150 μm substrate, 100 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 8, 25 °C). The change in absorbance at 405 nm was determined over time. 1 unit is defined as the enzymatic activity converting 1 μmol of substrate per minute (ϵ = 9920 m–1 cm–1). On average, the maximum specific activity of trypsin IV used for our work was ∼100 units/mg, using tosyl-GPR-pNA as substrate (supplemental Table S1). To assess the susceptibility to inhibitors, enzymes were preincubated for 5 min with aprotinin, SBTI, benzamidine, p-aminobenzamidine (all from Sigma) or nafamostat (FUT-175, Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Canada) before addition of the substrate. Cleavage of PAR-derived Peptides—The following peptides corresponding to extracellular N-terminal domains of human (h) and rat (r) PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 were from the Faculty Peptide Synthesis Facility at the University of Calgary (tethered ligand activating sequences underlined): hPAR1: NATLDPRSFLLRNPNDKYE; hPAR2: N-acetyl-GTNRSSKGRSLIGKVDGTSHVTGKGVT-amide; hPAR4: GDDSTPSILPAPRGYPGQV; rPAR2: GPNSKGRSLIGRLDTP-YGGC (non-PAR2 residues, YGGC, added for affinity-column coupling). Peptides (100 μm final) were incubated with trypsin I (1 or 5 units/ml corresponding to 2 or 10 nm), trypsin IV (30 or 360 nm), or p23 (3.8 nm) for 0–30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Samples were fractionated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and eluted peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry (41Oikonomopoulou K. Hansen K.K. Saifeddine M. Tea I.

https://openalex.org/W2056398216,"The pattern recognition receptor CD36 initiates a signaling cascade that promotes microglial activation and recruitment to β-amyloid deposits in the brain. In the present study we identify the focal adhesion-associated proteins p130Cas, Pyk2, and paxillin as novel members of the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway downstream of CD36 and show that assembly of this complex is essential for microglial migration. In primary microglia and macrophages exposed to β-amyloid, the scaffolding protein p130Cas is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and co-localizes with CD36 to membrane ruffles contemporaneous with F-actin polymerization. These β-amyloid-stimulated events are not detected in CD36 null cells and are dependent on CD36 activation of Src family tyrosine kinases. Fyn, a Src kinase known to interact with CD36, co-precipitates with p130Cas and is an essential upstream intermediate in the signaling pathways leading to phosphorylation of the p130Cas substrate domain. Furthermore, the p130Cas-interacting kinase Pyk2 and the cytoskeletal adapter protein paxillin also demonstrate CD36-dependent phosphorylation, identifying these focal adhesion molecules as additional members of this β-amyloid signaling cascade. Disruption of this p130Cas complex by small interfering RNA silencing inhibits p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and microglial migration, illustrating the importance of this pathway in microglial activation and recruitment. Together, these data are the first to identify the signaling cascade that directly links CD36 to the actin cytoskeleton and, thus, implicates it in diverse processes such as cellular migration, adhesion, and phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1974067623,"Little is known about the role of specific base modifications of transfer RNAs. Wyosine bases are tRNAPhe-specific modifications that are distinguished by differentiated, lateral side chains and base methylations appended to the core ring structure of a universally conserved G37, adjacent to the anticodon of Phe tRNAs. Based on previous data, we hypothesized that this modification was needed for –1 frameshifting. Using a reporter system incorporating a SCV-LA yeast virus slippery site for detecting –1 frameshifts in vivo, yeast strains were created that enabled chemical-genetic dissection of the role of different functional groups of wyebutosine that are added in a three-step post-transcriptional set of reactions. With this system, hypomodification increased Phe-specific frameshifting, with incremental changes in frameshift efficiency after specific intermediates in the progression of wyebutosine synthesis. These data combined with investigations of wild-type and hypomodified tRNA binding to ribosomes suggest that frameshift efficiency is kinetically and not thermodynamically controlled. The progressive nature of frameshift efficiency with the stage of modification is consistent with a stepwise evolution and tuning of frameshift potential. The stepwise tuning of frameshift efficiency could explain why tRNAPhe in some eukaryotes is not fully modified but, rather, hypomodified to capture a specific frameshift potential.

Many viruses (e.g. retroviruses and totiviruses) rely on programmed –1 frameshifting to allow translation of multiple proteins or protein variants from a single promoter (24Jacks T.

For such organisms the efficiency of frameshifting is critical because it determines the ratio of structural and catalytic proteins and, therefore, controls viral propagation. For example, a small (2-fold) change in –1 frameshifting frequency completely eradicated the SCV-LA virus from S. cerevisiae (28Meskauskas A. Harger J.W. Jacobs K.L. Dinman J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the perspective of this previous work, we set out to explore the potential role of the wyebutosine base modification in –1 frameshifting. Because yW is synthesized through a multistep pathway, our interest was drawn to the question of how the potential for frameshifting might also be built up step-by-step. Thus, the significance of yW modification substructures of yeast tRNAPhe to –1 frameshifting, its frequency, and its specificity were investigated by structural ablation using a series of characterized yeast knock-out strains that are blocked at specific, successive steps of wyebutosine synthesis. tRNA Strains—Wild-type and deletion strains (ΔYPL207w and ΔYML005w) of S. cerevisiae were purchased from Open Biosystems. All three strains were of the MATα leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 genotype. Genes ΔYPL207w and ΔYML005w were renamed as TYW1 and TYW2, respectively (9Noma A. Kirino Y. Ikeuchi Y. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The YPL207w and ΔYML005w open reading frames were substituted with a KanR cassette (Table 1).TABLE 1Isogenic S. cerevisiae strains producing tRNAPhe with specific structural variants of G37StrainGenotypePhenotype (tRNAPhe at position 37)Wild typematαWyebutosine (yW)ΔTYW1 (ΔYPL207w)matα, TYW1ΔKanRN1-methylguanosine (m1G)ΔTYW2 (ΔYML005w)matα, TYW2ΔKanR4-demethylwyosine (imG14) Open table in a new tab Each deletion strain is blocked at separate, successive steps of wyebutosine biosynthesis (see Fig. 1B), and therefore, it produces tRNAPhe pools that are homogeneously under-modified at position 37. Composition analysis of tRNAPhe from S. cerevisiae ΔTYW1 strain by tandem liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy revealed the presence of the first wyebutosine precursor, 1-methylguanosine (m1G, see Fig. 1), at position 37 of tRNAPhe (2Waas W.F. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37616-37622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An analogous study of ΔTYW2 (ΔYML005w) strain demonstrated accumulation of imG14 precursor in tRNAPhe (29Kalhor H.R. Penjwini M. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell growth of each deletion and wild-type strains was measured in rich YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract and 2% glucose). Neither strain showed a detectable defect in rate or yield relative to the parent wild-type strain that might hinder consequent in vivo studies. –1 PRF Reporter Constructs—Dual-luciferase reporter construct pJD511 containing ADH1 promoter, lucR, an ∼200 base sequence from SCV-LA virus, lucF and CYC1 terminator was a generous gift of J. D. Dinman (University of Maryland) (30Harger J.W. Dinman J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The slippery sequence variants (pSCV-I–pSCV-VI) of the SCV-LA-derived bicistronic reporter were produced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange) of pJD511 plasmid. 0-frame control plasmid contained polylinker sequence only (no frame-shifting sequence) and firefly luciferase is in the same reading frame as Renilla luciferase, producing both proteins. Plasmid sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing. Plasmids were first introduced into S. cerevisiae by chemical transformation using standard protocols. Transformants were isolated on media lacking leucine (0.067% Leu(–) DO supplement (BD Biosciences), 0.67% nitrogenous base (Sigma), 2% glucose); pSCV restored leucine biosynthesis. Dual-luciferase Assays—Yeast strains (wt, ΔTYW1, ΔTYW2) harboring reporter constructs were grown in Leu(–) dropout media (2 ml) for 7 h at 30 °C after a 1:5 dilution of overnight culture. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 500 μl of ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (containing protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science), centrifuged again for 10 min at 15700 × g, and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. Cells were lysed with 100 μl of glass beads (Sigma, 425–600 μm, prewashed in phosphate-buffered saline) in a Vortex mixer at 4 °C 5 times 2 min each. Lysates were clarified by centrifuging for 10 min, and total protein concentration was determined by Bradford method. Preparation routinely produced 0.1–1.0 mg/ml protein. Activities of expressed Renilla and Firefly luciferases were determined in a luminometer (MicroLumant LB 96P) with 20 μl of cell lysate using the Dual-Luciferase® assay system reagents (Promega E1910) following manufacturer's protocol. Each strain was assayed in seven replicates. Raw luminescence data were converted to a lucF/lucR ratio for each sample. This ratio was then normalized to the strain-specific 0-frame control and multiplied by 100% to obtain frameshift efficiencies for each recoding signal. By virtue of this manipulation, frameshifting is 100% for control plasmids, although strain variation is not large. tRNA Preparation and Purification—Bulk tRNA containing tRNAPhe structural variants was isolated from yeast strains (wt, ΔTYW1, ΔTYW2). Bulk tRNA purification and fractionation and purification of aminoacylated Phe-tRNAPhe structural variants were as described in Waas et al. (2Waas W.F. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37616-37622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified bulk tRNA containing wt or hypomodified tRNAPhe was fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC (Vydac C4 semi-preparative HPLC column, Deerfield, IL). Fractions enriched for tRNAPhe were aminoacylated with [3H]phenylalanine using yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. Aminoacylated [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe variants were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described (2Waas W.F. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37616-37622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because the retention times of Phe-tRNAPhe and deacylated tRNAPhe are grossly different, the resulting Phe-tRNAPhe pool was free of deacylated tRNA contamination. Using this procedure we obtained Phe-tRNAPhe structural variants with amino acid acceptances that were higher than 1800 pmol/A260 (2Waas W.F. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37616-37622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The uniformity of purified tRNAPhe structural variants was additionally confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (2Waas W.F. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

All three structural variant were aminoacylated simultaneously with the same batch of [3H]Phe, and the charged tRNAs were purified under identical conditions. We demonstrated that no less than 95% of detected [3H]Phe was linked to tRNA. Specific activities of the three [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe variants were uniform and equal to 1.32 × 104 cpm/pmol. The procedure for N-acetylation of Phe-tRNAPhe to prepare P-site substrate NAc-Phe-tRNAPhe was performed similar to previously described (31De Pereda J.M. Waas W.F. Jan Y. Ruoslahti E. Schimmel P.

Ribosome Purification—80 S ribosomes were purified from commercially available S. cerevisiae strain (INVSc1, Invitrogen) as described in Algire et al. (32Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G.

Yeast cells, resuspended in 30 ml of low salt buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mg/ml heparin, 1 mini-EDTA free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)), were lysed with 425–600-μm glass beads using Bead-Beater (Biospec) in 3 pulses of 3 min each at 4 °C. Cells were spun for 30 min at 50,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again. KCl was added to the supernatant to the final concentration of 500 mm and centrifuged again for 4 h at 50,000 × g. Ribosome pellets were resuspended in 6 ml of high salt buffer (500 mm KCl, 100 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mg/ml heparin, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Puromycin and GTP were added to the final concentration of 1 mm each, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min. Ribosome mixture was layered on top of 3 ml of sucrose cushion (500 mm KCl, 100 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 m sucrose) and centrifuged overnight at 152,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in ribosome storage buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA), separated into aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in –80 °C. The concentration of 80 S ribosomes was calculated based on the assumption that 1 A260 = 20 pmol (80 S extinction coefficient at 260 nm is 5 × 107 cm–1m–1) (32Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G.

Acid Treatment of [3H]AcPhe-tRNAPhe—To remove wyebutosine modification of position 37 of tRNAPhe, wt [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe and [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe (m1G-37) were treated with mild acid as previously described (12Thiebe R. Zachau H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, aminoacylated tRNA was incubated in 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 2.9, for 3 h at 37°C. tRNA was exchanged into 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, and concentrated using Microcon YM10 filters (Millipore). Millipore Filter Binding Assay: Saturation Experiments with [14C]NAcPhe-tRNAPhe—0.8 μm 80 S was incubated with 0.8 mg/ml poly(U) RNA (Sigma) in binding buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 0.05 mm spermine, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 37 °C followed by 20 min of incubation on ice. 2.5-μl aliquots were taken into separate tubes, and 7.5 μl of an increased concentration [14C]NAc-Phe-tRNAPhe was added (to reach molar ratios of 0.5–10 tRNA to 80 S). The incubation was continued for 20 min at 37 °C. Tubes were transferred onto ice, and tRNA binding was determined by a filter -binding assay. Each sample was diluted to 100 μl with binding buffer and immediately applied onto a presoaked 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore); filters were washed 3 times with 500–750 μl of binding buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml total yeast RNA (to decrease nonspecific binding of tRNA to filters). Values were corrected for control samples lacking ribosomes, which were typically 1–4% of applied labeled tRNA. Filters were air-dried, placed into a scintillation vial, treated with 100 μl of 0.1 m NaOH to release Phe of tRNA (to reduce quenching), and counted in a scintillation counter using EcoLite scintillant (ICN). A-site tRNA Binding—80 S yeast ribosomes were preincubated with poly(U) mRNA in 140–150 μl of binding buffer for 20 min at 37 °C. 10–20 μl of P-site substrate N-AcPhe-tRNAPhe in the same buffer was added, giving a final concentration of 60 nm 80 S, 0.4 mg/ml poly(U), 75 nmN-AcPhe-tRNAPhe. The incubation was continued for 20 min at 37 °C and 20 min on ice. For the alternative A-site complex (see “Results”), 0.1 μm mRNA with sequence AUG UUU ACG AUU AUU AUU AUU (synthesized by IDT technologies) and 0.1 μmEscherichia coli tRNAMetf as P-site substrate were used (purchased from Chemical Block, Russia). After incubation, 5-μl aliquots of P-site tRNA-80 S complex were transferred into separate tubes and mixed with 5 μl of increasing concentration of [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe to titrate ribosomal A-site. The complexes were incubated an additional 20 min at 37 °C, transferred to ice, and filtered as described above. Experimental Strategy—In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the hypermodified wyebutosine is synthesized through post-transcriptional, sequential action of at least five enzymes, designated as TRM5p and TYW1p to TYW4p (Fig. 1B) (9Noma A. Kirino Y. Ikeuchi Y. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The disruption of TYW1 results in production of m1G37, a hypomodified tRNAPhe lacking both yW side chains and the core tricyclic ring structure (it is specifically m1G37 tRNAPhe that has been identified in certain mammalian tumor cell lines (11Smith D.W. McNamara A.L. Mushinski J.F. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 147-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kuchino Y. Borek E. Grunberger D. Mushinski J.F. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6421-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). After conversion of G37 to m1G by TRM5p, the next enzyme, TYW1p, converts m1G to 9H-imidazo[1,2-α]purin-9-one, 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3-β-d-ribofuranosyl (4-demethylwyosine, imG14). The actions of TYW2p, -3p, and -4p then alter imG14 to yW through reactions whose details are not fully understood. Thus, a ΔTYW2 strain produces tRNAPhe with a tricyclic, archaeal-like (wyosine-family bases at position 37 of tRNAPhe are also seen in Archaea) form of wyosine that lacks the typical side chains of yW, i.e. 4-demethylwyosine-37 (imG14-37). Our goal was to work with yeast strains in which one of the genes needed for yW synthesis was knocked out, so that a specific intermediate, like m1G37 or imG14-37, would build up. We could then test that tRNA, with a specific hypomodification at position 37, for its activity in programmed ribosomal frameshifting. For these investigations isogenic yeast strains were selected that were proven to accumulate the specific hypomodified tRNAPhe (Table 1). Taking advantage of previous work and strain constructions, the common genetic background for the “wild-type” and deletion strains was MAT α leu2Δ0 met15Δ 0 ura3Δ 0 (2Waas W.F. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37616-37622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar strains encoding the ΔTYW1 and, separately, the ΔTYW2 alleles, were viable and, as demonstrated previously by mass spectrometry, produced tRNAPhe with m1G and imG14, respectively, at position 37 (2Waas W.F. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37616-37622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Kalhor H.R. Penjwini M. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A strain carrying a ΔTRM5 allele was also considered, but its viability was marginal. More importantly, the m1G37 methyltransferase is not pathway-specific (a ΔTRM5-bearing strain encodes other hypomodified tRNAs (for example, Arg-, Leu-, and Pro-specific tRNAs) in addition to hypomodified tRNAPhe (35Bjork G.R. Jacobsson K. Nilsson K. Johansson M.J. Bystrom A.S. Persson O.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar)). Disruption of the TYW1 and TYW2 gene products, which are pathway-specific, thus provides an important simplification for interpretation of any data generated in vivo. With all these considerations in mind, three different species of tRNAPhe (wild-type, m1G, and imG14) were used for investigations of frameshifting in vivo. Experimental Rationale for Use of Yeast Double-stranded RNA Virus as Part of the Reporter System—Our reporter constructs were developed to mimic viral frameshifting in which “–1” (or –1 PRF) is most common. In viruses, programmed –1 ribosomal frameshifting redirects translating ribosomes into a new reading frame, thus bypassing an in-frame stop codon and continuing synthesis of an extended protein. As a consequence, frameshifting allows for expression of two polypeptide chains from a single mRNA at a ratio specified by the primary sequence of the viral gene as well as by the predisposition of the host for frameshifting. We noted that many laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae carry a double-stranded RNA virus known as SCV-LA. The viral genome codes for a capsid polypeptide (cap) and cap-RNA polymerase fusion (cap-pol) that is produced as a result of –1 PRF (36Dinman J.D. Icho T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 37Lopinski J.D. Dinman J.D. Bruenn J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 38Icho T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal for frameshifting is provided by an ∼200-base sequence between cap and pol genes. Contained within this sequence are three elements that are each required for –1 PRF, a heptameric slippery site, a linker region, and a secondary structure element (36Dinman J.D. Icho T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 39Tzeng T.H. Tu C.L. Bruenn J.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In SCV-LA virus, similarly to other viruses (including retroviruses), efficiency of –1 PRF is crucial because it determines the ratio of structural and enzymatic proteins. Growing evidence suggests that modulation of frameshift efficiency can reduce viral infectivity and have a dramatic effect on virus propagation and viability (25Brierley I. Dos Ramos F.J. Virus Res. 2006; 119: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3669-3676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hung M. Patel P. Davis S. Green S.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For our experiments the functional –1 PRF unit from SCV-LA virus was transplanted into a bicistronic LucF/LucR reporter system (see below) (Fig. 2). In yeast that harbors SCV-LA, a specific UUA-reading tRNALeu slips one nucleotide from UUA to insert leucine at a UUU (codes for Phe) codon. This construction allowed the inherent frameshifting frequency to be determined in detail (30Harger J.W. Dinman J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When placed in the wild-type or ΔTYW1 and ΔTYW2 genetic backgrounds, the reporter system enabled us to analyze in vivo relationship between the discrete (but substantial) modification state of tRNAPhe and –1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting efficiency in a codon-specific manner. The dependence of frameshifting on the slippery sequence context could also be studied by incorporating several variants of the SCV-LA heptameric frameshift element into our test system. For these purposes, we changed the “pre-slippage” UUA codon to either UUU or UUC (codons for Phe) so as to specifically position tRNAPhe in the ribosomal A-site (Fig. 2). Combining Yeast RNA Virus Construct with a Dual Luciferase Reporter System—To have a direct visual readout, we used a dual luciferase reporter system developed by Dinman and co-workers (30Harger J.W. Dinman J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 42Plant E.P. Dinman J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The construct specifies synthesis of two reporters that are driven by an ADH1 promoter. The two reporters are Renilla luciferase (encoded by lucR) and firefly luciferase (encoded by lucF). As shown in Fig. 2, viral coding sequences for the cap and pol proteins were replaced, respectively, with the coding sequences for lucR and lucF. Thus, the SCV-LA sequence that promotes frameshifting was placed between the coding sequences for the two luciferases. This arrangement promoted constitutive expression of lucR, whereas the production of lucF depended on frameshifting at the SCV-LA intervening sequence. Therefore, a –1 frameshift produced a protein harboring both Firefly and Renilla luciferases connected by a small peptide linker. A construction encoding a 0-frame control was also assembled.

All five members of the WASP family of proteins contain a conserved C terminus verprolin (V), cofilin (C), and acidic (A) region (VCA domain), which binds to the Arp2/3 complex and stimulates its actin polymerization activity (5Sossey-Alaoui K. Head K. Nowak N. Cowell J.K. Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The regulation of the activity of both WASP and N-WASP is thought to be achieved by their inclusion in inactive conformations through intramolecular interaction between the GTPase-binding domain and the VCA region (2Miki H.

Zhang J. Badour K. Arpaia E. Freeman S. Cheung P. Siu M. Siminovitch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1098-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined whether the activity of WAVE3 is regulated at the phosphorylation level downstream of c-Abl tyrosine kinase. We show that phosphorylation of WAVE3 is stimulated upon treatment with PDGF, and that both WAVE3-Abl interaction and Abl-kinase activity are required for the Abl-mediated phosphorylation of WAVE3. We also show that four tyrosine residues, which map to different domains of the WAVE3 protein, are targeted for phosphorylation by Abl. We determined that Abi1 is not required for mediating phosphorylation of WAVE3 by Abl, contrary to WAVE2, although Abi1 could be found in the same immunocomplex as WAVE3. We finally show that loss of WAVE3 phosphorylation results in inhibition of lamellipodia formation and cell migration, supporting our previous findings that WAVE3 plays a crucial role in these events (3Sossey-Alaoui K.

Materials—The antibodies used in this study were: rabbit anti-human WAVE3/Scar from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA); mouse anti-human p85 and Living Colors Rabbit anti-GFP from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); rabbit anti-Abl from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA); mouse anti-GFP from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA); mouse anti HA tag (6E2) and anti-Myc tag antibodies from Cell Signaling Inc. The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). PDGF was obtained from Sigma. Gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. Cell Culture—Human MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and the COS7 cells (ATTC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 nm l-glutamine. For stimulation with PDGF, the cells were first subjected to serum starvation for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and then treated with 5 ng/ml recombinant PDGF. Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and the Abl/Arg double knock-out MEFs (27Koleske A.J. Gifford A.M. Scott M.L. Nee M. Bronson R.T. Miczek K.A. Baltimore D.

Plasmid Construction and Transfections—WAVE3 constructs were generated using the PCR from the template WAVE3 cDNA IMAGE clone 4838122 (ATTC). In the 5′ primer for the full-length WAVE3 and the WAVE3 lacking the VCA domain (ΔVCA), the ATG sequence for the first methionine was replaced by a TTG. Amplified fragments were subcloned into the pCR2·1 vector using the T-A cloning kit (Invitrogen). The subcloned fragments were inserted into EcoRI-digested pEGFPC1–1 vector (Clontech), in-frame with the 3′ terminus of EGFP (GFP). The vectors expressing the wild-type c-Abl, the constitutively active (P131L), or the catalytically inert (K290R), forms of c-Abl were kindly provided by Dr. Ann Marie Pendergast (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The vectors expressing either HA-tagged Abi1 or HA-tagged WAVE2 fusion proteins ware kind gifts from Dr. Alexis Gautreau (Institut Curie, Paris France). The HA tag in the HA-WAVE2 construct was replaced by a Myc tag using standard cloning procedures. All constructs were sequence-verified using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (ABI Prism). The EGFP-recombinant vectors were used for either transient or stable transfections using standard protocols. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA fragment that contains the Kozak sequence and the open reading frame of the wild-type WAVE3 transcript was PCR-amplified using WAVE3 cDNA IMAGE clone 4838122, as a template, and subcloned into pCDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The correct sequence and orientation were verified by sequencing. We used the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instruction to generate the WAVE3 phospho-mutant variants, where the tyrosine residues were replaced by a phenylalanine (TAT to TCT, or TAC to TCC), by introducing a single nucleotide change at the second position of the tyrosine codon. Sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis are available upon request. Three-dimensional Migration Assay—Three-dimensional migration was assayed using collagen IV-coated inserts (8-μm pore size, BD Falcon) in 6-well plates. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 × 105 cells was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber contained 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Where required, PDGF (5 ng/ml) was added to the lower chamber. The inserts were incubated overnight at 37 °C, where after the non-migrating cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The cells that were able to migrate through the pores onto the lower surface of the membrane were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (American Scientific Products, McGaw Park, IL) and photographed using an inverted Leica DM IRB microscope fitted with a charge-coupled device camera (Leica Microsystems, Germany), and counted. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature and washed with PBS. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed again with PBS, and incubated in the blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Primary as well as secondary antibodies were diluted at the recommended concentration in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. Actin filaments (F-actin) were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS. The coverslips were mounted on object slides using Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence images were captured using a Nikon TE2000-E inverted microscope. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For endogenous co-immunoprecipitation, cells were grown in 10-cm diameter Petri dishes and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Immediately, ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of proteases inhibitors) was added. The cells were rapidly scraped off the plates, and the crude lysates were transferred to prechilled Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-WAVE3 antibody or rabbit anti-serum for 1 h, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min at 4 °C on a rotary wheel. Beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation using EGFP fusion proteins the cleared cell lysates were immediately mixed with 100 μg of either EGFP-, EGFP-WAVE3-, or EGFP-WAVE3-truncated fusion proteins, and the tubes were incubated on a rotary wheel overnight at 4 °C. The next morning the protein mixtures were incubated with the anti-EGFP antibody, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads as described above. Beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunoblotting cellular lysates containing equivalent amounts of total protein (50 μg) were treated with SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes using Bio-Rad gel and transfer apparatus. Membranes were incubated in 5% whole milk (or bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, followed by incubation with the primary antibody (as specified) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, and the signals were developed using Western Lights Chemiluminescence Detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Abl Kinase Activity Is Required for WAVE3 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Our previous study suggested that WAVE3 phosphorylation is required for WAVE3-p85 interaction, and for the PDGF regulation of WAVE3-mediated regulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration, downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (3Sossey-Alaoui K. Li X. Ranalli T.A. Cowell J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21748-21755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of PDGF on WAVE3 phosphorylation, we treated cultured MDA-MB-231 cells with 5 ng/ml PDGF for various amounts of time and analyzed the phosphorylation levels of endogenous WAVE3 protein (Fig. 1A). PDGF stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a time-dependent increase in the levels of WAVE3 phosphorylation, which could be detected as early as 10 min after stimulation, and reached maximum levels after 30 min. Westphal and colleagues (32Westphal R.S. Soderling S.H. Alto N.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4589-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) showed that c-Abl interacts with the WAVE protein complex. Furthermore, c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity was found to be required for the phosphorylation of WAVE2, a close relative of WAVE3 (30Leng Y. Zhang J. Badour K. Arpaia E. Freeman S. Cheung P. Siu M. Siminovitch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1098-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated whether WAVE3 and Abl interact endogenously in MDA-MB-231 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of protein lysates from PDGF-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells determined that endogenous WAVE3 and c-Abl proteins are present in the same immunocomplex (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Abl might be involved in WAVE3 phosphorylation. We also used immunostaining analyses to confirm the localization of WAVE3 and Abl to membrane ruffles at the edge of PDGF-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C). Immunostaining of MDA-MB-231 cells with WAVE3 antibody showed co-localization of endogenous WAVE3 with membrane ruffles at the edge of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C, left panel). Similarly, immunostaining with Abl antibody showed that endogenous Abl also co-localizes with membrane ruffles of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C, middle panel), suggesting a possible co-localization of Abl and WAVE3 in vivo as well. Co-staining of MDA-MB-231 cells with both anti-WAVE3 and anti-Abl antibodies (Fig. 1C, right panel), showed co-localization of both endogenous WAVE3 and Abl proteins to cells edges. To determine whether Abl kinase activity is required for WAVE3 phosphorylation, we analyzed the effect of STI-571 (Gleevec), a specific inhibitor of Abl kinase activity, on WAVE3 phosphorylation. Although PDGF-stimulated cells showed relatively strong levels of WAVE3 phosphorylation, pre-treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with STI-571 resulted in a dramatic reduction in the phosphorylation levels of WAVE3 (Fig. 1D). The low levels of phosphorylated WAVE3 that could be detected without PDGF stimulation where also reduced to undetectable levels as a result of the treatment with STI-571 (Fig. 1D). These results, therefore, demonstrate the requirement of Abl tyrosine kinase activity for WAVE3 phosphorylation. To further confirm the requirement of Abl activity for WAVE3 phosphorylation, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of ectopically expressed WAVE3 in both wild-type MEFs, and MEFs derived from mice where both Abl and the Abl-related-gene (Arg) where targeted for double knock-out (Abl-/-/Arg-/-). Phosphorylated WAVE3 could be detected only in the wild-type MEFs, whereas no WAVE3 phosphorylation could be detected in the MEFs where Abl activity was lacking (Fig. 2A, left panel). Phosphorylation of WAVE3 could, however, be restored when Abl activity was rescued in the (Abl-/-/Arg-/-) MEFs (Fig. 2A, right panel).FIGURE 2Abl-mediated phosphorylation of exogenous WAVE3.A, protein lysates from wild-type MEFs or Abl-/-/Arg-/- double knock-out MEFs cells that were transfected with either GFP or GFP-WAVE3 fusion, were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-GFP antibody and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (a). Phosphorylated WAVE3 is detected only in the wild-type MEFs, but not in the MEFs lacking Abl kinase activity (a, left panel). WAVE3 phosphorylation is rescued in the Abl-/-/Arg-/- MEFs where Abl activity was restored (a, right panel). Cell lysates were sequentially immunoblotted with mouse anti-GFP and anti-Abl antibodies to confirm the presence of equal amounts of these proteins in the cell lysates (b and c, respectively). B, protein lysates of COS7 cells transfected with the indicated constructs, were immunoprecipitated with anti-WAVE3 antibody, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to determine WAVE3 phosphorylation (a). WAVE3 phosphorylation can be achieved only in the presence of Abl. Cell lysates were sequentially immunoblotted with anti-WAVE3 and anti-Abl antibodies to confirm the presence of equal amounts of these proteins in the cell lysates (b and c, respectively). C, protein lysates of COS7 cells transfected with the indicated constructs, that were either treated or not with STI-571, were immunoprecipitated with anti-WAVE3 antibody, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to determine WAVE3 phosphorylation (a). WAVE3 is phosphorylated only in the presence of wild-type Abl (Abl-WT) or constitutively active Abl (Abl-P131L), but not in the presence of catalytically inert Abl kinase (Abl-K290R). Pre-treatment of cells with STI-571 also inhibits phosphorylation of WAVE3 even in the presence of active Abl kinase. The presence of equal amounts of WAVE3 in the precipitated immunocomplex was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-WAVE3 antibody (b). Equal amounts of WAVE3 and Abl proteins in the cell lysates were also confirmed by sequential immunoblotting with anti-WAVE3 and anti-Abl antibodies (c and d, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we analyzed the Abl-mediated phosphorylation of WAVE3 in COS7 cells by performing anti-WAVE3 immunoprecipitation reactions from COS7 cells overexpressing WAVE3 alone or both WAVE3 and Abl. When immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, phosphorylation of WAVE3 occurred only in the presence of Abl (Fig. 2B). Wild-type or constitutively active (P131L) forms of Abl kinase, but not the catalytically inert (K290R) Abl kinase, were able to mediate phosphorylation of WAVE3 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that not only the presence of Abl protein, but also an active Abl kinase is required for WAVE3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Similarly, in COS7 cells, inhibition of Abl-kinase activity with STI-571 results in inhibition of WAVE3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Abi1 Is Not Required for Abl-mediated Phosphorylation of WAVE3—WAVE3 along with WAVE1 and WAVE2 are thought to be regulated by their inclusion in a protein complex also containing the Abelson (Abl) interactor-1 (Abi1) adaptor protein (33Stovold C.F. Millard T.H. Machesky L.M. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that Abl-mediated phosphorylation of WAVE2 is mediated by Abi1 in an Abl·Abi1·WAVE2 complex (30Leng Y. Zhang J. Badour K. Arpaia E. Freeman S. Cheung P. Siu M. Siminovitch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1098-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To test whether Abi1 is required for coupling of Abl to WAVE3 to promote Abl-mediated phosphorylation of WAVE3, we analyzed WAVE3 phosphorylation by Abl both in the presence and absence of Abi1. Although Abi1 could be detected in the same immunocomplex that contains WAVE3 or WAVE2 (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively), indicating a possible interaction between the two proteins, the presence of Abi1, however, has no effect on WAVE3 phosphorylation, because phosphorylation of WAVE3 could be achieved even in the absence of Abi1 (Fig. 3A). No WAVE2 phosphorylation could, however, be achieved in the absence of Abi1 (Fig. 3B), confirming the requirement of Abi1 for the Abl-mediated phosphorylation of WAVE2. Possible endogenous levels of Abi1 in COS7 cells could not explain the detection of phosphorylated WAVE3, in the absence of exogenous Abi1. If that were the case, then this endogenous Abi1 would have been able to mediate WAVE2 phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous Abi1. Four WAVE3 Tyrosine Residues Are Targeted for Abl Phosphorylation—To determine the location of potential tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by Abl, truncated forms of WAVE3, tagged with GFP (Fig. 4A), were expressed together with Abl in COS7 cells, and their phosphorylation was examined. Immunoblotting with anti-tyrosine antibody of anti-GFP immunoprecipitates of proteins from cells expressing the different WAVE3 mutants shows that WAVE3 is phosphorylated as a full-length protein or when amino acids 91–440 are present, therefore, indicating the presence of target tyrosine residue(s) in this region of the WAVE3 protein (Fig. 4B). The presence of additional target tyrosine residues in the VCA domain cannot, however, be excluded. The only region of WAVE3 that could be excluded is the N-terminal 90-amino acid region, which contains the Scar Homology domain. To identify which of the one or more WAVE3 tyrosine residues are targeted for phosphorylation by Abl, WAVE3-mutant cDNAs in which each of the 15 tyrosine residues were individually replaced with phenylalanine (Tyr to Phe) and expressed in COS7 cells together with Abl, and the phosphorylation status of the mutant proteins was determined. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody of anti-WAVE3 proteins precipitates from these cells (Fig. 4C) shows that mutation of individual tyrosine residues did not result in a loss of WAVE3 phosphorylation by Abl, clearly suggesting that more than a single tyrosine in the WAVE3 protein is phosphorylated by Abl. Next, we generated a series of WAVE3 mutant cDNAs in which all 15 tyrosine residues were sequentially mutated (Table 1), and their phosphorylation status was examined as described above. Complete loss of WAVE3 phosphorylation could be achieved only when all 15 tyrosine residues were mutated (Fig. 4, D and E), which is a clear indication that at least tyrosine residue 486 (Tyr-486), along with other tyrosines are targeted for phosphorylation by Abl.TABLE 1Description of the WAVE3 expression vector carrying the sequential tyrosine residues substitutionsW3-Mut1: Y63FW3-Mut2: Y63F, Y125FW3-Mut3: Y63F, Y125F, Y140FW3-Mut4: Y63F, Y125F, Y140F, Y151FW3-Mut5: Y63F, Y125F, Y140F, Y151F, Y156FW3-Mut6: Y63F, Y125F, Y140F, Y151F, Y156F, Y210F, Y225FW3-Mut7: Y63F, Y125F, Y140F, Y151F, Y156F, Y210F, Y225F, Y248F, Y250FW3-Mut8: Y63F, Y125F, Y140F, Y151F, Y156F, Y210F,"

V-ATPases couple hydrolysis of cytoplasmic ATP to transport of protons from the cytosol into intracellular compartments. Organelle acidification is essential for a wide range of cellular processes including protein sorting in the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways; protein processing, activation, and degradation; cellular ion homeostasis; and coupled transport of small molecules (1Nishi T.

V-ATPases also have been identified in the plasma membrane of certain specialized cells where they pump protons from the cytosol out of the cell (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 5Wieczorek H. Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The structure and subunit composition of V-ATPases is very similar in all organisms from yeast to humans. They are multisubunit complexes composed of two domains. The V1 domain is a peripheral cytoplasmic complex composed of eight different subunits (subunits A–H), and it contains the sites of ATP hydrolysis. The V0 domain is an integral membrane complex that is composed of six different subunits (subunits a, d, e, c, c′, and c″). It comprises the proton pore. The V1 and V0 domains must be structurally and functionally coupled for ATP-driven proton translocation to occur. V1 complexes that are not attached to V0 at the membrane cannot hydrolyze MgATP, and V0 complexes in the membrane that are not attached to V1 are not able to transport protons (6Graf R. Harvey W.R.

Independent assembly of preassembled V1 and V0 subcomplexes, however, is probably not the predominant pathway for biosynthetic assembly. There is evidence that supports an integrated assembly of V1 and V0 subunits with initial association of individual V1 and V0 subunits followed by the addition of subunits from both domains (12Kane P.M. Tarsio M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17275-17283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Ochotny N. Van Vliet A. Chan N. Yao Y. Morel M.

In addition to the initial biosynthetic assembly, an important mechanism for regulation of V-ATPase activity is reversible disassembly of assembled complexes into free V1 and V0 domains in response to extracellular glucose concentrations (14Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast cells, glucose deprivation for as little as 5 min triggers dissociation of ∼70% of V-ATPase complexes. The addition of glucose reverses this process, reassembling the V1 and V0 complexes to original levels (14Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of the V-ATPase is not unique to yeast. In Manduca sexta midgut epithelial cells, cessation of feeding during molting or starvation results in disassembly of fully assembled, active V-ATPase complexes into inactive cytosolic V1 and membrane-bound V0 complexes (6Graf R.

There is also recent evidence from renal epithelial cells and maturing dendritic cells that V-ATPase activity is regulated at the level of assembly in mammalian cells as well (15Sautin Y.Y. Lu M.

Reversible dissociation appears to be a widely used mechanism of V-ATPase regulation.A novel regulator of V-ATPase assembly, the heterotrimeric protein RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes), mediates both the biosynthetic assembly and the glucose-induced reassembly of the V-ATPase in yeast (17Smardon A.M.

RAVE is a stable complex composed of three subunits: Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. rav1Δ and rav2Δ mutants display a very similar partial Vma– phenotype characterized by growth defects at pH 7.5 and 60 mm CaCl2 at elevated temperatures (33–37 °C) (18Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Consistent with this phenotype, rav1Δ mutants have a loss of quinacrine staining of the vacuole at elevated temperatures (37 °C), indicative of a loss of vacuolar acidification. Even at the permissive temperature of 30 °C, the rav1Δ mutant shows a kinetic delay in reassembly of V-ATPase complexes after the readdition of glucose to glucose-deprived cells (18Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Vacuoles isolated from cells lacking RAVE subunits have very low levels of V1 subunits and V-ATPase activity even when cells are grown in glucose at the permissive temperature (30 °C) (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). RAVE was shown to bind to V1 released from the vacuolar membrane by glucose deprivation and to release V1 upon glucose readdition (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The RAVE complex appears to be aiding cytosolic V1 complexes to assemble with V0 at the membrane.The interaction between RAVE and V1 is lost in mutants lacking two V1 subunits, E and G (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These two subunits, present in at least two copies/V1 complex, are believed to form one or more peripheral stalks connecting the catalytic head group and the V0 sector. Subunit C is another V1 peripheral stalk component that is associated with subunits E and G of the V1 complex and subunit a of the V0 complex in the assembled V-ATPase (19Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27896-27903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast have produced genetic, biochemical, and structural data supporting a role for subunit C in both the stability of the V1/V0 holoenzyme and in regulation of reversible assembly/disassembly of the complex (20Drory O. Frolow F. Nelson N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Z. Inoue T. Forgac M. Wilkens S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).In this work we provide evidence that RAVE interacts with subunit C in the cytosol and that this interaction is independent of RAVE/V1 binding. In the absence of RAVE function, subunit C is not able to stably assemble with the V1 and V0 subcomplexes of the V-ATPase at the vacuole. Our results support a model in which RAVE influences V-ATPase peripheral stalk subunit interactions via a chaperone type assembly function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Growth Media—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech. TaKaRa LA-Taq was purchased from Fisher, and Pfu I DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Zymolyase 100T was from MP Biomedicals, and concanamycin A was from Wako Biochemicals. Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were from New England Biolabs. Monoclonal antibody against the Myc epitope (9E10) was obtained from Roche Applied Science, and HA.11 (16B12) against the HA epitope was from Covance Research Products. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG used for immunofluorescence was purchased from Invitrogen. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and pGEM-T Easy TA cloning vector were from Promega. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated c-Myc (9E10):sc-40 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Yeast and Escherichia coli media were from Fisher. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract –peptone –2% dextrose (YEPD) medium or fully supplemented minimal medium (SD) lacking individual nutrients as described previously (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1982; PubMed Google Scholar). For growth and testing of vma mutant strains, YEPD was buffered to pH 5.0 or 7.5 with 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm potassium succinate.Strain Construction—All of the strains were derived from SF838-5Aα (23Stevens T.H. Rothman J.H. Payne G.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or from the two-hybrid strains PJ69-4A and PJ69-4α (24James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genotypes of strains used in this study are listed in Table 1, and oligonucleotides used to construct the strains are listed in Table 2. To delete the VMA5 gene we used oligonucleotides VMA5-600/VMA5+350 to amplify vma5Δ:: kanMX6 from the BY4741 vma5Δ::kanMX6 deletion strain (25Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3155) Google Scholar). The vma5Δ::kanMX6 PCR product was introduced into the SF838-5A strain using a modified lithium acetate transformation protocol (26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on 200 μg/ml G418 and tested for integration by PCR and by testing for the Vma– phenotype (lack of growth at pH 7.5 and 60 mm CaCl2). A single HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was fused to the N terminus of VMA5 to generate the integrated HA-VMA5 strain using a fusion PCR protocol in which two individual PCR products were first produced using oligonucleotide pairs VMA5-600/VMA5-HT2 and VMA5-HT/VMA5+350 with genomic DNA as template. This was followed by a second PCR using oligonucleotides VMA5-600/VMA5+350 and the two PCR products previously produced and gel-purified as templates. The resulting fusion PCR product was transformed into the SF838-5A vma5Δ strain, and colonies able to grow on YEPD pH 7.5 plates were selected. The integrated HA-VMA5 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To delete VMA4 in the RAV1-Myc13 and RAV1-Myc13 HA-VMA5 strains, the VMA4-600/VMA4+200 oligonucleotide pair was used to PCR amplify vma4Δ::URA3 from the SF838-5A vma4Δ::URA3 (9Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) strain. The vma4Δ::URA3 fragment was used to transform the RAV1-Myc13, and the RAV1-Myc13 HA-VMA5 strains as described above and transformants were selected on supplemented minimal plates lacking uracil (SD –ura), followed by testing for integration by PCR and by testing for lack of growth on pH 7.5 and 60 mm CaCl2. We used a previously constructed SF838-5A VMA2-GFP (27Sambade M. Alba M. Smardon A.M. West R.W. Kane P.M. Genetics. 2005; 170: 1539-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) strain to introduce the GFP tag at the C terminus of VMA2 in the SF838-5A rav1Δ, SF838-5A vma5Δ and SF838-5A vma10Δ strains as described (28Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). The VMA4 open reading frame was deleted in the PJ69-4A and PJ69-4α strains by integrating a vma4Δ::URA3 PCR fragment as described above in the RAV1-Myc13 strains. The VMA10 open reading frame was deleted in a similar manner using the oligonucleotide pair VMA10-2/VMA10-200 to amplify the vma10Δ::URA3 PCR fragment from the SF838-5A vma10Δ::URA3 strain (12Kane P.M. Tarsio M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17275-17283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on supplemented minimal plates lacking uracil (SD –ura), and disruption of the VMA4 or VMA10 genes was confirmed by PCR and phenotype testing as described above.TABLE 1Genotypes of strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceSF838-5AMATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his4-519 ade6Ref. 23Stevens T.H.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar), RAV1 and RAV2 were amplified from wild type genomic DNA with primer pairs RAV1NBamHI/YJR9 and RAV2NBamHI/YDR9, respectively. BamHI sites were introduced just upstream of the ATG start codon. The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy TA cloning vector and sequenced for accuracy. RAV1 and RAV2 inserts were excised using BamHI and SalI and cloned into the BamH1/SalI cleaved pAS2 vector. A similar method was used to clone RAV1, RAV2, VMA4, and VMA10 into the pACT2 (29Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar) two-hybrid vector with the BamHI sites in frame with the activation domain of the pACT2 plasmid and using primer pairs RAV1NBamHI/YJR9, RAV2NBamHI/YDR9, VMA4BamHI/VMA4+200, and VMA10NBamHI/VMA10-2, respectively. PCR inserts were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced, and inserts were excised with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI cleaved pACT2 vector. To clone VMA5 into the pACT2 vector, the oligonucleotide pair VMA5-5′2hyb/VMA5-3′2hyb was used to amplify VMA5 from wild type genomic DNA and processed as above except that BamHI and SacI were used to excise the VMA5 insert from the pGEM-T Easy vector and cloned into the BamHI/SacI cleaved pACT2 vector. pAS2 plasmids were introduced into the two-hybrid reporter strains PJ69-4A (MATa), PJ69-4A vma4Δ, and PJ69-4A vma10Δ, and pACT2 plasmids were introduced into PJ69-4α (MATα), PJ69-4α vma4Δ, and PJ69-4α vma10Δ reporter strains as described above, and transformants were selected on SD plates lacking tryptophan or leucine for selection of the pAS2 and pACT2 plasmids, respectively. To test for two-hybrid interactions, a MATa strain containing a pAS2 plasmid construct was crossed to a MATα strain containing a pACT2 plasmid and diploids were selected on SD –trp, –leu. The resulting diploid strains were tested for a two-hybrid interaction by plating onto SD plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, adenine and histidine (SD –trp –leu –ade –his) (24James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—For coimmunoprecipitations of Rav1pMyc with HA-Vma5p and Vma2p, cytosolic fractions were obtained from the Rav1p-Myc HA-Vma5p strains as described (30Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J. Sandmeyer S. Nasmyth K. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (100 A600 of each strain) were lysed by agitation with glass beads, and cytosol was obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100 ultracentrifuge. Protein concentrations of the cytosolic fractions from the various strains were measured by Lowry assay (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 0.4 mg of protein was directly precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and 4.0 mg was combined with 100 μl of anti-Vma2p monoclonal antibody (13D11) or 6 μl(∼30 μg) anti-HA (16B12) monoclonal antibody followed by the addition of 60 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL4B. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized at 75 °C in cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for analysis on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described below.Other Biochemical Techniques—Vacuolar vesicles were isolated as described (32Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis activity was determined at 37 °C using a coupled enzyme assay (33Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of 100 nm concanamycin A. For immunoblotting, vacuolar vesicles were solubilized in cracking buffer. For all immunoblots, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to either nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies 13D11, 7A2, and 10D7 against V1 subunits B and C and V0 subunit a, respectively (34Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were bound by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and detected by colorimetric assay as described (35Kane P.M. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blot signals were quantitated using Image J (National Institutes of Health). Rav1p-Myc was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 9E10 antibody. The antibodies were detected on blots either as described above or by using ECL detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences to detect the primary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 9E10 antibody.Microscopy and Immunofluorescence—Strains carrying the VMA2-GFP construct were grown in YEPD at 30 °C to 1.0 A600/ ml, and GFP fluorescence was observed on a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope under fluorescein fluorescence optics. The images were captured using a Hamamatsu CCD camera. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (32Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Anti-Vma2p (13D11) and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100, respectively. Secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (2 μg/μl) was used at a 1:200 dilution. The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy as described above.RESULTSRAVE Binds to Subunit C—The binding of RAVE to V1 is almost completely lost in the vma4Δ and vma10Δ mutants, which lack subunits E and G, respectively (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Based on these results we hypothesized that RAVE binds to the stalk region of the cytosolic V1 complex, specifically subunits E and/or G. To examine further the nature of RAVE/V1 binding, we looked at pairwise interactions between RAVE subunits and V1 subunits in two-hybrid assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that Rav1p interacts with Rav2p and Skp1p of the RAVE complex and Vma4p (subunit E), Vma10p (subunit G), and Vma5p (subunit C) of the V1 complex. Rav2p interacts with Rav1p and Vma5p, but not with Skp1p, Vma4p, or Vma10p (Fig. 1A). The remaining V1 subunits (Vma1p, Vma2p, Vma7p, Vma8p, and Vma13p) did not interact in two-hybrid tests with Rav1p or Rav2p (data not shown).The disruption of the RAVE/V1 interaction in subunit E and G deletion strains (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) predicted positive interactions in the two-hybrid assay between RAVE and subunits E and/or G, but the RAVE interaction with subunit C was surprising. As noted above, subunit C is released from both V1 and V0 domains during disassembly. Subunit C is isolated only at very low levels with cytosolic V1 subcomplexes from glucose-deprived cells or yeast cells containing only V1 subcomplexes because of a deletion of a V0 subunit (36Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An interaction between RAVE and subunit C raises the question as to whether this interaction is independent of the RAVE/V1 interaction. It is possible that the two-hybrid interactions between the RAVE subunits and Vma5p are not due to direct binary interactions but instead result from other"
https://openalex.org/W2061393426,"The syndecans comprise a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans exhibiting complex biological functions involving the interaction of heparan sulfate side chains with a variety of soluble and insoluble heparin-binding extracellular ligands. Here we demonstrate an inverse correlation between the expression level of syndecan-2 and the metastatic potential of three clones derived from Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL. This correlation was proved to be a causal relationship, because transfection of syndecan-2 into the higher metastatic clone resulted in the suppression of both spontaneous and experimental metastases to the lung. Although the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and its cell surface activators, such as membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, were similar regardless of the metastatic potentials of the clones, elevated activation of MMP-2 was observed in the higher metastatic clone. Removal of heparan sulfate from the cell surface of low metastatic cells by treatment with heparitinase-I promoted MMP-2 activation, and transfection of syndecan-2 into highly metastatic cells suppressed MMP-2 activation. Furthermore, transfection of mutated syndecan-2 lacking glycosaminoglycan attachment sites into highly metastatic cells did not have any suppressive effect on MMP-2 activation, suggesting that this suppression was mediated by the heparan sulfate side chains of syndecan-2. Actually, MMP-2 was found to exhibit a strong binding ability to heparin, the dissociation constant value being 62 nm. These results indicate a novel function of syndecan-2, which acts as a suppressor for MMP-2 activation, causing suppression of metastasis in at least the metastatic system used in the present study.

Tumor metastasis is accomplished through a multistep process in which individual tumor cells disseminate from a primary tumor to distant secondary sites. In the process of metastasis, tumor cells are involved in numerous interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinaseMT1-MMPmembrane-type 1 MMPPBSphosphate-buffered salineH11LM66-H11GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinaseMT1-MMPmembrane-type 1 MMPPBSphosphate-buffered salineH11LM66-H11GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. providing information that controls the behavior of tumor cells.

One class of cell surface receptors with such functions is cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including the transmembrane-type syndecan family and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored-type glypican family (1Bernfield M.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). However, cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are unique and are different from proteinous cell surface receptors in terms of the binding redundancy for ligands. This is because the many ligand-binding sites reside in the polysaccharide moiety (i.e. heparan sulfate side chains). Therefore, theoretically, they can be receptors for all heparin-binding molecules. Actually, a large number of reports have demonstrated that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans function as receptors for soluble heparin-binding ligands, such as cell growth factors and insoluble molecules such as ECM constituents. In many cases, it seems that they cooperate with intrinsic high affinity receptors for heparin-binding molecules as low affinity receptors and thereby regulate their signal transduction. For example, they act as co-receptors for heparin-binding growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and control the strength of the signals (4Yayon A.

Moreover, it is well known that syndecans cooperate with integrins as co-receptors for fibronectin, which constitutes various types of ECM, and participate in cell adhesion and/or migration through regulation of focal contact and stress fiber formation (12Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 13Woods A.

(Tokyo). 2004; 135: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, besides the function regarding this signal transduction, cell surface proteoglycans provide initial docking sites for the binding to various viruses (17Gallay P. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Spear P.G. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In such cases, viruses also recognize other proteinous receptors expressed simultaneously on the cell surface. Overall, it can be considered that the common function of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is regulation of the functions of other proteinous molecules on the cell surface. Therefore, heparan sulfate proteoglycans on tumor cells have various functions in the process of metastasis that force the tumor cells to always interact in non-self circumstances. During metastasis, tumor cells must respond to and adapt to the host ECM, which in general, acts defensively against the tumor cells. First of all, tumor cells have to degrade the host ECM in order to disseminate. A family of ECM degradation enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been implicated in not only physiological processes of tissue remodeling but also pathological conditions, such as cancer (19Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar). Although various types of MMPs are involved in metastasis, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on type IV collagenases (20Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 21John A. Tuszynski G. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2001; 7: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and, in particular, activation of MMP-2 appears to be closely correlated with tumor metastasis (22Sato H. Seiki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In common with all MMPs, MMP-2 is synthesized as a latent form, requiring proteolytic removal of the propeptide for activation. Therefore, regulation of MMP-2 occurs through three steps (i.e. alteration of gene expression, activation of latent zymogens, and inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases). The mechanism of activation of MMP-2 on the cell surface has been well documented. This event is triggered by the formation of a tertiary complex comprising (or including) secreted pro-MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), and membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) on the cell surface and is followed by the cleavage of the peptide of the pro-MMP-2 by TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP (see Fig. 10A) (23Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 24Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

Okada Y. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16098-16103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, it was shown recently that an additional member, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein, RECK (reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs), suppressively regulates this process on the cell surface, suggesting that the regulation of MMP-2 activation might be more complicated than previously expected (27Oh J. Takahashi R. Kondo S. Mizoguchi A. Adachi E. Sasahara R.M. Nishimura S. Imamura Y. Kitayama H. Alexander D.B. Ide C. Horan T.P. Arakawa T. Yoshida H. Nishikawa S. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Itohara S. Takahashi C. Noda M. Cell. 2001; 107: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The fact that both MT1-MMP and RECK are membrane-anchored proteins strongly suggests the possibility that other cell surface molecules may be involved in this regulation. Previously, we found an inverse correlation between the expression level of syndecan-2 and the metastatic potential of clones established from Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL (14Kusano Y. Oguri K. Nagayasu Y. Munesue S. Ishihara M. Saiki I. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Munesue S. Kusano Y. Oguri K. Itano N.

(Tokyo). 2004; 135: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further demonstrated the causal relationship in this inverse correlation and the possible mechanism underlying this relation. The results obtained indicate a novel function of syndecan-2, of which the heparan sulfate side chains suppress the activation of MMP-2 on the cell surface. Cell Culture and Transfection—P29, LM12-3, and LM66-H11 cells exhibiting low, intermediate, and high metastatic potential, respectively, were cloned from Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL on the basis of spontaneous metastatic potential (28Nakanishi H. Takenaga K. Oguri K. Yoshida A. Okayama M. Virchows Arch. A. 1992; 420: 163-170Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Itano N. Oguri K. Nakanishi H. Okayama M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 862-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (where “P” represents “parent” and LM represents “lung metastasis”; i.e. the LM12 and LM66 series were cloned from the populations undergoing 12 and 66 cycles of spontaneous metastasis from a subcutaneous primary tumor to the lung). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were harvested after incubation with 2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (EDTA/PBS) for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by gentle flushing with a pipette, and subcultured twice a week. After transfection of the expression plasmid for each protein using Tfx-50 reagent (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, cells were cultured in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml), and the G418-resistant colonies were picked up 2 weeks later. Construction of Syndecan-2 Core Protein and a Mutant of It—cDNA of mouse syndecan-2 core protein containing the entire coding region was generated as described previously (15Munesue S. Kusano Y. Oguri K. Itano N. Yoshitomi Y. Nakanishi H. Yamashina I. Okayama M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mutant core protein of syndecan-2, of which the glycosaminoglycan-attachable serine residues were changed to alanine residues (S41A, S53A, S55A, and S57A), was generated using a TaKaRa Mutan-Super Express Km Kit (TaKaRa BIO Inc.). The four mutagenic primers that changed thymine to guanine were primer A (5′-GAG GAA GCT CA GGA GTA TA-3′), primer B (5′-TGA CTA TTC TC TGC CTC AG-3′), primer C (5′-TAT TCT CT GCC GCA GGC T C-3′), and primer D (5′-AGG CC AGG AGC TGA TGA AT-3′). The double underlining in the sequences indicates the altered residues. First, primer A was used to mutate codon 41 of syndecan-2 cDNA cloned into the pkF19k vector (TaKaRa BIO Inc.) by the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber-long and accurate (ODA-LA) PCR method. After confirmation of the sequence of the mutant cDNA, primers B, C, and D were used similarly to mutate codons 53, 55, and 57 of the cDNA in that order. Finally, the mutant syndecan-2/pkF19k was inserted into pcDNA3 (Promega Corp.) at a site downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned mutant syndecan-2 cDNA was verified with an ABI PRISM 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Treatment of Cells with Antisense Oligonucleotides of Syndecan-2—Treatments of P29 cells with antisense or sense oligonucleotides of syndecan-2 were performed as described previously (14Kusano Y. Oguri K. Nagayasu Y. Munesue S. Ishihara M. Saiki I. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides complementary to the region around the initiation codon of mouse syndecan-2 mRNA (5′-CAC GCG CGC TGC ATA TT-3′) and the corresponding sense (5′-AAT ATG CAG CGC GCG TG-3′) and scrambled antisense (5′-ACGT CCC TGA GCG ATC T-3′) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized using a model 392 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by two cycles of reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. P29 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μm oligonucleotides for 4 days and then cultured for another 1 day in the medium without fetal bovine serum. The conditioned media were concentrated for gelatin zymography. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies, SN1Ab, SN2Ab, SN3Ab, and SN4Ab, specific to ectodomain recombinants of the mouse syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4 core proteins, respectively, were prepared as described previously (14Kusano Y. Oguri K. Nagayasu Y. Munesue S. Ishihara M. Saiki I. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Kusano Y. Yoshitomi Y. Munesue S. Okayama M. Oguri K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The commercially available antibodies used were as follows: goat anti-human integrin α5β1 antibodies (Chemicon International); mouse monoclonal antibodies F58-10E4, specific to heparan sulfate, and F69-3G10, specific to the unsaturated nonreducing end of heparan sulfate chain, generated upon heparitinase digestion (Seikagaku Corp.); and mouse monoclonal antibody F-68 anti-human MMP-2 reactive to mouse MMP-2 (DAIICHI Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.). Flow Cytometric Assay—Subconfluent cell layers were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then digested with or without 0.1 unit/ml of heparitinase-I (EC 4.2.2.8; Seikagaku) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested with EDTA/PBS, suspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (3 × 105 cells/50 μl), and then incubated with antibodies or the respective nonimmune serum or Ig for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After washing three times with PBS, they were exposed to an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody for 30 min. The labeled cells were washed, and the intensity of fluorescence was measured with a flow cytometer, FACSort (BD Biosciences). Metastasis Assay—The metastasis assay was performed as described previously (28Nakanishi H. Takenaga K. Oguri K. Yoshida A. Okayama M. Virchows Arch. A. 1992; 420: 163-170Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 105 cells) suspended in 0.2 ml of PBS were injected into the tail veins of 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice for experimental metastasis or subcutaneously into the right abdominal flank for spontaneous metastasis. The animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later, and the numbers of visible nodules in lungs fixed in Bouin's solution were determined. Northern Blot Analysis—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 cells of each clone, using a QuickPrep mRNA Purification Kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (15Munesue S. Kusano Y. Oguri K. Itano N. Yoshitomi Y. Nakanishi H. Yamashina I. Okayama M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 μg of each poly(A)+ RNA from cells was electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 1.1 m formaldehyde, transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.), and then hybridized to a cDNA fragment of mouse syndecan-1 (nucleotides 409-967), syndecan-2 (nucleotides 487-1175), syndecan-3 (nucleotides 370-931), syndecan-4 (nucleotides 92-534), MMP-2 (nucleotides 683-1484), MT1-MMP (nucleotides 1115-1696), TIMP-2 (nucleotides 227-691), β-actin (nucleotides 183-722), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (nucleotides 319-1047), which had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random labeling method. After hybridization for 14 h at 42 °C, the membranes were exposed to x-ray films, and the films were scanned with a CanoScan 600 (Canon). Quantification of the bands was performed with the public domain NIH Image program in the 256-grayscale mode. Western Blot Analysis—Cell surface proteoglycans were extracted from cell layers with 2% Triton X-100, 25 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.036 mm pepstatin A as proteinase inhibitors for 12 h on ice and then purified as described previously (14Kusano Y. Oguri K. Nagayasu Y. Munesue S. Ishihara M. Saiki I. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Samples were digested with heparitinase-I plus chondroitinase ABC to remove glycosaminoglycan side chains (29Itano N. Oguri K. Nakanishi H. Okayama M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 862-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBST for 1 h and then reacted with antibodies for 1 h. After washing with PBST, the membranes were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies for 1 h and then stained with Immunostain (Konica) or ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). Gelatin Zymography—Gelatin zymography was conducted on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing gelatin (1 mg/ml) as described previously (23Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned media in which cells were cultured for 15 h without fetal bovine serum were concentrated with a Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter device (Millipore), adjusted to the SDS-PAGE loading buffer without the reducing agent, and then subjected to electrophoresis through a gel containing gelatin at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice for 30 min at 37 °C with 2.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then incubated in 1 μm ZnCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 18 h at 37 °C. Enzyme activity was visualized as negative staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The band density ratios, active form to latent form, were calculated according to Isnard et al. (30Isnard N. Robert L. Renard G. Cell Biol. Int. 2003; 27: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). If necessary, the following polypeptides were used as a substratum; human plasma fibronectin (Iwaki Glass) and its recombinant polypeptides (i.e. the RGD-containing cell-binding domain C-274, the C-terminal heparin-binding domain H-271, and CH-271, a fusion peptide of C-274 and H-271) (TaKaRa Bio Inc.) (14Kusano Y. Oguri K. Nagayasu Y. Munesue S. Ishihara M. Saiki I. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Affinity Chromatography of MMP-2 on a Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B Column—The conditioned medium of H11 cells (1 × 108 cells) was applied to a column (1 × 9 cm) of Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.) equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. The column was then washed extensively with the equilibrating buffer. The bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer, 1-ml fractions being collected. The conductivity of each fraction was measured by CD-35MII (M & S Instruments Inc.). Each fraction was concentrated and then subjected to gelatin zymography as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance measurements were carried out with a Biacore X system (Biacore AB). A C1 biosensor chip was activated according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Biacore AB). 1340 response units of streptavidin (Sigma) was coupled to the surface of the C1 biosensor chip. Then 150 response units of biotinylated heparin (Seikagaku), produced as described previously (31Yang B. Yang B.L. Goetinck P.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was captured by streptavidin on the chip. The amount of biotinylated heparin coupled to the sensor surface was limited to avoid mass transfer limitation. Kinetic binding analysis was performed in 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min, the instrument being equilibrated at 25 °C. Mouse calvaria-derived pro-MMP-2 (Calbiochem) was perfused at various concentrations. At least two different replicated experiments were performed. Response curves were generated by subtraction of the background signal generated simultaneously in the control flow cell. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting of the sensorgrams to a 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore AB). Inverse Correlation between Metastatic Potential and Syndecan-2 Expression Level in Clones Derived from Lewis Lung Carcinoma 3LL—Our previous paper (16Kusano Y. Yoshitomi Y. Munesue S. Okayama M. Oguri K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL-derived low metastatic P29 and highly metastatic LM66-H11 (abbreviated as H11 hereafter) clones expressed three members of the syndecan family (i.e. syndecan-1, -2, and -4). Among them the expression level of only syndecan-2, a key molecule for regulation of actin cytoskeletal organization in cooperation with integrin α5β1, was different between the clones, although the expression levels of the other two syndecans were very similar in the two clones (14Kusano Y. Oguri K. Nagayasu Y. Munesue S. Ishihara M. Saiki I. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Munesue S. Kusano Y. Oguri K. Itano N. Yoshitomi Y. Nakanishi H. Yamashina I. Okayama M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, to verify the correlation between the metastatic potential and the expression level of syndecan-2, another clone, LM12-3, with intermediate metastatic potential (28Nakanishi H. Takenaga K. Oguri K. Yoshida A. Okayama M. Virchows Arch. A. 1992; 420: 163-170Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was used. As shown in Table 1, both the experimental and spontaneous metastatic potentials of the three clones used gradually increased in the order of P29 < LM12-3 < H11. Northern blot analysis clearly showed that the expression levels of mRNA of syndecan-1 (2.6 kbp) and -4 (5.6 kbp) were similar among the three clones, but that of only syndecan-2 was different (Fig. 1A, left). Quantification of the densities of the bands followed by normalization as to the respective β-actin bands revealed that syndecan-2 mRNA linearly decreased as the metastatic potential of the clones increased (Fig. 1A, right). These results were very consistent with the results of flow cytometric analysis showing cell surface expression of the syndecan family in the clones (Fig. 1B). Syndecan-3 expression was hardly detected on any of these clones, and the expression levels of syndecan-1 and -4 were not significantly different among the clones. In contrast, syndecan-2 expression decreased inversely with the metastatic potentials of the clones. Since it became clear that there is an inverse correlation between the syndecan-2 expression level and the metastatic potential in these clones, next the causality underlying this inverse correlation was investigated.TABLE 1Experimental and spontaneous metastatic potentials of the three clones derived from Lewis lung carcinoma 3LLInjection and cloneIncidenceNumber of lung fociRangeMeanIntravenousP293/70-10.4LM12-37/719-9247.9LM66-H117/7467-744516.2SubcutaneousP290/700LM12-36/70-144.5LM66-H117/723-5635.2 Open table in a new tab Causal Relationship of the Inverse Correlation between the Metastatic Potential and Syndecan-2 Expression—In order to examine the causality, a stable transfectant, the H11-SN2 clone, which was obtained upon transfection of syndecan-2 core protein cDNA into H11 cells, and a mock transfectant, H11-Vec (15Munesue S.

Northern blot analysis confirmed that the expression of syndecan-2 mRNA in the H11-SN2 clone was elevated, although the level of H11-Vec was similar to that in the parent H11 cells (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2164882561,"We previously reported that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates the gene expression of keratin 16 by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling which in turn enhances the recruitment of p300 to the keratin 16 promoter. The recruited p300 functionally cooperates with Sp1 and c-Jun to regulate the gene expression of keratin 16. This study investigated in detail the molecular events incurred upon p300 whereby EGF caused an enhanced interaction between p300 and Sp1. EGF apparently induced time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of p300, both in vitro and in vivo, through the activation of ERK2. The six potential ERK2 phosphorylation sites, including three threonine and three serine residues as revealed by sequential analysis, were first identified in vitro. Confirmation of these six sites in vivo indicated that these three serine residues (Ser-2279, Ser-2315, and Ser-2366) on the C terminus of p300 were the major signaling targets of EGF. Furthermore, the C-terminal serine phosphorylation of p300 stimulated its histone acetyltransferase activity and enhanced its interaction with Sp1. These serine phosphorylation sites on p300 controlled the p300 recruitment to the keratin 16 promoter. When all three serine residues on p300 were replaced by alanine, EGF could no longer induce the gene expression of keratin 16. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that the ERK2-mediated C-terminal serine phosphorylation of p300 was a key event in the regulation of EGF-induced keratin 16 expression. These results also constituted the first report identifying the unique p300 phosphorylation sites induced by ERK2 in vivo. We previously reported that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates the gene expression of keratin 16 by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling which in turn enhances the recruitment of p300 to the keratin 16 promoter. The recruited p300 functionally cooperates with Sp1 and c-Jun to regulate the gene expression of keratin 16.

Keratins, which are the most prominent cytoskeletal proteins in keratinocytes, belong to a large family of ∼30 epithelially specific intermediate filament proteins that form the cytoskeleton (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Among these, keratin 16 is usually referred to as an activation- and hyperproliferation-associated keratin because it is reported to be the marker in the hyperproliferated skin diseases (2Komine M. Rao L.S. Kaneko T. Tomic-Canic M. Tamaki K. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32077-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Leigh I.M.

Furthermore, whereas 10% of the invasive breast carcinomas are positive, in either a diffuse or focal pattern, with the keratin 16 antibodies, normal breast tissue and noninvasive breast carcinomas are nearly negative with the keratin 16 antibodies (4Wetzels R.H. Kuijpers H.J. Lane E.B. Leigh I.M. Troyanovsky S.M. Holland R. van Haelst U.J. Ramaekers F.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 751-763PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that keratin 16 is induced in human papilloma virus-infected tissues at the transcriptional level, and more importantly, the induction leads to the proliferation of keratinocytes, a known characteristic of human papilloma virus infection (5McClowry T.L. Shors T. Brown D.R. J. Med. Virol. 2002; 66: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, a full understanding of the gene regulation of keratin 16 might contribute to therapies beneficial to those hyperproliferated diseases. It is reported that p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), 2The abbreviations used are:MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorWTwild typeERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasePKCprotein kinase CCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein-binding proteinaaamino acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineHAThistone acetyltransferaseHAhemagglutininsiRNAshort interfering RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseDAPADNA affinity precipitation assay also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), phosphorylate specific substrates, including transcription factors like Elk-1 (6Janknecht R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and coactivators such as p300/CBP (8Liu Y.Z. Thomas N.S. Latchman D.S. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Sang N. Stiehl D.P. Bohensky J. Leshchinsky I. Srinivas V. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14013-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Once activated, MAPKs directly phosphorylate proteins containing the minimal consensus phosphoacceptor motif Ser/Thr-Pro (10Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In addition to the MAPK phosphoacceptor consensus sites, it is becoming increasingly clear that in many cases, additional determinants, known as docking domains, are required to specify for the MAPK substrates (11Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). MAPKs bind directly to the docking domain on the substrate or bind indirectly to the substrate through an adaptor possessing the docking domain (10Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kinase epidermal growth factor wild type extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein kinase C cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein amino acid phosphate-buffered saline histone acetyltransferase hemagglutinin short interfering RNA glutathione S-transferase DNA affinity precipitation assay p300, as well as its related protein CBP, are well known transcriptional coactivators. Both play pivotal roles in coordinating and integrating multiple signal-dependent events with the transcription machinery and participate in diverse physiological processes, including development, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (12Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Several functional domains of p300/CBP, such as CH1 and CH3 domains, are important for protein-protein interactions (12Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the versatile coactivators p300/CBP enhance gene transcription mainly via three mechanisms (12Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, they create a bridge between the transcription factors and basal transcription machinery. Second, they act as a scaffold for the assembly of multiprotein complexes, including transcription factors and cofactors through their CH1, CH3, and KIX domains, etc. The simultaneous interaction between p300/CBP and multiple transcription factors is thought to contribute to the transcriptional synergy. For example, p300 cooperates with Sp1 to regulate p21waf1/cip1 promoter activation (14Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, it is reported that the acetyl-transferase region of p300 interacts with the DNA-binding domain of Sp1 to regulate the DNA binding activity of Sp1 (15Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Third, p300/CBP possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which acetylates transcription factors and histones and thus activates transcription (16Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russsanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Recently, many studies have reported that p300 and CBP are direct targets of cellular signaling, resulting in their post-translational modifications (17Legube G. Trouche D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Of these modifications, phosphorylation is extensively studied especially in vitro. For example, activated ERK2 phosphorylates GST-p300 (aa 1572–2370) in vitro, and as a result, the transcriptional activity of p300 is enhanced (9Sang N. Stiehl D.P. Bohensky J. Leshchinsky I. Srinivas V. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14013-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The C-terminal phosphorylation of CBP by ERK1 stimulates its HAT activity in vitro (18Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Ait-Si-Ali S. Carlisi D. Ramirez S. Upegui-Gonzalez L.C. Duquet A. Robin P. Rudkin B. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is still not entirely clear how phosphorylation may regulate the p300 or CBP activity in vivo. Basically, it is not known which kinases are responsible for the p300/CBP phosphorylation in vivo, nor is it known exactly where the phosphorylation sites may take place. Most important of all, the functional links between the specific phosphorylation events and the downstream gene regulation remain largely unknown. Up to this point, very few phosphorylation sites on p300/CBP have been identified in vivo. These identified phosphorylation sites from in vivo studies are described as follows. The PKC or AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated Ser-89 phosphorylation of p300 attenuates its HAT activity or its interaction with individual nuclear receptors (20Yuan L.W. Gambee J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40946-40951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Yuan L.W. Soh J.W. Weinstein I.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38341-38344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The growth factor-induced Ser-436 phosphorylation of CBP through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-PKC pathway controls the recruitment of CBP to the transcription complex (23Zanger K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 551-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Ser-301 phosphorylation of CBP by calmodulin kinase IV mediates the CBP-dependent transcriptional activation (24Impey S. Fong A.L. Wang Y. Cardinaux J.R. Fass D.M. Obrietan K. Wayman G.A. Storm D.R. Soderling T.R. Goodman R.H. Neuron. 2002; 34: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Akt-mediated Ser-1834 phosphorylation of p300 increases the p300 recruitment to the ICAM-1 promoter and enhances its associated HAT activity, resulting in the transcriptional activation of ICAM-1 gene (25Huang W.C. Chen C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6592-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have previously proposed a model for the transcriptional regulation of keratin 16 (26Wang Y.N. Chang W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45848-45857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We suggest that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) up-regulates the recruitment of coactivator p300 to the promoter of keratin 16 through the activation of ERK, the last being of critical importance for the EGF regulation of keratin 16. We also show that the recruited p300 functionally cooperates with Sp1 and c-Jun to enhance the gene expression of keratin 16. Furthermore, the HAT domain of p300 is absolutely required for the keratin 16 promoter activation incurred upon EGF treatment. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study how the ERK activation regulated the recruitment of p300, thereby activating the keratin 16 gene expression. We found that the ERK2-mediated C-terminal serine (Ser-2279, Ser-2315, and Ser-2366) phosphorylations of p300 were the major targets by EGF, resulting in the stimulation of its HAT activity and its interaction with Sp1. These ERK2-mediated serine phosphorylation sites on p300 apparently controlled the p300 recruitment to the keratin 16 promoter, thus explaining the activation of the transcriptional activity of keratin 16 caused by EGF. Furthermore, this study was the first to identify the exact ERK2 phosphorylation sites on p300 in vivo.

Antibodies against HA and affinity matrix-conjugated to HA were from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents used were of the highest purity obtainable. Cell Culture and EGF Treatment—HaCaT cells, a spontaneously immortalized human epidermal keratinocyte cell line, were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in 10-cm plastic dishes containing 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. A431 cells, a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, were grown in the same condition as HaCaT cells. In this series of experiments, both cells were treated with 30 ng/ml EGF in optimal serum-free conditions, unless stated otherwise. Immunoprecipitation Assay—Nuclear extracts and cell lysates were prepared as described before (27Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (80–1000 μg of protein of each) or lysates (1000–1800 μg of protein of each) were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of p300 antibodies agarose-conjugated, phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies agarose-conjugated, Sp1 antibodies agarose-conjugated, or HA antibodies affinity matrix-conjugated individually in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) under gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated beads were pelleted and washed three times with 500 μl of washing buffer (1× PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Protein was removed from the beads by boiling in 2× SDS loading buffer for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis, as described before (27Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), probed with phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro antibodies, or as indicated. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The commercially obtained full length of recombinant p300 protein was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with recombinant activated or inactivated ERK2 in the presence of 23.3 μm cold ATP in MAPK buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 5× SDS loading buffer and by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. After separation through 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was transferred and followed by Western blot analysis probed with phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro antibodies. In Vitro Acetylation Assay and Nonradioactive Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Assay—The commercially obtained full length of recombinant p300 protein was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay, as described previously, and then mixed with purified 0.5 μg of histone H3 and 2 μg of acetyl-CoA in the presence of acetylation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. In addition, the immunoprecipitates of HA-p300-WT or HA-p300-S3A with or without EGF treatment were subjected to this in vitro acetylation assay. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 5× SDS loading buffer and by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. After separation through a 12% SDS-PAGE, the gel was followed by Western blot analysis probed with acetyl-lysine antibodies. Nonradioactive HAT activity assay was performed by using a HAT assay kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. The commercially obtained full length of recombinant p300 protein was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay as described previously, and nuclear extracts with HA-p300-WT (wild type) or HA-p300-S3A (with Ser-2279, Ser-2315, and Ser-2366 all replaced by alanine) expression treated with or without EGF were subjected to this assay. Briefly, each reaction mixed with 100 μm acetyl-CoA, and 1× HAT assay buffer was incubated on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate pre-coated with histone H3 at 30 °C for 30 min. After washing with 1× Tris-buffered saline for several times, acetylated histones were detected with acetyl-lysine antibodies, followed by the horseradish peroxidase-based colorimetric assay. Transfection with Arrest-In and Reporter Gene Assay—Cells were transfected with plasmids by lipofection using Arrest-In according to the manufacturer's instruction with a slight modification. Cells were replated 24 h before transfection at an optimal cell density (60–80% of confluence) in 2 ml of fresh culture medium in a 3.5-cm plastic dish. For use in transfection, 1 μl of Arrest-In (DNA:Arrest-In = 1:5) was incubated with 0.2 μg of pXK-5-1 luciferase plasmid that contained the EGF-responsive region of the keratin 16 gene (26Wang Y.N. Chang W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45848-45857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or the indicated plasmids as described in each experiment in 60 μl of Opti-MEM medium for 10 min at room temperature. Total DNA concentration for each transfection was matched with HA-pcDNA3.0. Cells were transfected by changing the medium with 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium containing the plasmids and Arrest-In, followed by incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 5 h. After a change of Opti-MEM medium to 2 ml of fresh culture medium and overnight incubation, cells were stimulated with EGF if necessary and then incubated for an additional 24 h. For cells transfected in a 6-cm plastic dish, 2 μg of indicated plasmids as described in each experiment were transfected in 2 ml of Opti-MEM medium, and the residual transfection procedure was similar to that as described above. The luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured by the luciferase assay system and determined as described previously (28Liu Y.W. Arakawa T. Yamamoto S. Chang W.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized per μg of extract protein. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay (DAPA)—The binding assay was performed by mixing nuclear extract proteins, 2 μg of biotinylated keratin 16-specific wild type oligonucleotide, and 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (4%) with a 50% slurry. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rotating. Beads were pelleted and washed three times with cold 1× PBS. The binding proteins were eluted by 2× SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis probed with specific antibodies. 5′-Biotinylated wild type sequence was SpAP (where SpAP is a wild type sequence containing Sp1- and Ap1-binding sites), 5′-biotin-GTTAGGAGGGCCCCGCCTTCCCCAGG-3′ (27Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Stable transfectants of HaCaT cells with HA-p300-WT or HA-p300-S3A expression were treated with or without inhibitors for 30 min, followed by EGF treatment for 24 h. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, washed once with 1× PBS, lysed with L1 buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), and then resuspended with L2 buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). The lysates were sonicated to shear the size of DNA to 500–1000 bp. One mg of sonicated extracts was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 m NaCl), followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA at 4 °C for 30 min for pre-cleaning. Immunoprecipitation was performed with specific antibodies and rotating at 4 °C overnight, followed by adding 40 μl of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Immunoprecipitated beads were pelleted and washed with high salt and low salt washing buffer each four times. DNA-protein complex was eluted in an elution buffer (1× Tris-EDTA buffer containing 1% SDS) with rotating at room temperature for 15 min, and the immune complex cross-link was reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight, followed by treatment with 100 μg/reaction proteinase K at 50 °C for 1 h. DNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 45 μl of H2O. L1 buffer, L2 buffer, and dilution buffer contained 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Specific sequences in the immunoprecipitates were detected by PCR amplification. The PCR product was separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining (27Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Construction and Purification of GST-p300 Fusion Proteins—To create various GST-p300 fragments, PCR-generated fragments encoding amino acids 2–331, 302–670, 565–966, 952–1145, 1140–1570, 1570–1968, 1964–2197, and 2188–2375 of human p300 were inserted into the SalI/NotI sites of pGEX4T-1 individually. In addition, these constructs were subjected to QuikChange □ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit for obtaining single point or triple points mutations of GST-p300 fragments. Escherichia coli containing expression vectors of respective GST-p300 fragment were cultured in LB medium and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–6 h at 18–37 °C as indicated. Cells were harvested, and incubated in 1× PBS buffer containing 2 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A at 37 °C for 30 min. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B at 4 °C for 2 h to overnight as indicated, followed by elution with elution buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 9.6), 20 mm glutathione, and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 30 min twice. These elutions were stored at -70 °C until used. GST Pulldown Assay—Equal molar concentrations of GST or GST-Sp1 fusion protein were incubated with 250 ng of recombinant p300 protein at 4 °C overnight. The p300 protein that interacted with GST-Sp1 was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot probed with p300 and GST antibodies. Reverse Transcription-PCR—HaCaT cells with stable expression of HA-p300-WT or HA-p300-S3A maintained for 2 days in serum-free medium were incubated with EGF for 24 h and then harvested. Total RNA was isolated by using the TRIzol RNA extraction kit, and 2 μg of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR with SuperScript™III. Specific primers for keratin 6, 16, 17 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used. The PCR products were separated by 1% agarose-gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. ERK2-dependent Phosphorylation of p300 by EGF—Several studies indicate that direct phosphorylation of p300 or CBP controls their recruitment to the transcription complex (23Zanger K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 551-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Huang W.C. Chen C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6592-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous results indicate that the ERK activation regulates the recruitment of p300 to the keratin 16 promoter (27Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied here whether ERK caused the phosphorylation of p300. At first, we studied the interaction between p300 and ERK by coimmunoprecipitation with p300 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, significant bindings of phospho-ERK2 and ERK2 to p300 in the nucleus were observed in HaCaT cells treated with EGF (IP, compare lane 2 with lane 1). Furthermore, these interactions induced by EGF were blocked by U0126, a specific MEK1 inhibitor (Fig. 1A, IP, compare lane 4 with lane 2), which presented a similar pattern of endogenous protein expressions (Fig. 1A, Nuclear extracts). Next, to confirm whether p300 was a direct substrate of ERK2, an in vitro kinase assay was performed by using phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro antibodies. The antibodies were chosen because the minimal ERK consensus phosphoacceptor motif is Ser/Thr-Pro (10Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, purified full-length p300 protein was phosphorylated by recombinant activated ERK2-A in vitro (lane 2). Inactivated ERK2-I was here used as a negative control (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The inputs of p300 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) and ERK2 (lanes 5 and 6) were shown as equal. To further confirm the phosphorylation of p300 by activated ERK2-A in vitro was not because of the different binding affinities between purified p300 protein and these two recombinant ERK2 proteins, immunoprecipitation assay with p300 antibodies was then performed. The results shown in Fig. 1C indicated that both activated ERK2-A and inactivated ERK2-I had similar binding affinities to p300 protein in vitro (middle panel, lanes 3 and 4). We then assessed whether EGF induced phosphorylation of p300 in vivo. The p300 protein was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extracts of HaCaT cells with p300 antibodies and then immunoblotted with phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro antibodies. The results are shown in Fig. 1D. EGF induced the phosphorylation of p300 in a time-dependent manner. The induction of p300 phosphorylation by EGF was maximized at 30 min (Fig. 1D, lane 3) and sustained at least up to 90 min (lane 6) after EGF treatment. It was also observed that this EGF-induced phosphorylation of p300 was dose-dependent (see supplemental Fig. S1A, middle panel). These results showed that the phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated p300 was maximized when HaCaT cells were treated with EGF for 30 ng/ml. Similar results were observed in A431 cells (Fig. 1E). When A431 cells were transiently overexpressed with HA-p300-WT (wild type) and then the lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies"

Here, we show that a major fibromodulin-binding site for collagen type I is located in leucine-rich repeat 11 in the C terminus of the leucine-rich repeat domain. We identified Glu-353 and Lys-355 in repeat 11 as essential for binding, and the synthetic peptide RLDGNEIKR, including Glu-353 and Lys-355, inhibits the binding of fibromodulin to collagen in vitro. Fibromodulin and lumican compete for the same binding region on collagen, and fibromodulin can inhibit the binding of lumican to collagen type I. However, the peptide RLDGNEIKR does not inhibit the binding of lumican to collagen, suggesting separate but closely situated fibromodulin- and lumican-binding sites in collagen. The collagen-binding Glu-353 and Lys-355 residues in fibromodulin are exposed on the exterior of the β-sheet-loop structure of the leucine-rich repeat, which resembles the location of interacting residues in other leucine-rich repeat proteins, e.g. decorin.

Collagen fibrils in tendon of fibromodulin-deficient mice are irregularly shaped with a higher proportion of thin fibrils, in contrast to fibrils formed in wild type mice (9Svensson L. Aszodi A.

In addition, fibromodulin also binds collagen type XII (16Font B. Eichenberger D. Rosenberg L.M. van der Rest M.

It has also been proposed that fibromodulin and other collagen-binding SLRPs have a function in protecting collagen from collagenase degradation in connective tissues (18Geng Y. McQuillan D. Roughley P.J. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Genomic analysis suggests a role for fibromodulin in metastasis (19Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S.

Fibromodulin is one of just 14 genes progressively changed in expression with age and in progeria (21Ly D.H. Lockhart D.J. Lerner R.A. Schultz P.G.

The fibromodulin core protein is composed of 12 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), each containing an average of 24 amino acid residues.

Nivens C.M. Reiss L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20634-20640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No function has been ascribed to these carbohydrate chains, and it is known that their absence does not affect the interaction with collagen (31Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The precise fibromodulin-binding site for collagen has not been determined, although it was hypothesized to be present in the C-terminal end of the protein core (31Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is important to characterize the fibromodulin-collagen interaction to distinguish it from other SLRP-collagen interactions. Understanding the influence of the individual SLRPs on the structure and function of collagen matrices could clarify their mechanism of concerted action. We recently demonstrated that a SYIRIADTNIT sequence in decorin binds collagen type I. In this study, we have used protein fragments, site-directed mutagenesis, and synthetic peptides to locate the collagen-binding site in fibromodulin. Homology Modeling of Fibromodulin—The tertiary structure of fibromodulin was modeled with Swiss-PdbViewer software (32Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of decorin (Protein Data Bank 1xku) as template. Expression of GST-tagged Fibromodulin Fragments in Bacteria—Bovine fibromodulin cDNA (GenBank™ Accession Number X16485) was used as a template in PCR to amplify cDNAs encoding different regions of fibromodulin. The fragments covered the following primary sequences: FmN-4 (amino acids 19–192), FmN-2 (amino acids 19–144), Fm3–4 (amino acids 138–192), Fm5–7 (amino acids 185–259), Fm8–12 (amino acids 259–375), and Fm11–12 (amino acids 324–375). The primers used for PCR are listed in supplemental Fig. 1. The amplified cDNAs were digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and SmaI and ligated into the vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs were sequenced to confirm the identity and transfected into BL21 Escherichia coli, and proteins were expressed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were purified under native conditions by glutathione affinity chromatography, as described previously (33Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and dialyzed against PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 prior to use. The protein concentration was determined with Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent (Pierce). Expression of His-tagged Fibromodulin in Bacteria—Wild type fibromodulin cDNA was used as a template in PCR to amplify fibromodulin cDNA. The primers used for the PCR are listed in supplemental Fig. 1. The amplified cDNA was digested with XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes and ligated into a pET-27b(+) expression vector (Novagen), and the His-tagged protein was expressed in Rosetta cells (Novagen). Fibromodulin was purified from the periplasmic compartment using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to use, the protein was dialyzed against PBS. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of Mutated Fibromodulins in Bacteria—Fibromodulin cDNA was used for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II kit and pBluescript® II KS(+/–) cloning vector (both from Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were the following: R348S, D350N, E353Q, K355M, and R356S. The mutated fibromodulin cDNA was then transferred to pET-27b(+) expression vector by digestion with XhoI and BamHI and subsequent ligation. FmodR348S, FmodD350N, FmodE353Q, FmodK355M, and FmodR356S were expressed and purified as described above. Mammalian Expression of Fibromodulin and Lumican—Fibromodulin and lumican cDNA (GenBank Accession Number BC007038) was amplified by PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Fig. 1. cDNA was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI and ligated into the pCEP4 BM40-hisEK expression vector (34Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegard D. Sommarin Y. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40695-40702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), attaching the fibromodulin or lumican cDNA to His tag DNA in the N terminus. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing and used to transfect human embryonic kidney 293 cells by electroporation, as described previously (35Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). After 24 h, hygromycin (Invivogen) was added to a concentration of 150 μg/ml. After 1 week, single clones were picked, incubated in medium containing [35S]sulfate, and analyzed for proteoglycan expression, as described previously (35Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The proteoglycan-expressing clones were cultured in EX-Cell 325 PF CHO protein-free medium (JRH Biosciences) for 12 days with medium changes every 3 days. The medium was dialyzed against 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, and proteoglycans were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen). Proteoglycans were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides RLDGNEIKR and RLDGNQIMR were purchased from Schafer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark) and dissolved in PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Calorimetry was performed using a VP-ITC (MicroCal). Samples (fibromodulin fragments and acid-solubilized collagen) were dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Titrations were performed by injections of 10-μl aliquots of 20 μm fibromodulin fragments into ITC sample cell (volume 1.345 ml) containing 2 μm collagen in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. ITC data were corrected for the heat of dilution of the titrant by subtracting enthalpies of sample injection into protein-free buffer. Data were fitted with Origin software using the non-linear least squares minimization method using one site-binding model (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) to calculate the dissociation constant (KD). Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD data were collected with a J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO). Samples were at concentration of 1 μm in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, buffer, in a 1-mm path length cuvette, at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded from 200 to 250 nm, with a scanning rate of 10 nm/min and an accumulation of three scans. Solid-phase Collagen Binding Assay—Microtiter 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated for 16 h using 10 μg/ml acetic acid-extracted mouse tail collagen in acetic acid. The wells were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. After a single wash using PBS with 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (wash buffer), the GST-tagged fibromodulin fragments were added, and after 3 h, the wells were washed five times with the wash buffer. The amounts proteins bound to collagen were determined using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and reduced glutathione, as described previously (36Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar procedure was followed for assays with His-tagged full-length fibromodulin and mutated fibromodulins, but the detection was done with rabbit anti-His tag antibody ab9108 (Abcam) diluted 1:250 in the wash buffer and with swine anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (DAKO) diluted 1:500 in the wash buffer as well as with detection with phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). For peptide inhibition assays, the peptide in different concentrations was added to fibromodulin or lumican prior to incubation. Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assay—The assays were performed as described previously (37Kalamajski S. Aspberg A. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16062-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Pepsin-extracted acid-solubilized collagen (Vitrogen) was neutralized and diluted (167 pm) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with fibromodulin or mutated fibromodulins at 4 °C. Solutions were degassed and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 h in a spectrophotometer, where the absorbance was continuously recorded at 400 nm. We used bacteria to express the GST-tagged fibromodulin fragments FmN-4, FmN-2, Fm3–4, Fm5–7, Fm8–12, and Fm11–12 to study the interaction between fibromodulin and collagen type I (Fig. 1A). The collagen binding of these fragments was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Fm8–12 and Fm11–12 had the same KD = 1 μm, and Fm5–7 had a weak binding enthalpy, whereas the other fragments had negligible affinity (Fig. 1, B–G). Fm8–12 and Fm11–12 also interacted with collagen in a solid-phase assay (KD = 3nm), Fm5–7 had low affinity (KD = 10 nm, by extrapolation), and the other fragments had no affinity (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, Fm8–12 and Fm11–12 could inhibit the binding of mammalian-expressed full-length fibromodulin at Ki = 4 μm, in contrast to the other non-binding fragments. Fm5–7 had a low inhibitory effect (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Collagen binding of fibromodulin mutants.

Residues exposed on the exterior of the β-sheet-loop region of LRR 11 and also conserved in six species were mutated (Fig. 3A). The mutations were R348S, D350N, E353Q, K355M, and R356S. Mutated fibromodulins were expressed in E. coli and purified from the periplasmic compartment to obtain proteins with intrachain disulfide bonds. Collagen binding was determined in a solidphase binding assays. Wild type fibromodulin had an affinity similar to FmodR348S and FmodR356S (KD = 2.5 nm), whereas FmodD350N, FmodE353Q, and FmodK355M had no collagen affinity (Fig. 3B). The mutated fibromodulins were subjected to far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy to exclude possible structural changes that could affect the collagen binding. FmodD350N had a marginally blue-shifted CD spectrum (trough at 219 nm), as compared with the spectra of wild type fibromodulin and the other mutants (troughs at around 222 nm) (Fig. 3C). CD spectra of FmodR348S and FmodR356S were similar to wild type fibromodulin (data not shown). To clarify the influence of D350N on collagen binding, we incorporated the mutations in the collagen-binding fibromodulin fragment Fm11–12 and analyzed the collagen affinity. The D350N mutation had no effect on collagen binding of Fm11–12, whereas the other mutations had similar effects as those in full-length fibromodulin (data not shown). This suggests that the mutation D350N causes structural changes in full-length fibromodulin affecting the collagen binding. We analyzed how the mutated fibromodulin variants influenced the collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro. Incubation of 100 μg/ml acid-solubilized collagen with wild type fibromodulin at neutral pH and 37 °C led to a hampered collagen fibril formation with low final turbidity, and 2 μg/ml fibromodulin completely inhibited the collagen fibril formation (Fig. 4A). FmodR348S and FmodR356S restrained the fibrillogenesis as efficiently as wild type fibromodulin (Fig. 4, B and F), whereas FmodD350N, FmodE353Q, and FmodK355M had a reduced inhibition of fibril formation (Fig. 4, C–E). A synthetic peptide RLDGNEIKR, which encompasses Glu-353 and Lys-355 in LRR 11, was used in a solid-phase assay to inhibit the binding of mammalian-expressed fibromodulin or lumican to collagen. The peptide inhibited the fibromodulin-collagen interaction at Ki = 1.5 μm, whereas the lumican-collagen interaction was unaffected. In contrast, lumican binding to collagen could be inhibited by fibromodulin (data not shown) as reported previously (13Svensson L. Narlid I. Oldberg A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The control peptide RLDGNQIMR, with E353Q and K355M mutations, did not inhibit the fibromodulin-collagen binding (Fig. 5). We demonstrate that fibromodulin binds collagen via LRR 11 and the mutations E353Q or K355M impair the collagen binding. The synthetic peptide RLDGNEIKR, encompassing Glu-353 and Lys-355 in LRR 11, inhibits the fibromodulin-collagen interaction in vitro. Also, mutation of Asp-350 impaired collagen binding of full-length fibromodulin, but the CD spectrum of FmodD350N was blue-shifted as compared with the spectrum of wild type fibromodulin and the other mutated fibromodulins. In addition, fibromodulin fragment Fm11–12 with the mutation D350N retained the collagen binding. Presumably, this mutation in full-length fibromodulin produces structural changes that affect the exposure of the collagen-binding site, whereas the smaller fragment retains the collagen affinity due to less influence by the surrounding structures. We conclude that fibromodulin interacts with collagen via neighboring glutamate and lysine residues located in the β-sheet-loop region of LRR 11. These residues are most likely exposed on the outer surface of the protein. Our results are supported by the study of Font et al. (31Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), showing that fibromodulin lacking the C-terminal region is not able to coprecipitate with collagen fibrils. Interestingly, interacting amino acids in other LRR proteins are also located in the β-sheet-loop region of LRR domains. We have recently identified Asp-210 of decorin as a critical collagen-binding residue (37Kalamajski S. Aspberg A. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16062-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, e.g. Asp-175 and Glu-128 of glycoprotein Ib are crucial for complex formation with von Willebrand factor (38Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and Asp-435 of ribonuclease inhibitor is important for binding RNase A and angiogenin (39Chen C.Z. Shapiro R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In these cases, the binding residues are exposed on the outer surface of the β-sheet-loop of a LRR domain. Similar locations of binding sites can be found in other LRR proteins (40Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), implying conserved binding patterns. Fibromodulin inhibits the rate of collagen fibril formation in vitro and lowers the final fibril turbidity (15Hedbom E. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, fibromodulin impairs the fibril growth by binding to collagen, in effect creating thinner collagen fibrils. This inhibition of fibril formation depends on proper intrachain disulfide bonds in fibromodulin (31Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fibromodulin expressed in bacteria and purified from the periplasm inhibits collagen fibrillogenesis, indicating correct fibromodulin intrachain disulfide bond formation. Also, reduction of bacterially expressed fibromodulin abolishes the inhibition of collagen fibril formation and confirms the results by Font et al. (31Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (results not shown). The inhibitory effect is prominent at a collagen:fibromodulin molar ratio of 1:7 (collagen molecular mass 300 kDa and fibromodulin molecular mass 42 kDa) (Fig. 4). A similar inhibition was observed using FmodR348S and FmodR356S. FmodE353Q and FmodK355M lost their major influence on collagen fibrillogenesis, although some inhibition remained. This may be due to a weaker collagen-binding site, possibly located in LRRs 5–7. Fm5–7 binds weakly to collagen (Fig. 2A) and partially inhibits the fibromodulin-collagen interaction (Fig. 2B). The peptide RLDGNEIKR inhibits the fibromodulin-collagen type I interaction at Ki = 1.5 μm. However, the inhibition of fibromodulin binding is partial and implies additional weak cooperating collagen-binding sites in fibromodulin (Fig. 5). This additional binding site may be located in LRRs 5–7. Fibromodulin and lumican compete for binding to collagen type I, and the two proteins appear to share a common collagen-binding site (13Svensson L. Narlid I. Oldberg A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the peptide RLDGNEIKR does not inhibit lumican binding. Full-length fibromodulin inhibits the binding of lumican to collagen, indicating that the two proteins have overlapping collagen-binding sites. Presumably, the two proteins cannot simultaneously bind collagen for sterical reasons. The expression of lumican and fibromodulin varies during the development of tendon. Lumican appears to control the early stage assembly of thin fibrils, whereas fibromodulin has a role in the later stages of fibril growth, contributing to the mechanical strength. Most likely, the concerted action of several SLRPs affects the interaction between collagen monomers and fibrils and contributes to the shaping of the collagen matrix structure and function. Binding of SLRPs to collagen monomers and the gap zone of the assembling collagen fibrils may regulate the interchain collagen cross-linking by juxtaposing collagen monomers. This may direct the initial Schiff base formation between lysine and/or hydroxylysine residues and ultimately control the mature interchain cross-linking. Indeed, the collagen cross-linking and assembly may be affected in fibromodulin, lumican, and decorin knock-out mice, as the phenotypes of these mice reveal structurally and functionally altered collagen matrices.

https://openalex.org/W2100503402,"To investigate the role of the angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during pregnancy and lactation, we used mice in which VEGF had been inactivated in mammary gland epithelial cells. Pups born to mutant mothers failed to thrive, displaying little milk in their stomachs. However, when they were transferred to control mothers they developed normally. Investigation of the mammary gland morphology revealed that lobulo-alveolar expansion into the fat pad was not complete in lactating mutant glands, and an accumulation of fat globules was evident in their secretory epithelium. In contrast to control glands, lactating mutant glands failed to up-regulate mRNAs for genes involved in milk secretion. Blood vessel density was comparable in pregnant mice of both groups but was only half that of controls in lactating mutant mice. FITC-labeled albumin injected intravenously (i.v.) into lactating mice extravasated rapidly and accumulated in the mammary gland epithelial cells in control animals, but was almost completely retained within the vessels in the mutants. Injection of recombinant VEGF i.v. reversed this effect. These findings demonstrate that mammary epithelium-derived VEGF is partially dispensable for angiogenesis during pregnancy and lactation, and by regulating vascular function during lactation, this factor is crucial to mammary gland differentiation and milk production."

In this study, we employed an in situ disulfide cross-linking strategy to monitor ligand-induced conformational changes in a series of cysteine-substituted mutant M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The observed disulfide cross-linking patterns indicated that muscarinic agonists trigger a separation of the N-terminal segment of the cytoplasmic tail (helix 8) from the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane domain I. In contrast, inverse muscarinic agonists were found to increase the proximity between these two receptor regions. These findings provide a structural basis for the opposing biological effects of muscarinic agonists and inverse agonists. This study also provides the first piece of direct structural information as to how the conformations induced by these two functionally different classes of ligands differ at the molecular level.

GPCR-dependent signaling pathways play critical roles in regulating an extraordinarily large number of important physiological functions. The major structural hallmark shared by all GPCRs is a transmembrane (TM) core formed by a bundle of seven TM helices (TM I–VII) (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 2Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 3Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J.

A better understanding of how GPCRs function at the molecular level is considered essential for the development of novel classes of clinically useful drugs. The structural features of the ligand binding and G protein coupling domains have been studied extensively for a large number of GPCRs (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 2Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 3Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J.

Likewise, the conformational changes involved in the activation of the photoreceptor rhodopsin have been mapped in considerable detail (7Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 8Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R.

Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little is known about the sequence of molecular events that trigger the activation of GPCRs that bind diffusible ligands such as neurotransmitters and hormones. According to their pharmacological characteristics, GPCR ligands are currently classified into agonists, neutral antagonists, and inverse agonists (12Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 13Strange P.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Inverse agonists are drugs that can reduce GPCR-mediated G protein activation observed in the absence of ligands (basal GPCR activity). In fact, accumulating evidence suggests that most classic GPCR antagonists need to be reclassified as inverse agonists (12Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 13Strange P.G. Trends Pharmacol.

At present, little is known about the nature of the structural changes that inverse agonists induce in their target receptors. Biophysical studies carried out with different adrenergic receptor subtypes strongly suggest that adrenergic agonists endowed with different efficacies, including inverse agonists, induce or stabilize different receptor conformations (15Gether U.

To shed light on this issue, we have used the rat M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypic class I GPCR (21Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 22Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), as a model system. To monitor ligand-induced changes in receptor structure, we employed an in situ disulfide cross-linking strategy that allows the detection of disulfide bond formation between Cys residues that are adjacent to each other in the three-dimensional structure of the receptor (23Ward S.D.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One major advantage of this strategy is that ligand-dependent conformational changes can be detected in receptors present in their native membrane environment, without the need for any receptor purification and reconstitution steps. In this study, we examined whether different classes of muscarinic ligands (full versus inverse muscarinic agonists) had different effects on the relative orientation of helix 8 relative to the C terminus of TM I (Fig. 1). Helix 8 represents a cytoplasmic α-helical extension of TM VII to which it is connected via a short linker sequence (Fig. 1) (27Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that helix 8 plays an important role in productive receptor/G protein coupling (6Wess J. Pharmacol.

Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), complimented by biophysical and biochemical studies (11Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), indicate that several residues contained within helix 8 are located close to the cytoplasmic end of TM I. We therefore hypothesized that Cys residues substituted into this segment of TM I might serve as useful reporters to detect potential ligand-induced movements of helix 8 in disulfide cross-linking studies. Specifically, we introduced pairs of Cys residues into a modified version of the M3 muscarinic receptor that lacked most native Cys residues and contained two factor Xa cleavage sites within the third intracellular loop (this receptor is referred to as “M3′(3C)-Xa” receptor throughout this study; see “Experimental Procedures” for details; Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that the M3′(3C)-Xa receptor exhibits ligand binding and G protein coupling properties similar to the wild-type M3 muscarinic receptor (35Zeng F.Y. Hopp A. Söldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We generated 20 double Cys mutant M3 receptors, all of which contained one Cys substitution within the cytoplasmic end of TM I (Ala91–Asn95) and a second one within the N-terminal segment of helix 8 (Lys548–Arg551; Fig. 1). Disulfide cross-linking studies using membranes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells showed that muscarinic agonists and inverse muscarinic agonists had different effects on the efficiency of disulfide bond formation in specific double Cys mutant M3 receptors. In conjunction with a three-dimensional model of the M3 muscarinic receptor, this study provides the first piece of direct structural information as to how the receptor conformations induced (or stabilized) by GPCR agonists and inverse GPCR agonists differ from each other at the molecular level. Materials—Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), acetylcholine bromide, atropine sulfate, N-methylscopolamine bromide, cupric sulfate (CuSO4), 1,10-phenanthroline, N-ethylmaleimide, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. [3H]NMS (82.0 Ci/mmol) and myo-[3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Factor Xa protease and digitonin were from Roche Applied Science. Precast Novex Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels and SeeBlue Plus 2 prestained molecular mass standards were purchased from Invitrogen. Hybond™ ECL™ nitrocellulose membranes, anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, ECL™ detection reagents, and Hyperfilm™ ECL™ chemiluminescence film were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The β-actin antibody (human) used was from Cell Signaling. All other reagents used were of the highest grade commercially available. CuSO4 was mixed with 1,10-phenanthroline at a molar ratio of 1:3 (32Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The concentrations indicated in the text for the Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3 complex refer to molar copper concentrations. Construction of Cys-substituted Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptors—All Cys substitutions were introduced into a pCD-based expression plasmid coding for a modified version of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor referred to as M3′(3C)-Xa (35Zeng F.Y. Hopp A. Söldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The M3′(3C)-Xa receptor construct contains an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag and lacks all five potential N-terminal N-glycosylation sites and most endogenous Cys residues, except for Cys140, Cys220, and Cys532, as described previously (35Zeng F.Y. Hopp A. Söldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the central portion of the i3 loop (Ala274–Lys469) was replaced by two factor Xa cleavage sites. Cys residues were substituted into the M3′(3C)-Xa construct by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identity of all mutant receptors was confirmed by sequencing the entire receptor coding sequences. Transient Expression of Cys-substituted Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptors in COS-7 Cells—The M3′(3C)-Xa receptor construct and all M3′(3C)-Xa-derived Cys-substituted mutant receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. About 24 h prior to transfections, ∼1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. Cells were transfected with 4 μg/dish of receptor plasmid DNA using the Lipofectamine Plus kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To achieve higher receptor expression levels, transfected cells were incubated with 1 μm atropine for the last 24 h of culture, as described previously (23Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Preparation of Membranes from Transfected COS-7 Cells—To prepare cell membranes, COS-7 cells were harvested ∼48 h after transfections. Initially, cells were washed twice (10 min each wash) with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. This washing step was included to ensure the complete removal of atropine that was present in the culture medium during the last 24 h of culture. Subsequently, 2 ml of ice-cold buffer A (25 mm sodium phosphate and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) was added to each 100-mm dish, followed by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C. Cells were then scraped off the plates and homogenized using a Polytron tissue homogenizer (setting 5; 20 s). After a 15-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g (4 °C), membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer A (1 ml/100-mm dish), rehomogenized, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Radioligand Binding Studies—The NMS and carbachol binding properties of the receptors analyzed in this study were determined in radioligand binding assays. [3H]NMS saturation and carbachol competition binding studies were carried out essentially as described previously (24Han S.J. Hamdan F.F. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. Brichta L. Bloodworth L.M. Li J.H. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24870-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, membrane homogenates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells (∼10–20 μg of membrane protein per tube) were incubated with the muscarinic antagonist/inverse agonist, [3H]NMS, for 2 h (22 °C) in 1 ml of buffer A. In saturation binding assays, six different [3H]NMS concentrations ranging from 20 to 3,000 pm were employed. In competition binding assays, a fixed concentration of [3H]NMS (500 pm) was present in all tubes, using 10 different concentrations of the cold competitor, carbachol. Nonspecific binding was assessed as binding remaining in the presence of 1 μm atropine. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/C Brandel filters, followed by three washes (∼4 ml per wash) with ice-cold distilled water. The amount of radioactivity that remained bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. To analyze the saturation and carbachol competition binding data, the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 4.0 (GraphPad) was used. Measurement of Receptor-mediated Phosphatidylinositol Hydrolysis—To study whether the different mutant receptors analyzed in this study retained the ability to activate G proteins, we determined carbachol-mediated increases in intracellular inositol monophosphate (IP) levels. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells grown in 6-well plates were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (3 μCi/ml) for the last 20–24 h of culture. On the day of the assay, the labeled cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of carbachol in the presence of 10 mm LiCl for 1 h at 37 °C. The IP fraction was isolated and quantitated as described previously (24Han S.J. Hamdan F.F. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. Brichta L. Bloodworth L.M. Li J.H. Wess J. J. Biol.

The nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 4.0 (GraphPad) was used to derive EC50 and Emax values from carbachol concentration-response curves.

In brief, receptor-containing membranes prepared from one 100-mm dish (∼1 mg of protein) were suspended in 1 ml of buffer A containing 25 μm Cu(II)-phenanthroline, either in the presence or in the absence of different muscarinic ligands. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at room temperature (22 °C) and then terminated by the addition of EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm each), followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. Membrane proteins were then solubilized by incubating samples with 1.2% digitonin, as described by Han et al. (24Han S.J. Hamdan F.F. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. Brichta L. Bloodworth L.M. Li J.H. Wess J.

Factor Xa-treated membrane lysates were incubated with Laemmli loading buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, either under nonreducing or under reducing conditions (in the absence or presence of 50 mm DTT, respectively). Samples were then immediately loaded onto 10–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels and run at 125 V in the presence of 0.1% SDS.

M3 receptor proteins were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents and autoradiography. To quantitate the intensities of immunoreactive bands, we used scanning densitometry employing the program NIH ImageJ. Generation of Cys-substituted Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptors—All Cys substitutions were introduced into the M3′(3C)-Xa construct, a modified version of the M3 muscarinic receptor lacking most native Cys residues and containing a pair of factor Xa cleavage sites within the third intracellular loop (Fig. 1). We generated 20 double Cys mutant M3 receptors harboring one Cys substitution within the cytoplasmic end of TM I (Ala91–Asn95) and a second one within the N-terminal segment of helix 8 (Lys548–Arg551; Fig. 1; Table 1). All receptor constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and subsequently characterized in pharmacological and biochemical studies.TABLE 1Ligand binding and functional properties of double Cys mutant M3 muscarinic receptors analyzed in this study The indicated double Cys mutant M3 muscarinic receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells.

We first characterized the ligand binding properties of the 20 double Cys mutant M3 receptors in radioligand binding studies, using [3H]NMS as a radioligand. NMS, like atropine and essentially all other classic muscarinic antagonists, has recently been reclassified as an inverse muscarinic agonist (36Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Brauner-Osborne H.

[3H]NMS saturation binding studies with membranes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells showed that all double Cys mutant M3 receptors were expressed at levels ≥1 pmol/mg membrane protein (Table 1). Moreover, all receptors were able to bind [3H]NMS with high affinity (range of [3H]NMS KD values, 241–667 pm; Table 1). To determine the affinity of the different mutant M3 receptors for the muscarinic agonist carbachol, we carried out [3H]NMS/carbachol inhibition binding experiments. These studies showed that all double Cys mutant M3 receptors were able to bind carbachol with affinities that were similar to or even higher than that observed with the M3′(3C)-Xa receptor from which all mutant receptors were derived (range of carbachol Ki values, ∼1–14 μm; Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2127886621,"The acrosome reaction is a regulated Ca2+-dependent secretion event required for sperm-egg interaction. Previous studies indicate that the process requires Rab3-dependent tethering of membranes, SNARE complex assembly, and Ca2+-mediated activation of synaptotagmin. Sperm are transcriptionally and translationally inactive; hence, most studies of the exocytosis mechanism are limited to membrane-permeant reagents. The effect of proteins involved in exocytosis has been assessed only in permeabilized cells. Polyarginine peptides are a powerful tool for delivering macromolecules to cells. Most reports indicate that membrane translocation of arginine-containing proteins requires endocytosis; therefore, this strategy might not be useful in sperm. However, our results indicate that GST and Rab3A, when fused with an arginine-rich peptide, were able to translocate into sperm. Moreover, membrane-permeant Rab3A initiated exocytosis when prenylated and activated with GTP. We show here that a key event after the cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase caused by progesterone is the activation of Rab3A. When active Rab3A is introduced into sperm, Ca2+ in the extracellular medium and in the cytoplasm is dispensable. However, a Ca2+ efflux from inside the acrosome is still required to achieve exocytosis. In conclusion, arginine-containing proteins can penetrate the sperm plasma membrane and thus are valuable tools to study sperm physiology in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035473830,Beagle dogs between 7.6 and 8.8 years of age administered a twice daily supplement of alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) over approximately 2 months made significantly fewer errors in reaching the learning criterion on two landmark discrimination tasks compared to controls administered a methylcellulose placebo. Testing started after a 5 day wash-in. The dogs were also tested on a variable delay version of a previously acquired spatial memory task; results were not significant. The improved performance on the landmark task of dogs supplemented with LA + ALC provides evidence of the effectiveness of this supplement in improving discrimination and allocentric spatial learning. We suggest that long-term maintenance on LA and ALC may be effective in attenuating age-associated cognitive decline by slowing the rate of mitochondrial decay and cellular aging.
https://openalex.org/W2048593274,"Hepatocytes are polarized epithelial cells whose function depends upon their ability to distinguish between the apical and basolateral surfaces that are located at intercellular tight junctions. It has been proposed that the signaling cascades originating at these junctions influence cellular activity by controlling gene expression in the cell nucleus. To assess the validity of this proposal with regard to hepatocytes, we depleted expression of the tight junction protein junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) in the HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Reduction of JAM-A resulted in a striking change in cell morphology, with cells forming sheets 1-2 cells thick instead of the normal multilayered clusters. In the absence of JAM-A, other tight junction proteins were mislocalized, and pseudocanaliculi, which form the apical face of the hepatocyte, were consequently absent. There was a strong transcriptional induction of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin in cells with reduced levels of JAM-A. This increase in E-cadherin was partially responsible for the observed alterations in cell morphology and mislocalization of tight junction proteins. We therefore propose the existence of a novel mechanism of cross-talk between specific components of tight and adherens junctions that can be utilized to regulate adhesion between hepatic cells.

We therefore propose the existence of a novel mechanism of cross-talk between specific components of tight and adherens junctions that can be utilized to regulate adhesion between hepatic cells. Hepatocytes, the primary cell type within the liver parenchyma, are polarized epithelial cells. The apical surface of hepatocytes is defined as the region of the cell that generates bile canaliculi, which act as a conduit for bile secretion and therefore mediate the exocrine activities of the liver. The membrane at the basal surface of hepatocytes faces the sinusoidal endothelium and is actively involved in exchange of nutrients, toxins, and metabolites to and from the blood supply. The segregation of exocrine and endocrine functions via distinct hepatocyte membrane domains requires maintenance of cell polarity, which in turn is partly dependent upon the formation of tight junctions. Tight junctions are areas of localized contact found at the apical region of adjacent epithelial cells (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar) and are the foremost junctional complexes abutting the edges of bile canaliculi in hepatocytes. The traditional view of tight junctions is that they serve as a paracellular seal that regulates the flow of small molecules and ions and inhibits the flow of lipids and membrane-enriched proteins (1Farquhar M.G.

Nature. 1981; 294: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition to their structural role, recent reports have highlighted the importance of tight junctions in regulating signaling pathways from the apical cell surface to the nucleus, as well as from the interior of the cell to the surface (3Ebnet K.

JAM-A (also called JAM, JAM-1, or F11 receptor) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is localized to tight junctions of both epithelial and endothelial cells (14Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Numerous studies have shown that JAM-A is linked to signaling cascades, both directly and indirectly, through its interactions with other tight junction proteins (4Matter K. Balda M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 5Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1213-C1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 18Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), making JAM-A a good candidate for investigation. We found that depletion of JAM-A from HepG2 cells by RNAi caused a dramatic change in cell morphology, mislocalization of other junction proteins, and a significant reduction in pseudocanaliculi formation. Gene array analyses revealed that expression of multiple genes was altered, including that of E-cadherin that was increased by >5-fold upon loss of JAM-A. The increase in E-cadherin expression occurred as a consequence of an elevated transcriptional response elicited by the E-cadherin proximal promoter (19Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P.

The increase in E-cadherin expression was partially responsible for the changes in cell morphology and tight junction protein mislocalization associated with JAM-A depletion. We conclude that signaling pathways exist in hepatic cells to facilitate a compensatory increase in cell adhesiveness when cell junctions are disrupted. This may reflect a mechanism through which cell junctions are established between nascent hepatocytes following liver damage. short hairpin RNA β-actin E-cadherin junctional adhesion molecule-A small interfering RNA zonula occludens-1 RNA interference reverse transcription Hanks' balanced saline solution bovine serum albumin Madin-Darby canine kidney cells immunofluorescence immunoblotting green fluorescent protein protein-tyrosine phosphatase; receptor type M dipeptidyl-peptidase 4. short hairpin RNA β-actin E-cadherin junctional adhesion molecule-A small interfering RNA zonula occludens-1 RNA interference reverse transcription Hanks' balanced saline solution bovine serum albumin Madin-Darby canine kidney cells immunofluorescence immunoblotting green fluorescent protein protein-tyrosine phosphatase; receptor type M dipeptidyl-peptidase 4.

Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To generate lentiviruses, 293T cells were transfected with 4 μg of transfer plasmid and 2 μg of each helper plasmid using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatants containing virus were collected 48 h post-transfection, filtered through 0.45-μm filters (Corning), and directly applied to HepG2 cells with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) to transduce cells. Cells transduced with virus containing the puromycin resistance gene were maintained with 4 μg/ml puromycin in the medium, whereas those transduced with virus containing either IRES-GFP or CMV-GFP were selected using flow cytometry. JAM-Amut cells were generated by sequential transduction with JAM-Ai2 and JAM-Amut lentiviruses. JAM-Ai1/E-cadherin-i1 cells were generated by sequential transduction with JAM-Ai1 and E-cadherin-i1 lentiviruses. All cell populations were polyclonal containing a large population of stably infected cells, and all cell populations were generated using at least two independent infections. Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein lysates of cultured cells were prepared by lysing cells in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing the following protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were quantitated by the Bradford method using the protein assay from Bio-Rad. Protein (35 μg) was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature, probed with primary antibody diluted into TBST + 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at 4 °C, and finally probed with secondary antibody diluted into TBST + 1%BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications, and membranes were exposed to film. Fold changes were determined by using an AlphaImager Imaging System (Alpha Innotech) and normalizing to β-actin expression. Immunofluorescence—HepG2 cells were washed in HBSS (Invitrogen) and fixed in 100% cold ethanol for 30 min at -20 °C (for DPPIV staining, cells were fixed in acetone for 5 min at -20 °C). HBSS containing 3% BSA was applied for 1 h at room temperature for blocking, and primary antibody diluted in HBSS plus 3% BSA was added overnight at 4 °C, and secondary antibody diluted in HBSS plus 1% BSA was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using TO-PRO-3 iodide (Invitrogen). A Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscopic imaging system was utilized to acquire images. A Leica 63× oil, 1.32-0.6 aperture, HCX PL APO CS objective, and Leica confocal software were used in all confocal images. Electron Microscopy—Cells were either grown on tissue culture plastic or Thermanox® plastic coverslips, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer or in buffer supplemented with either 1% lanthanum nitrate or 0.05% ruthenium red (kept in the dark) for 3 h (24Luft J.H.

Cell Biol. 1970; 45: 272-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide containing the same concentration of the tracers. The coverslips were then embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned both in the transverse and lateral planes and viewed in a JEOL 2100 TEM. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed as described (27Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the primer pairs listed in supplemental Table 1. Fold changes were determined using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) scanner and normalized to POLR2A expression. Luciferase Assays—HepG2 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter construct that expressed Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase and 0.025 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-EF) using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed and analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed three independent times, with each transfection duplicated and firefly luciferase values normalized to expression of Renilla luciferase. Oligonucleotide Array Analyses—RNA (15 μg) from four independent vector-transduced samples and five independent JAM-Ai1 samples was used to generate biotinylated cRNA that was subsequently hybridized to human oligonucleotide arrays (U133A 2.0, Affymetrix). Fold changes were calculated using a 2.5-fold cutoff and a p value ≤0.05 using dChip software (28Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). A call of “present” was required for genes in all JAM-Ai1 samples for up-regulated genes, and a call of present was required for genes in all vector samples for down-regulated genes, as determined by the Gene Chip Operating System software (Affymetrix). Gene expression data have been deposited into NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE6080. Genes with significant fold changes of 1.5 or greater were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity® Systems). HepG2 Cell Morphology Is Altered by Depletion of JAM-A—JAM-A is a component of tight junctions that is expressed in the mouse liver (29Aurrand-Lions M. Duncan L. Ballestrem C. Imhof B.A. J. Biol.

Dyn. 2005; 233: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that administration of an anti-JAM-A monoclonal antibody or depletion of JAM-A by small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment in a colonic epithelial cell line leads to a reduction in transepithelial resistance, suggesting that JAM-A is critical for maintaining the permeability and polarity of these cells (34Mandell K.J.

Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that JAM-A might also be critical to maintain the integrity of hepatocyte junctions. Two different lentiviral shRNAs were generated to trigger siRNA-mediated depletion of JAM-A (JAM-Ai1 and JAM-Ai2; Fig. 1A) in HepG2 cells. These lentiviruses also contained a gene encoding puromycin resistance allowing for selection of stably transduced cells. Polyclonal stable cell lines were created by infecting HepG2 cells with JAM-Ai1 or JAM-Ai2 viruses, or control virus generated from the lentiviral vector without a hairpin (Vector). Immunoblot analyses using an antibody against JAM-A revealed that cells transduced with either JAM-Ai1 or JAM-Ai2 shRNAs exhibited a 90% reduction in the level of JAM-A protein compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). HepG2 cells characteristically grow as epithelial cell clusters or islands (7Kubitz R. Huth C. Schmitt M. Horbach A. Kullak-Ublick G. Haussinger D. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Yano T. Hernandez-Blazquez F.J. Omori Y. Yamasaki H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The morphology of HepG2 cells infected with control virus was indistinguishable from uninfected cells (Fig. 1D and data not shown). In contrast to control cells, HepG2 cells transduced with either JAM-Ai1 or JAM-Ai2 had a very different appearance (Fig. 1, E and F), with the cells displaying a flattened morphology and forming a 1-2-cell thick sheet across the entire culture dish. Although the altered cell morphology gave an appearance that the number of JAM-Ai cells per field had increased (Fig. 1, D-F), the rate of JAM-Ai1 and JAM-Ai2 cell proliferation was significantly less than that of control cells as determined by cell counting (supplemental Fig. 1) and phosphohistone H3 immunocytochemistry to detect cells in mitosis (data not shown). To demonstrate the specificity of the shRNA treatment, we designed a virus that expressed GFP as well as a mutated JAM-A cDNA called JAM-Amut (Fig. 1A). The third nucleotide in five of six codons targeted by the JAM-Ai2 shRNA was mutated in the JAM-Amut cDNA such that the altered nucleotide sequence retained the capacity to encode a wild type JAM-A protein. JAM-Ai2 HepG2 cells were infected with the JAM-Amut-expressing virus, and infected cells were sorted for GFP expression and maintained under puromycin selection. Fig. 1C shows that expression of the JAM-Amut cDNA restored JAM-A expression in JAM-Ai2-transduced cells. Moreover, the expression of the JAM-Amut cDNA in JAM-Ai2-transduced cells re-established a normal HepG2 cell morphology (Fig. 1G), demonstrating that the phenotype associated with the JAM-Ai cells is a direct consequence of a reduction in JAM-A rather than nonspecific effects of the shRNA. Depletion of JAM-A Leads to Mislocalization of Several Tight Junction Proteins—The change in morphology induced in HepG2 cells upon depletion of JAM-A raised the possibility that a disruption in tight junction formation had occurred. To address this possibility, we examined whether other tight junction proteins could localize to the apical boundary of JAM-A-depleted HepG2 cells. The pseudocanaliculus of HepG2 cells can be visualized as a small circle formed between apposing membranes (6Chiu J.H. Hu C.P. Lui W.Y. Lo S.C. Chang C.M.

Immunocytochemistry detected occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 in such circular areas of control cells (Fig. 2, A, C, and E, arrows), consistent with localization of tight junction proteins to this domain of HepG2 cells. However, in JAM-Ai cells, these tight junction proteins failed to localize at the apical surface and instead were distributed as polygons giving a chicken wire appearance surrounding the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, B, D and F, arrowheads). Staining with multiple antibodies revealed that the tight junction proteins examined co-localized in both control and mutant cells (data not shown). Quantification of the localization data found a significant reduction in the pseudocanalicular localization of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in JAM-Ai1 cells compared with controls (supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, quantification of the polygonal localization of junction proteins found this arrangement significantly increased in JAM-Ai1 cells compared with controls (supplemental Fig. 2). The localization of the tight junction proteins in the JAM-Ai cells was mainly above the plane of the nuclei (x-z confocal images Fig. 2, B, D and F), similar to the apical positioning of junctions in columnar epithelial cells such as MDCK cells (37Cohen D. Brennwald P.J. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Musch A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This suggests that loss of JAM-A reorients junction proteins from the typical hepatic orientation around the pseudocanaliculus to a more columnar epithelium-like pattern. This abnormal localization was not a reflection of increased abundance of these proteins, because immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the total levels of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 were unchanged in JAM-Ai cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2G). JAM-A Is Required for the Formation of Pseudocanaliculi in HepG2 Cells—The observation that tight junction proteins failed to localize to the normal apical domain of hepatoma cells depleted of JAM-A implied that cell polarity was disrupted and that the development of pseudocanaliculi was adversely affected. To determine whether this implication was correct, we first assessed whether loss of JAM-A influenced the polarity of HepG2 cells as a consequence of tight junction protein mislocalization. We evaluated whether the localization of a known marker of hepatic polarity, DPPIV (7Kubitz R. Huth C. Schmitt M. Horbach A. Kullak-Ublick G. Haussinger D. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was changed upon loss of JAM-A. Consistent with the mislocalization of tight junction proteins, knockdown of JAM-A leads to a 60% reduction in DPPIV localization (supplemental Fig. 3). Next, we directly examined the presence of cell junctions and pseudocanaliculi by performing electron microscopy on sections of control and JAM-Ai cells. To ensure that the presence of junctions was not inadvertently overlooked because of the plane of section, electron microscopy was performed on both horizontal and vertical sections through cell layers grown on plastic coverslips. Control cells displayed a classic hepatic arrangement of pseudocanaliculi containing numerous microvilli surrounded by tripartite junctions consisting of tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes (Fig. 3A) (1Farquhar M.G.

We recently found that a small population of these macrophages is spontaneously and temporally refractory to LeTx-induced cytotoxicity. Analysis of genome-wide transcripts of a resistant clone before and after regaining LeTx sensitivity revealed that a reduction of two closely related mitochondrial proteins, Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) and Bnip3-like (Bnip3L), correlates with LeTx resistance. Down-regulation of Bnip3 and Bnip3L was also found in “toxin-induced resistance” whereby sublethal doses of LeTx induce resistance to subsequent exposure to cytolytic toxin doses. The role of Bnip3 and Bnip3L in LeTx-induced cell death was confirmed by showing that overexpression of either Bnip3 or Bnip3L rendered the resistant cells susceptible to LeTx, whereas down-regulation of Bnip3 and Bnip3L in wild-type macrophages conferred resistance. The down-regulation of Bnip3 and Bnip3L mRNAs by LeTx occurred at both transcriptional and mRNA stability levels. Inhibition of the p38 pathway by lethal factor was responsible for the destabilization of Bnip3/Bnip3L mRNAs as confirmed by showing that p38 inhibitors stabilized Bnip3 and Bnip3L mRNAs and conferred resistance to LeTx cytotoxicity. Therefore, Bnip3/Bnip3L play a crucial role in LeTx-induced cytotoxicity, and down-regulation of Bnip3/Bnip3L is a mechanism of spontaneous or toxin-induced resistance of macrophages.

Because efficient Mek cleavage by LeTx is present in LeTx cytolysis-resistant macrophages and many other cell types without apparent cell death (18Kim S.O. Jing Q. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Duesbery N.S.

A recent genetic study investigating LeTx sensitivity trait loci in different strains of mice identified Nalp1b as a host factor that confers rapid LeTx cytotoxicity (33Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The gene product, a NACHT-LRR and pyrin domain-containing protein (NALP1), is a member of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family proteins involved in innate immunity and inflammation (34Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). NALP1 induces caspase-1 activation by forming the NALP1 inflammasome that consists of NALP1, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspace-recruitment domain, caspase-1, and caspase-11. It was suggested that NALP1b activation by LF induces caspase-1 and subsequently causes rapid macrophage cell death (9Cordoba-Rodriguez R. Fang H. Lankford C.S. Frucht D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20563-20566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which caspase-1 induces rapid macrophage cell death still remains to be defined. Several features manifested in LeTx cytotoxic cells include early mitochondrial dysfunction (35Alileche A. Squires R.C. Muehlbauer S.M. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Ca2+ influx, and generation of reactive oxygen species (36Shin S. Hur G.H. Kim Y.B. Park K.J. Park Y.M. Lee W.S. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 2000; 16: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Bhatnagar R. Singh Y. Leppla S.H. Friedlander A.M. Infect.

Collier R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on inhibitor studies, several molecules including the proteasome (40Tang G. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3055-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are involved in LeTx cytotoxicity, but definitive molecular and signaling mechanisms of LeTx cytotoxicity are unknown. Macrophages can adaptively adjust to LeTx cytotoxicity, a phenomenon termed toxin-induced resistance (TIR). Pretreatment of macrophages with low doses of LeTx induces a physiological state in which macrophages become refractory to challenge with high cytolytic doses of LeTx (41Salles I.I. Tucker A.E. Voth D.E. Ballard J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12426-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the mechanism for TIR involves either adaptive Erk activation in the presence of LeTx or decreased proteasome activity in TIR cells (41Salles I.I. Tucker A.E. Voth D.E. Ballard J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12426-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the majority of TIR cells are protected from LeTx cytotoxicity for 3–4 days, we observed that a small fraction of RAW246.7 cells (∼2%) remain resistant to LeTx cytotoxicity, and about 1% of the surviving cells retained resistance for an extended time period of up to 5–6 weeks. The prolonged LeTx resistance of the clones allowed us to recover enough cells from a single resistant clone for microarray analysis, thus eliminating background noise between clones. Analysis of more than 39,000 transcripts from this single clone during and after LeTx resistance revealed only 15 genes that displayed up to a 5-fold reduction in their expression levels. Among these genes, we found two closely related mitochondrial genes: Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) and Bnip3-like (Bnip3L; also known as Nip3-like protein X). Here we show that Bnip3 and Bnip3L play a key role in LeTx-induced cytotoxicity in macrophages and that down-regulation of these gene products is a mechanism for TIR, which at least in part is also mediated through continual inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by LF inside cells. This study provides the first mechanistic description of TIR and Bnip3/Bnip3L-mediated LeTx cytotoxicity. Materials—LF and PA were prepared in the laboratory as described previously (39Hanna P.C. Kochi S. Collier R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SB203580, SB202190, U0126, Jnk inhibitor II, and actinomycin D were purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences). Antibodies toward p38, Akt, Mek1-CT, phospho-p38, phospho-Jnks, and phospho-Erks were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Pickering, Ontario, Canada). Antibodies raised against the N terminus of Mek1 and Bnip3L were from QED Bioscience Inc. and eBioscience, respectively. Macrophages, Cell Culture, and Screening of TIR Clones—RAW264.7 murine macrophages and bone marrow-derived immortalized macrophages from a C57BL/6 mouse (obtained from Dr. B. Aggarwal, Houston, TX) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or medium containing 10% heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 10 mm minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids solution, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Primary peritoneal macrophages were isolated from 129s/j mice as described previously (18Kim S.O. Jing Q. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Duesbery N.S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7413-7421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TIR cells were obtained by treating RAW264.7 macrophages with LeTx (10 ng/ml LF and 200 ng/ml PA) for 5 h, and surviving cells were plated in a fresh tissue culture dish. To screen and select spontaneous LeTx resistance clones, RAW246.7 cells were plated on a 10-cm dish and exposed to a cytolytic dose of LeTx (500 ng/ml LF and 1 μg/ml PA) for 5 h (Fig. 1). Two weeks later surviving clones were individually picked and plated on a 96-well plate. Each clone was duplicated, and one of them was tested for LeTx sensitivity. LeTx-resistant clones were then passaged every 3–4 days with fresh medium, and LeTx susceptibility was tested at every passage. Microtiter Tetrazolium (MTT) Assay—RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured with or without LeTx in 96-well plates for 5 h, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was then added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After incubating at 37 °C for an additional 4 h, culture medium was carefully aspirated, and 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to dissolve crystals. Optical densities of the wells were analyzed using an automatic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (UV MAX, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 590 nm. The ratio of cell survival was estimated based on the optical density of wells by comparison with non-treated cells as 100% survival. Total Cell Lysate Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.2) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were electrophoretically resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 5% (w/v) skim milk and then incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies. The membranes were washed and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Promoter-Reporter Assay—Wild-type or lethal toxin-exposed RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with 1.6 μg of Bnip3L promoter-reporter plasmids (42Galvez A.S. Brunskill E.W. Marreez Y. Benner B.J. Regula K.M. Kirschenbaum L.A. Dorn G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and 0.4 μg of β-galactosidase-encoding plasmids using the Nucleofector™ II kit (Amaxa Biosystems). After 24 h, transfected cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (BioVision) followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was assayed for luciferase activity in a Berthold luminometer (Sirius, Montreal Biotech Inc.) using a luciferase reporter assay kit (BioVision). The other aliquot was used for a β-galactosidase assay. The relative activity was normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. Metabolic Radiolabeling and Immunoblotting—At 48 h post-LeTx exposure, LeTx-treated or untreated control cells were placed in methionine-free medium for 60 min. The cells were then labeled for 1 h with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The labeled cells were lysed, and proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoblotting analysis of labeled proteins for Mek1-NT or Mek1-CT was performed as described above. Quantitative Real Time PCR—mRNA expression of Bnip3 and Bnip3L in macrophages was quantified on a Rotor-Gene RG3000 quantitative multiplex PCR instrument using Brilliant SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed by using oligo(dT) primers and the Superscript II reverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Oligonucleotide primers were the following: for Bnip3, 5′-GCTCCCAGACACCACAAGAT-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-TGAGAGTAGCTGTGCGCTTC-3′ (3′ primer); for Bnip3L, 5′-CCTCGTCTTCCATCCACAAT-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-GTCCCTGCTGGTATGCATCT-3′ (3′ primer); for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GCATTGTGGAAGGGCTCATG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-TTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG-3′ (3′ primer). Small Interfering RNA—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides directed against mouse Bnip3 and Bnip3L were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of RAW264.7 cell with siRNAs was performed with the Nucleofector II kit (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subcultured 1 day before nucleofection. Cells were harvested, resuspended at room temperature in Nucleofector solution V to a final concentration of 2.0 × 106 cells/100 μl, and mixed with 2 μg of siRNA. The mixtures were used for nucleofection using Nucleofector program D-32 in the Nucleofector I device (Amaxa Biosystems). Adenoviral-p38 Transfection—A recombinant, replication-deficient adenovirus vector encoding the human wild-type p38 and an identical construct lacking the insert (Ad0) were purified and transfected as described previously (43Kim S.O. Sheikh H.I. Ha S.D. Martins A. Reid G. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1958-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly RAW264.7 cells were transiently infected with adenovirus at 15 multiplicity of infection/cell for 1 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then washed and cultured in growth medium for 24 h. pEGFP-Bnip3L Construction—Mouse Bnip3L cDNAs were prepared from total RNAs of RAW264.7 macrophages. The total RNAs were reverse transcribed, and the target gene for Bnip3L was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (forward, 5′-ATTAGATCTTCTCACTTAGTCGAGCCGCCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTAGAATTCTCAGTAGGTGCTGGCAGAAGG-3′). The amplified fragment was digested with BglII and EcoRI and cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector (Invitrogen). Transfection of recombinant plasmids was performed using the same method as for siRNA transfection. Bnip3 and Bnip3L Are Involved in LeTx-induced Cytotoxicity of Macrophages—A small population (∼2%) of RAW264.7 macrophages is resistant to cytolytic doses of LeTx, but when individually cloned and retested for LeTx susceptibility, most of the resistant cells become sensitive to LeTx in about 4 days (41Salles I.I. Tucker A.E. Voth D.E. Ballard J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12426-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, about ∼2% of these cells remained LeTx resistant for up to 6 weeks (Fig. 1A). Cells that originated from one LeTx-resistant clone before (post-LeTx treatment day 35) and after (post-LeTx treatment day 49) regaining LeTx sensitivity showed no differences in Mek1 N terminus cleavage and Erk1/2 phosphorylation inhibition by LeTx (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the long term resistance phenotype was not due to defects in toxin uptake and release into cytosol of resistant cells. To identify genes involved in the resistance phenotype, a genome-wide transcript analysis using the murine 430A array (Affymetrix) was carried out comparing transcripts from cells before (post-LeTx treatment day 35) and after (post-LeTx treatment day 49) regaining LeTx sensitivity. Using cells derived from the same clone allowed us to eliminate most of the background noise between clones. From ∼39,000 transcripts examined, we detected 14 transcripts with more than a 5-fold change in their levels of expression. Two of them encoded closely related mitochondrial proteins: Bnip3 and Bnip3L (or Nip3-like protein X protein). The more than 5-fold reduction of Bnip3 and Bnip3L transcript levels in the resistant cells (post-LeTx treatment day 35) was further verified by real time PCR (Fig. 1C). The expression of known cell death-related genes in the resistant cells including Bad, Bax, Noxa, Bid, and Puma or antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 did not significantly change by more than 2-fold relative to wild-type cells (data not shown). To confirm whether the down-regulation of Bnip3 and/or Bnip3L is associated to the resistance phenotype, N-terminal GFP-conjugated Bnip3 and/or Bnip3L were overexpressed in the resistant cells, and these cells were also exposed to a cytotoxic dose of LeTx (500 ng/ml LF and 1 μg/ml PA). N-terminal GFP-conjugated Bnip3 had the same effect as wild-type Bnip3 (37Bhatnagar R. Singh Y. Leppla S.H. Friedlander A.M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2107-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GFP+ cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope to confirm >50% transfection efficiency (data not shown). Under these conditions, overexpression of Bnip3L alone induced about 25% cell death in resistant macrophages (Fig. 1D). However, Bnip3L overexpression in combination with a cytolytic LeTx dose induced high levels of cell death (∼75%) in the resistant cells (Fig. 1D). To confirm whether Bnip3 and Bnip3L are indeed required for LeTx cytotoxicity, we silenced the expression of Bnip3 and/or Bnip3L in RAW264.7 cells using siRNAs. Both Bnip3 and Bnip3L mRNA levels were reduced at least 4-fold in the siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1E, left upper panel). Western blots against Bnip3L further showed that Bnip3L protein levels in Bnip3L or Bnip3 + Bnip3L siRNA-treated cells were also greatly diminished (left lower panel). Down-regulation of the Bnip3L expression prevented LeTx cytotoxicity in about 50% of the cells, whereas down-regulation of Bnip3 had a smaller effect (∼15%) (Fig. 1E, right panel). Additive protection was detected when both genes were down-regulated (∼65%) (Fig. 1E, lower panel). Together these results support the notion that both Bnip3 and Bnip3L are required for LeTx cytotoxicity of macrophages. TIR Is Mediated by Down-regulation of Bnip3 and Bnip3L—TIR is an adaptive phenomenon by which macrophages exposed to sublethal doses of LeTx become refractory to subsequent challenge with high cytolytic doses of LeTx (41Salles I.I. Tucker A.E. Voth D.E. Ballard J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12426-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To examine whether Bnip3 or Bnip3L is also involved in TIR, RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with a sublethal dose of LeTx (10 ng/ml LF and 100 ng/ml PA) that causes about 15% cell death. Consistent with a previous study (41Salles I.I. Tucker A.E. Voth D.E. Ballard J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12426-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), TIR lasted for up to 3–4 days (Fig. 2A). By day 5, an intermediate TIR phenotype was observed, whereas by day 6 cells were as sensitive to high doses of LeTx as the untreated controls. Transcript levels of Bnip3 and Bnip3L were dramatically reduced (>10-fold) after 12 h of LeTx treatment and remained low for at least 3–4 days (Fig. 2B, top panel). Bnip3L protein levels were also reduced in TIR cells; this correlated well with mRNA levels (Fig. 2B, lower panel). By day 5, transcript and protein levels increased, and at day 6 they were identical to those found in untreated cells. The temporal variation in Bnip3L transcript and protein levels correlated with the duration of the TIR state (Fig. 2, compare A and B). To confirm whether the down-regulation of Bnip3 or Bnip3L is responsible for TIR, we expressed N-terminal GFP-conjugated Bnip3 or Bnip3L in TIR cells and challenging them with a cytolytic dose of LeTx (500 ng/ml LF and 1 μg/ml PA). Fig. 2C shows that overexpression of either Bnip3 or Bnip3L sensitized TIR cells to LeTx, suggesting that down-regulation of Bnip3 and Bnip3L is required for TIR. We further determined whether the down-regulation of Bnip3L in TIR cells was due to a decreased transcription rate or reduced mRNA stability. We used a mouse Bnip3L promoter sequence (-5362 bp upstream of ATG start codon of mouse Bnip3L)-fused luciferase reporter system to examine the basal transcription activity of Bnip3L in wild-type and TIR cells. Fig. 2D (left panel) shows at least 3-fold lower reporter activity in TIR cells relative to wild-type cells. To examine the stability of Bnip3L mRNA, wild-type RAW264.7 or TIR cells were pretreated with a broad spectrum transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D (3 μg/ml), for 1 h, and mRNA levels of Bnip3L were analyz"
https://openalex.org/W2056806942,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating diverse neuronal processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, and long-term synaptic plasticity. However, a detailed understanding of the action of ERK in neurons is made difficult by the lack of knowledge about its subcellular localization in response to physiological stimuli. To address this issue, we have studied the effect of visual stimulation in vivo of dark-reared rats on the spatial-temporal dynamics of ERK activation in pyramidal neurons of the visual cortex.Using immunogold electron microscopy, we show that phosphorylated ERK (pERK) is present in dendritic spines, both at synaptic and non-synaptic plasma membrane domains. Moreover, pERK is also detected in presynaptic axonal boutons forming connections with dendritic spines. Visual stimulation after dark rearing during the critical period causes a rapid increase in the number of pERK-labelled synapses in cortical layers I-II/III. This visually-induced activation of ERK at synaptic sites occurs in pre- and post-synaptic compartments and its temporal profile is identical to that of ERK activation in neuronal cell bodies.Visual stimulation in vivo increases pERK expression at pre- and post-synaptic sites of axo-spinous junctions, suggesting that ERK plays an important role in the local modulation of synaptic function. The data presented here support a model in which pERK can have early and late actions both centrally in the cell nucleus and peripherally at synaptic contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2070860583,"Receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling in many non-excitable cells initially induces Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores, followed by Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Recent findings have suggested that stromal interaction molecules (STIMs) function as the Ca2+ sensor to detect changes of Ca2+ content in the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Human STIMs and invertebrate STIM share several functionally important protein domains, but diverge significantly in the C-terminus. To better understand the evolutionary significance of STIM activity, phylogenetic analysis of the STIM protein family was conducted after extensive database searching. Results from phylogeny and sequence analysis revealed early adaptation of the C-terminal divergent domains in Urochordata, before the expansion of STIMs in Vertebrata. STIMs were subsequently subjected to one round of gene duplication as early as in the Euteleostomi lineage in vertebrates, with a second round of fish-specific gene duplication. After duplication, STIM-1 and STIM-2 molecules appeared to have undergone purifying selection indicating strong evolutionary constraints within each group. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the EF-hand Ca2+ binding domain and the SAM domain, together with functional divergence studies, identified critical regions/residues likely underlying functional changes, and provided evidence for the hypothesis that STIM-1 and STIM-2 might have developed distinct functional properties after duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2056311716,"Naked DNA plasmid represents the simplest vehicle for gene therapy and DNA-based vaccination purposes; however, the molecular mechanisms of DNA uptake in mammalian cells are poorly understood. Here, we show that naked DNA uptake occurs via proteoglycan-dependent macropinocytosis, thus challenging the concept of a specific DNA-internalizing receptor. Cells genetically deficient in proteoglycans, which constitute a major source of cell-surface polyanions, exhibited substantially decreased uptake of likewise polyanionic DNA. The apparent paradox was explained by the action of DNA-transporting proteins present in conditioned medium. Complexes between these proteins and DNA require proteoglycans for cellular entry. Mass spectrometry analysis of cell medium components identified several proteins previously shown to associate with DNA and to participate in membrane transport of macromolecular cargo. The major pathway for proteoglycan-dependent DNA uptake was macropinocytosis, whereas caveolae-dependent and clathrin-dependent pathways were not involved, as determined by using caveolin-1 knock-out cells, dominant-negative constructs for dynamin and Eps15, and macropinocytosis-disruptive drugs, as well as confocal fluorescence co-localization studies. Importantly, a significant fraction of internalized DNA was translocated to the nucleus for expression.

Our results provide novel insights into the mechanism of DNA uptake by mammalian cells and extend the emerging role of proteoglycans in macromolecular transport. Cells have developed efficient barriers to ensure genetic diversity and for protection from disadvantageous non-self genes. Gene therapy and cellular protein delivery strategies rely on the entry of large, polyvalent molecules across these barriers. The introduction of gene-based therapies into the clinic is hampered by a limited understanding of macromolecular transport in mammalian cells. Mechanistic studies are thus required for a more rational design of DNA and protein delivery vehicles (1Luo D. Saltzman W.M. Nat.

The most straightforward strategy for gene delivery is represented by free (or “naked”) DNA (3Herweijer H. Wolff J.A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2315-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A functional role in DNA uptake has not been convincingly shown for any of these membrane proteins. Initial studies had suggested an involvement of class A scavenger receptor in DNA uptake by macrophages (18Takagi T. Hashiguchi M. Mahato R.I. Tokuda H. Takakura Y. Hashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); however, studies with class A scavenger receptor knock-out mice failed to confirm this notion (19Takakura Y. Takagi T.

The mechanism of DNA uptake by mammalian cells thus remains largely unknown. We set out to study the uptake of DNA and found an unexpected role for heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Materials-Fluorophores, labeled markers, secondary antibodies, and DNase I were from Invitrogen.

T24 bladder carcinoma cells were a kind gift from Dr. I. Olsson (Lund University, Lund, Sweden), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). CHO cells were routinely cultured as described (21Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts, C6 cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured as recommended by the supplier. T24 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. For production of CM, cells were grown to subconfluency in 75- to 500-cm2 flasks, extensively rinsed with serum-free medium, and then incubated in F12K medium as indicated under “Results” and in the figure legends. CM was loaded onto a 5-ml heparin affinity column (HiTrap Heparin HP; GE Healthcare) (flow-through was designated as “non-binding” fraction), followed by 2 column volumes F12K wash and 10 column volumes phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2 m. Proteins bound to the matrix were eluted with 5 column volumes 2 m NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and designated as “binding” fraction. Peak fractions were desalted on PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare) using protocols as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA and HS Uptake Studies-Uptake of fluorophore-labeled DNA oligonucleotides, DNA plasmid, or HS was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as described (21Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Some cells were treated with DNase I from bovine pancreas (10 units/ml, 2 units/sample) for 15 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as described (22Sandgren S. Wittrup A. Cheng F. Jönsson M. Eklund E. Busch S. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17951-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For competition studies, HS was depolymerized with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (23Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) followed by size fractionation on a Bio-Gel P-6 column into three separate pools: intact chains (∼40 disaccharides), oligosaccharides (dodeca- to octadecasaccharides), and disaccharides (24Belting M. Havsmark B. Jonsson M. Persson S. Fransson L.A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In some cases, cells were treated with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (1 mm), the macropinocytosis inhibitor amiloride (2.5 mm), or the actin-disrupting agent latrunculin A (2.5 μm) for 30 min prior to incubation and during uptake experiments. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy-Cells were plated on chamber slides and allowed to grow for 48 h. For live cell microscopy, cells were incubated with AF488-labeled DNA oligonucleotides (5 μg/ml) and heparin binding CM components (20 μg/ml) for 3 h. Extracellular DNA was removed by three consecutive rinses with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 100 μg/ml dextran sulfate, followed by immediate analysis. For the co-localization studies, labeled DNA oligonucleotide was allowed to form complexes with CM components for 30 min. Dextran-AF647 or transferrin-AF647 (final concentrations of 100 and 150 μg/ml, respectively) was added just prior to addition of the solutions to the cells. The cells were rinsed as above, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and mounted in Permafluor (Beckman Coulter). In the studies using HA-dynamin-WT/K44A, GFP-Eps15-EΔ95/295, and Cav1-YFP construct, 2–4 × 106 CHO-K1 cells were electroporated at 340 V in 700 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg of plasmid DNA using a BTX ECM399 (Genetronics) electroporator. Immediately after electroporation cells were plated in chamber slides and allowed to grow 24–48 h before further analysis. Cells were then incubated with DNA-AF647 (5 μg/ml) and heparin binding CM components (20 μg/ml) for 3 h or with transferrin-AF647 (150 μg/ml) for 30 min in F12K without serum. Extracellular DNA was removed as described above. Slides were then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells transfected with HA-tagged dynamin constructs were blocked overnight in 2% bovine serum albumin and stained using the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (1:100) followed, after extensive rinsing, by AF488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500). Actin was counterstained using phalloidin-TRITC (1:500). Finally, cells were mounted in Permafluor. For quantifications, in total more than 50 cells from at least five low magnification images were assigned to each of the expressing and non-expressing groups as determined by GFP or anti-HA staining. Ligand uptake was quantified using LCS software, and a ratio of the uptake between expressing and nonexpressing cells was calculated for each image. The mean ratio ± S.D. is presented. All cells were analyzed using Leica confocal scanning equipment TCS SP2 II. Fluorescence Quenching and Gel Retardation-For fluorescence quenching analysis, a mixture of DNA (5 μg/ml) and ethidium bromide (DNA:EtBr 20:1, w/w) in 1 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (or 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 for samples with divalent cations) was supplemented with varying concentrations of heparin binding CM components (0–250 μg/ml) and/or highly sulfated HS (0–250 μg/ml). EtBr fluorescence was determined following a 30-min incubation at 20 °C using a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG) spectrophotometer (excitation 337 nm; emission 620 nm). For the gel retardation assay DNA was mixed with heparin binding CM components for 30 min at 20 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA. DNA and CM mixtures were then separated on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and DNA migration was visualized on a UV board. Mass Spectrometry Identification-Heparin binding CM components were dissolved in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and loaded on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel. The gel was stained using Colloidal Blue (Invitrogen). Bands of interest were excised and analyzed by MALDI time-of-flight according to the method described (25Onnerfjord P. Heathfield T.F. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For MS/MS analysis the peptide extract was spotted directly onto a stainless steel MALDI target and was left to dry. Matrix solution containing 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 50 mm citric acid was added and allowed to dry, and MS/MS spectra were acquired using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, CA) in positive reflector mode. Protein identification was performed using the GPS Explorer software, with an in-house Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) searching the NCBI non-redundant data base (taxa, Rodentia). Statistical Analyses-Each data point in the figures is the mean ± S.D. In some cases the error bars were smaller than the drawn symbols. Temperature-dependent Uptake and Expression of Naked DNA in Mammalian Cells-DNA uptake was studied by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A), demonstrating a time-dependent and linear increase up to 48 h, although there appeared to be a lag phase during the initial 2–4 h (Fig. 1B). Cells were detached by trypsin treatment and extensively rinsed prior to flow cytometry analysis; however, it could not be ruled out that fluorophore-labeled DNA was associated with the cell exterior, especially after short incubation periods. In Fig. 1B, however, it is evident that DNase treatment in addition to trypsin treatment does not influence the cell-associated fluorescence. Dose-response experiments showed saturable DNA uptake kinetics with maximal uptake at ∼10 μg/ml (Fig. 1C). It has previously been shown that DNA oligonucleotides enter cells in a temperature-independent manner (17Laktionov P.P. Dazard J.E. Vives E. Rykova E.Y. Piette J. Vlassov V.V. Lebleu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2315-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We next incubated cells with DNA at 37 or 4 °C, demonstrating a strong temperature dependence. The same holds true for HS, i.e. another ubiquitous polyanion (Fig. 1D). Cells incubated with DNA plasmid encoding a luciferase reporter gene displayed dose-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 1E). Together, these results demonstrate saturable and temperature-dependent uptake of naked DNA and that a significant fraction of internalized DNA reaches the nucleus for transcription. DNA and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), e.g. HS, CS, and hyaluronic acid (HA), constitute the dominating macromolecular polyanions in the cell interior and on the cell exterior, respectively, sharing some basic biophysical characteristics. We next asked whether DNA and various GAGs compete for uptake via common transport pathway/s. Highly sulfated, heparin-like HS (HS-6) as well as less sulfated HS (HS-2), exhibiting a lower charge density as compared with CS, were used. Both HS-6 and HS-2 showed dose-dependent inhibition of DNA uptake (∼65–80% inhibition at 8 μg/ml HS); however, even at 80 μg/ml, CS and HA showed very limited or no inhibition of DNA uptake (Fig. 1F). Moreover, the inhibitory activity of HS was size-dependent (Fig. 1G); DNA uptake was reduced by ∼80 and 35% by intact chains and oligosaccharides (dodeca- to octadecasaccharides), respectively, whereas HS disaccharides were completely inactive even at the highest concentration tested (4 μg/ml). DNA efficiently inhibited HS-2 uptake, whereas inhibition of HS-6 uptake was less efficient (data not shown). The results indicate that the polyanions DNA and GAGs compete for cellular uptake in a structure-specific, size-dependent, and charge density-dependent manner. Components in Conditioned Medium Mediate DNA and HS Uptake via Cell Surface PGs-As cell surface PGs provide a polyanionic envelope around the cell exterior and previously have been shown to promote the uptake of various polybasic ligands (26Belting M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that uptake of free DNA may be negatively regulated by PGs. To test this idea, we used CHO cell mutants (pgsA-745) deficient in xylosyl transferase that catalyzes the first step in GAG chain assembly onto the PG core protein, anticipating greater DNA uptake in these cells as compared with PG-expressing wild-type cells. Uptake of DNA over a period of 5 h was similar in wild-type (filled symbols) and PG-deficient cells (open symbols) at all concentrations tested (Fig. 2A, squares). When cells were incubated for 24 h, DNA uptake was 2- to 3-fold greater in wild-type than in PG-deficient cells (Fig. 2A, circles). These results were unexpected and contrary to our predictions. PgsA-745 cells produce ∼5% PG as compared with wild-type CHOs (27Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We next included another PG-deficient CHO cell mutant (pgsB-618) that produces ∼15% PG as compared with wild-type cells (28Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Roden L. Anantharamaiah G. Gawish A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data demonstrate a direct correlation between DNA uptake efficiency and PG levels in recipient cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, this was also valid for the HS preparations described in Fig. 1, which lends further support for a common uptake mechanism of DNA and HS. There was a clear tendency toward increased relative PG dependence with increasing polyanion charge density (HS-6 > HS-2 > DNA; Fig. 2B). These results, together with the initial lag phase in DNA uptake (Fig. 1B), made us speculate that naked DNA transport is mediated by secreted components that accumulate in the culture medium. To this end, serum-free medium was conditioned with cultured cells for various periods of time and then re-isolated for DNA and HS uptake studies. DNA uptake was ∼8-fold greater in wild-type cells incubated in CM as compared with fresh control medium (Fig. 2C). Again, DNA uptake was strictly PG-dependent, as DNA uptake in PG-deficient cells was the same or even reduced in CM as compared with fresh medium (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained irrespective of DNA labeling method (intercalation with YOYO-1 or covalent conjugation with AF488). CM-mediated DNA transport increased in a time-dependent and saturable manner, suggesting an endocytotic uptake mechanism (Fig. 2D), which was further supported by a vesicular staining pattern of internalized DNA (Fig. 3A). A significant fraction of internalized DNA was translocated to the nucleus for expression (Fig. 3B). Importantly, CM-mediated DNA uptake was not restricted to CHO cells, as it was also demonstrated in human bladder carcinoma cells, rat glioma cells, and primary human endothelial cells (Fig. 3C). To gain further insight into the mechanism of CM-mediated DNA uptake, CM was separated on a heparin (highly sulfated HS) affinity column into a non-binding and binding fraction. Non-bound CM material exhibited insignificant DNA transport activity (Fig. 3D). Heparin binding CM components stimulated DNA uptake in a dose-response-dependent manner, and at 10 μg/ml the effect was ∼7-fold greater as compared with equivalent amounts of unfractionated CM (Fig. 3D) and 1.5-fold greater than the HIV-Tat transduction peptide that is known to bind to and mediate transport of DNA (21Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results suggested that heparin binding CM components may directly bind to and form complexes with DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, CM components induced a substantial and concentration-dependent mobility shift of plasmid DNA in a gel retardation assay (Fig. 3E). Complex formation between DNA and heparin binding CM components was further supported by CM-induced quenching of fluorescent DNA. In addition, highly sulfated HS almost completely abrogated CM-dependent quenching of DNA fluorescence (Fig. 3F). Together with the fact that HS had no effect on DNA fluorescence per se, either in the presence or absence of divalent cations (Fig. 3F, diamonds), our results indicate that HS efficiently competes with DNA for binding to CM components and that complex formation between DNA and HS is unlikely. SDS-PAGE separation and mass spectrometry analysis (peptide mass fingerprint and MS/MS) of the heparin binding CM fraction identified 13 dominating protein bands (Fig. 3F and Table 1), several of which have previously been shown to associate with DNA and HS (see “Discussion”).TABLE 1Mass spectrometry identification of CM components Seq. cov., sequence coverage; PCEEP, procollagenase C-endopeptidase enhancer precursor; CFUT2MP, CHO functionally unknown type II membrane protein; n/a, not applicable due to MS/MS identification.

Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of dominant-negative variants of dynamin and Eps15 has become widely used for specific inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (30Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 31Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Begue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found significant inhibition of the uptake of transferrin, a well established ligand of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, in cells expressing dominant-negative constructs of dynamin and Eps15 (Fig. 4). However, CM-mediated DNA uptake was unaffected by either construct, and internalized DNA showed weak co-localization with transferrin, as determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C). Together, these results show that DNA uptake follows predominantly a non-clathrin-dependent route of entry. Cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains may exist either as separate “rafts” or, when associated with caveolin, form invaginations called caveolae, and these pathways seem to be partly overlapping (32Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin is a well established cholesterol-depleting agent employed for studying the involvement of rafts/caveolae in cellular transport (33Ono A. Freed E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13925-13930Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 34Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with this agent significantly reduced CM-mediated DNA uptake (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained with nystatin, which also disrupts lipid raft domains (results not shown). Lipid rafts have been associated with macropinocytosis that is characterized by actin membrane protrusions that pinch off into macropinosome vesicles (35Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Cells treated with amiloride that specifically inhibits the Na+/H+ exchange required for macropinocytosis showed ∼55% reduction of CM-mediated DNA uptake, and treatment with latrunculin A that disrupts actin filaments resulted in ∼45% reduction of uptake (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that CM-mediated DNA uptake requires intact lipid rafts and an intact actin cytoskeleton, as well as active Na+/H+ exchange, which is consistent with uptake through macropinocytosis. Accordingly, internalized DNA showed strong co-localization with dextran, which is a marker of macropinocytosis (Fig. 5B). Finally, we investigated the possible involvement of caveolae-dependent pathways. DNA uptake was unperturbed in caveolin-1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells (Fig. 5C), and internalized DNA did not co-localize with caveolin-1-yellow fluorescent protein (Fig. 5D), providing evidence that caveolin-associated endocytosis has no major role in CM-mediated DNA uptake. Here, we present evidence that DNA uptake by mammalian cells is mediated by secreted proteins via an endocytotic mechanism that strictly requires cell surface PGs. These results advance our understanding of DNA transport in mammalian cells and further strengthen accumulating evidence for the role of PGs in macromolecular transport. Although DNA uptake is induced severalfold by secreted components, a parallel and less efficient pathway involving direct binding of DNA to a cell surface receptor molecule cannot be ruled out. However, considering the high number of potential DNA binding partners in the extracellular environment it is, in our view, highly unlikely that DNA is taken up as a single molecule in the in vivo situation. We further demonstrate that DNA uptake predominantly involves a non-clathrin-dependent, non-caveolae-dependent macropinocytotic pathway. We have previously shown that LL-37-mediated DNA uptake occurs via PGs and non-caveolar lipid raft-dependent endocytosis (22Sandgren S. Wittrup A. Cheng F. Jönsson M. Eklund E. Busch S. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17951-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and several groups have demonstrated a role for PGs in cationic gene delivery (36Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Hengge and co-workers (11Basner-Tschakarjan E. Mirmohammadsadegh A. Baer A. Hengge U.R. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggested that primary keratinocytes internalize DNA by macropinocytosis, as both amiloride and its more potent derivative N,N-dimethylamiloride substantially reduced DNA uptake, which is consistent with our results. The specificity of polyanion uptake is quite intriguing. Our observations are in line with previous in vivo studies showing efficient inhibition of hepatic DNA uptake by HS, but not by CS or HA (5Kobayashi N. Kuramoto T. Yamaoka K. Hashida M. Takakura Y.J J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 853-860PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, DNA plasmid was injected intramuscularly, showing that heparin strongly inhibited DNA reporter gene expression (9Satkauskas S. Bureau M.F. Mahfoudi A. Mir L.M. Mol. Ther. 2001; 4: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Conversely, Harris et al. (37Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36201-36209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that uptake of HA via the HARE (HA receptor for endocytosis) pathway was unaffected by HS, whereas CS was a potent inhibitor of HA transport. The authors concluded that HARE may specifically recognize N-acetyl groups of amino sugars of HA and CS, but not N-sulfated glucosamine found in HS and heparin. The results presented here would suggest that DNA shares some structural requirements with HS not found in CS and HA, allowing binding to secreted components and subsequent uptake via the PG-dependent route. This notion is supported by the identification of moesin as one of the most abundant proteins in CM. Moesin has previously been identified as a cell surface DNA receptor (11Basner-Tschakarjan E. Mirmohammadsadegh A. Baer A. Hengge U.R. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as well as an HS receptor (38Lankes W. Griesmacher A. Grunwald J. Schwartz-Albiez R. Keller R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but with poor binding to CS and HA. The HS binding activity of moesin has been attributed to the presence of several stretches of the general structure (XBXBXBX), 3B indicates a basic amino acid and X any amino acid. (XBBXBX), and (XBXBBX), i.e. consensus sequences for HS binding, in its C-terminal tail (39Lankes W. Furthmayr H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 8297-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The identification of moesin as a cell surface receptor is difficult to reconcile with its lack of a transmembrane region or obvious glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment site. Intracellular moesin and the other ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins have been shown to act as adaptors between the actin cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins (40Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). From our data, a model in which extracellular moesin similarly acts as an adaptor between an extracellular ligand (e.g. DNA) and an endocytosis receptor (PG) may be envisaged. This model would also explain several independent observations regarding the role of nucleolin, another major CM component, in cellular uptake of macromolecular cargos, such as the cytokine midkine (41Said E.A.

Interestingly, nucleolin was recently shown to act as a cell surface receptor for acharan sulfate, a GAG structurally related to HS (44Joo E.J. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, internalization via nucleolin was shown to be dependent on the co-expression of cell surface PGs (42Legrand D. Vigie K. Said E.A. Elass E. Masson M. Slomianny M.C. Carpentier M. Briand J.P. Mazurier J. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cell surface PGs can be either membrane-intercalated (syndecans), glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (glypicans), or present in the pericellular matrix (perlecan) and have been shown to be internalized and recycle at the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 26Belting M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Another CM component, cyclophilin B, has been shown to interact with cell surface PGs (45Allain F. Vanpouille C. Carpentier M. Slomianny M.C. Durieux S. Spik G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2714-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and may co-internalize with its ligand cyclosporine (46Allain F. Denys A. Spik G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16537-16540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) via the PG-dependent route. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), also found in CM, is a well known nuclear protein organized in two DNA-binding domains and a negatively charged C terminus. HMGB1 mediates physical interaction between DNA and several nuclear factors, such as p53, NF-κB, and homeobox-containing proteins (reviewed in Ref. 47Dumitriu I.E. Baruah P. Manfredi A.A. Bianchi M.E. Rovere-Querini P. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the context of the present work, it is of interest that HMGB1 is also expressed on the plasma membrane (referred to as amphoterin) and has been shown to be released to the extracellular environment, where it may exert pro-inflammatory effects. The significance of the presence of histones in CM was not clear as necrotic cells are known to release histones via passive secretion. Importantly, our results may not solely be explained by the nonspecific release of intracellular factors into CM, as demonstrated by 1) the lack of lactate dehydrogenase activity in CM conditioned for 24 h; 2) no further stimulation of DNA uptake by CM conditioned for extended time periods that was associated with significant release of lactate dehydrogenase; and 3) no effect on DNA uptake of a cytosol preparation obtained from several freeze-thaw cycles of cultured cells (data not shown). Histones have indeed been found present on the exterior of various cell lines. Watson et al. (48Watson K. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Edwards R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21707-21713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) showed that dextrin 2-sulfate, a sulfated polysaccharide related to GAGs, displaced nucleosomes from the surface of activated T-cells. Cell surface-located nucleosomes were shown to contain H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, i.e. the same histone variants identified in CM (Table 1). In the same report it was further shown that PGs mediate nucleosome binding to the cell surface. The authors proposed that the positively charged N termini of histones extending from the nucleosome core particles were available for binding to negatively charged PGs, a model that agrees well with the data presented in our study. Whether cellular exchange through the PG-dependent route of nucleic acids or other polyanions has a critical role in pathophysiology remains to be determined. Furthermore, the distribution of DNA-transporting proteins in various tissues and serum is another area of future research."
https://openalex.org/W2159685430,"Persistent and stable expression of foreign genes has been achieved in mammalian cells by integrating the genes into the host chromosomes. However, this approach has several shortcomings in practical applications. For example, large scale production of protein pharmaceutics frequently requires laborious amplification of the inserted genes to optimize the gene expression. The random chromosomal insertion of exogenous DNA also results occasionally in malignant transformation of normal tissue cells, raising safety concerns in medical applications. Here we report a novel cytoplasmic RNA replicon capable of expressing installed genes stably without chromosome insertion. This system is based on the RNA genome of a noncytopathic variant Sendai virus strain, Cl.151. We found that this variant virus establishes stable symbiosis with host cells by escaping from retinoic acid-inducible gene I-interferon regulatory factor 3-mediated antiviral machinery. Using a cloned genome cDNA of Sendai virus Cl.151, we developed a recombinant RNA installed with exogenous marker genes that was maintained stably in the cytoplasm as a high copy replicon (about 4 × 104 copies/cell) without interfering with normal cellular function. Strong expression of the marker genes persisted for more than 6 months in various types of cultured cells and for at least two months in rat colonic mucosa without any apparent side effects. This stable RNA replicon is a potentially valuable genetic platform for various biological applications.

This stable RNA replicon is a potentially valuable genetic platform for various biological applications. Delivery and ectopic expression of foreign genes in mammalian cells is now standard in modern biology. Although transient expression of delivered genes is usually sufficient for basic research purposes, their sustained expression is desirable in various medical and industrial applications. For example, persistent expression of therapeutic genes in tissue cells in situ is crucial for gene therapy of congenital metabolic diseases (1Verma I.M. Weitzman M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 711-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Stable and strong gene expression is also required for large scale production of recombinant proteins in cultured mammalian cells (2Wurm F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Persistent expression of exogenous genes is achieved routinely by integrating them as a part of the host chromosome, either actively by using integrating viral vectors (1Verma I.M. Weitzman M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 711-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) or transposable elements (3Izsvak Z. Ivics Z. Mol. Ther. 2004; 9: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or passively without any special molecular device. Whereas the former occurs much more efficiently, exogenous DNA elements are inserted into the random location on the host chromosome in either case. Chromosomal insertion has several drawbacks in practical applications of transgene expression. Because the number of expression cassettes integrated into a cell by a single transfection event is usually limited (2Wurm F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar), multiplication of the target genes by laborious drug selection is sometimes required to maximize the gene expression in industrial purposes. In addition, random chromosomal insertion of exogenous genetic elements occasionally induces uncontrollable activation (or suppression) of endogenous genes, and this may lead to fatal side effects in medical applications. For example, in a recent gene therapy trial, the retroviral transfer of therapeutic genes into bone marrow stem cells induced malignant T-cell lymphoma through accidental activation of the LMO2 gene (4Nienhuis A.W. Dunbar C.E. Sorrentino B.P. Mol. Ther. 2006; 13: 1031-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Installing exogenous genes on stable autonomous DNA replicons, such as circular episomal DNA and linear human artificial chromosomes, may avoid these problems (5Jackson D.A. Juranek S. Lipps H.J. Mol. Ther. 2006; 14: 613-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although the significance of these replicons in medical and industrial applications is not yet established. Recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors also frequently maintain their genome as an episome in the nucleus, but the mechanism underlying this persistence and the long term stability in the cells have not been established (1Verma I.M. Weitzman M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 711-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).

Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 689-724Google Scholar). It has a single-strand RNA genome (15,384 nucleotides) encoding eight proteins (NP, P, C, V, M, F, HN, and L). Replication and transcription of SeV occurs in the cytoplasm with extremely low cell specificity and species specificity, although SeV is neither pathogenic nor carcinogenic in human beings. These characteristics make it a candidate for producing harmless viral vectors suitable for medical and industrial applications. Most recombinant SeV vectors developed by reverse genetics have genetic back-grounds of wild-type cytopathic SeV strains (Z and Fushimi) (7Bitzer M. Armeanu S. Lauer U.M. Neubert W.J. J. Gene Med. 2003; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Griesenbach U. Inoue M. Hasegawa M. Alton E.W. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2005; 7: 346-352PubMed Google Scholar). The replication-competent first generation vectors were prepared from the full-length viral genome cDNA with inserted exogenous genes. The replication-defective second generation vectors were prepared from the cDNA by deletion of essential viral genes. These vectors have characteristics reflecting those of the parental SeV strains (efficient gene transduction and strong gene expression, with low cell specificity and species specificity), and a gene therapy trial using a second generation SeV vector has been approved recently in Japan. However, none of these vectors could sustain gene expression for more than 10 days because of the cytopathic nature of the parental SeV strain. Extensive deletion and alteration of the viral genes should reduce the cytotoxicity to some extent (9Yoshizaki M. Hironaka T. Iwasaki H. Ban H. Tokusumi Y. Iida A. Nagai Y. Hasegawa M. Inoue M. J. Gene Med. 2006; 8: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but no SeV vector has been reported to express foreign genes stably in a wide variety of cells. Sendai virus defective-interfering interferon β interferon regulatory factor 3 Chinese hamster ovary enhanced green fluorescent protein C. noctiluca luciferase fibroblast growth factor-proteoglycan fusion protein multiplicity of infection 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid nucleotide(s) retinoic acid-inducible gene 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole Sendai virus defective-interfering interferon β interferon regulatory factor 3 Chinese hamster ovary enhanced green fluorescent protein C. noctiluca luciferase fibroblast growth factor-proteoglycan fusion protein multiplicity of infection 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid nucleotide(s) retinoic acid-inducible gene 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole In this article, we describe a novel RNA replicon based on a noncytopathic persistent variant SeV strain. We found that this unique virus strain established stable symbiosis with host cells by escaping from the antiviral reaction mediated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). This remarkable characteristic was maintained even after exogenous marker genes had been inserted into the virus genome, thus enabling us to express the marker genes stably for more than 6 months. We discuss the potential of this novel cytoplasmic RNA replicon in medical and industrial applications. Viruses and Cells—Sendai virus was grown in 10-day-old fertilized chicken eggs at 35.5 °C for 3 days (Z and Nagoya 1-60 strain, GenBank™ accession number AB275417) or at 32 °C for 5 days (Cl.151 strain, GenBank™ accession number AB275416) and was purified by sucrose step gradient centrifugation as described (10Kato K. Nakanishi M. Kaneda Y. Uchida T. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3361-3364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus MVAGKT7 (provided by Dr. G. R. Kovacs) was propagated using chicken embryo fibroblasts as described (11Kovacs G.R. Parks C.L. Vasilakis N. Udem S.A. J. Virol. Methods. 2003; 111: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). LLCMK2 and CV-1 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium, COS-1 and NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), and U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Each medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). cDNA Cloning—All of the recombinant DNA experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Recombinant DNA Experiment Committee of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. Genomic RNA of SeV was isolated from the purified virion as described (12Kondo T. Yoshida T. Miura N. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21924-21930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First strand cDNA corresponding to the SeV genome RNA was synthesized using the Superscript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Double-stranded genome cDNA was cloned into pBluescript II SK (+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as three overlapping clones (nucleotide numbers 1-2875, 2870-10484, and 10479-15384) after PCR amplification using Pfu Ultra high fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences of four independent SeV cDNA clones were determined by Takara Bio Inc. (Otsu, Japan). For constructing full-length genome cDNA of the Z strain, pSeV (+) (provided by Dr. A. Kato) was used as a template for PCR. A full-length SeV genome cDNA was finally assembled on λ DASH II (Stratagene). The primers used in this article are summarized in supplemental Table S2, and the detailed procedure of the cloning and assembly of the full-length SeV genome cDNA is described in supplemental Fig. S1. To construct the SeV vector, marker genes were inserted into a unique NotI site created in SeV genomic cDNA as described (13Hasan M.K. Kato A. Shioda T. Sakai Y. Yu D. Nagai Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), Cypridina noctiluca luciferase (CLuc), and fibroblast growth factor 1-proteoglycan fusion protein (PG-FGF-1) were amplified by PCR to add the transcription initiation signal (S) and termination signal (T), using pEGFP-1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), pCLm (14Nakajima Y. Kobayashi K. Yamagishi K. Enomoto T. Ohmiya Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and pMex-RyuII (15Yoneda A. Asada M. Oda Y. Suzuki M. Imamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as templates, respectively. The detailed procedure for the construction of the vector cDNA with marker genes is described in supplemental Fig. S2. Rescue of Recombinant SeV by Reverse Genetics—Recombinant SeV and the derivatives were rescued essentially as described (11Kovacs G.R. Parks C.L. Vasilakis N. Udem S.A. J. Virol. Methods. 2003; 111: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). LLCMK2 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) in 6-well plates were infected with MVAGKT7 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 plaque-forming units/cell and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were supplemented with 2 ml of fresh medium and transfected with SeV genome cDNA. A complex of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (10 μl), λ phage DNA encoding SeV genomic cDNA (5 μg), pGEM-NP (2 μg), pGEM-P (1 μg), and pGEM-L (2 μg) (pGEM-NP, -P, and -L were provided by Dr. D. Kolakofsky) was prepared according to the protocol provided by the supplier, added to each well of cell culture, and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The complex was removed, and the cells were incubated in fresh medium for 20 h at 32 or 37 °C. A cell lysate was prepared and inoculated into 10-day-old fertilized chicken eggs as described (13Hasan M.K. Kato A. Shioda T. Sakai Y. Yu D. Nagai Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The eggs were incubated at 35.5 °C for 3 days (Z and Nagoya strains and the derivatives) or at 32 °C for 5 days (Cl.151 strain and the derivatives), after which the viruses were recovered from the allantoic fluid. The titer of SeV in allantoic fluid was determined by measuring hemagglutinating activity (10Kato K. Nakanishi M. Kaneda Y. Uchida T. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3361-3364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant virus seeds were propagated in fertilized chicken eggs once and then purified using sucrose step density centrifugation as described (10Kato K. Nakanishi M. Kaneda Y. Uchida T. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3361-3364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of defective-interfering (DI) genomic RNA in the virus preparation was determined as described (16Strahle L. Garcin D. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 2006; 351: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic Assay—Because the ratio of plaque-forming units and viral particles differed significantly between different SeV strains and because Cl.151 did not make plaques at 37 °C, we used the 50% tissue culture infectivity dose (TCID50) as an index of viral infectivity. This was determined from the ratio of the cells expressing NP protein in the culture examined with an indirect immunofluorescent assay using a mouse anti-NP monoclonal antibody as described (17Eguchi A. Kondoh T. Kosaka H. Suzuki T. Momota H. Masago A. Yoshida T. Taira H. Ishii-Watabe A. Okabe J. Hu J. Miura N. Ueda S. Suzuki Y. Taki T. Hayakawa T. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17549-17555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One TCID50 unit of SeV suspension of the Cl.151 and Z strains corresponds to 1.25 and 0.125 pg of viral protein/cell, respectively. Cytotoxicity was determined using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science) that measures lactose dehydrogenase activity as described (9Yoshizaki M. Hironaka T. Iwasaki H. Ban H. Tokusumi Y. Iida A. Nagai Y. Hasegawa M. Inoue M. J. Gene Med. 2006; 8: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Detection of EGFP—To measure EGFP production in cultured cells, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and mounted in VECTASHIELD with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole HCl (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The EGFP signal was then examined by fluorescence microscopy as described (18Fujita S. Eguchi A. Okabe J. Harada A. Sasaki K. Ogiwara N. Inoue Y. Ito T. Matsuda H. Kataoka K. Kato A. Hasegawa M. Nakanishi M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2006; 29: 1728-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Animal Use—All of the animal experiments were performed according to the regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Advanced Industrial Science and Technology with permission of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were fasted for 24 h and then anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Osaka, Japan). The animals were restrained in a supine position on a thermocontrolled sheet to maintain body temperature during the experiment. Three hundred micrograms (protein) of SeV vector suspended in 0.3 ml of buffered salt solution (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) was administered directly through a 3-cm-long tube through the anus. The animals were euthanized at the times described in Fig. 2B, and tissue specimens were prepared and observed as described (19Goto T. Morishita M. Nishimura K. Nakanishi M. Kato A. Ehara J. Takayama K. Pharm. Res. 2006; 23: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except that the thickness of the transverse section was 20 μm. Determination of Secreted Marker Proteins—CLuc activity was determined as described (14Nakajima Y. Kobayashi K. Yamagishi K. Enomoto T. Ohmiya Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with modification: 50 μl of filtrated culture medium was mixed with 50 μl of C. noctiluca luciferin (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan; 216 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at room temperature, and the emission was determined with a luminometer (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). The amount of C. noctiluca luciferase was quantified using purified enzyme (ATTO) as a standard. To express PG-FGF-1 from the conventional DNA-based vector, the full-length PG-FGF-1 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI/NotI site of pMKIT-neo (provided by Dr. K. Maruyama) to create pMKIT-neo-PG-FGF-1, in which the cDNA was driven by the strong SRα promoter (20Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells (6.5 × 105 cells/well with 0.8 ml medium) were cultured in 12-well plates for 8 h. The cells were transfected with the complex of 2 μg of pMKIT-neo-PG-FGF-1 and 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 prepared in 200 μl of Opti-MEM according to the protocol provided by the supplier. The cells were incubated for 14 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of Opti-MEM, and the cells were incubated for a further for 48 h for transient expression. Under this condition, about 80% of the cells expressed the marker gene. To ensure stable expression, transfected cells were selected further with G418 (800 μg/ml), and a clonal cell line expressing the highest level of PG-FGF-1 was cultured for 48 h as described above. PG-FGF-1 was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (15Yoneda A. Asada M. Oda Y. Suzuki M. Imamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interferon β Promoter Activation Assay—A 172-bp KpnI/HindIII fragment containing the 140-bp human interferon β (IFNβ) promoter (from -119 bp to +21 bp, +1 = transcription start site) was excised from the pGL3-IFNβ-promoter-luc (provided by Dr. A. Matsuda) and inserted into a KpnI/HindIII site of pGL4.12 (Promega, Madison, WI) to create pIV3. Nineteen micrograms of pIV3 and 1 μg of pRSVHyg were cotransfected into LLCMK2 cells with DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One of the hygromycin-resistant clones (LLCMK2/pIV3/clone 16) containing the complete IFNβ promoter-luciferase transcription unit was used in this study. Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega), and protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). The IFNβ promoter was activated either by virus infection or by transfecting with a 147-nt 5′-triphosphate single-stranded RNA synthesized in vitro using a RiboMAX Large Scale RNA production system-T7 (Promega) (21Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzozka K. Jung A. Kato H. Poeck H. Akira S. Conzelmann K.K. Schlee M. Endres S. Hartmann G. Science. 2006; 314: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar, 22Pichlmair A.

Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3082) Google Scholar) as described in the figure legend. LLCMK2/pIV3/16/RIG-IC/clone 20 was the cell line derived from LLCMK2/pIV3/clone 16 and expressed RIG-IC (dominant-negative form of RIG-I) (23Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3082) Google Scholar) stably. This cell line was established by cotransfecting a RIG-IC expression cassette pNH63-8 (Flag-RIG-IC cDNA driven by CAG promoter) pRSV-Neo and selected by G-418 (1600 μg/ml) as described above. Determination of Viral RNA—Total cellular RNA was purified with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the supplier's protocol. Copy numbers of Cluc mRNA and SeV genome RNA in the cells were determined by a quantitative S1 nuclease assay using a double-strand DNA probe, which was 32P-labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (185 TBq/mmol), as described (24Murray M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Details of the S1 assay, including the structure of the probes against Cluc mRNA, SeV genomic RNA, and monkey β-actin mRNA, are described in supplemental Fig. S3. Five or 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized with 2 fmol each of the Cluc probe and monkey β-actin probe or with 2 fmol each of SeV genome probe and monkey β-actin probe in 10 μl of hybridization buffer (3 m sodium trichloroacetate, 50 mm PIPES-NaOH, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) at 45 °C for 16 h. The mixture was digested with S1 nuclease (400 units, in 200 μl of 250 mm NaCl, 40 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm ZnCl2, pH 5.5) at 37 °C for 60 min. Digested materials were recovered with ethanol precipitation and analyzed on a prewarmed, denatured 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Signals corresponding to the protected probes were quantified using the STORM 830 image analyzer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The results were normalized against monkey β-actin mRNA, and the copy numbers were estimated from the signal of predetermined single-strand RNA synthesized in vitro using a Ribo-MAX large scale RNA production system-T7 (Promega) according to the supplier's protocol. Characterization of the Genome Structure of SeV Clone 151 Strain—A noncytopathic persistent variant SeV strain Cl.151 (25Yoshida T. Nagai Y. Maeno K. Iinuma M. Hamaguchi M. Matsumoto T. Nagayoshi S. Hoshino M. Virology. 1979; 92: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was isolated originally from the parental cytopathic Nagoya strain (26Matsumoto T. Nagata I. Kariya Y. Ohashi K. Nagoya J. Med. Sci. 1954; 17: 93-97Google Scholar, 27Matsumoto T. Yamamoto N. Maeno K. J. Immunol. 1961; 87: 590-598PubMed Google Scholar) as a variant that caused stable persistent infection in baby hamster kidney cells at a nonpermissive temperature (38 °C). Cl.151 can establish persistent infection even in sensitive CV-1 cells without cytopathic effects (Fig. 1C). We showed previously that amino acid substitutions in the M protein of Cl.151 lead to temperature-sensitive virion production (12Kondo T. Yoshida T. Miura N. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21924-21930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Defective virion production might be responsible for the reduced cytotoxicity because accumulation of unassembled NP protein affects the relative levels of transcription and replication (6Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 689-724Google Scholar, 28Gubbay O. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the recombinant M-deleted SeV is still highly cytopathic, although it is defective in virion production, as is Cl.151 (29Inoue M. Tokusumi Y. Ban H. Shirakura M. Kanaya T. Yoshizaki M. Hironaka T. Nagai Y. Iida A. Hasegawa M. J. Gene Med. 2004; 6: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, SeV injures the infected cells by a mechanism that is independent of virus morphogenesis. To uncover the mechanism underlying the noncytopathic persistent nature of Cl.151, we cloned a cDNA corresponding to the full-length genome RNA of Cl.151 and characterized it in comparison with that of the parental Nagoya strain. Although no deletion or insertion was identified, we found 50 nucleotide substitutions throughout the viral genome, 35 of which led to the amino acid substitutions (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). Because the characteristics of different SeV strains are affected largely by external factors such as the presence of DI genome RNA, we then characterized the recombinant virus recovered from the cloned cDNA by reverse genetics to examine whether these substitutions alone were responsible and sufficient for exhibiting the phenotype of Cl.151. Recombinant SeV was recovered from the full-length genome cDNA by converting it to the antigenome RNA in the cytoplasm with the aid of T7 RNA polymerase. Simultaneous expression of NP, P, and L proteins in the cell encapsulates the de novo synthesized antigenome RNA and initiates the virus replication in the cytoplasm (30Kato A. Sakai Y. Shioda T. Kondo T. Nakanishi M. Nagai Y. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). One of the drawbacks of the original procedure is that full-length SeV genome cDNA (15384 bp) cloned into plasmid vectors was unstable in bacterial cells and frequently caused partial deletion during amplification (data not shown). To overcome this problem, we reconstructed the full-length SeV genome cDNAs on a nonlysogenic λ phage vector, which maintained the long SeV cDNA more stably in Escherichia coli than did plasmid vectors (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Antigenome RNA is transcribed from this cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter and is trimmed precisely by hairpin ribozyme derived from the tobacco ringspot virus (31Hampel A. Tritz R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4929-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We recovered virus at 32 °C, but not at 37 °C (the standard temperature for recovering wild-type SeV) from Cl.151 genomic cDNA; this is consistent with the temperature-sensitive replication of Cl.151. In addition, this recombinant SeV had characteristics indistinguishable from the original Cl.151: it infected various cultured cells persistently at nonpermissive temperature (≥37 °C) without cytopathic effects (Fig. 1C), and virion production occurred only at the permissive temperature (32 °C) (data not shown). We conclude that this cloned cDNA contains all the genetic information necessary and sufficient for reproducing the characteristics of Cl.151. Mechanism Underlying the Noncytopathic Phenotype of SeV Cl.151 Strain—Wild-type SeV induces apoptotic death in infected cells. This phenomenon is triggered by caspases 3, 8, and 9 (32Bitzer M.

The protein is a membrane-anchored thiol-oxidoreductase that has been hypothesized to be involved in the recognition and reduction of apocytochrome c, a prerequisite for covalent heme attachment. Here, we present the 1.7Å crystal structure of the soluble periplasmic domain of CcmH from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa-CcmH*). The protein contains a three-helix bundle, i.e. a fold that is different from that of all other thiol-oxidoreductases reported so far. The catalytic Cys residues of the conserved LRCXXC motif (Cys25 and Cys28), located in a long loop connecting the first two helices, form a disulfide bond in the oxidized enzyme.

What is the mechanism whereby the heme is covalently attached to c-type cytochromes? Despite the crucial role played by these proteins in many cellular processes, this question remains largely unanswered. In c-type cytochromes, the heme is covalently bound to the apoprotein via two thioether bonds between the heme vinyls and the thiol groups occurring in the conserved CXXCH motif. The apoprotein and the heme group have to be in the correct stereochemical orientation for promotion of thioether bond formation; however, the chemistry of such a process is poorly understood, and only recently, in vitro formation of a c-type cytochrome has been reported (1Daltrop O.

Although System III consists of a single cyt c heme lyase (3Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 1: 235-241Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and is adopted exclusively by eukaryotes, Systems I and II consist of different proteins that have been discovered in Gram-negative bacteria, in plant or protozoal mitochondria (System I), and in Gram-positive bacteria, plant chloroplasts, and cyanobacteria (System II) (4Thony-Meyer L.

Both systems comprise different membrane-anchored proteins that expose their active site to the periplasm (System I) or to the exterior (System II), each performing a particular function. The CcmABC components of System I have been recently recognized as subunits of an ATP binding cassette transporter that, together with CcmE and CcmD, acts as a heme release complex (7Feissner R.E. Richard-Fogal C.L. Frawley E.R. Kranz R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Ahuja U. Thony-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, since in the periplasm the 2 Cys residues of the heme binding motif of apocyt (CXXCH) are oxidized by DsbA (9Tan J.T. Bardwell J.C. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a crucial bottleneck in the maturation of apocyt is the required reduction of these cysteines before covalent heme attachment can occur. In System II, this reductive step is carried out by the thioredoxin-like (TRX-like) ResA, a membrane-associated thiol-oxidoreductase (10Colbert C.L. Wu Q. Erbel P.J. Gardner K.H. Deisenhofer J. Proc.

Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Fabianek R.A. Hofer T. Thony-Meyer L. Arch.

According to this view, the mixed disulfide complex between CcmH and apocyt is subsequently resolved by CcmG, releasing reduced apocyt and oxidized CcmH (15Reid E. Cole J. Eaves D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Thony-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CcmG is a structurally well characterized TRX-like protein that receives electrons from DsbD (17Edeling M.A. Guddat L.W. Fabianek R.A. Thony-Meyer L. Martin J.L.

Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 985-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), no structural information is available for any CcmH protein. Previous studies indicated that CcmH is a membrane-bound protein exposing the conserved redox-active LRCXXCQ motif to the periplasm; its essential role in the maturation of apocyt was suggested by the observation that loss of CcmH impairs the synthesis of c-type cytochromes in vivo (13Monika E.M. Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Fabianek R.A. Hofer T. Thony-Meyer L. Arch.

Moreover, in vitro evidence indicates that Rhodobacter capsulatus and Arabidopsis thaliana CcmH homologues are able to reduce the CXXCH motif of an apocyt-mimicking peptide (13Monika E.M. Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Meyer E.H. Giege P. Gelhaye E. Rayapuram N. Ahuja U. Thony-Meyer L. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that CcmH is redox-active and is specifically involved in the thioreduction pathway of cytochrome c maturation. To shed light on the extracytoplasmic-heme ligation process occurring in System I organisms, we expressed, crystallized, and characterized the soluble periplasmic domain of CcmH from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (hereafter named Pa-CcmH*). The three-dimensional structure of Pa-CcmH* solved at 1.7 A resolution reveals that the periplasmic domain adopts a peculiar three-helix bundle fold that is different from that of canonical thiol-oxidoreductases and provides a basis for understanding its specific reductant activity in a highly oxidizing environment. Moreover, we have determined (i) the pKa value of the 2 Cys residues (Cys25 and Cys28) engaged in the disulfide bond and (ii) the redox potential of both Pa-CcmH* and its physiological partner Pa-apocyt c551. The interaction between Pa-CcmH* and Pa-apocyt c551 was characterized in vitro, by fluorescence stopped-flow experiments, using a Trp-containing fluorescent variant of Pa-CcmH* and a dansylated nonapeptide mimicking the heme binding motif of P. aeruginosa cytochromes c551. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The soluble N-terminal domain of CcmH from P. aeruginosa (residues 21–100) was obtained by removing the signal peptide, the membrane-anchoring helix, and the cytoplasmic C-terminal stretch. The domain was amplified from the genomic DNA (strain PA01) and cloned in pET28b (Novagen). Site-directed mutants were produced by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression of the His tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; cells were grown in LB broth at 27 °C. Pa-CcmH* was purified in two steps with nickel affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. The yield of purified protein was ∼25 mg/liter. After tag cleavage with thrombin, Pa-CcmH* was again subjected to ion-exchange purification. Selenomethionine-substituted Pa-CcmH* was expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells in minimal medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter d-l-selenomethionine following standard procedures and was purified under the same conditions as the wild type protein. Protein Crystallization—Crystallization conditions were 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 20% polyethylene glycol 1000 at room temperature. Drops were prepared by mixing 2.5 μl of precipitant solution and 1.0 μl of protein (13 mg/ml) and allowed to equilibrate against 0.5 ml. High quality crystals for the Se-Met protein were obtained by mixing 1 μl of protein (9 mg/ml) and 1 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 38% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.8 m NaCl, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Crystals appeared in 2 days and grew to full size in 1 week. Diffraction data for both native and Se-Met crystals were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) Synchrotron (Grenoble, France). Data were indexed and integrated with DENZO and SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). One molecule was found in the asymmetric unit for both the native and the Se-Met derivative crystals. Crystal Structure Determination and Refinement—Pa-CcmH* structure was solved by a combination of MAD and MR procedures. MAD was carried out on the Se-Met derivative data. The program SOLVE (23Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) identified one selenium site. Initial phase calculation led to an overall figure of merit of 0.61 at 35-3.5 Å resolution. Solvent flattening with RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) improved the quality of the map, yielding a figure of merit of 0.8 at 2.5 Å resolution. The ARP-WARP (25Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 7: 978-981Google Scholar) automatic building procedure provided a partially built model. This model was then used as a template to perform an MR with the native data set using AMORE (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; : 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and gave a complete and easily interpretable electron density map at 1.7 Å resolution. The model (residue 1 in the structure corresponds to Ala21 in the full-length protein) was completely built, and water molecules were added using COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Several cycles of refinement (REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar)), visual inspection, and manual rebuilding led to a final Rfactor of 21.0% and Rfree of 23.5% at 1.7 Å resolution. The average atomic B-factor for the structure is 31.16 Å2. The model quality was checked with PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); all residues lie in the most favored and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank ID code 2HL7). Analysis of the cavities was performed with the program CastP (30Dundas J. Ouyang Z. Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W116-W118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Biochemical Analyses—Pa-apocyt was obtained from purified Pa-cyt c551 (prepared as described in Ref. 31Cutruzzola F. Ciabatti I. Rolli G. Falcinelli S. Arese M. Ranghino G. Anselmino A. Zennaro E. Silvestrini M.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) following the original protocol of Anfinsen and co-workers (32Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard redox potentials (E0′) of Pa-CcmH* and Pa-apocyt were determined as described previously (33Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). pKa Determination of the Active Site Cysteines—Reduced Pa-CcmH* (5 μm) was mixed with an excess of 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; 50–100 μm) in the pH range 4.0–9.5 in the Pi-Star stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK), and the reaction was monitored following the absorbance at 412 nm. Absorbance data were fitted to a single exponential function to obtain an observed, pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs). pKa values were determined by plotting kobs values as a function of pH and fitting to an appropriate equation. For single pKa processes, Equation 1 was used, kobs=kSH+kS-10pH-pKa1+10pH-pKa(Eq. 1) where kSH and kS- are the rate constants for the protonated and deprotonated forms, respectively (34Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For two proton dissociation events, an equation that takes into account two pKa values (35Jeng M.F. Holmgren A. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10101-11015Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used. Binding Kinetics—Binding kinetics of a Trp-containing variant of Pa-CcmH* (Y64W) with dansylated nonapeptide (dansyl-KGCVACHAI; JPT Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany) was measured in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. Reduced Pa-CcmH* (1 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride) was diluted 3-fold after a 10-min incubation and used at different concentrations in a 1 to 10 mixing ratio with dansylated peptide. Conditions after mixing were: 91-9.0 μm Pa-CcmH*; 0.3 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride; 4 μm peptide. Fluorescence time courses were monitored by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) following the emission of the dansyl group covalently linked to the N terminus of the peptide (λex = 280 nm, λem > 475 nm). Under pseudo-first order conditions (where [Pa-CcmH*] >> [peptide]), the dependence of the observed rate constant kobs on ligand concentration for a reversible association reaction follows Equation 2, kobs=k1[A0]+k-1(Eq. 2) where k1 is the association or on-rate constant, k-1 is the dissociation or off-rate constant, and [A0] is the initial concentrations of the varied reagent (36Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. 1999; (W. H. Freeman, New York): 132-168Google Scholar). Overall Structure of CcmH—The soluble redox-active N-terminal domain of Pa-CcmH (Pa-CcmH*), obtained by removing the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal membrane-anchoring helix, is composed of 80 residues. This domain was expressed in E. coli, purified, and crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure was solved by a combination of MAD and MR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The high quality electron density map obtained at 2.5 Å resolution by MAD using a Se-Met derivative enabled us to build a partial model of the protein. MR was employed to position the model in a different crystal form, obtaining a complete model at higher resolution. The final structural model consisting of 4 residues derived from the His tag cleavage site (numbered from -4 to -1) plus 78 residues of the protein domain (Val79 and Asn80 were excluded because they were undetectable in the electron density) was refined at 1.7 Å resolution with Rwork = 21% and Rfree = 23.5%.

Helices α1 (residues 10–22) and α2 (residues 39–54) are connected by a long loop (residues 23–38), whereas helices α2 and α3 are linked by a short loop (residues 58–69). A search using DALI (37Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) returned significant hits only with unrelated α-helical proteins, indicating that the three-helix bundle fold of Pa-CcmH* is unique among redox-active proteins. In Pa-CcmH*, the redox-active motif Cys25-Pro26-Lys27-Cys28 is part of the loop connecting helices α1 and α2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The electron density for the side chains of these 2 Cys residues is continuous, indicating that the protein is in the oxidized state (supplemental Fig. 1). Attempts to crystallize the reduced form were unsuccessful. The conformation of the disulfide bond, albeit located in a peculiar fold, resembles that of the TRX and TRX-like proteins, displaying the typical righthand hook conformation with the χs-s dihedral angle = 81.1°, the Sγ-Sγ distance = 2.02 Å, and the Cα-Cα distance = 5.34 Å (38Sevier C.S.

Structure (Camb.). 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) assumes that the solvent-exposed N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif performs a nucleophilic attack on the disulfide bridge of the target substrate. This process leads to a mixed disulfide complex that is subsequently resolved by the buried C-terminal Cys activated by a nearby conserved acidic residue (Asp or Glu) (41Menchise V. Corbier C. Didierjean C. Saviano M. Benedetti E. Jacquot J.P. Aubry A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Dyson H.J. Jeng M.F. Tennant L.L. Slaby I. Lindell M. Cui D.S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the accessible surface area reveals that in Pa-CcmH*, the N-terminal Cys25 residue is buried, whereas the C-terminal Cys28 is solvent-exposed, at variance with the canonical arrangement observed in the TRX superfamily where the N-terminal Cys of the CXXC motif is always solvent-exposed. Moreover, neither the acidic Asp/Glu residue nor the conserved and functionally important cis-Pro residue (44Martin J.L. Structure (Camb.). 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) are present in the active site, suggesting that Pa-CcmH* may catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange by a different mechanism. Multiple sequence alignment of CcmH homologues from various organisms (Fig. 2) shows that, in addition to the catalytic residues Cys25 and Cys28, 10 other residues are fully conserved, mostly located near the active site (Fig. 1B). Gly55 and Gly70 act as helix-breaking residues and are located at the end of the α2 and α3 helices, respectively; Leu23 and Val73 side chains point to the hydrophobic core of the bundle and presumably fulfill a structural role; Arg24 and Gln29 are located close to the catalytic Cys and may be involved in the binding to the redox partners of CcmH, apocyt, and/or CcmG. The hydroxyl group of the fully conserved Ser36 is at 6.2 Å distance from the Sγ of the Cys28, making implausible a direct interaction between these 2 residues. Interestingly, however, a water molecule found in the crystal structure is at 3.88 Å from the Sγ of Cys28 and H-bonded to the–OH group of Ser36 (2.59 Å). This H-bonding network involving a water molecule seems to be highly conserved in the CcmH proteins since the position of Ser36 is secured by the presence of the fully conserved Arg45, whose guanidinium group is H-bonded to the backbone oxygen of Ser36 (2.70 and 3.09 Å, respectively) (Fig. 1C). Taken together, evidence suggests a possible role for Ser36 in the activation of Cys28 through a water molecule (see below). The side chain of Ser36 is also found to line a small cavity (volume = 89.8 Å3). This pocket, located behind the catalytic cysteines, is surrounded by conserved or conservatively mutated polar and hydrophobic residues (Cys25, Cys28, Gln29, Asn30, Gln31, Ile33, Ser36, Ala38, Ile40, Ala41, Leu44). Although the overall hydrophobic character of the pocket is suitable for the interaction with an unfolded substrate, such as the heme binding motif of apocyt, the presence of conserved polar residues may be strategic in the recognition of the conserved His of the CXXCH motif of c-type cytochromes. Determination of the Redox Potential of Pa-CcmH* and Pa-apocyt—To provide information about the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of reducing equivalents in the redox pathway involving CcmH and apocyt in P. aeruginosa, we determined the redox potential (E0′) of Pa-CcmH* and Pa-apocyt. The difference in electrophoretic mobilities of the reduced-modified form and the oxidized form was used to estimate the E0′ values of Pa-CcmH* and Pa-apocyt following Inaba and Ito (33Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fit of the data (supplemental Fig. 2) to the Nernst equation yields E0′=-215 mV for Pa-CcmH* and E0′=-190 mV for Pa-apocyt. These values are in agreement with the estimates previously reported for the homologous protein Ccl2 from R. capsulatus and for a model peptide of apocyt c2 (-210 and 170 mV, respectively) (45Setterdahl A.T. Goldman B.S. Hirasawa M. Jacquot P. Smith A.J. Kranz R.G. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10172-10176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The slightly more positive E0′ value of Pa-apocyt is consistent with its reduction by Pa-CcmH*; therefore we conclude that the difference in redox potential, although small, is thermodynamically favorable. The pKa of the Active Site Cysteines—The pH dependence of the rate of reaction between DTNB and Pa-CcmH* was used to determine the pKa of the Cys residues. Control experiments carried out under pseudo-first order conditions at selected pH values confirmed that the reaction is second order (data not shown). At variance with what was observed in the case of TRX and TRX-like proteins (43Chivers P.T. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the time course was always monophasic (Fig. 3A, inset), suggesting a one-step bimolecular reaction mechanism. The pH dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constant for DTNB reduction by Pa-CcmH* (Fig. 3A) displayed a minor systematic deviation from a model accounting for a single titratable group, showing a Hill coefficient of about 0.8 (data analysis not shown). Thus, to assess the pKa of the active site thiols individually, two single variants of Pa-CcmH* (C25S and C28S) were generated and purified. The pseudo-first order rate constant of the reaction with DTNB of these variants at various pH values (Fig. 3B) can be fitted to a one-proton dissociation process, with very similar pKa values (8.4 ± 0.1 for Cys25 and 8.6 ± 0.1 for Cys28; see also Ref. (45Setterdahl A.T. Goldman B.S. Hirasawa M. Jacquot P. Smith A.J. Kranz R.G. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10172-10176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the case of TRX and TRX-like proteins, the pKa values of the catalytic Cys residues are widely separated, being in the range of 6.7–7.5 for the N-terminal reactive cysteine and >9 for the C-terminal one (42Dyson H.J. Jeng M.F. Tennant L.L. Slaby I. Lindell M. Cui D.S. Kuprin S. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2622-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 46Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the active site Cys residues of Pa-CcmH* have unusual pKa values when compared with canonical TRX proteins. Recently however, also for the TRX-like ResA protein from Bacillus subtilis, the two Cys residues were reported to have similarly close pKa values (12Lewin A. Crow A. Oubrie A. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35467-35477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); in this case, the crystal structure of the reduced state of the protein, responsible for the reduction of apocyt in System II, reveals an unusually large separation between the two thiols, which may account for the result. Comparison of the pH dependence of the reduction of DTNB by Pa-CcmH* (Fig. 3A) with that of the two single Cys variants (Fig. 3B) highlights faster pseudo-first order rate constants in the former case under the same co"
https://openalex.org/W1963665279,"Chromosome segregation in mitosis is orchestrated by dynamic interactions between spindle microtubules and centromeres, which in turn are governed by protein kinase- and phosphatase-signaling cascades. Previous studies showed that overexpression of human phosphatase HsCdc14A, an antagonist of cyclin-dependent kinase 1, affects several aspects of cell division. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HsCdc14A regulation in mitosis has remained elusive. Here we show that HsCdc14A activity is regulated by an auto-inhibitory mechanism via its intra-molecular association. Our biochemical study demonstrated that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) interacts with and phosphorylates HsCdc14A. This phosphorylation partially releases the auto-inhibition of HsCdc14A judged by its phosphatase activity in vitro. To examine the functional relevance of such phospho-regulation of HsCdc14A in vivo, a phospho-mimicking mutant of HsCdc14A was expressed in HeLa cells. Importantly, overexpression of the phospho-mimicking mutants caused aberrant chromosome alignment with a prometaphase delay, suggesting the temporal regulation of HsCdc14A activity is critical for orchestrating mitotic events. Given the fact that HsCdc14A forms an intra-molecular association and PLK1-mediated phospho-regulation promotes HsCdc14A phosphatase activity, we propose that PLK1-HsCdc14A interaction provides a temporal regulation of HsCdc14A in chromosome segregation during mitosis."

The influence on differentiation as well as the tumor suppressor activity may at least partially be due to the inhibitory impact of CEACAM1 on proliferation (21Hsieh J.T. Luo W. Song W. Wang Y.

All these cellular responses originate in the activation or inhibition of CEACAM1 by homophilic or heterophilic interactions. But how does CEACAM1 communicate its signal to the inside of the cell? By now, some mechanisms of signaling by CEACAM1 have been described, e.g. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent (15Yu Q. Chow E.M. Wong H. Gu J. Mandelboim O. Gray-Owen S.D. Ostrowski M. J.

Still, little is known about how CEACAM1 accomplishes its effects on the various cellular functions mentioned above, and there might be further mechanisms that link CEACAM1 to the different regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and cell fate control. With this in mind, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for new CEACAM1-L-interacting proteins that might play a role in CEACAM1 signaling. Thus we identified PDIP38 (DNA polymerase δ-interacting protein, 38-kDa apparent molecular mass, also known as Poldip2 and Mitogenin I) as a novel interaction partner. PDIP38 was originally identified as a PCNA- and DNA polymerase δ-interacting protein, implicating a function in the regulation of gene expression, DNA duplication, or DNA repair (33Liu L.

PDIP38 thus represents an interesting interaction partner for CEACAM1, because it could link the transmembrane adhesion receptor signaling directly to regulatory processes inside the nucleus. On the other hand, PDIP38 has been reported to be associated with mitochondria in three previous studies, which might not be congruent with a role in regulation of nuclear functions (34Xie B. Li H.

However, these studies were largely performed with transfected GFP-tagged PDIP38, which might give different subcellular localization patterns compared with that of endogenously expressed PDIP38. Therefore, with the aim to determine the subcellular distribution of endogenous PDIP38, we generated a panel of specific antibodies against PDIP38 that could be used for this purpose. We could thus demonstrate that endogenous PDIP38 interacts with both CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S and that it localizes to different cellular compartments, i.e. the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus. We found only a minor amount of endogenous PDIP38 associated with mitochondria. In NBT-II cells, the subcellular localization of PDIP38 depended on the cellular state and was affected by CEACAM1 perturbation using CEACAM1-specific antibody clustering. In proliferating NBT-II cells, this treatment led to rapid recruitment of PDIP38 to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the same treatment applied to quiescent NBT-II cells led to translocation of PDIP38 to the nucleus. The present study accordingly demonstrates that CEACAM1 can regulate the subcellular distribution of PDIP38 in NBT-II cells, suggesting that PDIP38 may represent a novel downstream target of CEACAM1 signaling. Antibodies, Peptides, Cell Lines, Vectors, and Materials—The monoclonal anti-rat CEACAM1 antibody Be9.2 (37Becker A. Neumeier R. Heidrich C. Loch N. Hartel S. Reutter W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367,: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the monoclonal anti-mouse CEACAM1 antibody AgB10 (38Greicius G. Severinson E. Beauchemin N. Öbrink B. Singer B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74,: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (not cross-reacting with rat CEACAM1) were described previously. Other monoclonal antibodies used were: anti-α3 integrin (Ralph3.2), anti-phospho tyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-PCNA (PC10, Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-His-Tag (Merck); and anti-DNA polymerase δ (p125 subunit) and anti-β1 integrin (BD Transduction Laboratories). Polyclonal antibodies used were: rabbit-anti-Histon H3 (Abcam); rabbit-anti-FAK (A-17) and rabbit-anti-TOM20 (FL-145) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit-anti-mouse IgG, goat-anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488-conjugate, goat-anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 546-, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugate (Molecular Probes); and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Control IgG from rabbit non-immune serum was purified using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The PDIP38 peptides P3 (NH2-CKAENPAGHGSKEVKGKTH-CONH2) and P8 (NH2-CSLESNKDEKTPPSGLHW-COOH), as well as the rabbit and guinea pig antisera against the peptides P3 and P8, were produced by Pineda-Antikörperservice (Berlin, Germany). If not stated otherwise, the IgG fractions of both rabbit antisera (P8R and P3R) were used, whereas the guinea pig antisera (P8G and P3G) were used as whole sera only. Rat brain endothelial (RBE) cells (14Müller M.M. Singer B.B. Klaile E. Öbrink B. Lucka L. Blood. 2005; 105,: 3925-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were transfected with rat CEACAM1-L, CEACAM1-S, and CEACAM1-Δcyto (a mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain) cDNA. The vectors containing these cDNAs were described previously (26Budt M. Cichocka I. Reutter W. Lucka L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383,: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RBE, HeLa, and Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in RPMI medium, and NBT-II and IEC18 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, both containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin; for transfected cells, 0.6 g/liter G418 was added. All cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. pGEX-4T and pRSET-A vectors were from Amersham Biosciences. The full-length mouse PDIP38 cDNA (clone IMAGp998F089456) from the IMAGE Consortium (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) (39Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33,: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung (Berlin, Germany). All cDNAs used were verified by sequencing using the Thermo Sequenase primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Fermentas or Invitrogen. All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid MATCHMAKER 3 GAL-4-based system (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used as described earlier (32Klaile E. Müller M.M. Kannicht C. Singer B.B. Lucka L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118,: 5513-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast strains AH109 and CG1945 were sequentially transformed with pGBKT7-CC1-L-cyto (containing aa 450-519 of rat CEACAM1-L) and the rat liver MATCHMAKER cDNA library (32Klaile E. Müller M.M. Kannicht C. Singer B.B. Lucka L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118,: 5513-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yeast plasmid was extracted using the YEASTMAKER kit (BD Biosciences Clontech). Specificity of reporter gene activation was confirmed by transformation of prey plasmid alone and by one-on-one transformations of prey plasmid pACT2-PDIP38 (aa 296-370) together with pGBKT7-DNA-BD, pGBKT7-53, pGBKT7-Lam (negative controls), or bait plasmid. Clones were tested for growth on selection medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, or were grown on selection medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and tested for β-galactosidase reporter gene activity in filter-lift assays and for α-galactosidase reporter gene activity in liquid assays (substrate: p-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactopyranoside). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis of Binding Sites—The following constructs were cloned and tested in one-on-one transformations in AH109 yeast cells as described above. Stop codons were inserted in the pGBKT7-CC1-L-cyto and pACT2-PDIP38 plasmids by PCR point mutation using the following primer pairs: (1Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Generation and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The full-length mouse PDIP38 cDNA (IMAGp998F089456) was excised from the pCMV-SPORT6 plasmid and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-3 plasmid, creating a GST-PDIP38 fusion protein with the GST tag at the N terminus. GST-PDIP38 (65 kDa) and GST (26 kDa) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-star (Invitrogen) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The generation, expression, and purification of the His-tagged cytoplasmic domain of rat CEACAM1-L (aa 447-519, CC1-L-cyto-His, 14 kDa) and the His-tagged control protein resulting from a frameshift of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase cDNA (GNE, 12 kDa, Fig. 2A) was done as described (40Budt M. Michely B. Müller M.M. Reutter W. Lucka L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292,: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purified His-tagged cytoplasmic domain of the α3 integrin subunit was kindly provided by Diana Mutz (Berlin, Germany). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Analyses were performed in a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore AB). The His-tagged cytoplasmic domains of rat CEACAM1-L (CC1-L-cyto-His) and of rat α3 integrin (α3-cyto-His, background control) were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (Amine Coupling Kit, BIAcore AB). For immobilization, 40 μl of CC1-L-cyto-His or 80 μl of α3-cyto-His (each 200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 2.7) were applied. All coupling reactions were carried out at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Biomolecular interaction analyses were performed in HBS Buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 3.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Between sample injections the surface was regenerated with 5 μl of 15 mm HCl. Binding constants were calculated assuming a 1:1 binding using the BIAevaluation software. Immunoprecipitation, Binding Assays, and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in HBS (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). When tyrosine phosphorylation was required, phosphatase inhibitors were added (1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm Na4P2O6, 100 mm NaF). For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of cleared lysates were incubated with 2-4 μg of the appropriate protein A-Sepharose-bound antibodies or Ig controls, washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gels, NuPAGE MOPS buffer, Invitrogen). For affinity binding assays, 10 μg of GST or GST-PDIP38 bound to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with 5 μg of CC1-L-cyto-His or 5 μg of control-His (GNE, frame-shifted), or with RBE-CC1-L/-S cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, 3 μg of nickel-Sepharose-bound CC1-L-cyto-His or α3-cyto-His (control) were incubated with NBT-II cell lysates. Protein detection on Western blots using nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) was performed using the luminol-based SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Detection of chemiluminescence and quantification was done using the Fujifilm LAS-1000 digital system. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop program for processing. In-gel Digestion and Peptide Mass Fingerprint—After immunoprecipitation using P8R antibody, the protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa was excised from a Coomassie G-250-stained gel and cleaved in situ with trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (41Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68,: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Digested samples were desalted using a Zip-Tip-C18 (Millipore) as proposed by the manufacturer, and the peptides were eluted from the tip filter with 10 μl of 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. 1.5 μl of the eluate was immediately spotted onto a MALDI-TOF target and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in a Bruker reflex mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in the reflector mode, equipped with pulse-ion extraction and a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Spectra were calibrated with adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18-39 and angiotensin II (both Sigma). Searches were performed in Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd.) using the data base NCBI and taxonomy Rattus norvegicus. Mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da, and one miscleavage was allowed. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on tissue culture-treated 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc). When indicated, cells were treated with antibodies as described, or were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (1:2000) for 20 min prior to fixation. In some cases, cells were serum-starved for 28 h and then treated with 10% serum prior to fixation. Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature and permeabilized for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS/0.025% saponin. Slides were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS, incubated with 10 μg/ml P8R and/or Be9.2 antibody for 2 h or overnight, washed, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:200) for 2 h. Samples were mounted in Elvanol (70% PBS, 25% glycerol, 5% Polyviol, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine). Images were obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Axiovert 200 inverse microscope equipped with the LSM 510 META system, Zeiss) at 63× magnification (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat, numerical aperture 1.4) or 40× magnification (Zeiss Plan-Neofluar, numerical aperture 0.75). Images were imported from the LSM 5 Image Examiner 3.2 software into Adobe Photoshop program for processing. Subcellular Fractionation—All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C, if not stated otherwise. The total volume of the samples was determined in all steps. NBT-II and HeLa cells were washed 1× with hypo-osmolar buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2), scraped into 750 μl of ice-cold hypo-osmolar buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, E-64, betastatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (Sigma)), and incubated for 30 min. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 600 × g (3 min). The resulting nuclear pellet was re-homogenized in 1 ml of hypo-osmolar buffer and re-pelleted. The pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of hyper-osmolar buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 μg/ml DNase I, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After 1 h at room temperature, the nuclear lysate (fraction “n”) was cleared at 17,000 × g (10 min). The supernatant was fraction “sn.” The pellet (fraction “in”) was solubilized in 80 μl of reducing Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 10% glycerol (v/v); 2.5% SDS (w/v); 0.006% bromphenol blue (w/v); 10 mm dithiothreitol). The 600 × g-supernatant was re-pelleted at 600 × g (10 min) and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant (fraction “s1”) was then centrifuged at 9,000 × g (10 min). The resulting mitochondrial enriched pellet was washed with 1 ml HBS (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2), and re-pelleted at 9,000 × g (10 min). The pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of hyper-osmolar buffer (see above). After 1 h at room temperature, the lysed mitochondrial enriched fraction (fraction “mi”) was cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g (10 min). The supernatant was fraction “smi.” The pellet (fraction “imi”) was solubilized in 75 μl of reducing Laemmli buffer. The 9,000 × g-supernatant (fraction “s2”) was cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g (10 min). The supernatant contained the cytoplasmic proteins (fraction “c”). The pellet containing small membrane fragments and insoluble proteins (fraction “me”) was solubilized in 75 μl of reducing Laemmli buffer. Identification of PDIP38 as a Novel CEACAM1-L-interacting Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screen against a rat liver cDNA library, using the cytoplasmic domain of rat CEACAM1-L (CC1-L-cyto) as a bait, identified PDIP38 as a putative CEACAM1-L-interacting protein. The interacting clone encoded the C-terminal 74 amino acids of the rat PDIP38 homologue (aa 296-370, accession number: XM_001080851, Fig. 1C). The specificity of the interaction was verified by one-on-one transformation into yeast strains AH109 and CG1945. Only PDIP38/CC1-L-cyto double transformants tested positive in α-galactosidase liquid assays (Fig. 1A) and β-galactosidase filter-lift assays (data not shown). Characterizat"
https://openalex.org/W2012872764,"Background HIV-1 integrase (IN) catalyses the retroviral integration process, removing two nucleotides from each long terminal repeat and inserting the processed viral DNA into the target DNA. It is widely assumed that the strand transfer step has no sequence specificity. However, recently, it has been reported by several groups that integration sites display a preference for palindromic sequences, suggesting that a symmetry in the target DNA may stabilise the tetrameric organisation of IN in the synaptic complex. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed the ability of several palindrome-containing sequences to organise tetrameric IN and investigated the ability of IN to catalyse DNA cleavage at internal positions. Only one palindromic sequence was successfully cleaved by IN. Interestingly, this symmetrical sequence corresponded to the 2-LTR junction of retroviral DNA circles—a palindrome similar but not identical to the consensus sequence found at integration sites. This reaction depended strictly on the cognate retroviral sequence of IN and required a full-length wild-type IN. Furthermore, the oligomeric state of IN responsible for this cleavage differed from that involved in the 3′-processing reaction. Palindromic cleavage strictly required the tetrameric form, whereas 3′-processing was efficiently catalysed by a dimer. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that the restriction-like cleavage of palindromic sequences may be a general physiological activity of retroviral INs and that IN tetramerisation is strongly favoured by DNA symmetry, either at the target site for the concerted integration or when the DNA contains the 2-LTR junction in the case of the palindromic internal cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1974639277,"Common diseases may be attributed to combinations of variant alleles, but there are few model systems where the interactions among such variants can be studied in controlled genetic crosses. While association studies are designed to detect common polymorphisms of moderate effect, new approaches are required to characterize the impact on disease of interactions among rare alleles.We show that wild populations of Drosophila melanogaster harbor rare polymorphisms of major effect (RAME) that predispose flies to a specific disease phenotype, age-dependent cardiac dysfunction. A screen of fifty inbred wild-type lines revealed a continuous spectrum of pacing-induced heart failure that generally increases in frequency with age. High-speed video analysis of the inbred lines with high rates of inducible heart failure indicates specific defects in cardiac function, including arrhythmias and contractile disorders ('cardiomyopathies'). A combination of bulked segregant analysis and single feature polymorphism (SFP) detection localizes one of the cardiac susceptibility loci to the 97C interval on the fly genome.Wild-type Drosophila, like humans, are predisposed to cardiac dysfunction. Identification of factors associated with these naturally occurring cardiac traits promises to provide important insights into the epidemiology of cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W1976244060,"Gene regulatory networks have been conserved during evolution. The Drosophila wing and the vertebrate hindbrain share the gene network involved in the establishment of the boundary between dorsal and ventral compartments in the wing and adjacent rhombomeres in the hindbrain. A positive feedback-loop between boundary and non-boundary cells and mediated by the activities of Notch and Wingless/Wnt-1 leads to the establishment of a Notch dependent organizer at the boundary. By means of a Systems Biology approach that combines mathematical modeling and both in silico and in vivo experiments in the Drosophila wing primordium, we modeled and tested this regulatory network and present evidence that a novel property, namely refractoriness to the Wingless signaling molecule, is required in boundary cells for the formation of a stable dorsal-ventral boundary. This new property has been validated in vivo, promotes mutually exclusive domains of Notch and Wingless activities and confers stability to the dorsal-ventral boundary. A robustness analysis of the regulatory network complements our results and ensures its biological plausibility."
https://openalex.org/W1991841963,"Human and mouse show markedly different sensitivities toward bacterial endotoxins, and recent evidence suggests that a species-specific regulation of the lipopolysaccharide receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) may contribute to this phenomenon. To gain further insight into mechanisms of Tlr4 regulation, we conducted a detailed in vivo and in vitro study of the murine Tlr4 gene, including analysis of transcription start site location, transcription factor occupancy, and activities of its proximal regulatory sequences. Our analyses identified a PU.1-dependent myeloid promoter, which is conserved between humans and mouse. We also identified an additional, distal promoter, located approximately 200 bp upstream of the myeloid-specific promoter, which is a functional target of E-box binding factors. In contrast to humans, where non-myeloid cells utilize both promoters, the distal Tlr4 promoter initiates all Tlr4 transcripts in murine non-myeloid cells, indicating that species-specific differences in TLR4 mRNA regulation may primarily exist in non-myeloid cell types. Interestingly, PU.1 null murine myeloid progenitor cells predominantly use the distal promoter, and the conditional induction of PU.1 expression in these cells leads to the rapid switch of transcription initiation to the proximal myeloid promoter. This indicates a direct role for PU.1 in determining the transcriptional start site and in recruiting the basal transcription machinery to myeloid promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2138576569,"In light of the involvement of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis, strategies to prevent TAM recruitment within the tumor microenvironment are currently under investigation. The recent observation that angiostatin reduces macrophage infiltration in an atherosclerosis model prompted our laboratory to further explore the use of human plasminogen angiostatin (hK1-3) protein as a macrophage modulatory agent. We demonstrate that hK1-3 blocks migration of murine peritoneal macrophages (91% decrease, P<0.00005) and human monocytes (85% decrease, P<0.05) in vitro. Cell viability of hK1-3-treated cells is not affected, as determined by fluorochrome-labeled inhibitors of caspase-propidium iodide (FLICA/PI) flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, confocal microscopy of phalloidin-stained cells reveals that hK1-3 leads to disruption of actin filopodia/lamellipodia in human monocytes and induces distinct podosome accumulation in mature differentiated macrophages. Paradoxically, we observed a 3.5-fold increase in secretion and a 3- to 5.5-fold increase in gelatinolytic activity of macrophage-produced matrix metalloproteinase-9, which we suggest is a cellular response to compensate for the dominant static effect of hK1-3 on actin. We also demonstrate that hK1-3 induces the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) in human monocytes. hK1-3-mediated macrophage immobilization has the potential to be exploited therapeutically in pathological conditions associated with cellular hypoxia, such as cancer and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969903820,"Subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1) represents the first mammalian member of secretory subtilisin-like processing enzymes that cleaves after nonbasic residues. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor that undergoes three sequential autocatalytic processing steps of its N-terminal prosegment and an ectodomain shedding at a site near the transmembrane domain. The various cellular functions of SKI-1 emphasize the need to understand the sites of its activation and shedding. We have previously shown that SKI-1 undergoes autocatalytic shedding at the sequence KHQKLL953↓, resulting in a membrane-bound stump called St-1 (amino acids 954-1052). However, little is known about the cellular localization of SKI-1 or its shed forms. In the present study, we have further identified a smaller C-terminal fragment St-2 generated closer to the transmembrane domain. By sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis, the start site and the molecular mass of St-2 were determined. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed the critical amino acid involved in this novel process. Mutation of Met990 to M990A, M990I, and M990L failed to generate St-2, suggesting an internal alternate translation event at Met990, as confirmed by an in vitro transcription/translation assay. Confocal microscopy defined the subcellular localization of SKI-1 and its fragments. The data show that most of membrane-bound SKI-1 and its stumps St-1 and St-2 localize to the Golgi and can enter the endosomal/lysosomal compartments but do not sort to the cell surface. Deletion studies showed that the transmembrane domain of SKI-1 determines its trafficking. Finally, rSt-1 and rSt-2 seem to affect the processing of ATF6 by SKI-1, but cellular stress does not regulate the production of St-2.

The membrane-bound SKI-1 is rendered soluble via an autocatalytic ectodomain shedding event at a KHQKLL953 ↓ site near the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A) (15Elagoz A. Benjannet S. Mammarbassi A.

Shedding of SKI-1 releases a soluble protein soluble SKI-1 (aa 188-953), leaving behind a membrane-bound stub (St-1; aa 954-1052) (Fig. 1A). The biological importance of the shedding and the role, if any, of the membrane-bound stub St-1 is unknown. In the present study, we have identified a new mechanism generating a smaller membrane-bound C-terminal fragment, denoted as St-2 (Fig. 1A). Microsequencing and mass spectrometric data revealed that St-2 starts at Met990. Site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro transcription/translation indicated a unique alternate translation event starting at Met990. Immunocytochemistry performed on endogenous and overexpressed SKI-1 and various constructs, including those coding for St-1 and St-2, revealed that SKI-1 can sort to endosome/lysosomes but not to the cell surface. These stumps seem to interfere with the ability of SKI-1 to process pro-ATF6 into its nuclear form in response to cellular stress. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.

All of the bound antibody-antigen complex was eluted from Protein A beads by incubation in 2 × 150 μl of 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8) for 10 min at room temperature with shaking. Supernatants were collected, combined, and neutralized with 30 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The elutants were concentrated 20× with an Amicon Ultra YM3 Centricon (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis, 10 μl of the sample was applied to an Au Chip (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and allowed to air-dry at room temperature. 1 μl of saturated sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile plus 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was added to each spot. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Ciphergen Protein Biology System II (PBS II). Analyses represent an average of 100 shots, and masses were calibrated internally with All-in-1 Protein Standards (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Palo Alto, CA). In Vitro Transcription/Translation—rSt-1 was excised from pIRES-rSt-1-V5 using HindIII/BamHI and subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector.

The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 90 min, samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were analyzed using mAb/V5 (1:5000). Production of Human SKI-CT Antibody—Human SKI-1 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing two rabbits with a peptide containing an N-terminal Cys linked to the segment aa 1036-1051 of SKI-1 (C-RPQLMQQVHPPKTPSV), which was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using a standard keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugation kit protocol (Sigma). The two rabbit bleeds were analyzed, and the best one (R2-02) called Ab-CT was used for Western blot analysis (1:1000) and subcellular localization (1:500) studies. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—To detect endogenous SKI-1, human hepatocyte (HuH7) cells were plated, and 24 h later the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton to permeabilize them.

In another experiment, we used triple transfections of 1 μg each of rATF6 and SKI-1, along with either an empty 2 μg of pIRES2 vector (control) or 2 μg of cDNAs coding for either rSt-1 or rSt-2. 24 h later, cells were treated or not with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin for 12 h. Thereafter, the cells were treated with ALLN (Sigma) at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml for 1 h.

Analysis of the C-terminal Products of SKI-1—Following transient transfection in three cell lines of C-terminally V5-tagged full-length SKI-1 (SKI-1), we analyzed the processing of the membrane-bound zymogen proSKI-1. HEK293 cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]Arg for 4 h, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb/V5, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in Tris-Tricine.

However, in this more resolving separation, we also observed a smaller ∼8.5-kDa V5-positive product running at the bottom of the gel, estimated at 11-17% of total (St-2; Fig. 1B), suggesting that it represents a shorter C-terminal fragment.

https://openalex.org/W2014048071,"The alpha-complex proteins (alphaCP) are generally known as RNA-binding proteins that interact in a sequence-specific fashion with single-stranded poly(C). These proteins are mainly involved in various post-transcriptional regulations (e.g., mRNA stabilization or translational activation/silencing). Here we report a novel function of alphaCP3, a member of the alphaCP family. alphaCP3 bound to the double-stranded poly(C) element essential for the mu opioid receptor (MOR) promoter and repressed the promoter activity at the transcriptional level. We identified alphaCP3 using affinity column chromatography containing the double-stranded poly(C) element and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. AlphaCP3 binding to the poly(C) sequence of the MOR gene was sequence specific, as confirmed by the supershift assay. In cotransfection studies, alphaCP3 repressed the MOR promoter only when the poly(C) sequence was intact. Ectopic expression of alphaCP3 led to repression of the endogenous MOR transcripts in NS20Y cells. When alphaCP3 was disrupted using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in NS20Y cells, the transcription of the endogenous target MOR gene was increased significantly. Our data suggest that alphaCP3 can function as a repressor of MOR transcription dependent on the MOR poly(C) sequence. We demonstrate for the first time a role of alphaCP3 as a transcriptional repressor in MOR gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2064629897,"Cancer is a complex, multi-step process characterized by misregulated signal transduction and altered metabolism. Cancer cells divide faster than normal cells and their growth rates have been reported to correlate with increased metabolic flux during cell transformation. Here we report on progressive changes in essential elements of the biochemical network, in an in vitro model of transformation, consisting of primary human keratinocytes, human keratinocytes immortalized by human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) and passaged repeatedly in vitro, and the extensively-passaged cells subsequently treated with the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene. We monitored changes in cell growth, cell size and energy metabolism. The more transformed cells were smaller and divided faster, but the cellular energy flux was unchanged. During cell transformation the protein synthesis network contracted, as shown by the reduction in key cap-dependent translation factors. Moreover, there was a progressive shift towards internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. The switch from cap to IRES-dependent translation correlated with progressive activation of c-Src, an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which controls energy-consuming processes, including protein translation. As cellular protein synthesis is a major energy-consuming process, we propose that the reduction in cell size and protein amount provide energy required for cell survival and proliferation. The cap to IRES-dependent switch seems to be part of a gradual optimization of energy-consuming mechanisms that redirects cellular processes to enhance cell growth, in the course of transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1985434511,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) and its conjugate receptor (SR) mediate cotranslational targeting of a subclass of proteins destined for secretion to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes or to the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. Conserved active site residues in the GTPase domains of both SRP and SR mediate discrete conformational changes during formation and dissociation of the SRP.SR complex. Here, we describe structures of the prokaryotic SR, FtsY, as an apo protein and in two different complexes with a non-hydrolysable GTP analog (GMPPNP). These structures reveal intermediate conformations of FtsY containing GMPPNP and explain how the conserved active site residues position the nucleotide into a non-catalytic conformation. The basis for the lower specificity of binding of nucleotide in FtsY prior to heterodimerization with the SRP conjugate Ffh is also shown. We propose that these structural changes represent discrete conformational states assumed by FtsY during targeting complex formation and dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1977060458,"The adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) receptor (melanocortin 2 receptor, or MC2R) is the smallest G-protein-coupled receptor that, when activated by the peptide hormone ACTH, stimulates cAMP production and adrenal steroidogenesis. Receptor expression is dependent on a specific membrane trafficking process involving an accessory protein (melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein, or MRAP) and other unidentified components. In an attempt to discover novel receptor interacting proteins, the C-terminal tail of the MC2R was used to screen a mouse adrenal Y6 cell cDNA library using the bacterial two-hybrid system. This identified the nucleoporin Nup 50 (Npap60) as the major full-length interacting protein. Interaction was confirmed by a GST pulldown assay and by coimmunoprecipitation in human H295R cells (which express both proteins endogenously). Deletion analysis identified the region between residues 143 and 466 in Nup50 as being required for interaction with the MC2R. Stimulation of H295R cells with ACTH (10(-6) M) was followed by a gradual translocation of the Nup50-MC2R complex from the membrane to the nucleus after 30 min. This time course is most consistent with MC2R internalization dynamics and may suggest a novel role for Nup50."

Although professional antigen-presenting cells (B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells) express MHC II constitutively, interferon-γ will induce MHC II on most negative tissues/cells. Expression of both constitutive and inducible MHC II is regulated by a master transcriptional co-activator, CIITA (1Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). CIITA also regulates expression of MHC II-related genes such as HLA-DM and invariant chain through the W, X, and Y elements common to this family of promoters (2Chang C.H. Fontes J.D. Peterlin M.

Class II MHC expression levels, both constitutive and cytokine-induced, are in large part regulated via transcriptional control of CIITA through multiple promoters, each with particular tissue restriction and induction patterns (5Lennon A.M.

However, post-translational modification of CIITA function, either directly via signaling events (e.g. phosphorylation and ubiquitination) or indirectly through histone deacetylase association during infection also influences MHC II expression, suggesting that CIITA is highly regulated (8Li G.

CIITA can self-associate and likely forms larger complexes mediated by homotypic and heterotypic interactions between the GTP-binding domain and the leucine-rich repeats (19Linhoff M.W. Harton J.A.

These interactions may be important for transcription activation, but it remains unclear whether they are critical for nuclear import. Once in the nucleus, CIITA participates in chromatin remodeling and activates MHC II transcription. Although a non-DNA-binding protein, CIITA directs MHC II transcription by forming a scaffold or enhanceosome at the promoter through interactions with RFX, CREB, NF-Y, and components of the basal transcription machinery (21Zhu X.S.

The histone acetyltransferases CBP (CREB-binding protein), p300, and pCAF cooperatively activate CIITA-driven gene expression, and CIITA may have its own acetyltransferase activity (25Raval A.

Conversely, CIITA can be negatively regulated by phosphorylation at a number of different serine residues (8Li G. Harton J.A. Zhu X. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell.

Mutants with defective GTP binding have been used to demonstrate the importance of the GTP-binding domain of CIITA in nuclear import and export, dimerization, and intrinsic acetyltransferase activity (18Raval A.

Because GTP-binding domain mutations render CIITA largely cytoplasmic, whether GTP binding is actually required for CIITA transcription activation potential remains unclear. In this report we explore the GTP dependence of CIITA-mediated MHC II transcription activation using CIITA constructs containing the strong SV40 nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS). Under conditions of enforced nuclear expression, activation of MHC II transcription by CIITA appears to be largely GTP-dependent. Further GTP binding appears important for recruitment to the MHC II promoter and may mediate CIITA interactions with promoter-bound transcription factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Culture Cells and Conditions—COS-7 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 mm l-glutamine, and 0.1% streptomycin-penicillin. All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Plasmid Constructs—pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and FLAG-tagged versions of wild-type CIITA and the CIITA GTP binding mutants GTP1, GTP2, GTP3, C2RASG1, and C2RG1L465Q have been described previously (27Harton J.A.

To generate the chimera C2RAS, an Eco47III site at nucleotides 1279–1284 and a ClaI site at nucleotides 1707–1712 of wild-type CIITA were generated using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Following digestion, an amplified Eco47III/ClaI-flanked fragment of the GTPase-inactive RasQ61L oncogene was inserted. All the NLS-tagged forms of these mutants were generated by transferring the AocI/SacII fragment containing the entire nucleotide-binding domain into AocI/SacII-digested NLS-CIITA (14Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The sequences of all DNA amplification-generated constructs were confirmed by fluorescent dye terminator sequencing.Luciferase Assays—Transient cotransfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells/well were plated in 24-well plates, cultured overnight, and transfected with DRA300Luc (a luciferase reporter driven by the MHC class II HLA-DR promoter) and either pcDNA3 (vector control), FLAG-tagged NLS-CIITA, or NLS-CIITA mutant plasmids (14Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were lysed 16–18 h posttransfection in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (29Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). Each transfection was performed in triplicate, and luciferase data were normalized to total protein.Western Blotting—Following transfection of cells with 1 μg of DNA, cell were lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) containing 1× Complete™ (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were normalized, and 5 μgof protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blotting for the FLAG epitope was performed as described (19Linhoff M.W. Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Martin B.K. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3001-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescent staining of transiently transfected COS-7 cells was performed as previously described (14Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 to 8 × 104 cells were plated on two-well chamber slides (Nunc), incubated overnight at 37 °C, and transfected with 1 to 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6. After a second overnight incubation, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat serum, and stained with anti-FLAG(M5) (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Southern Biotech). To ensure representative data in these experiments, prior to taking representative photomicrographs for each experiment the entire slide was examined under 400–500× magnification to observe the pattern of nuclear and cytoplasmic expression.ChIP Assay—HeLa cells were plated (1 × 106 cells/100-mm plate) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 3 μg of the indicated plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) were performed in accordance with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 18–24 h post-transfection DNA-protein cross-linking was accomplished at room temperature with 0.37% formaldehyde for 10 min and stopped by addition of 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. Cells were lysed on ice for 15 min with SDS cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). After lysis, chromatin was sheared to an average size of 200–1200 bp by sonication. Lysates were diluted 1:2 with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with Protein G Plus A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 10 μg of anti-FLAG M5 (Sigma). DNA-protein-antibody-bead complexes were then washed at room temperature using the following: TSE-500 wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.1), LiCl wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 100 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.1) and 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). In addition, no-antibody control immunoprecipitations were performed. Elution of the DNA-protein complexes was accomplished with a 1% SDS and 50 mm NaHCO3 buffer solution. Cross-links were reversed overnight at 65 °C. Samples were then incubated with 1.0 μgof Proteinase K for 1 h, and DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform extraction. Recovered HLA-DR promoter DNA was assayed by real-time PCR using 15% of the recovered DNA.Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was performed using a MyIQ Thermocycler (Bio-Rad) with the following MHC II promoter primers: sense primer, 5′-GAT CTC TTG TGT CCT GGA CCC TTT GCA A-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCC AAT TAC TCT TTG GCC AAT CAG AAA A-3′. Quantification of the HLA-DR promoter was conducted in a total volume of 25 μl with 2× Sybr Green (Bio-Rad). Thermal cycler parameters were 3 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing/extension at 55 °C for 1 min.RESULTSThe GTP-dependent functions of CIITA are not fully understood. Previously we demonstrated that CIITA mutants with decreased abilities to bind GTP remain principally cytoplasmic and thus unable to effectively activate MHC II transcription (Table 1) (27Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Der C.J. Ting J.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these observations may be due to increased nuclear export as other studies suggest enhanced binding of the same mutants to CREM1, the major protein responsible for nuclear export (18Raval A. Weissman J.D. Howcroft T.K. Singer D.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Diminished self-association of certain CIITA-GTP mutants suggests that molecular interactions between CIITA molecules may be disrupted or non-productive if GTP is not bound (19Linhoff M.W. Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Martin B.K. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3001-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Sisk T.J. Roys S. Chang C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4919-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus it remains unclear what role, if any, GTP binding actually plays in transcriptional activation. To directly test whether CIITA requires GTP binding to activate transcription of MHC II, we generated NLS-tagged versions of several GTP binding mutants and examined their ability to activate transcription from the HLA-DRA promoter (Fig. 1). All of the NLS-tagged constructs display nuclear localization comparable with that seen with wild-type NLS-CIITA (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our previous results where we observed no apparent nuclear localization of the untagged mutants, the phosphate-binding domain (GTP1) and guanine ring-binding domain (GTP3) mutants essentially lack the ability to activate MHC II transcription (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, however, the GTP2 mutation that eliminates the consensus magnesium ion coordination site (DAYG) retains substantial ability to activate transcription from the HLA-DRA promoter. We have previously observed that reducing the amount of transfected DNA can reveal the effects of nuclear import-related differences in activation potential relative to wild-type controls (17Harton J.A. Zika E. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38715-38720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Harton J.A. O'Connor W. Conti B.J. Linhoff M.W. Ting J.P. Hum. Immunol. 2002; 63: 588-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, transfections of cells with a tenth of the DNA yielded essentially the same pattern, suggesting that NLS-GTP2 is functionally impaired, retaining only ∼50% activity relative to wild-type, and that the reduced activity is not a consequence of import differences. These data strongly suggest that CIITA requires GTP for the full activation of HLA-DRA transcription.TABLE 1Summary of transactivation potential and nuclear localization for CIITA GTP-binding domain mutantsConstructG1G3G4GTPase activityRelative activationNuclear localization%CIITAGKAGQGKSDAYG LSKAD-100C/NGTP1–AGQGKSDAYG LSKADND38CGTP2GKAGQGKS—- LSKADND10CGTP3GKAGQGKSDAYG L—-ND21CC2RASG1GAGVGGKSDAYG LSKAD-95C/NC2RASG1L465QGAGVGGKSDAYG QSKAD+30C Open table in a new tab Mutation of the phosphate-binding domain of CIITA to that of Ras (C2RasG1) does not diminish activation of HLA-DRA transcription; however, the addition of the L465Q point mutation to either C2RASG1 (C2RG1L465Q) or to wild-type CIITA imparted intrinsic GTPase activity to CIITA (27Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Der C.J. Ting J.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that CIITA GTPase activity correlated with diminished transcriptional activation ability and an apparent loss of nuclear translocation. Presumably, limited nuclear import of C2RG1L465Q is sufficient to partially activate transcription but insufficient for successful immunofluorescent staining. If the diminished capacity of this mutant is due principally to the import defect, restoration of nuclear localization would be expected to completely restore function. The NLS-tagged forms of both C2RASG1 and C2RASG1L465Q display nuclear localization comparable with wild-type NLS-CIITA (Fig. 2A), but the GTPase active form of CIITA has ∼50% of the activity of the parent construct (Fig. 2B). Thus, even with detectable and apparently normal nuclear localization, GTPase-active CIITA is impaired in its ability to activate transcription. This observation further supports the hypothesis that the GTP-bound state of CIITA influences its transcriptional activity.FIGURE 2The GTPase-active CIITA mutant C2RG1L465Q decreases CIITA-mediated transactivation. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with either 1 μg (A) or 100 ng (B) of the indicated constructs and the HLA-DR luciferase reporter. Transactivation ability was normalized to that of NLS-C2RASG1 (100%; relative activation), the functional, non-GTPase parent construct. Data shown represent the mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)How GTP binding imparts transactivation capacity to CIITA is unclear. One possibility is that GTP binding confers a transactivation-permissive conformation. To test this, wild-type CIITA and GTP mutants were fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and tested for their ability to activate a GAL4-luciferase promoter/reporter construct (Fig. 3). From previous studies, it is known that phosphorylation of CIITA by cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits the ability of GAL4-CIITA to activate a GAL4-luciferase promoter (8Li G. Harton J.A. Zhu X. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4626-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, deletion of critical GTP binding elements in GAL4-CIITA had no effect on activation of GAL4-luciferase, suggesting that GTP binding defects do not impair the availability of the activation domain. Interestingly, GAL4-C2RASG1 has an increased ability to activate transcription whereas that of GAL4-C2RG1L465Q is decreased relative to its parent construct (C2RASG1). Although some correlation with GTP binding may account for the increased activity of C2RasG1, the lack of differences between wild type and deletion or GTPase-active mutants strongly suggests that GTP binding differences do not alter transactivation domain availability.FIGURE 3GTP domain mutations do not adversely affect CIITA activation domain function. COS-7 cells were transfected with DNA coding for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pSG424), GAL4 fused to wild-type CIITA (GAL4-CIITA), or the indicated GTP-binding domain mutants and a Gal4 luciferase reporter with five copies of the Gal4 DNA binding motif. Luciferase activity was normalized to the parent construct, GAL4-CIITA (100%; relative activation). Luciferase activity in triplicate transfections is shown as the mean ± S.E. and is representative of results from one of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our data suggested that GTP does not alter availability of the distal N-terminal transactivation domain; however, GTP-dependent conformational changes affecting residues near the motifs mediating GTP binding might be important. To explore this idea, the GTP-binding domain of Ras61L (GTPase-deficient) was cloned into CIITA to generate C2RAS (Fig. 4A). C2RAS retains the phosphate binding loop (G1) of CIITA but contains the nucleotide-binding domain of the oncogenic, GTPase-defective Ras61L mutant from residue 18 through 127 and displays GTP binding comparable with Ras in an in vitro exchange assay (not shown). C2RAS fails to activate HLA-DRA transcription (not shown) and has defective nuclear import (Fig. 4B). To rule out failed nuclear import as a reason for lack of transactivation ability, C2RAS was tagged with the SV40 NLS. NLS-C2RAS enters the nucleus but still fails to activate transcription (Fig. 4, B and C). These observations suggest that residues within the domain, but not directly involved in nucleotide binding, are required for activation, even in the presence of an intact GTP-binding domain.FIGURE 4CIITA nuclear localization and HLA-DRA transactivation require the CIITA GTP-binding domain.A, schematic of the C2RAS construct that contains the GTP-binding domain of the Ras Q61L, non-GTPase-active oncogene.

B, anti-FLAG immunofluorescence staining is shown for COS-7 cells expressing transfected wild-type CIITA and C2RAS, without and with the addition of an N-terminal NLS sequence. C, HLA-DR luciferase reporter activation by NLS-CIITA versus NLS-C2RAS. Data are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.

This led us to consider whether the defect was in recruitment of the GTP-binding domain mutants to the promoter or in the ability of the mutants to transactivate. CIITA interacts cooperatively with the histone acetyltransferases CBP, pCAF, and p300 leading to increased transactivation and requires the N terminus of CIITA (16Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J.

We reasoned that if CIITA mutants were recruited to the promoter but unable to activate transcription, their intact N-terminal domain should still interact with these coactivators (in excess), resulting in increased transcriptional activity. Expression of the NLS-tagged CIITA constructs is comparable with wild type in transfected cells (Fig. 5A), with the exception of NLS-GTP2. NLS-GTP2, like the parent GTP2 construct, consistently displays reduced expression relative to other constructs (27Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Der C.J. Ting J.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Chin K.C. Li G.G. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although no cooperation was observed between wild-type NLS-CIITA and CBP, pCAF and p300 both substantially enhanced the ability of NLS-CIITA to activate transcription (Fig. 5B). Of the mutants, only NLS-GTP2 displayed cooperation with both pCAF and p300, despite its lower expression. This confirms the initial observation that NLS-GTP2 is partially active and supports our conclusion that NLS-GTP2 is recruited to the promoter. Neither GTP1 nor GTP3 displayed any cooperativity with pCAF or p300, suggesting that they are unlikely to be recruited to the promoter. Curiously, C2RAS, although unable to appreciably activate HLA-DRA transcription, displayed some cooperation with p300. Although small, cooperation between C2RAS and p300 was consi"

Much less is known about a physiological protective role of nAChRs. To understand whether endogenous activation of beta2* nAChRs contributes to the maintenance of the functional and morphological integrity of neural tissue, adult beta2-/- mice were subjected to in vivo challenges that cause neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment (intrahippocampal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid), or neuroprotection and cognitive potentiation (2-month exposure to an enriched environment). The excitotoxic insult caused an increased deficit in the Morris water maze learning curve and increased loss of hippocampal pyramidal cells in beta2-/- mice. Exposure to an enriched environment improved performance in contextual and cued fear conditioning and object recognition tests in beta2+/+, whereas the improvement was absent in beta2-/- mice. In addition, beta2+/+, but not beta2-/-, mice exposed to an enriched environment showed a significant hypertrophy of the CA1/3 regions. Thus, lack of beta2* nAChRs increased susceptibility to an excitotoxic insult and diminished the positive effects of an enriched environment. These results may be relevant to understanding the pathophysiological consequences of the marked decrease in nAChRs that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2052126979,"Background Promoter-associated CpG islands (PCIs) mediate methylation-dependent gene silencing, yet tend to co-locate to transcriptionally active genes. To address this paradox, we used data mining to assess the behavior of PCI-positive (PCI+) genes in the human genome. Results PCI+ genes exhibit a bimodal distribution: (1) a ‘housekeeping-like’ subset characterized by higher GC content and lower intron length/number, and (2) a ‘pseudogene paralog’ subset characterized by lower GC content and higher intron length/number (p<0.001). These subsets are functionally distinguishable, with the former gene group characterized by higher expression levels and lower evolutionary rate (p<0.001). PCI-negative (PCI-) genes exhibit higher evolutionary rate and narrower expression breadth than PCI+ genes (p<0.001), consistent with more frequent tissue-specific inactivation. Conclusions Adaptive evolution of the human genome appears driven in part by declining transcription of a subset of PCI+ genes, predisposing to both CpG→TpA mutation and intron insertion. We propose a model of evolving biological complexity in which environmentally-selected gains or losses of PCI methylation respectively favor positive or negative selection, thus polarizing PCI+ gene structures around a genomic core of ancestral PCI- genes."

Heme c transfers electrons from donor proteins to the active site heme d1, an iron-dioxoisobacteriochlorin unique to this class of enzyme. In the crystal structure of the aerobically isolated (“oxidized”) cd1 from Paracoccus pantotrophus (Pp), each heme is in the FeIII state with two protein-derived axial ligands, His17 and His69 to heme c and His200 and Tyr25 to heme d1 (see Scheme 1). MCD and EPR spectroscopy confirmed that these are the ligands in solution (5Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Crystallography further showed that reduction of both hemes to the FeII state triggers a conformational change, which results in the replacement of the heme c ligand His17 with Met106 and the dissociation of Tyr25 from heme d1 (6Williams P.A.

Because these g values are almost identical to those observed for the His/Met liganded heme c in other cytochromes cd1 (see Table 1), it was suggested that the Pp enzyme has been trapped in a transient form (cd1*on Scheme 1) in which heme c retains the coordination normally associated with the reduced state (11Allen J.W.

Until this reversion has occurred, the enzyme is capable of NO2- reduction using the physiological electron donor pseudoazurin (11Allen J.W. A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct.

Open table in a new tab The intermediate cd1* differs from oxidized Pp cd1 in that it is reported to bind NO2- immediately following its formation by hydroxylamine reoxidation. The absorption spectrum of this putative NO2--bound form is characteristic of low-spin FeIII heme d1 (29Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was concluded that NO2- binds to the distal side of FeIII heme d1 before the relatively slow rebinding of Tyr25 can occur. However, several observations make it unlikely that the product (hereafter cd1*-X) is the simple NO2--bound FeIII heme d1 species depicted in the lower left of Scheme 1. The long timescale of formation is not consistent with a process, which is preventing the reversion to the oxidized state (29Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum contained no signals characteristic of low-spin FeIII heme d1. A single species was observed with similar g values to those of His/Met heme c in cd1* (29Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1). It was proposed that NO2- bound at heme d1 was blocking the rebinding of Tyr25 and preventing the conformational change to His/His ligation at FeIII heme c. This is not strictly proven because ligand orientation, not identity, is the primary determinant of the form of the EPR spectrum (30Walker F.A. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; 186: 471-534Crossref Google Scholar). Rotation of the histidine ligands from the perpendicular conformation observed in oxidized cd1 could yield the same g values. The work described here was therefore undertaken with two primary objectives: to determine the identity of the ligands to heme c in cd1*-X and to provide an explanation for the EPR silence of the heme d1. Purification of cd1—Samples of cd1 from Pp and Pseudomonas stutzeri (Ps) strain ZoBell (ATCC 14405) were purified according to published methods (10Moir J.W. B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J.

Biochem. 1985; 153: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Initially, samples of the Pp cd1*-X were prepared according to reported methods (11Allen J.W. A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem.

Aliquots of buffered potassium nitrite solutions, freshly prepared, were added within 10-15 s of this reoxidation. Assays of nitrite reductase activity were performed following published methods (13Richter C.D. Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Koppenhofer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using reduced equine cytochrome c as electron donor. EPR spectra were measured with a Bruker ER300D spectrometer fitted with a dual mode cavity type ER4116DM interfaced to an ELEXSYS computer control system (Bruker Analytische Messtechnik GmBH) and equipped with a variable temperature cryostat and liquid helium transfer line (Oxford Instruments). EPR simulations were performed using the Bruker program WINEPR SimFonia (v1.25). MCD spectra were recorded on JASCO circular dichrographs models J810 and J730 for the UV-visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions, respectively, used in conjunction with an Oxford Instruments SM4 split-coil superconducting solenoid capable of generating magnetic fields of up to 5 tesla. The intensities of spectra presented are referred to concentrations of cd1 monomer, calculated using the Soret absorption intensity of the oxidized enzymes and extinction coefficients of ϵ = 141 mm-1 cm-1 for the Ps enzyme (32Sutherland J. Greenwood C. Peterson J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and ϵ = 148 mm-1 cm-1 for the Pp enzyme (10Moir J.W. B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Samples for MCD spectroscopy were prepared in deuterium oxide solutions containing 50 mm BTP buffer at pH* = 6.5 to which equivalent volumes of glycerol had been added as glassing agent (33Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. George S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). pH* is the apparent pH of the D2O-based solutions measured using a standard glass pH electrode. Preparation and Absorption Spectra of cd1*-X—Samples of the Pp cd1*-X species were prepared anaerobically at pH = 7.0 according to the methods described by Allen et al. (29Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 2-h incubation, the same type of absorption and EPR spectroscopic changes were observed. However, identical results were obtained during control experiments in which oxidized cd1 was incubated with the same concentration (5 mm) of NO2-. This was the case whether the incubation was performed anaerobically or aerobically, but at pH 7.0, the reaction still required several hours to go to completion. Further control experiments revealed that the rate of this reaction of resting enzyme with NO2- was strongly pH-dependent, increasing significantly at lower pH. Although there are some variations in the rate between preparations, at pH 6.5, the product is fully formed in 5-10 min but at pH 9.0 negligible reaction was observed over 24 h. The substrate itself (pKa 3.35) is fully deprotonated over the pH range investigated, and the pH dependence may be a characteristic of NO2- binding and/or the subsequent reaction. No significant changes in the absorption spectrum of the oxidized enzyme were observed over the pH range 5.5-9.0. Assays of NO2- reductase activity using published methods (13Richter C.D. Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Koppenhofer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) confirmed that cd1*-X prepared by this method is catalytically active, as is reported for the species formed by NO2- addition to enzyme reoxidized with hydroxylamine (29Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All samples used for the spectroscopic characterization of cd1*-X described in this work were prepared in D2O-based buffers at pH* 6.5 by aerobic additions of buffered solutions of potassium nitrite. The absorption spectra of oxidized Pp cd1 and of cd1*-X are shown in Fig. 1a. In oxidized Pp cd1 at room temperature, FeIII heme d1 exists in a thermal equilibrium between a low-spin ground state (S = 1/2) and an excited high-spin state (S = 5/2), which give rise to absorption bands at 644 and 702 nm, respectively (5Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cd1*-X spectrum lacks the high-spin FeIII heme d1 band at 702 nm, but the low-spin band has increased in intensity and is blue-shifted to 631 nm. Low-spin FeIII heme c bands between 500 and 600 nm are present in both forms. It therefore appears that all FeIII heme d1 is in the low-spin state following reaction with NO2-. The absorption spectrum of Pp cd1*-X is very similar to those of the oxidized cytochromes cd1 from Pa and Ps, enzymes in which the heme d1 is fully low-spin at all temperatures (5Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Silvestrini M.C. Colosimo A. Brunori M. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This reactivity of oxidized Pp cd1 is unexpected given that it is generally accepted that this state does not interact with NO2- (34Fulop V. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 163-204Crossref Google Scholar). The heme c ligand switch of the Pp enzyme is unique among known cytochromes cd1, and this raises the question as to whether the ability to react with NO2- in this manner is also unique. We found that the cd1 from Ps also reacts with NO2- at pH 6.5. When the Ps enzyme is treated with NO2- under identical conditions, the heme d1 absorption band undergoes a small shift from 643 to 640 nm (Fig. 1b). However, in this enzyme, formation of a cd1*-X species, which contained low-spin FeIII heme d1 would involve no change of spin-state at either heme. Less significant absorption changes would therefore result. That, these small changes do indicate the formation a cd1*-X, species is confirmed by EPR and MCD spectroscopic studies described below. EPR Spectra of cd1*-X—Fig. 2 shows the 10 K X-band perpendicular mode EPR spectra of the oxidized cytochromes cd1 from Pp and Ps, and of the species formed following treatment of each enzyme with NO2-. No signals were detected in the parallel mode for any of these samples. Heme c in oxidized Pp cd1 (Fig. 2a) gives rise to a “large gmax” spectrum with a gz feature at ∼3.06. This is one of two limiting types of EPR observed for low-spin FeIII c-type hemes (5Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Walker F.A. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; 186: 471-534Crossref Google Scholar). The other two g values are often difficult to detect but spectral simulations, presented below, show that broad gy features are present in the g = 2.2-2.3 region. Heme c of oxidized Ps cd1 gives rise to an EPR spectrum of the second limiting type. This “rhombic” spectrum (Fig. 2c) comprises three detectable features at g = 2.99, 2.29, 1.61. Note that, although the hemes c in these two enzymes have different axial ligation, it is not this which leads to the different EPR spectra. The occurrence of a large gmax or rhombic spectrum is dictated primarily by ligand orientation and not ligand identity. Thus both ligand sets could give rise to either type of EPR spectrum. In the case of the His/His-coordinated heme c of oxidized Pp cd1, the observation of a large gmax spectrum is consistent with the perpendicular ligand arrangement observed in the crystal structure (4Fulop V. Moir J.W. B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 30Walker F.A. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; 186: 471-534Crossref Google Scholar). At 10 K, only the low-spin state of FeIII heme d1 in oxidized Pp cd1 is significantly populated, and minor traces of the high-spin state are observed at g values of 6.86 and 4.99 (5Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The low-spin FeIII state of heme d1 gives rise to EPR spectra, which are unlike either of the limiting cases described for heme c, having narrow features and low g value anisotropy (5Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These are observed in the oxidized cd1 spectra with g values of 2.52, 2.19, 1.84 for Pp and 2.58, 2.44, 1.87 for Ps. After addition of NO2-, the EPR spectra (Fig. 2, b and d) are devoid of the characteristic low-spin FeIII heme d1 features, although this state of d1 is apparent in the absorption spectra (Fig. 1). The Ps cd1*-X EPR spectrum (Fig. 2d) retains the signals which were assigned to heme c in the oxidized state, and it is reasonable to assume that that these g values do indicate His/Met ligation because the cd1 from this species does not exhibit ligand switching. For NO2--treated Pp cd1 (Fig. 2b), the large gmax spectrum of heme c has been replaced by a rhombic spectrum, with g values of 2.93, 2.32, 1.42 as reported by Allen et al. (29Allen J.W. A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who proposed that these features originate from FeIII heme c with His/Met ligation. The validity of this assignment will be addressed below using MCD spectroscopy. It has not previously been shown that this EPR spectrum accounts for a single heme, although, given its unusual electronic ground state, low-spin FeIII heme d1 is unlikely to give rise to these signals (5Cheesman M.R.

https://openalex.org/W2108372071,"Background Road traffic crashes are considered by the WHO to be the most important global cause of death from injury. However, this may not be true for large areas of rural Asia where road vehicles are uncommon. The issue is important, since emphasising the importance of road traffic crashes risks switching resources to urban areas, away from already underfunded rural regions. In this study, we compared the importance of road traffic crashes with other forms of injury in a poor rural region of South Asia. Methodology/Principal Findings We collected data on all deaths from injury in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka (NCP; population 1,105,198 at 2001 census) over 18 months using coronial, hospital, and police data. We calculated the incidence of death from all forms of intentional and unintentional injury in the province. The annual incidence of death from injury in the province was high: 84.2 per 100,000 population. Half of the deaths were from self-harm (41.3/100,000). Poisoning (35.7/100,000)—in particular, pesticide self-poisoning (23.7/100,000)—was the most common cause of death, being 3.9-fold more common than road traffic crashes (9.1/100,000). Conclusions/Significance In poor rural regions of South Asia, fatal self-harm and pesticide self-poisoning in particular are significantly more important than road traffic injuries as a cause of death. It is possible that the data used by the WHO to calculate global injury estimates are biased towards urban areas with better data collection but little pesticide poisoning. More studies are required to inform a debate about the importance of different forms of injury and how avoidable deaths from any cause can be prevented. In the meantime, marked improvements in the effectiveness of therapy for pesticide poisoning, safer storage, reduced pesticide use, or reductions in pesticide toxicity are required urgently to reduce the number of deaths from self-poisoning in rural Asia."

https://openalex.org/W1987007556,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is a polymer of N-acetylneuraminic acid residues added post-translationally to the membrane-bound neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). The large excluded volume created by PSA polymer is thought to facilitate cell migration by decreasing cell adhesion. Here we used live cell imaging (spot fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) combined with biochemical approaches in an attempt to uncover a link between cell motility and the impact of polysialylation on NCAM dynamics. We show that PSA regulates specifically NCAM lateral diffusion and this is dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton. However, whereas the glial-derivative neurotrophic factor chemotactic effect is dependent on PSA, the molecular dynamics of PSA-NCAM is not directly affected by glial-derivative neurotrophic factor. These findings reveal a new intrinsic mechanism by which polysialylation regulates NCAM dynamics and thereby a biological function like cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2045866759,"Infection of keratinocytes with high risk human Papilloma virus causes immortalization, and when followed by further mutations, leads to cervical cancer and other anogenital tumors. Here we monitor the progressive loss of robustness in an in vitro model of the early stages of transformation that comprises normal keratinocytes and progressive passages of HPV16 immortalized cells. As transformation progresses, the cells acquire higher proliferation rates and gain the ability to grow in soft agar. Concurrently, the cells lose robustness, becoming more sensitive to serum starvation and DNA damage by Cisplatin. Loss of robustness in the course of transformation correlates with significant reductions in the activities of the anti-apoptotic proteins PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 both under normal growth conditions and upon stress. In parallel, loss of robustness is manifested by the shrinkage of the number of growth factors that can rescue starving cells from apoptosis, with the emergence of dependence solely on IGF1. Treatment with IGF1 activates PKB/Akt and Jnk and through them inhibits p53, rescuing the cells from starvation. We conclude that transformation in this model induces higher susceptibility of cells to stress due to reduced anti-apoptotic signaling and hyper-activation of p53 upon stress."
