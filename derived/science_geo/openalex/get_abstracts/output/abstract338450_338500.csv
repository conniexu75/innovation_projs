The Greenland ice sheet evidence shows that Greenland, over and over for decades to thousands of years, cooled drastically from temperatures equal to or higher than today's, often to virtual ice age conditions. The researchers believe that disruptions in the flow of warm water from the southern Atlantic to the North Atlantic, and the return flow of cold water to the south, may be linked to these climatic fluctuations. The present climate appears relatively stable, but that may change if temperatures warm due to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases."

https://openalex.org/W2061096070,"Two primary theories are being advanced to explain the behavior of electron pairs in high-temperature superconductors. One theory is a modification of the BCS theory, which has phonons creating stable electron pairs. The new modification states that electron pairs tunnel between the copper oxide layers. The tunneling process augments the binding energy of the paired electrons, allowing superconductivity to persist at elevated temperatures. A competing theory relies on a different pairing mechanism, namely magnetic disturbances, or spin fluctuations, in the crystal lattice. Electrons pair in the wake of a magnetic wave in the lattice, analagous to but fundamentally different from the mechanical wave of a phonon. If the first theory is correct, electron pairs should carry a kind of angular momentum referred to as s-wave character. If the second theory is correct, the pairs should have d-wave character. Preliminary experiments performed to test the theories have hinted at d-wave behavior, but more experiments need to be performed."

But a Science poll of the House members who switched sides since last year, when a similar motion passed by only 232 to 181, found that most regarded their vote as a mandatory attack on the federal deficit. They say they still approve of the big physics project and that its important for the government to continue supporting basic science. In fact, the $10 billion SSC could well recover from its near-death condition by fall. For SSC supports, the shallowness of the opposition is bolstered by the fact that Congress writes its spending bills in a way that stacks the deck against opponents of the project. By law, appropriations bills are introduced in the House and cobbled together by one of 13 subcommittees. Once the bills reach the floor of each body, they can still be amended. That's what happened on 24 June, when House opponents of the SSC won approval to eliminate money to continue building themore » SSC and, instead, to spend $220 million to terminate the project. Now the bill moves to the Senate, which for the last 2 years has soundly defeated amendments to kill the SSC. After the Senate acts, any differences in the two bodies versions of the $22 billion energy and water bill, of which the SSC is only a small part, must be resolved by a conference committee consisting of an equal number of members from the House and Senate chosen by party leaders. Conferences are traditionally selected from among those on the relevant appropriating and authorizing committees, which strongly support the SSC.« less"

On the Continent it seems to be still generally assumed that the domestic breeds have descended from a single species, but in England and America many naturalists now believe―(1) that domestic horses have sprung from several wild species, connected by several lines of descent with three-hoofed species of the Miocene period; and (2) that while some of the wild ancestors were adapted for living in the vicinity of forests and upland valleys, others were adapted for a steppe, plateau, or desert life."
