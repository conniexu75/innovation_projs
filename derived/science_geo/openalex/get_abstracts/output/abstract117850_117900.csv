https://openalex.org/W1989035987,"A cofactor for HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus-type 1) fusion and entry was identified with the use of a novel functional complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning strategy. This protein, designated ""fusin,"" is a putative G protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane segments. Recombinant fusin enabled CD4-expressing nonhuman cell types to support HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and HIV-1 infection. Antibodies to fusin blocked cell fusion and infection with normal CD4-positive human target cells. Fusin messenger RNA levels correlated with HIV-1 permissiveness in diverse human cell types. Fusin acted preferentially for T cell line-tropic isolates, in comparison to its activity with macrophagetropic HIV-1 isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2081407528,"Single molecules of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were stretched with force-measuring laser tweezers. Under a longitudinal stress of ∼65 piconewtons (pN), dsDNA molecules in aqueous buffer undergo a highly cooperative transition into a stable form with 5.8 angstroms rise per base pair, that is, 70% longer than B-form dsDNA. When the stress was relaxed below 65 pN, the molecules rapidly and reversibly contracted to their normal contour lengths. This transition was affected by changes in the ionic strength of the medium and the water activity or by cross-linking of the two strands of dsDNA. Individual molecules of single-stranded DNA were also stretched giving a persistence length of 7.5 angstroms and a stretch modulus of 800 pN. The overstretched form may play a significant role in the energetics of DNA recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2094048962,"An intriguing and puzzling consequence of damage to the human brain is selective loss of knowledge about a specific category of objects. One patient may be unable to identify or name living things, whereas another may have selective difficulty identifying man-made objects. To investigate the neural correlates of this remarkable dissociation, we used positron emission tomography to map regions of the normal brain that are associated with naming animals and tools. We found that naming pictures of animals and tools was associated with bilateral activation of the ventral temporal lobes and Broca's area. In addition, naming animals selectively activated the left medial occipital lobe--a region involved in the earliest stages of visual processing. In contrast, naming tools selectively activated a left premotor area also activated by imagined hand movements, and an area in the left middle temporal gyrus also activated by the generation of action words. Thus the brain regions active during object identification are dependent, in part, on the intrinsic properties of the object presented."

https://openalex.org/W2082753131,"The force-displacement response of a single duplex DNA molecule was measured. The force saturates at a plateau around 70 piconewtons, which ends when the DNA has been stretched about 1.7 times its contour length. This behavior reveals a highly cooperative transition to a state here termed S-DNA. Addition of an intercalator suppresses this transition. Molecular modeling of the process also yields a force plateau and suggests a structure for the extended form. These results may shed light on biological processes involving DNA extension and open the route for mechanical studies on individual molecules in a previously unexplored range."

https://openalex.org/W2041573061,"Cells deprived of serum mitogens will either undergo immediate cell cycle arrest or complete mitosis and arrest in the next cell cycle. The transition from mitogen dependence to mitogen independence occurs in the mid-to late G1 phase of the cell cycle and is called the restriction point. Murine Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts deprived of serum mitogens accumulated the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1. This was correlated with inactivation of essential G1 cyclin-CDK complexes and with cell cycle arrest in G1. The ability of specific mitogens to allow transit through the restriction point paralleled their ability to down-regulate p27, and antisense inhibition of p27 expression prevented cell cycle arrest in response to mitogen depletion. Therefore, p27 is an essential component of the pathway that connects mitogenic signals to the cell cycle at the restriction point."
https://openalex.org/W2036396876,"Gene expression regulated by the cAMP response element (CRE) has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. It has been proposed that CRE-mediated gene expression is stimulated by signals that induce long-term potentiation (LTP). To test this hypothesis, we made mice transgenic for a CRE-regulated reporter construct. We focused on long-lasting long-term potentiation (L-LTP), because it depends on cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (PKA) and de novo gene expression. CRE-mediated gene expression was markedly increased after L-LTP, but not after decremental UP (D-LTP). Furthermore, inhibitors of PKA blocked L-LTP and associated increases in CRE-mediated gene expression. These data demonstrate that the signaling required for the generation of L-LTP but not D-LTP is sufficient to stimulate CRE-mediated transcription in the hippocampus."

The genetic steps governing development and differentiation of the thymic microenvironment are unknown. With the use of a targeted disruption of the whn gene, which recapitulates the phenotype of the athymic nude mouse, the WHN transcription factor was shown to be the product of the nude locus. Formation of the thymic epithelial primordium before the entry of lymphocyte progenitors did not require the activity of WHN. However, subsequent differentiation of primitive precursor cells into subcapsular, cortical, and medullary epithelial cells of the postnatal thymus did depend on activity of the whn gene. These results define the first genetically separable steps during thymic epithelial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2007750331,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is pivotal in B cell activation and development through its participation in the signaling pathways of multiple hematopoietic receptors. The mechanisms controlling BTK activation were studied here by examination of the biochemical consequences of an interaction between BTK and SRC family kinases. This interaction of BTK with SRC kinases transphosphorylated BTK on tyrosine at residue 551, which led to BTK activation. BTK then autophosphorylated at a second site. The same two sites were phosphorylated upon B cell antigen receptor cross-linking. The activated BTK was predominantly membrane-associated, which suggests that BTK integrates distinct receptor signals resulting in SRC kinase activation and BTK membrane targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1991992481,"The RAS guanine nucleotide binding proteins activate multiple signaling events that regulate cell growth and differentiation. In quiescent fibroblasts, ectopic expression of activated H-RAS (H-RASV12, where V12 indicates valine-12) induces membrane ruffling, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, and stimulation of DNA synthesis. A mutant of activated H-RAS, H-RASV12C40 (where C40 indicates cysteine-40), was identified that was defective for MAP kinase activation and stimulation of DNA synthesis, but retained the ability to induce membrane ruffling. Another mutant of activated H-RAS, H-RASV12S35 (where S35 indicates serine-35), which activates MAP kinase, was defective for stimulation of membrane ruffling and induction of DNA synthesis. Expression of both mutants resulted in a stimulation of DNA synthesis that was comparable to that induced by H-RASV12. These results indicate that membrane ruffling and activation of MAP kinase represent distinct RAS effector pathways and that input from both pathways is required for the mitogenic activity of RAS."

The role of NFAT1 was investigated by targeted disruption of the NFAT1 gene. Unexpectedly, cells from NFAT1 -/- mice showed increased primary responses to Leishmania major and mounted increased secondary responses to ovalbumin in vitro. In an in vivo model of allergic inflammation, the accumulation of eosinophils and levels of serum immunoglobulin E were increased in NFAT1 -/- mice. These results suggest that NFAT1 exerts a negative regulatory influence on the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2023153839,"The reaper gene (rpr) is important for the activation of apoptosis in Drosophila. To investigate whether rpr expression is sufficient to induce apoptosis, transgenic flies were generated that express rpr complementary DNA or the rpr open reading frame in cells that normally live. Transcription of rpr from a heat-inducible promoter rapidly caused wide-spread ectopic apoptosis and organismal death. Ectopic overexpression of rpr in the developing retina resulted in eye ablation. The occurrence of cell death was highly sensitive to the dosage of the transgene. Because cell death induced by the protein encoded by rpr (RPR) could be blocked by the baculovirus p35 protein, RPR appears to activate a death program mediated by a ced-3/ICE (interleukin-1 converting enzyme)-like protease."

In the study presented here, a cell population in murine fetal blood that fulfills the criteria of progenitor mastocytes was identified. It is defined by the phenotype Thy-1loc-Kithi, contains cytoplasmic granules, and expresses RNAs encoding mast cell-associated proteases but lacks expression of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor. Thy-1loc-Kithi cells generated functionally competent mast cells at high frequencies in vitro but lacked developmental potential for other hematopoietic lineages. When transferred intraperitoneally, this population reconstituted the peritoneal mast cell compartment of genetically mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice to wild-type levels."
https://openalex.org/W2170854435,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited neuropathy in humans and has been associated with a partial duplication of chromosome 17 (CMT type 1A). We have generated a transgenic rat model of this disease and provide experimental evidence that CMT1A is caused by increased expression of the gene for peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22, gas-3). PMP22-transgenic rats develop gait abnormalities caused by a peripheral hypomyelination, Schwann cell hypertrophy (onion bulb formation), and muscle weakness. Reduced nerve conduction velocities closely resemble recordings in human patients with CMT1A. When bred to homozygosity, transgenic animals completely fail to elaborate myelin. We anticipate that the CMT rat model will facilitate the identification of a cellular disease mechanism and serve in the evaluation of potential treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2047209080,"When mammalian cells were treated with triplex-forming oligonucleotides of sufficient binding affinity, mutations were specifically induced in a simian virus 40 vector contained within the cells. Triplex-induced mutagenesis was not detected in xeroderma pigmentosum group A cells nor in Cockayne's syndrome group B cells, indicating a requirement for excision repair and for transcription-coupled repair, respectively, in the process. Triplex formation was also found to stimulate DNA repair synthesis in human cell extracts, in a pattern correlating with the inhibition of transcription in such extracts. These findings may have implications for therapeutic applications of triplex DNA and raise the possibility that naturally occurring triple helices are a source of genetic instability."

Despite the importance of this compensatory response, the enzymes involved have not been clearly identified, and the mechanisms that control their activity are unknown. In carp liver, cold induces an 8- to 10-fold increase in specific activity of the microsomal stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase. Cold-induced up-regulation of gene transcription resulted in a 10-fold increase in desaturase transcript amounts after 48 to 60 hours. However, this increase was preceded by the activation of latent desaturase, probably by a posttranslational mechanism. These two mechanisms may act sequentially to match desaturase expression to the demands imposed by a progressive decrease in temperature."

The large and small subunits of TFIIA associate intimately to form both domains of a two-domain folding pattern. TFIIA binds as a heterodimer to the side of the TBP/TATA complex opposite to the side that binds TFIIB and does not alter the TBP/DNA interaction. The six-stranded beta-sandwich domain interacts with the amino-terminal end of TBP through a stereospecific parallel beta-strand interface and with the backbone of the TATA box and the 5'-flanking B-DNA segment. The four-helix-bundle domain projects away from the TBP/TATA complex, thereby presenting a substantial surface for further protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2095335458,"Genetic studies indicated that the Drosophila melanogaster protein REAPER (RPR) controls apoptosis during embryo development. Induction of RPR expression in Drosophila Schneider cells rapidly stimulated apoptosis. RPR-mediated apoptosis was blocked by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), which suggests that an interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE)-like protease is required for RPR function. RPR-induced apoptosis was associated with increased ceramide production that was also blocked by Z-VAD-fmk, which suggests that ceramide generation requires an ICE-like protease as well. Thus, the intracellular RPR protein uses cell death signaling pathways similar to those used by the vertebrate transmembrane receptors Fas (CD95) and tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1."
https://openalex.org/W2089386794,"Drosophila vision involves a G protein-coupled phospholipase C-mediated signaling pathway that leads to membrane depolarization through activation of Na+ and Ca2+ channels. InaD mutant flies have a M442K point mutation and display a slow recovery of the Ca2+-dependent current. We report that anti-INAD antibodies coimmunoprecipitate TRP, identified by its electrophoretic mobility, cross reactivity with anti-TRP antibody, and absence in a null allele trp mutant. This interaction is abolished by the InaD point mutation in vitro and in vivo. Interaction was localized to the 19 amino acid C-terminus of TRP by overlay assays, and to the PDZ domain of INAD, encompassing the point mutation. Given the impaired electrophysiology of the InaD mutant, this novel interaction suggests that INAD functions as a regulatory subunit of the TRP Ca2+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W2066441690,"The composition of the jovian atmosphere from 0.5 to 21 bars along the descent trajectory was determined by a quadrupole mass spectrometer on the Galileo probe. The mixing ratio of He (helium) to H2 (hydrogen), 0.156, is close to the solar ratio. The abundances of methane, water, argon, neon, and hydrogen sulfide were measured; krypton and xenon were detected. As measured in the jovian atmosphere, the amount of carbon is 2.9 times the solar abundance relative to H2, the amount of sulfur is greater than the solar abundance, and the amount of oxygen is much less than the solar abundance. The neon abundance compared with that of hydrogen is about an order of magnitude less than the solar abundance. Isotopic ratios of carbon and the noble gases are consistent with solar values. The measured ratio of deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) of (5 +/- 2) x 10(-5) indicates that this ratio is greater in solar-system hydrogen than in local interstellar hydrogen, and the 3He/4He ratio of (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(-4) provides a new value for protosolar (solar nebula) helium isotopes. Together, the D/H and 3He/4He ratios are consistent with conversion in the sun of protosolar deuterium to present-day 3He."
https://openalex.org/W2066126116,"Addiction to the psychostimulant drugs, of which cocaine and the amphetamine derivatives are the most important, is one of the foremost public health problems in the United States. Cocaine and amphetamine share two critical properties with other addictive drugs: they are reinforcing when administered acutely (i.e., drug use entails repeated drug use) and produce compulsive use if administered chronically with adequate dose and frequency. The mesoaccumbens dopamine (DA) pathway, extending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens (NAc; the major component of the ventral striatum), has been identified as the critical shared substrate of the reinforcing effects of cocaine, amphetamine, and all other addictive drugs (10Koob G.F Neuron. 1996; 16 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar [this issue of Neuron]). Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine are thought to be addictive because they produce significant molecular adaptations both within and outside the mesoaccumbens circuitry that alter the function of neurons that regulate motivated behavior and emotion. Progress has been made in identifying both the properties of drugs that make them reinforcing and the potentially relevant adaptations within the VTA and in dopaminergically innervated brain regions including both the NAc and dorsal striatum. The critical mechanism by which cocaine and amphetamine produce reinforcement is their ability to increase synaptic DA levels in the mesoaccumbens circuit. Cocaine blocks the DA reuptake transporter (DAT), a member of the Na+/Cl−-dependent twelve transmembrane domain transporter family that also includes the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters. Amphetamine has more complex actions, but its most significant effect is to cause reverse transport of DA via the DAT. In mice lacking a DAT, as a result of targeted gene disruption, amphetamine does not increase synaptic DA levels (4Giros B Jaber M Jones S.R Wightman R.M Caron M.G Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). There are significant homologies within the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter family; thus, cocaine and amphetamine also increase synaptic levels of norepinephrine and serotonin. While these other monoamine neurotransmitters may contribute to the reinforcing or addictive (i.e., plasticity-inducing) effects of cocaine and amphetamine, it is the increase in synaptic DA that is necessary for and central to reinforcement. Antidepressant drugs that block norepinephrine and/or serotonin, but not DA reuptake, produce neither significant reinforcement in animal models nor euphoria in humans. Moreover, antidepressants do not produce dependence in humans even with very long-term use. In addition, lesioning of DA terminals within the NAc or full pharmacological blockade of DA receptors inhibits cocaine or amphetamine self-administration (reviewed by14Self D.W Nestler E.J Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). It is also significant that mice lacking the DAT are entirely insensitive to the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine or amphetamine (4Giros B Jaber M Jones S.R Wightman R.M Caron M.G Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). The precise contributions of different postsynaptic DA receptors to reinforcement have yet to be fully established because of the lack of adequately selective antagonists directed against the five known DA receptors. Studies of drug self-administration in mice with disruptions in the genes encoding each of the different DA receptors as well as the DAT may also prove informative; however, the difficulty of establishing drug self-administration in the mouse strains currently used for homologous recombination and the problem of developmental compensation has slowed this type of analysis. Based on pharmacological data available to date, both D1 family and D2 family DA receptors contribute to cocaine and amphetamine reinforcement (reviewed by14Self D.W Nestler E.J Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), although it is the D1 receptor that has been implicated in cocaine- and amphetamine-induced plasticity to date. The acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and amphetamine lead to patterns of drug use that, in epigenetically vulnerable individuals, result eventually in addiction, a state hypothesized to be the result of plastic changes in multiple neural circuits. The types of plasticity that underlie addiction can be divided conceptually into three groups: compensatory adaptations in neural systems that regulate autonomic and other somatic functions leading to physical dependence and withdrawal; adaptations in the mesoaccumbens brain reward circuitry itself resulting in the emotional and motivational aspects of dependence and withdrawal; plasticity involving both the mesoaccumbens circuitry and other limbic circuits yielding sensitization and cue-dependent, positively biased emotional memories of drug use that may predispose to relapse. Unlike the opiates and ethanol, cocaine and amphetamine do not produce physical dependence; they are nonetheless among the most reinforcing and addictive drugs known, underscoring the importance of plasticity in emotional circuits. With cocaine and amphetamine, tolerance to the reinforcing effects may be marked, leading to administration of very high drug doses. Compared with amphetamine, cocaine has a very short duration of action that leads to a typical pattern of administration: rats or humans given access to adequate supplies of cocaine often binge, i.e., self-administer multiple closely spaced doses over long periods of time. Abstinence following such a binge may dramatically unmask neural adaptations that have occurred, as evidenced by a withdrawal syndrome in humans of dysphoria, anhedonia, and drug craving with eventual reinstatement of drug use. Anhedonia in humans may be modeled in rats by transient decreases in DA neurotransmission and elevations in electrical brain self-stimulation reward thresholds observed after cocaine administration (12Markou A Koob G.F Psychopharmacology. 1991; 4: 17-26Google Scholar). Pharmacological attempts to inhibit the reinstatement of cocaine or amphetamine self-administration after discontinuation have utilized both DA receptor antagonists, aimed at blocking subsequent reinforcement, or DA receptor agonists, aimed either at supplementing transient decreases in dopaminergic neurotransmission during withdrawal, or decreasing the likelihood of subsequent cue-dependent drug craving. Current DA receptor antagonists are unacceptable treatments because they exacerbate anhedonia and dysphoria and because D2 receptor antagonists cause serious motor side effects. Selective D2 agonists such as bromocriptine have been used to treat craving in humans without great success. Strikingly, in a rat model in which cocaine self-administration was extinguished by replacement of cocaine with saline, D2 agonists caused reinstatement of self-administration, possibly as an interoceptive cue, whereas a D1 agonist did not. In addition, a D1 agonist prevented reinstatement of self-administration caused by a priming dose of cocaine itself (15Self D.W Barnart W.J Lehman D.A Nestler E.J Science. 1996; 271: 1586-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). While a subset of adaptations to cocaine and amphetamine produce tolerance and dependence (and therefore upon drug cessation, withdrawal), other drug-induced adaptations produce sensitization, i.e., a subset of drug effects increase with repeated use. In humans, some aspects of sensitization may increase craving for drugs even if, as a result of tolerance, the actual enjoyment of drugs is diminished (13Robinson T.E Berridge K.C Brain Res. Rev. 1993; 18: 247-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (5387) Google Scholar). Another form of sensitization observed in humans is a syndrome of cocaine- or amphetamine-induced paranoia, which, once initiated, may be reinstated even with relatively low drug doses after prolonged abstinence. In animal models, behavioral sensitization is generally studied by observing an increase in the locomotor stimulatory effects or stereotyped behaviors produced by cocaine and amphetamine. Tolerance, dependence, or sensitization is differentially most strongly elicited with different drug administration paradigms and different timepoints after the final dose. Differences in these parameters likely explain many inconsistencies in behavioral and physiological findings of different labs. Tolerance, dependence (with subsequent withdrawal), and sensitization are likely all experienced by drug addicted humans and contribute to compulsive drug use. The VTA appears to be required for initiation of locomotor sensitization; however, the NAc is required for its expression (see references in14Self D.W Nestler E.J Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Changes in the mesoaccumbens circuitry that would increase the effects of DA and might therefore contribute to sensitization include augmentation of the ability of cocaine or amphetamine to increase extracellular DA concentrations in the NAc, decreased sensitivity of DA autoreceptors (presynaptic D2 receptors), and supersensitivity of postsynaptic D1 receptors. Locomotor sensitization to cocaine has been reported to persist for a month after withdrawal and is correlated with an enhancement of D1 DA receptor responses in the NAc (Henry and White, 1995). D1 receptors are expressed in the NAc and in the dorsal striatum, predominantly on striatonigral neurons, which are GABAergic and also synthesize the neuropeptide precursors prodynorphin and preprotachykinin. Since no consistent changes have been observed in D1 receptor number or affinity after chronic cocaine administration, supersensitive D1 responses likely reflect changes in postreceptor signal transduction. Since D1 receptors are positively linked to the adenylyl cyclase via Gs and Golf, it is significant that chronic cocaine administration increases levels of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the NAc, while decreasing levels of Giα (reviewed by14Self D.W Nestler E.J Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Cocaine and amphetamine have potent effects on protein phosphorylation and gene regulation in dopaminoceptive neurons in the dorsal striatum and the NAc. An ongoing challenge is to relate these effects to electrophysiological and behavioral observations. Acute administration of amphetamine and cocaine induce cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation (9Konradi C Cole R.L Hyman S.E J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5623-5634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and expression of both AP-1 (e.g., c-fos, fras, and junB) and non-AP-1 family immediate early genes (IEGs) in both the dorsal and ventral striatum (14Self D.W Nestler E.J Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In addition, both amphetamine and cocaine have been shown to induce AP-1 binding activity in striatal cell extracts (Nguyen et al., 1992; 5Hope B.T Kosofsky B Hyman S.E Nestler E.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 5764-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). As described, D1 DA receptor signaling has been implicated in sensitization; it appears to play an obligate role in cocaine- and amphetamine-induced gene expression. Psychostimulant-induced CREB phosphorylation and IEG expression are both blocked by D1 receptor antagonists (9Konradi C Cole R.L Hyman S.E J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5623-5634Crossref PubMed Google Scholarreferences therein). Consistent with this pharmacological finding, double label in situ hybridization studies demonstrate that cocaine (11Kosofsky B.E Genova L.M Hyman S.E J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 351: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and amphetamine (7Jaber M Cador M Dumartin B Normand E Stinus L Bloch B Neuroscience. 1995; 64: 1041-1050Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) induce IEG expression primarily in striatonigral neurons. Induction of CREB phosphorylation and expression of IEG transcription factors by acute cocaine and amphetamine have been hypothesized to initiate downstream molecular events, which in the longer term could exert significant behavioral consequences. Potential targets of cocaine- and amphetamine-induced transcriptional activators include the neuropeptide genes expressed within D1 receptor expressing neurons. Indeed, cocaine and amphetamine have been shown to induce expression of preprotachykinin mRNA and of prodynorphin mRNA and peptides in striatonigral neurons (7Jaber M Cador M Dumartin B Normand E Stinus L Bloch B Neuroscience. 1995; 64: 1041-1050Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholarreferences therein). Prodynorphin gene expression has also been shown to be induced in other states of putative DA excess, either due to the loss of functional DAT in knockout mice (4Giros B Jaber M Jones S.R Wightman R.M Caron M.G Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) or following administration of D1 receptor agonists in rats with a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion substantia nigra (16Steiner H Gerfen C.R J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 353: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholarreferences therein). In contrast, mice lacking D1 receptors as a result of targeted gene disruption exhibit decreased prodynorphin gene expression (18Xu M Moratalla R Gold L.H Hiroi N Koob G.F Graybiel A.M Tonegawa S Cell. 1994; 79: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The regulation of the prodynorphin gene by cocaine and amphetamine could be a biologically significant adaptive mechanism contributing to the motivational aspects of withdrawal. Dynorphin peptides can signal back on presynaptic DA terminals within the striatum via recurrent axon collaterals (Figure 1). Acting via κ opiate receptors on DA terminals, dynorphin peptides appear to decrease DA release (16Steiner H Gerfen C.R J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 353: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). κ receptor agonists produce an aversive dysphoric syndrome in drug naive humans and rats. Thus, an increase in dynorphin peptides following chronic psychostimulant administration may be a compensatory adaptation to excess DA stimulation that, by inhibiting the release of DA, may contribute to the dysphoric state that occurs with drug cessation and therefore to withdrawal. The prodynorphin gene contains three cAMP response elements (CREs) in its 5′ flanking region. In primary striatal cultures, induction of prodynorphin gene expression by DA has been shown to be dependent on D1 receptor stimulation and to correlate with Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB (3Cole R.L Konradi C Douglass J Hyman S.E Neuron. 1995; 14: 813-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). CREB has been shown to be phosphorylated on its critical Ser-133 in vivo in response to amphetamine (9Konradi C Cole R.L Hyman S.E J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5623-5634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); with chronic amphetamine administration, the time course of CREB phosphorylation is markedly prolonged (3Cole R.L Konradi C Douglass J Hyman S.E Neuron. 1995; 14: 813-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), consistent with up-regulation of other components of the cAMP system (described above) by chronic cocaine (14Self D.W Nestler E.J Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The D1 receptor–cAMP–CREB pathway (Figure 2) may serve as an important mechanism of adaptation, contributing not only to prodynorphin gene regulation, but also to regulation of many additional target genes that contain CREs. The posited role for CREB in plasticity produced by drugs of abuse has a parallel in recent work implicating CREB in some forms of long-term synaptic plasticity, including a role in the maintenance phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) and in models of learning in Aplysia, Drosophila, and mice (reviewed by2Carew T.J Neuron. 1996; 16: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both LTP and LTD have been demonstrated in the NAc (8Kombian S.B Malenka R.C Nature. 1994; 368: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), although the molecular correlates in the NAc have not yet been identified. While there is a long way to go in dissecting the role of CREB in different types of long-term behavioral change, it appears to be a critical molecular switch in both cocaine- and amphetamine-induced plasticity (subserving a type of implicit memory), as well as in other types of memory functions. Cocaine- and amphetamine-induced gene regulation is more complex, however, with increasing evidence that the D1 DA receptor pathway interacts significantly with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptor pathways (Figure 2). It has been demonstrated by several groups that cocaine- and amphetamine-induced IEG expression is inhibited by NMDA receptor antagonists in vivo. Moreover, behavioral sensitization and D1 receptor supersensitivity are also prevented if MK-801 is coadministered with amphetamine (17Wolf M.E White F.J Hu X-T J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar). Explanations for the effects of MK-801 have largely focused on neural circuit interactions. NMDA receptor blockade has been hypothesized to inhibit the release of DA within the striatum or to inhibit DA D1 receptor function. However, NMDA receptor–activated intracellular Ca2+ pathways may also play a critical role in D1 receptor–mediated gene expression and deserve further investigation. CREB has been shown to be a substrate not only for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but also for several Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinases; in addition, NMDA receptors may activate additional signaling pathways within neurons such as MAP kinases. Unlike CREB, which is constitutively synthesized and regulated largely by protein phosphorylation, proteins of the Fos family are induced from very low levels of expression by acute cocaine or amphetamine administration. With repeated stimulation, induction of c-fos, c-jun, junB, and zif/268 is markedly down-regulated (5Hope B.T Kosofsky B Hyman S.E Nestler E.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 5764-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In contrast, certain Fos-related antigens accumulate with chronic cocaine treatment or other chronic stimuli (“chronic Fras”) and are expressed persistently (6Hope B.T Nye H.E Kelz M.B Self D.W Iadarola M.J Nakabeppu Y Duman R.S Nestler E.J Neuron. 1994; 13: 1235-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Alterations in the composition of AP-1 complexes over time might permit cells to activate specific programs of adaptation appropriate to the strength and time course of the stimulus. However, an unsolved problem with respect to downstream effects of AP-1 proteins in the dorsal and ventral striatum is that increased expression of AP-1 proteins, per se, or increased binding of AP-1 proteins to DNA as measured by gel shift assays does not necessarily indicate increases in transcriptional activation. Thus, in transformed cell lines, phosphorylation of Ser-63 or Ser-73 within the c-Jun activation domain by Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) has been shown to increase its ability to activate transcription markedly without affecting its ability to heterodimerize or bind DNA. The degree to which cocaine- and amphetamine-induced Fos and Jun family members are active as transcription factors in DA receptive neurons has not yet been established (Figure 2). Additional challenges include the identification of targets of both the CREB and AP-1 pathways that might lead to significant neural plasticity and behavioral change. Several other alterations in cellular proteins caused by chronic cocaine administration are of particular interest because they also occur with chronic morphine administration. Thus, for example, both cocaine and morphine increase levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and decrease levels of three neurofilament proteins in the VTA (reviewed by14Self D.W Nestler E.J Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Understanding the relationship of potential cytoskeletal changes to physiology or behavior remains an important goal. In addition to adaptations within the brain reward circuitry itself, drugs of abuse produce long-lived, positively biased, emotional memories that may be activated by environmental or interoceptive cues. The mesoaccumbens DA circuitry appears to be involved in producing memories associated with reinforcement. It is an open question whether cue-dependent drug craving activates the mesoaccumbens DA pathway or whether DA is involved in the production of such memories but not in their subsequent recall. Evidence exists on both sides of the issue (1Brown E.E Robertson G.S Fibiger H.C J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4112-4121PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). The resolution is important since development of pharmacological blockers of cue-dependent craving, which has been hypothesized (but not shown) to predispose to relapse in humans, will obviously differ depending on the receptors and circuits involved. In summary, progress is being made in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of addiction to cocaine and amphetamine. While the identification of significant molecular alterations and their relationship to behavior are in their early days, the field is progressing rapidly and should lead to the development of treatments for cocaine and amphetamine addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2142126460,"Hypoglycemic sulfonylureas represent a group of clinically useful antidiabetic compounds that stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood but are believed to involve inhibition of potassium channels sensitive to adenosine triphosphate (KATP channels) in the beta cell membrane, causing membrane depolarization, calcium influx, and activation of the secretory machinery. In addition to these effects, sulfonylureas also promoted exocytosis by direct interaction with the secretory machinery not involving closure of the plasma membrane KATP channels. This effect was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) and was observed at therapeutic concentrations of sulfonylureas, which suggests that it contributes to their hypoglycemic action in diabetics."
https://openalex.org/W2081764386,"In the neurological mutant mouse weaver, granule cell precursors proliferate normally in the external germinal layer of the cerebellar cortex, but fail to differentiate. Granule neurons purified from weaver cerebella have greatly reduced G protein–activated inwardly rectifying K+ currents; instead, they display a constitutive Na+ conductance. Expression of the weaver GIRK2 channel in oocytes confirms that the mutation leads to constitutive activation, loss of monovalent cation selectivity, and increased sensitivity to three channel blockers. Pharmacological blockade of the Na+ influx in weaver granule cells restores their ability to differentiate normally. Thus, Na+ flux through the weaver GIRK2 channel underlies the failure of granule cell development in situ."

To reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit dengue viruses, a recombinant Sindbis virus was used to transduce female Aedes aegypti with a 567-base antisense RNA targeted to the premembrane coding region of dengue type 2 (DEN-2) virus. The transduced mosquitoes were unable to support replication of DEN-2 virus in their salivary glands and therefore were not able to transmit the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2009821005,"We find that C. elegans egl-30 encodes a heterotrimeric G protein α subunit more than 80% identical to mammalian Gqα family proteins, and which can function as a Gqα subunit in COS-7 cells. We have identified new egl-30 alleles in a selection for genes involved in the C. elegans acetylcholine response. Two egl-30 alleles specify premature termination of Gqα and are essentially lethal in homozygotes. Animals homozygous for six other egl-30 alleles are viable and fertile, but exhibit delayed egg laying and leave flattened tracks. Overexpression of the wild-type egl-30 gene produces the opposite behavior. Analysis of these mutants suggest that their phenotypes reflect defects in the muscle or neuromuscular junction."

They find that the brain is surprisingly indeterminate, and that no single hierarchy can satisfactorily represent the order implied by the anatomical data.

https://openalex.org/W2049699715,"Phosphorylation of brain Na+ channels by protein kinase C (PKC) decreases peak Na+ current and slows macroscopic inactivation, but receptor-activated modulation of Na+ currents via the PKC pathway has not been demonstrated. We have examined modulation of Na+ channels by activation of muscarinic receptors in acutely-isolated hippocampal neurons using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording. Application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol reduced peak Na+ current and slowed macroscopic inactivation at all potentials, without changing the voltage-dependent properties of the channel. These effects were mediated by PKC, since they were eliminated when the specific PKC inhibitor (PKCI19-36) was included in the pipette solution and mimicked by the extracellular application of the PKC activator, OAG. Thus, activation of endogenous muscarinic receptors on hippocampal neurons strongly modulates Na+ channel activity by activation of PKC. Cholinergic input from basal forebrain neurons may have this effect in the hippocampus in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2050203483,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels are multimeric structures containing at least two subunits. However, the total number of subunits per functional channel is unknown. To determine the subunit stoichiometry of CNG ion channels, we have coexpressed the 30 pS conductance bovine retinal channel (RET) with an 85 pS conductance chimeric retinal channel containing the catfish olfactory channel P region (RO133). When RO133 and RET monomers are coexpressed, channels with four distinct intermediate conductances are observed. Dimer constructs reveal that two of these conductance levels arise from channels with the same subunit composition (2 RO133:2 RET) but distinct subunit order (like subunits adjacent to each other versus like subunits across from each other). Thus, the data demonstrate that cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels are tetrameric like the related voltage-gated potassium ion channels; the order of subunits affects the conductance of the channel; and the channel has 4-fold symmetry in which four asymmetric subunits assemble head to tail around a central axis."

https://openalex.org/W2028189987,"Modulation of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca)) regulates secretion of catecholamines from adrenal chromaffin cells. Previous work demonstrated that I(Ca) can be augmented by phosphorylation to increase secretion or that inhibition of I(Ca) results in diminished catecholamine secretion. In the current manuscript, we show that stimulation of chromaffin cells results in the release of an ""endogenous inhibitor"" that suppresses I(Ca). The inhibition is due to the secretion of ATP, which is stored at high concentrations in secretory granules and is coreleased with catecholamines upon stimulation. The ATP exerts its actions through P(2 gamma) purinoceptors and inhibits both N- and P/Q-type Ca (2+) channels in a voltage-dependent manner but with different efficacies. Overall, we have identified and characterized a negative feedback pathway that may serve as an important regulatory mechanism for catecholamine secretion in chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037668511,"During mammalian brain development, immature neurons often migrate considerable distances. A dramatic example is the rostral migration of olfactory interneuron precursors from near the septum to the olfactory bulb via a subventricular pathway. Heterotopic transplantations establish that this migration is unidirectional and that guidance cues operate over a considerable distance. The guidance cues for this translocation have not been identified, and the present studies provide evidence that a diffusible chemorepulsive factor, secreted by caudal septum but not by other tissue regions surrounding the pathway, may be involved. This activity is functionally distinct from that produced by factors that influence vertebrate axon outgrowth, such as netrin-1, netrin-2, and collapsin-1/semaphorin-III. The presence of this activity in the floor plate/ventral spinal cord as well as the septum suggests that it may influence other types of cell migration."

https://openalex.org/W1969113601,"Nerve-induced clustering of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) requires rapsyn, a synaptic peripheral membrane protein, as well as protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we show that rapsyn induces the clustering of the synapse-specific receptor-tyrosine kinase MuSK in transfected QT-6 fibroblasts. Furthermore, rapsyn stimulates the autophosphorylation of MuSK, leading to a subsequent MuSK-dependent increase in cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, rapsyn-activated MuSK specifically phosphorylated the AChR β subunit, the same subunit that is tyrosine phosphorylated during innervation or agrin treatment of muscle. These results suggest rapsyn may mediate the synaptic localization of MuSK in muscle and that MuSK may play an important role in the agrin-induced clustering of the AChR."

https://openalex.org/W2108402229,"We used serial cysteine mutagenesis to study the structure of the outer vestibule and selectivity region of the voltage-gated Na+ channel. The voltage dependence of Cd2+ block enabled us to determine the locations within the electrical field of cysteine-substituted mutants in the P segments of all four domains. The fractional electrical distances of the substituted cysteines were compared with the differential sensitivity to modification by sulfhydryl-specific modifying reagents. These experiments indicate that the P segment of domain II is external, while the domain IV P segment is displaced internally, compared with the first and third domain P segments. Sulfhydryls with a steep voltage dependence for Cd2+ block produced changes in monovalent cation selectivity; these included substitutions at the presumed selectivity filter, as well as residues in the domain IV P segment not previously recognized as determinants of selectivity. A new structural model is presented in which each of the P segments contribute unique loops that penetrate the membrane to varying depths to form the channel pore."
https://openalex.org/W1993788392,"The role of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in early development of the dorsal root ganglion was investigated. Excessive cell death in the dorsal root ganglion of mice that carry a deleted NT-3 gene (NT-3-/- mice) preceded the period of programmed cell death, detected by the TUNEL method, and caused a reduction in the number of proliferating precursors without altering the proportion of proliferating cells to total number of neurons. Furthermore, the majority of proliferating cells detected by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation also stained with the TUNEL method. NT-3 mRNA was expressed locally in the embryonic, but not the postnatal dorsal root ganglion. Most cultured early embryonic NT-3-/- neurons died in the absence of exogenous NT-3 as did the wild-type neurons when cultured with NT-3 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that NT-3 acts locally to prevent the death of proliferating sensory precursor cells during neurogenesis. Thus, NT-3 may inflict constraints on the number of proliferating precursor cells and thereby affect the number of neurons generated during development of the peripheral nervous system."

A short peptide spanning one of these loops was shown to carry out the key reaction mediated by the whole RecA protein: pairing (targeting) of a single-stranded DNA to its homologous site on a duplex DNA. In the course of the reaction the peptide bound to both substrate DNAs, unstacked the single-stranded DNA, and assumed a beta structure.

Between 0.6 and 10 bars large thermal fluxes imply very low gaseous opacities and provide no evidence for a deep water cloud. Near 8 bars the water vapor abundance appears to be about 10 percent of what would be expected for a solar abundance of oxygen.
