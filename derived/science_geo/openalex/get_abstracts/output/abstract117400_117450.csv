https://openalex.org/W2143339726,"We have recently shown that mechanical stress induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy partly through the enhanced secretion of angiotensin II (ATII). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been reported to be a potent growth factor for a variety of cells, including cardiomyocytes. In this study, we examined the role of ET-1 in mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy by using cultured cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats. ET-1 (10<sup>−8</sup>∼10<sup>−7</sup>M) maximally induced the activation of both Raf-1 kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases at 4 and 8 min, respectively, followed by an increase in protein synthesis at 24 h. All of these hypertrophic responses were completely blocked by pretreatment with BQ123, an antagonist selective for the ET-1 type A receptor subtype, but not by BQ788, an ET-1 type B receptor-specific antagonist. BQ123 also suppressed stretch-induced activation of MAP kinases and an increase in phenylalanine uptake by approximately 60 and 50%, respectively, but BQ788 did not. ET-1 was constitutively secreted from cultured cardiomyocytes, and a significant increase in ET-1 concentration was observed in the culture medium of cardiomyocytes after stretching for 10 min. After 24 h, an ∼3-fold increase in ET-1 concentration was observed in the conditioned medium of stretched cardiomyocytes compared with that of unstretched cardiomyocytes. ET-1 mRNA levels were also increased at 30 min after stretching. Moreover, ET-1 and ATII synergistically activated Raf-1 kinase and MAP kinases in cultured cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, mechanical stretching stimulates secretion and production of ET-1 in cultured cardiomyocytes, and vasoconstrictive peptides such as ATII and ET-1 may play an important role in mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy."

In Swiss 3T3 and REF52 fibroblasts, activated MEKK induces cell death involving cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. Expression of activated MEKK enhanced the apoptotic response to ultraviolet irradiation, indicating that MEKK-regulated pathways sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli. Inducible expression of activated MEKK stimulated the transactivation of c-Myc and Elk-1. Activated Raf, the serine-threonine protein kinase that activates the ERK members of the MAPK family, stimulated Elk-1 transactivation but not c-Myc; expression of activated Raf does not induce any of the cellular changes associated with MEKK-mediated cell death. Thus, MEKK selectively regulates signal transduction pathways that contribute to the apoptotic response.

In contrast, specific cytokines and stresses to the cell appear to preferentially activate the JNK/SAPK pathway(1.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J.

Several of the cytokines and stresses that activate the JNK/SAPK pathway also induce cell death characteristic of apoptosis. The JNK/SAPKs have been shown to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of several transcription factors including c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF-2(1.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Rubie E.A.

Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The MEKK-regulated JNK/SAPK sequential protein kinase pathway is parallel to the Raf/Erk pathway.Apoptosis is a regulated cell death process characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation (16.Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A. Currie A. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12723) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be induced by signaling from specific cell surface receptors (i.e. tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and Fas)(17.Cohen J.J. Adv.

Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of proteins involved in mediating or protecting against apoptosis, biochemical pathways involved in apoptosis are poorly defined.Receptor-stimulated apoptosis must involve signal transduction pathways that transfer cell surface events to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins that initiate the cell death program. Signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis appear to overlap with those that mediate growth and differentiation(31.Gulbins E. Bissonnette R. Mahboubi A. Martin S. Nishioka W. Brunner T.

Biochem. 1995; 58: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The integration of signal transduction pathways regulated by growth factor and cytokine receptors commits a cell either to proliferation or apoptosis(33.Sumimoto S.I. Heike T. Kanazashi S.-I. Shintaku N. Jung E.-Y. Data D. Katamura K. Mayumi M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2488-2496PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular stress such as DNA damage can stimulate signal transduction pathways and alter their integration so that the cell commits to a pathway of apoptosis(34.Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Several checkpoints exist in the pathways leading to apoptosis that involve proteins such as Bcl-2 and p53. Overexpression of Bcl-2 can collaborate with oncoproteins to suppress apoptosis and increase tumor cell growth. Similarly, mutational inactivation of p53 can inhibit apoptosis and contribute to the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation(28.Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.G. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2951) Google Scholar).To date, candidate molecules involved in signaling apoptosis include ceramide(35.Jimenez B. Arends M. Esteve P. Perona R. Sanchez R. Ramon y Cajal S. Wyllie A. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 811-816PubMed Google Scholar), Ras(31.Gulbins E. Bissonnette R. Mahboubi A. Martin S. Nishioka W. Brunner T.

Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar) and Fas(39.Wang W. Miura L. Beregron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The interleukin converting enzyme-like proteases appear to be frequent end point mediators of apoptosis(40.Lederman S.J. Yellin M.J. Cleary A.M. Pernis A. Inghirami G. Cohn L.E. Covey L.R. Lee J.J. Rothman P. Chess L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2163-2171PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the MAPK family may be predicted to be involved in apoptotic signaling because Ras can regulate their activity and may be involved in ceramide-mediated apoptosis(31.Gulbins E. Bissonnette R. Mahboubi A. Martin S. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). MAPKs are also involved in the regulation of transcription factors including c-Myc and c-Jun, which have been shown to influence apoptosis. The regulation of MAPKs including the ERKs, JNK/SAPK and p38/Hog1 involves sequential phosphorylation pathways. For ERKs the pathway is Raf-MEK-ERK, which is strongly implicated in the regulation of growth and differentiation of different cell types. For JNK/SAPK and p38/Hog1 the proposed pathway involves a MEKK, JNKK/SEK, JNK/SAPK, or p38/Hog1. The exact number and selectivity of members of these kinase pathways is still being defined. Members of the TNF receptor family including the TNFα receptor(4.Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), Fas, ( 2N. L. Johnson, A. M. Gardner, K. M. Diener, C. A. Lange-Carter, J. Gleavy, M. B. Jarpe, A. Minden, M. Karin, L. I. Zon, and G. L. Johnson, unpublished observation.) and CD40 (5.Sakata N. Patel H. Terada N. Aruffo A. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30823-30827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) activate JNK/SAPK pathways. The TNFα receptor and Fas can mediate apoptosis, but CD40 actually can be protective against apoptosis in B cells(33.Sumimoto S.I. Heike T. Kanazashi S.-I. Shintaku N. Jung E.-Y. Data D. Katamura K. Mayumi M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2488-2496PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 42.Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Even though JNK/SAPK activation is a common signal response to these receptors, their influence on cell function can be quite different. Thus, JNK/SAPK activation per se would not be predicted to be the primary mediator of apoptotic signaling by TNF receptor family members. Signal transduction pathways in addition to or other than JNK/SAPK activation must therefore be involved in mediating receptor-stimulated apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of activated MEKK mediates a cell death response characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. MEKK-mediated cell death appears independent of JNK/SAPK activation and has properties characteristic of apoptosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSMicroinjection of Swiss 3T3 and REF52 CellsFor microinjection Swiss 3T3 and REF52 cells were plated on acid-washed glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% bovine calf serum or newborn calf serum (NCS). Cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% calf serum for overnight incubation prior to injection and used for injection at 50-70% confluence. Injections were performed with an Eppendorf automated microinjection system with needles pulled from glass capillaries on a vertical pipette puller (Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Cells were injected with pCMVβ-gal in the presence or absence of pCMV5MEKKCOOH or pCMV5BxBRaf at 20-100 ng/μl for each expression plasmid in 100 mM KCl, 5 mM NaPO4, pH 7.3. Following injection cells were placed in 1% NCS for 12-18 h (Swiss 3T3) or 42 h (REF52) prior to fixation with paraformaldehyde and staining. Similar results were obtained when cells were placed in 10% NCS after microinjection. Propidium iodide (5 pg/ml) was used to stain DNA. X-Gal reactions were performed for 6 h.Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with 100 ng/μl pCMVβ-gal and 20 ng/μl pCMV5MEKKCOOH. To label free DNA ends, fixed and rehydrated cells were incubated with terminal deoxytransferase (TDT) and 10 nM biotin-dUTP following the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were stained with FITC-streptavidin to label DNA fragments. β-Galactosidase (β-gal) was detected using rabbit anti-β-gal antibody (Cappel Laboratories) and a rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel Laboratories).Transactivation AnalysisSwiss 3T3 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine with the reporter plasmid Gal4-TK-luciferase, which contains four Gal4 binding sites (43.Gupta S.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Transfections included pCMV5 without a cDNA insert (basal control), pCMV5MEKKCOOH and in some experiments pCMV5BxBRaf. Cells were incubated for 24-48 h after transfection, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity. Values were normalized to equivalent amounts of protein (μg) for all experiments.Protein Kinase AssaysJNK/SAPKActivity was measured using glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun(1−79) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B(2.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Cells expressing MEKKCOOH or control cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.25 NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and supernatants (25 μg of protein) mixed with 10 μl of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun(1−79)-Sepharose (3-5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun(1−79)). The mixture was rotated at 4°C for 1 h, washed twice in lysis buffer, and washed once in kinase buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM sodium vanadate). Beads were suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30°C for 20 min. Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and phosphorylated proteins resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To verify the selectivity of the JNK/SAPK assay, cell lysates were fractionated by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography and each fraction assayed as described above. Fractions were immunoblotted with a rabbit antiserum recognizing JNK/SAPK. Only fractions containing immunoreactive JNK/SAPK phosphorylated the glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun(1−79) protein.p42/44 ERK MAPKERK activity was assayed after fractionation of cell lysates on DEAE-Sephacel(46.Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ERK activity was assayed following Mono Q ion exchange chromatography as described previously and characterized(47.Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor receptor 662-681 peptide was used as a selective substrate for measuring ERK activity(48.Han J. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar).p38/Hog-1Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 0.2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants (200 μg of protein) were used for immunoprecipitation of p38/Hog-1 using rabbit antiserum raised against the COOH-terminal peptide sequence of p38/Hog-1 (CFVPPPLDQEEMES) (49.Abdel-Hafig H.

Immunoprecipitates were washed once in lysis buffer, once in assay buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 25 mM NaCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate), resuspended in kinase assay buffer with 20-50 ng of a recombinant NH2-terminal fragment of ATF-2 as substrate and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP(50.Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 495-500PubMed Google Scholar). For verification of the immunoprecipitation assay, lysates were fractionated by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography and each fraction assayed for ATF-2 kinase activity and immunoblotted with anti-p38 antibody. The results demonstrated that p38/Hog-1 containing fractions selectively phosphorylated the recombinant ATF-2 protein.Competitive Inhibitory Mutant JNK/SAPK and JNKK/SEK-1The competitive inhibitory JNK/SAPK mutant referred to as JNK/SAPK(APF) had the amino acids threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 mutated to alanine and phenylalanine, respectively(14.Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). These are the sites phosphorylated by JNKK/SEK-1 and required for activation of the JNK/SAPK kinase activity(14.Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L.

The findings suggested that expression of activated MEKK inhibited clonal expansion of transfected cells. For this reason, we characterized the functional consequence of expressing activated MEKK in Swiss 3T3 and REF52 cells using nuclear microinjection of an expression plasmid encoding an activated form of MEKK-1. Cells were microinjected with an expression plasmid encoding β-gal in the presence or the absence of the expression plasmid encoding MEKKCOOH, a truncated activated form of MEKK-1(8.Yan M. Dai T.

Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a field of Swiss 3T3 cells microinjected with expression plasmids for β-gal alone (control) or β-gal plus MEKKCOOH. It is readily apparent that expression of the activated MEKK-1 induced a strong morphological change of the cells. In contrast, cells microinjected with the β-gal plasmid alone are similar in morphology to uninjected cells. Of the six MEKK-injected cells in the field, three are highly condensed with a very dark staining of the cytoplasm that has dramatically shrunken relative to the flattened morphology of the cells injected with β-gal alone. The other three cells are in an earlier stage of cytoplasmic shrinkage, and, based on independent experiments with longer post-injection incubation, it is clear they would have eventually assumed a highly condensed morphology. The results indicated MEKKCOOH expression resulted in death of the cells.For further analysis and comparison cells were microinjected with BxBRaf, a truncated activated form of Raf-1 (51.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) that selectively activates the ERK pathway(12.Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In microinjected cells, expression of β-gal, MEKKCOOH, or BxBRaf was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence using specific antibodies recognizing each protein (Fig. 2). Swiss 3T3 cells (panels A and B) and REF 52 cells (panels C and D) microinjected with the indicated expression plasmid were fixed and stained only 8 h post-injection to demonstrate that each protein was being expressed in the cytoplasm of the cells. Since the cells shown in Fig. 2 were fixed and stained soon after injection, they were not yet undergoing significant cellular condensation as observed in Fig. 1. However, it is apparent with the REF 52 cells expressing MEKK (panel C) that they have begun to undergo a morphological change relative to β-gal-expressing cells (panel D).Figure 2:Expression MEKKCOOH and BxBRaf in Swiss 3T3 and REF52 cells. Swiss 3T3 cells (panels A and B) and REF52 cells (panels C and D) were micoinjected with pCMV5MEKKCOOH, pCMV5BxBRaf, or pCMVβ-gal as indicated. Eight hours after injection, cells were fixed and stained by indirect immunofluorescence for expression of each protein. The MEKKCOOH protein has the 9-amino acid hemagglutinin tag (YPYDVPDYA) at its NH2 terminus and was detected using the mouse monoclonal 12CA5 antibody and a secondary FITC-rabbit anti-mouse antibody. BxBRaf was detected using a rabbit anti-Raf antibody recognizing the COOH terminus of Raf-1, and a rhodamine-donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody. β-Gal was detected using a mouse anti-β-gal monoclonal antibody, and the FITC-rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody. At 8 h post-injection, the morphological changes in the MEKKCOOH-expressing REF52 cells (panel C) are beginning to be apparent while the changes in Swiss 3T3 cells are not yet apparent (compare panels A and B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantitation of microinjection experiments demonstrated that expression of MEKKCOOH resulted in significant cell death characterized by the dramatic morphological condensation (Table 1). In contrast, BxBRaf expression did not affect cell viability relative to control cells expressing only β-gal. Approximately 84% of all MEKKCOOH-injected cells had a highly condensed cellular morphology 17 h after injection. This count actually underestimates the number of condensed cells because Swiss 3T3 cells in advanced stages of the cell death response were often nonadherent to coverslips. Some of the nonadherent highly condensed cells could be found to be released from the coverslip into the culture medium, but were not scored in the quantitation. In contrast, fewer than 3% of BxBRaf and 1% of control β-gal-injected cells had an altered morphology even after 48-72 h post-injection.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Cell death resulting from MEKKCOOH expression required the kinase activity of the enzyme; the kinase inactive mutant of MEKKCOOH was without effect (Table 1).

Transient cell transfection assays using human dermal fibroblasts and stable transfection experiments using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts identified the region located between residues −265 and −241, as critical for TGF-β response. Specifically, we demonstrate that this 25-base pair region mediates the up-regulatory effect of TGF-β on COL1A2 promoter activity and allows antagonistic activity of TNF-α on the TGF-β effect. Gel mobility shift assays indicate that nuclear factor binding to this 25-base pair region of COL1A2 promoter is competed by AP-1, but not NF-1 or NF-κB, oligonucleotides. Transient cell transfection experiments with plasmid constructs in which the potential AP-1-binding site located within this short region of promoter was modified by sitedirected mutagenesis indicated that this element plays a significant role in the basal activity of the promoter. Furthermore, this sequence is essential for TGF-β response and does not require the presence of the three Sp-1-binding sites located further upstream, between nucleotides −273 and −304.

https://openalex.org/W2027116360,"THE primordial ratio of deuterium to hydrogen nuclei (D/H), created as a result of the Big Bang, provides the most sensitive measure of the cosmological density of baryons1–5. Measurements of the D/H ratio in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy place a strict lower limit on the primordial ratio6, because processing of gas by stars reduces the abundance of deuterium relative to hydrogen. Absorption of radiation from distant quasars by intervening clouds of gas offers a means of probing D/H ratios at large redshifts, where the effects of stellar processing should be negligible. Measurements7,8 on one absorption system have indicated an extremely high primordial abundance ratio of 24 × 10–5. Here we report a measurement of the D/H ratio in another high-redshift absorption system, and obtain a value that is an order of magnitude lower than that reported previously7,8. The measured ratio of 2.3 × 10–5 is consistent with that in the interstellar medium (after allowing for Galactic chemical evolution9,10), and indicates that the absorption spectra on which the earlier estimates are based may have been subject to strong contamination. We calculate a baryon density that is 5% of the critical density required to close the Universe."

We demonstrate prominent and early tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl upon stimulation of human B cell lines through surface IgM. Cbl was associated in vivo with Fyn and, to a lesser extent, other Src family kinases. B cell activation also induced a prominent association of Cbl with Syk tyrosine kinase. A substantial fraction of Cbl was constitutively associated with Grb2 and this interaction was mediated by Grb2 SH3 domains. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, which prominently associated with Grb2, was detected in association with Cbl in activated B cells.

The inhibition of the basal ATPase activity and the reversal of gramicidin D inhibition of Pgp ATPase by its various substrates conformed to classical Michaelis-Menten competition.

Mammalian cells with the MDR phenotype, express increased levels of a heavily glycosylated 170-kDa plasma membrane protein known as P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp is a tandemly duplicated 1280-amino acid polypeptide, each half of which contains six transmembrane α-helices and one cytoplasmic nucleotide triphosphate binding site(6.Chen C. Chin J.E. Ueda K.

In this respect, several initial reports have demonstrated that Pgp has a low ATPase activity(18.Hamada H. Tsuruo T. J. Biol.

Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Pgp functions as an ATP-dependent efflux transporter of multiple hydrophobic cytotoxic drugs.A major unresolved problem in the multidrug resistance field is how a single integral membrane transporter can transport various hydrophobic peptides, cytotoxic drugs, and chemosensitizers bearing a wide array of molecular structures(4.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar). Several genetic and biochemical approaches have been taken in an attempt to resolve this major question; these included an examination of the relationship between the structure and function of Pgp using mutational analysis of this transporter, as well as its photoaffinity labeling with substrate and substrate analogues (for a recent review, see (26.Beck W.T.

The first point mutation described in Pgp, involving a Gly → Val substitution at position 185, was detected in a highly colchicine-selected MDR KB-C1 cell line; this single amino acid substitution was shown to change the specificity of the transporter so that colchicine transport was improved, whereas vinblastine and actinomycin D transport was decreased(27.Choi K. Chen C. Kriegler M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1989; 53: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28.Currier S.J. Kane S.E. Willingham M.C. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J.

Similarly, mutations of Gly → Ala and Ala → Pro at positions 338 and 339, respectively, in transmembrane domain 6 of Chinese hamster Pgp (29.Devine S.E. Ling V. Melera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4564-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), appeared to decrease the resistance to several drugs, while maintaining normal resistance to actinomycin D. Furthermore, a site-directed mutation leading to conversion of Ser → Phe at residue 941 in the mouse mdr1 gene in transmembrane domain 11 (30.Hsu S.I.H. Cohen D. Kirschner L.S. Lothstein L. Hartstein M. Horwitz S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31.Gros P. Dhir R. Croop J. Talbot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7289-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) altered drug specificity such that the transport of vinblastine was intact, whereas that of colchicine and doxorubicin was drastically decreased.Several photoaffinity labels including Pgp substrates such as anticancer drugs, hydrophobic peptides, and chemosensitizers bind to two symmetrical sites on Pgp (i.e. transmembrane domains 6 and 12; see (4.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar)). Various hydrophobic peptides, drugs, and chemosensitizers were shown to competitively inhibit the photoaffinity labeling of Pgp with radiolabeled substrate analogues, or chemosensitizers' analogues, in isolated plasma membrane vesicles, or in whole MDR cells (reviewed in (26.Beck W.T. Qian X.-D. Biochem. Pharm. 1992; 43: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)). Using Pgp-reconstituted proteoliposomes, we have recently shown an ATP-driven transport of valinomycin and gramicidin D(15.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this active intravesicular accumulation of peptide ionophores was blocked by established Pgp substrates including the anthracyclines doxorubicin, daunorubicin, the Vinca alkaloid vinblastine as well as the tripeptide N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN; see (32.Sharma R.C. Inoue S. Roitelman J. Schimke R.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5731-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)).Taken collectively, these different studies pointed out that a common drug pharmacophore may exist in Pgp, which binds the structurally and functionally distinct drugs and chemosensitizers that participate in the MDR phenomenon(2.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12163-12166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev.

Indeed, using proteoliposomes reconstituted with Pgp ATPase, we show here that various hydrophobic peptides, cytotoxic drugs, and MDR chemosensitizers compete on a common drug pharmacophore present in Pgp. We therefore suggest that substrate competition using a drug-modulatable Pgp ATPase activity, is a functional assay useful for the screening of Pgp substrates and MDR chemosensitizers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDrugsThe peptides gramicidin D (Dubos), valinomycin, alamethicin, ALLN, ALLM, n-formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-methylester (f-NLP-ME), n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-methylester (f-MLP-ME), N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-methylester, and viscosin, the cytotoxic agents colchicine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, emetine hydrochloride, taxol, as well as the chemosensitizers (±)-verapamil hydrochloride, progesterone, quinidine hydrochloride, and quinine hydrochloride were all purchased from Sigma. Vinblastine sulfate and methotrexate were obtained from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Dolastatin 10 was a generous gift from Dr. V. Narayanan, Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, National Cancer Institute. Trimetrexate glucoronate was kindly provided by Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis, and metoprine was generously provided by Burroughs Wellcome.Cell Cultures and Stepwise SelectionA clonal derivative (C11) of parental Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells and their emetine-resistant sublines were maintained under monolayer conditions in α-minimal essential medium (Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel) containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Beth Haemek), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). Exponentially growing cells were passaged twice a week using a standard trypsinization procedure. For preparation of membrane fractions, cells were seeded (104 cells/ml) in 3-liter spinner flasks (Cytostir, Kontes) in growth medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and maintained as suspension cultures.Emetine-resistant variants were derived from wild type AA8 cells using a stepwise selection protocol of increasing drug concentrations. Drug selection was performed by first seeding 5 × 104 wild type cells/25-cm2 tissue culture flask (Nunc) in growth medium (5 ml) containing 0.15 μM emetine (∼3 times the 50% lethal dose (LD50) for parental AA8 cells). Following growth to midconfluence, emetine-selected cells were detached by trypsinization, counted, and replated as above in the presence of a 50-100% increment in the emetine concentration. The gradual increase in emetine concentrations was terminated at 1 μM (∼20-fold LD50).Determination of MDR Gene Copy NumberHigh molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from parental AA8 cells and from the various emetine-resistant sublines. Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with EcoRI, fractionated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to a Zetabind filter membrane. Blots were then hybridized with a 32P-oligolabeled hamster MDR cDNA probe (0.66-kilobase EcoRI insert of pCHP-1; see (35.Riordan J.R. Deuchars K. Kartner N. Alon N. Trent J. Ling V. Nature. 1985; 316: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar)). Hybridizations were carried out at 42°C for 48 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 0.18 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA at pH 7.0), 1% SDS, and 1 × Denhardt's (20 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone 360, 20 mg of Ficoll, and 20 mg of bovine serum albumin/100 ml of distilled water). Following hybridization, blots were washed twice for 30 min under high stringency conditions (0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65°C). Autoradiography was performed for various times using highly sensitive x-ray films (XAR-5 and XAM, Eastman Kodak Co.). Gene copy numbers were estimated by scanning densitometry (Cliniscan 2 scanning densitometer, Helena Laboratories) of linear film exposures. Scanning densitometry of the ethidium bromide-stained gels was used to correct for any slight differences in DNA loading.Clonogenic Cytotoxic AssaysTo determine cellular sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, parental AA8 cells and its emetine-resistant derivative EmtR1 were grown for 6-10 doublings in the absence of drugs. Then, 500 cells were seeded in duplicate 6-cm Petri dishes (Nunc) in medium (5 ml/dish) lacking or containing different concentrations of various cytotoxic drugs as detailed previously(36.Assaraf Y.G. Borgnia M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Following 6-12 days of incubation at 37°C, culture plates containing visible colonies were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol, and stained with crystal violet. Colonies (≥50 cells/colony) were then scored manually or using a computer-aided method we have recently developed(37.Assaraf Y.G. Borgnia M.J. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1993; 4: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Isolation of Microsomal and Plasma Membrane FractionCells (109) growing under suspension culture conditions were harvested by sedimentation at 3,000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing: 10 mM Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4 at 4°C, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, as well as the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 2 mM), aprotinin (1 mM), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). Following a 5-min incubation on ice, cells were lysed using a Teflon-glass homogenizer and diluted 3-fold in lysis buffer. Nuclei and mitochondria were removed by consecutive 10-min centrifugations at 300 and 4,000 × g, respectively, and the microsomal fraction was recovered by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and finally resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer.Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from the microsomal fraction by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation as described by Riordan and Ling (38.Riordan J.R. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12701-12705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification of Al-Shawi and Senior(21.Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The routine yields for microsomes and plasma membrane vesicles were, respectively: 0.4-0.6 mg of protein/108 cells and 50-100 μg of protein/108 cells. The membrane fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −75°C until analysis.Extraction and Reconstitution of Pgp-rich Membrane FractionsThe extraction and reconstitution of Pgp were performed according to our recently published protocol (15.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for minor modifications. A liposome suspension was prepared from a mixture containing the acetone-insoluble, ether-soluble fraction of soybean phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol in a ratio of 5:1:1, respectively. The lipid solutions were mixed, and the solvents were removed under a stream of nitrogen and exposure to vacuum for 30 min. The lipids were suspended by sonication in a round-bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Company, Hicksville, NY) to a concentration of 50 mg/ml in a reconstitution medium containing: 25 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 85 mM K2SO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM PMSF. Microsomal fraction or plasma membrane vesicles obtained from parental AA8 and EmtR1 cells were incubated for 20 min on ice at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in a solubilization buffer containing: 35 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 1.3% n-octylglucoside, 0.7% liposome suspension, 15% glycerol, 3 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mM PMSF, 1 mM aprotinin, 100 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. The detergent-soluble proteins were obtained as the supernatant after centrifugation for 30 min at 130,000 × g, and a liposome suspension was added to a final lipid concentration of 17 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 20 min.Proteoliposomes were formed by dilution of the protein and lipid solution into 25 volumes of vigorously-stirred reconstitution medium containing PMSF as the only protease inhibitor. The proteoliposomes were recovered by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 45 min, suspended in reconstitution medium, and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored for weeks at −75°C without any detectable loss of Pgp ATPase activity. Due to the high lipid content of the samples, protein was determined according to Esen(39.Esen A. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) as a standard.ATPase Activity AssayThe ATPase activity of Pgp was determined by a colorimetric monitoring of the inorganic phosphate released from ATP(40.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), whereas low Pi levels were determined by the malachite green method. Reconstituted vesicles were diluted to a protein concentration of 20 μg/ml in an ice-cold ATPase assay medium, adapted from Urbatsch and Senior(23.Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which contained: 3 mM ATP, 50 mM KCl, 25 mM MgSO4, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 2 mM ouabain. Aliquots were incubated with the various drugs and peptides for 1 h at 37°C in glass test tubes. Water-insoluble drugs and peptides were added as ethanol solutions. The total amount of ethanol added was less than 1% and had no effect on the ATPase activity. At the end of the incubation, the vesicle suspensions were rapidly cooled in an ice-cold water bath, and 50-μl portions were distributed into a 96-well microtiter plate. The reaction was not carried out in the plate since it was observed that hydrophobic peptides, such as gramicidin D, were tightly adsorbed to polystyrene. The enzymatic reaction was terminated and inorganic phosphate was determined by the addition of a solution consisting of: 0.2% ammonium molybdate, 1.3% sulfuric acid, 0.9% SDS, and freshly prepared 1% ascorbic acid, incubation for 30 min at room temperature, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reading(41.Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Background values were obtained with samples incubated in parallel on ice and were routinely subtracted from the measurements.Computer Simulation of Substrate Competition on PgpIn order to analyze the interaction of various substrates with Pgp, we assumed that all Pgp substrates behave as classical Michaelis-Menten substrates and are characterized by typical Km and Vmax terms. Furthermore, we presumed that these substrates compete on a common site present on Pgp, and that occupation of this site results in a reaction rate determined by the Vmax of the occupying substrate. After applying the set of schematic rules described by King and Altman(42.King E.L. Altman C.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar), the following general equation describing the steady-state kinetics of ATPase rates was obtained for the interaction of Pgp with multiple (n) substrates Regression analysis and reiterative best-fit computer-simulated curves were generated using Sigmaplot software distributed by Jandel Scientific Software.RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of Emetine-resistant Mammalian CellsTo establish a Pgp-overexpressing cell line, wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells (AA8) were subjected to gradually increasing concentrations of emetine, a eukaryotic translation inhibitor used as an antiamebic. Resistant variants stably growing at 0.15 μM (i.e. ∼3 times the LD50 of wild type cells; this line was therefore termed EmtR0.15] to 1 μM emetine (termed EmtR1) were established. Southern blot analysis with a highly conserved MDR exon probe (43.Ng W.F. Sarangi F. Zastawny R. Veinot-Drebot L. Ling V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 44.Assaraf Y.G. Molina A. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18326-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the MDR gene copy number rose from 20 copies in EmtR0.15 cells to approximately 100 copies in the highly emetine-resistant EmtR1 variant (Fig. 1). Consequently, a 170-kDa band constituting 4.5% of microsomal proteins and 18% of plasma membrane proteins was observed in EmtR1 cells, but was absent from parental AA8 cells (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis using C219 monoclonal antibody confirmed the high levels of Pgp overexpression in microsomes and plasma membrane vesicles from EmtR1 cells, whereas Pgp was not detectable in microsomal protein from parental AA8 cells(45.Drori S. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).EmtR1 cells displayed a 45-fold resistance to the selecting agent emetine, as well as a 15-95 cross-resistance to MDR-type drugs including doxorubicin, colchicine, vinblastine, taxol, and the novel microtubule depolymerizing anticancer peptide, dolastatin 10 (Table 1). The ionophore resistance pattern in EmtR1 cells (Table 1) was consistent with our previous findings of a high level resistance to the channel-forming pentadecapeptide ionophore gramicidin D and a low level resistance to the carrier-type ionophore valinomycin in GDR30 cells(36.Assaraf Y.G. Borgnia M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, EmtR1 cells maintained wild type sensitivity to cytotoxic agents that are not handled by Pgp including the hydrophilic antifolate methotrexate and the hydrophobic peptide antibiotic viscosin. Taken together these data suggest that upon stepwise selection to the antiamebic drug emetine, mammalian cells acquire a classic MDR phenotype via a prominent MDR gene amplification and consequent Pgp overexpression. The excessive overproduction of Pgp in EmtR1 plasma membrane makes this cell line an excellent source for Pgp.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Functional Reconstitution of Pgp ATPase into ProteoliposomesAnalysis of the proteins from proteoliposomes reconstituted with the n-octylglucoside-soluble extract from EmtR1 microsomes and plasma membrane vesicles showed that Pgp constituted 18% and 40%, respectively; this Pgp enrichment by its reconstitution into proteoliposomes was confirmed by Western blot analysis using C219 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). In contrast, Western blot analysis failed to detect Pgp in either AA8 microsomes, or in proteoliposomes reconstituted with microsomal proteins from parental AA8 cells(45.Drori S. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).When examined with established Pgp substrates, the ATPase activity of Pgp- reconstituted proteoliposomes was linear for at least 1 h at 37°C (Fig. 2). The basal (i.e. when no substrates were added) ATPase activities obtained with proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmtR1 microsomal and plasma membrane proteins were: 1.1 ± 0.25 and 2.6 ± 0.45 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein (mean ± S.E.), respectively. Thus, in accord with the 2.2-fold increased Pgp content in proteoliposomes reconstituted with plasma membrane proteins was their 2.3-fold elevated ATPase activity (Fig. 3). This basal ATPase activity was vanadate sensitive (see below), and under the sodium-free assay conditions used, the ATPase activity was ouabain-insensitive. Furthermore, this ATPase activity was inhibited by the well established Pgp substrate gramicidin D and stimulated by a variety of known Pgp substrates including hydrophobic peptides, cytotoxic drugs, and chemosensitizers (see below). In contrast, proteoliposomes reconstituted with AA8 cell membrane proteins did not display any drug-modulatable ATPase activity. Thus, the basal ATPase activity present in proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmtR1 membrane proteins is attributable to Pgp.Figu"

The observed increase in half-life (30 h versus 10 h) correlates with enhanced binding of a 66-kDa protein (hypoxia inducible protein) to the pyrimidine-rich tract located between bases 1552-1578 in the 3′-untranslated region of TH mRNA (hypoxia-inducible protein binding site (HIPBS)). The present study investigates the protein binding site within the 27-base HIPBS, first by using specific cleavages of HIPBS and its flanking sequences with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and RNase H and then by using mutational analysis of the binding properties. We found that the 27-base HIPBS oligoribonucleotide was sufficient to bind the protein in vitro in a hypoxia-stimulated manner. We further identified the optimal hypoxia-inducible protein binding site that is represented by the motif (U/C)(C/U)CCCU, where the core binding site is indicated by the underlined cytidines. Substitutions of either one of the cytidines with purine or uridine abolished the protein binding. The mutations within HIPBS, which partially reduced binding, did not prevent stimulation of protein binding for extracts from hypoxic cells.

D., Borgnia, M. J., Regev, R., and Assaraf, Y. G.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26058-26065). P-glycoprotein mediated the ATP-dependent uptake of 86Rb+-ionophore complex into the proteoliposomes, where the radioactive cation was accumulated, thus, circumventing the obstacle posed by the hydrophobicity of P-glycoprotein substrates in transport studies. Taking advantage of this assay and of the high levels of P-glycoprotein expression in multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells, we measured simultaneously both the ATPase and transport activities of P-glycoprotein under identical conditions and observed 0.5-0.8 ionophore molecules transported/ATP molecule hydrolyzed. The amount of 86Rb+ ions transported within 1 min via the ATP- and valinomycin-dependent P-glycoprotein was equivalent to an intravesicular cation concentration of 8 mM. Thus, this stoichiometry and transport capacity of P-glycoprotein resemble various ion-translocating ATPases, that handle millimolar substrate concentrations. This constitutes the first demonstration of comparable rates of P-glycoprotein-catalyzed substrate transport and ATP hydrolysis.

Inherent as well as acquired resistance to antineoplastic agents pose a major obstacle toward curative cancer chemotherapy(1.Frei III, E.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: MDRmultidrug resistanceAMPPCPβ,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphateCHOChinese hamster ovaryDTTdithiothreitolPgpP-glycoproteinPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.) is characterized by the development of tumor cell resistance to diverse anticancer drugs. Mammalian cells with the typical MDR phenotype express increased levels of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), an integral component of the plasma membrane(3.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). Consequently, these cells display resistance to multiple cytotoxic hydrophobic agents, mostly of natural origin, including anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, actinomycin D, taxoids, and dolastatin 10. Pgp, which possesses an ATPase activity, functions as an energy-dependent extrusion pump that expels these hydrophobic cytotoxic agents out of MDR cells(4.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol.

The reconstituted proteoliposomes displayed an ATP-dependent transport of colchicine, an established substrate of Pgp. Shapiro and Ling (7.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have purified Pgp from Pgp-rich cells by a combination of anion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography. The Pgp preparation was 90% pure and after reconstitution exhibited an ATPase activity that was highly stimulatable by several MDR type drugs and chemosensitizers. Urbatsch et al.(8.Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) have purified Pgp to apparent homogeneity from an extremely Pgp-rich Chinese hamster ovary cell line, reconstituted it, and characterized its drug-stimulatable ATPase activity. Sharom et al.(5.Sharom F.J. Yu X.H. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that colchicine was taken up actively into proteoliposomes with Pgp from CHO cells, against a 5.6-fold concentration gradient. However, the rate of colchicine uptake was about 15 pmol/mg/min with an ATPase activity of ∼0.5 μmol/mg/min. This extremely low stoichiometry of drug transport to ATP hydrolysis is probably due to the hydrophobicity and membrane permeability of Pgp substrates. Recently, Shapiro and Ling (9.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have described the ATP-dependent uptake of the fluorescent Pgp substrate, Hoechst 33342, into proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified Pgp from highly MDR CHO cells. They reported a stoichiometry of 1 substrate molecule transported/50 ATP molecules hydrolyzed and attributed this low efficiency to fast rebinding of the dye to the vesicles. The low transport efficiency reported for Pgp, either in membrane vesicles or in reconstituted proteoliposomes, led to proposals that other mechanisms were responsible for the relatively low levels of drugs observed in MDR cells(10.Simon S. Roy D. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, demonstration of Pgp-mediated transport similar in rate to the Pgp ATPase will prove that Pgp is indeed a drug-efflux pump and could function as such also in vivo. We have recently described an ATP-driven, valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ uptake into proteoliposomes reconstituted with mammalian P-glycoprotein(6.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions mammalian Pgp transported a cation-ionophore complex and the cation, 86Rb+ in this case, accumulated in the intravesicular space. The apparent advantage of this assay is that although the actively-transported substrate, ionophore-cation complex, is hydrophobic, the accumulated species is the hydrophilic cations. In the present study, we took advantage of the methodology developed for assay of ionophore- and ATP-dependent Pgp-mediated 86Rb+ uptake to measure simultaneously both the ATPase and transport functions of reconstituted Pgp. The valinomycin- and ATP-dependent 86Rb+ uptake into proteoliposomes reconstituted with Pgp was close to the ATPase rate exhibited by these proteoliposomes under identical experimental conditions and thus constitutes the first direct demonstration that isolated Pgp could function as an efficient drug-efflux pump. Gramicidin D, valinomycin, bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty-acid free), poly-L-tryptophan, and soybean phospholipids were purchased from Sigma. 86Rb+ was purchased from DuPont NEN. Cholesterol and phosphatidylserine were products of Avanti Polar Lipids. In transport studies the effect of Na+,K+-ATPase was abolished by careful depletion of Na+ from all reagents used in the transport assay. The triphosphate nucleotides were treated with Dowex 50WX8. The pH of the solutions was monitored and resin was added, until no further acidification occurred. The solutions were passed through a 0.22-μm filter and titrated to pH 7.4 with solid Tris base. A clonal derivative (C11) of parental CHO AA8 cells and their emetine-resistant sublines were maintained under monolayer conditions in α-minimal essential medium (Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel) containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Beth Haemek), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). Exponentially growing cells were passaged twice a week using a standard trypsinization procedure. For preparation of membrane fractions, cells were seeded (104 cells/ml) in 3-liter spinner flasks (Cytostir, Kontes) in growth medium supplemented with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and maintained as suspension cultures. Emetine-resistant variants were derived from wild type AA8 cells using a stepwise selection protocol of increasing drug concentrations. Drug selection was performed by first seeding 5 × 104 wild type cells/25-cm2 tissue culture flask (Nunc) in growth medium (5 ml) containing 0.15 μM emetine (∼3 times the LD50 for parental AA8 cells). Following growth to midconfluence, emetine-selected cells were detached by trypsinization, counted and replated as above in the presence of a 50-100% increment in the emetine concentration. The gradual increase in emetine concentrations was terminated at 1 μM (∼20-fold LD50). Cells (109) growing under suspension culture conditions were harvested by sedimentation at 3,000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing: 10 mM Hepes-Tris (pH 7.4) at 4°C, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiotreitol (DTT), as well as the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 2 mM), aprotinin (1 mM), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). Following 5 min incubation on ice, cells were lysed using a Teflon-glass homogenizer and diluted 3-fold in lysis buffer. Nuclei and mitochondria were removed by consecutive 10-min centrifugations at 300 and 4,000 × g, respectively, and the microsomal fraction was recovered by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and finally resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The membrane fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −75°C until analysis. The extraction and reconstitution of Pgp was performed according to our recently published protocol (6.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for minor modifications. A liposome suspension was prepared from a mixture containing the acetone-insoluble, ether-soluble fraction of soybean phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol in a weight ratio of 5:1:1, respectively. The lipid solutions were mixed, and the solvents were removed under a stream of nitrogen and exposure to vacuum for 30 min. The lipids were suspended to a concentration of 50 mg/ml in a reconstitution medium containing: 25 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4), 85 mM K2SO4, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF. Liposomes were formed by sonication to clarity in a round-bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Company, Hicksville, NY). Microsomal fraction obtained from either parental AA8 or EmtR1 cells were incubated for 20 min on ice at a 0.2 or 1 mg/ml protein concentration in a solubilization buffer containing: 35 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4), 1.3% n-octylglucoside, 0.7% liposome suspension, 15% glycerol, 3 mM DTT, 3 mM PMSF, 1 mM aprotinin, 100 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. The detergent-soluble proteins were obtained as the supernatant after centrifugation for 30 min at 130,000 × g; a liposome suspension was added to a final lipid concentration of 17 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 20 min. Proteoliposomes were formed by rapid dilution of the protein and lipid solution into 25 volumes of reconstitution medium containing PMSF as the sole protease inhibitor. The proteoliposomes were washed twice by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 45 min, and suspended in 1 ml of reconstitution medium. The proteoliposomes were fused by adding CaCl2 (25 mM final concentration), incubated for 20 min, and diluted into 7 ml of reconstitution buffer, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The proteoliposomes were concentrated by centrifugation for 45 min at 130,000 × g and suspended in 0.5 ml of reconstitution buffer using a 27-gauge needle. The proteoliposomes were used either directly or after an overnight incubation on ice. Due to the high lipid content of the samples protein was determined according to Esen(11.Esen A. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) as a standard. The ATPase activity of Pgp was determined by a colorimetric monitoring of the inorganic phosphate released from ATP(12.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Reconstituted vesicles were diluted to a protein concentration of 20 μg/ml in an ice-cold ATPase assay medium, adapted from Urbatsch and Senior(8.Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which contained: 3 mM ATP, 50 mM KCl, 25 mM MgSO4, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM EGTA, and 2 mM ouabain. Aliquots were incubated with the various drugs for 1 h at 37°C in glass test tubes. The ATPase activity was linear for at least 1 h(13.Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Water-insoluble drugs and peptides were added as ethanol solutions. The total amount of ethanol added was less than 1% and had no effect either on ATPase or on 86Rb+ uptake assays. At the end of the incubation, the vesicle suspensions were rapidly cooled in ice-cold water bath, and 50-μl portions were distributed into a 96-well microtiter plate. The reaction was not carried out in the plate since it was observed that hydrophobic drugs, such as valinomycin, were adsorbed to polystyrene. The enzymatic reaction was terminated and inorganic phosphate was determined by the addition of a solution consisting of: 0.2% ammonium molybdate, 1.3% sulfuric acid, 0.9% SDS, and freshly prepared 1% ascorbic acid, incubation for 30 min at room temperature, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reading(14.Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Background values were obtained with samples incubated in parallel on ice and were routinely subtracted from the measurements. Valinomycin- and ATP-dependent 86Rb+ uptake was assayed essentially according to the assay strategy we have recently described(6.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transport activity of Pgp was assessed indirectly by measuring uptake of 86Rb+ ions transported as a 86Rb+-valinomycin complex into reconstituted proteoliposomes (see Fig. 1 for a scheme describing the methodology). 86Rb+ serves as a convenient monitor of K+. The assay of 86Rb+ uptake was based on the amplification of the isotope uptake by an outwardly oriented concentration gradient of K+(15.Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The principle of the method relies on the trapping of high K+ concentrations within the proteoliposomes. Upon dilution of the proteoliposomes into the assay buffer and selective permeation of the proteoliposomes to 86Rb+ and K+ ions by the ionophore mobile carrier-type valinomycin, a diffusion potential is formed, which maintains the K+ gradient. 86Rb+ is transported into the proteoliposomes until equilibration of its specific radioactivity with K+ is reached. Thus, even in absence of ATP hydrolysis, the K+ is concentrated in the proteoliposomes relatively to its concentration in the buffer. This accumulation of 86Rb+ is transient, as during the course of time, the cation gradient is collapsed, and the accumulated isotope will flow out of the proteoliposomes. Valinomycin exhibits a high affinity toward K+ and 86Rb+ ions; thus, in the presence of relatively high cation concentrations present in the uptake medium, valinomycin is presented to Pgp predominantly as a cation-ionophore complex. Moreover, most known substrates of Pgp are hydrophobic and cationic in nature, and thus it is likely that the ionophore-cation complex is a preferred substrate for Pgp when compared with the unloaded ionophore. The ATP- and valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ uptake required preloading of the proteoliposomes with K+ ions, and was abolished by dissipation of the K+ gradient. Thus, Pgp transports the cation-ionophore complex into the intravesicular volume of the vesicles. The 86Rb+ ions cotransported with valinomycin equilibrate with the cations trapped within the vesicles. Since the amount of 86Rb+ ions transported is in large excess compared to the total amount of valinomycin present in the medium, valinomycin plays a catalytic role and is recycled. Presumably, the electric potential formed by the K+-gradient across the proteoliposome membrane hinders the release of 86Rb+ together with the accumulated valinomycin, and valinomycin leaks out of the proteoliposomes as the unloaded species. Thus, although the actual Pgp substrate is the hydrophobic 86Rb+-valinomycin complex, the accumulated substrate is hydrophilic 86Rb+ ions. The transport of 86Rb+ was measured by rapid removal of extravesicular cations with the strong cation exchange resin, Dowex-50WX8, 100-mesh(15.Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as modified by Garty and Karlish (16.Gasko O.D. Knowles A.F. Shetzer H.G. Suolinna E.-M. Racker E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the transport buffer contained: 25 mM Hepes-Tris (pH 7.4), 0.25 M sucrose, 8 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 μCi/ml carrier-free 86Rb+, various amounts of valinomycin, and either 1 mM ATP or AMPPCP in a final volume of 0.125 ml. The buffer was preincubated for 2 min at 37°C, and the transport was initiated by addition of 5 μl of reconstituted proteoliposomes. Non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP (i.e. AMPPCP) were included in the control samples since the cation-permeability of the proteoliposomes was very sensitive to Mg2+-concentrations and nucleotide triphosphates are efficient Mg2+-chelators capable of altering the Mg2+-concentrations. At appropriate times, the transport reactions were stopped by withdrawing 0.1-ml samples. The extravesicular cations were removed as described by Garty and Karlish (15.Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the amount of radioactivity associated with the vesicles was determined. The stopping procedure was concluded within 15 s. The amount of radioactivity associated with proteoliposomes incubated in the absence of ionophores was less than 0.05% of the total radioactivity added and did not increase upon a 30-min incubation at 37°C. This amount, presumably representing nonspecific adsorption, was routinely subtracted from all samples. We undertook this study in order to estimate the stoichiometry of drug transport to ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by Pgp. To this end, both the ATPase and transport functions of Pgp had to be measured simultaneously under identical experimental conditions. In this respect, we have described an assay of valinomycin uptake into proteoliposomes reconstituted with Pgp from rat liver, the amount of transported valinomycin was assessed as the quantity of 86Rb+ ions cotransported with the ionophore (6.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of Pgp present in canalicular vesicles from rat liver was low, and its presence could be detected only by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody(6.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, its ATPase activity was relatively low and was masked by other ATPases present in the preparation. In contrast, Pgp ATPase activity has been demonstrated with Pgp from multidrug-resistant CHO cells where it is highly overexpressed(5.Sharom F.J. Yu X.H. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 9.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, the aim of the present study was to measure simultaneously both ATPase and 86Rb+ uptake functions assayed under identical conditions as valinomycin-dependent activities of hamster Pgp. Toward this end, a CHO variant (EmtR1) highly-expressing Pgp was established by stepwise selection with the MDR drug, emetine. The Pgp content in the microsomal fraction of this EmtR1 subline constituted 4.5% of the total protein content. Upon reconstitution, the relative amount of Pgp was increased to 18%, and under the assay conditions used here all the ATPase activity was attributable to Pgp(13.Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity was stimulated by known substrates of Pgp, inhibited by known inhibitors of Pgp including vanadate and oligomycin, and insensitive to ouabain and EGTA. Reconstitution of Pgp from EmtR1 plasma membranes, the Pgp content of which was 18%, yielded proteoliposomes with a Pgp content of 40% and a consistently higher ATPase activity(13.Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the yield of these proteoliposomes was low, and since they did not pose a clear advantage over proteoliposomes reconstituted with Pgp from the microsomal fraction, the latter were routinely used. The basal (i.e. with no substrates added) ATPase activity of proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmtR1 microsomal fraction was 1.1 ± 0.25 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein (Fig. 2A and (13.Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)). A similar basal activity was reported for various Pgp preparations(5.Sharom F.J. Yu X.H. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Shapiro A.B.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17.Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This basal activity was stimulated by valinomycin and emetine, the selecting drug used to establish EmtR1 cells (Fig. 2). However, a major problem became evident as the minimal valinomycin concentrations required for demonstrating stimulation of ATPase activity were higher than 0.1 μM, whereas appreciable ATP- and valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ uptake was already evident at a concentration of 0.1 μM valinomycin. Thus, the high basal activity demonstrated by Pgp presumably masked the ATPase activity required for valinomycin-dependent transport. To overcome this obstacle, we looked for a Pgp inhibitor capable of reversibly repressing the basal ATPase activity without exerting a deleterious effect on the proteoliposomes. In this respect we have recently found that various hydrophobic homopolypeptides modulate Pgp ATPase activity. ( 2G. D. Eytan and Y. G. Assaraf, manuscript in preparation.) Poly-L-tryptophan met these expectations; at concentrations lower than 100 nM, it inhibited both the basal ATPase and the substrate-stimulatable activities of Pgp (Fig. 2B). These concentrations of poly-L-tryptophan had no deleterious effects on the integrity of the proteoliposomes as revealed by retention of encapsulated 86Rb+ or calcein (data not shown). Most importantly for this study, low concentrations of poly-L-tryptophan repressed the basal ATPase activity and, at concentrations required for mediation of ATP-dependent 86Rb+ uptake (see below), valinomycin reactivated it in a competitive manner (Fig. 3). The Michaelis-Menten type competitive inhibition exerted by poly-L-tryptophan on the stimulatory effect of valinomycin is presented in Fig. 3B as a Lineweaver-Burk plot.Figure 3:Activation of poly-L-tryptophan-inhibition of Pgp ATPase by valinomycin. The ATPase activity of Pgp proteoliposomes was determined in the presence of various concentrations of valinomycin or emetine, and the following concentrations (μM) of poly-L-tryptophan (mass = 5.4 kDa): 0, circles; 1, squares; 10, triangles; 100, inverted triangles. The ATPase rates presented were calculated by subtracting the values obtained in presence of 10 μM orthovanadate. The same experimental data are presented as a Lineweaver-Burk plot on panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Valinomycin is a cation ionophore with high affinity toward K+ ions, and as expected it allowed uptake of 86Rb+ ions into the proteoliposomes. ATP hydrolysis accelerated both the rate and maximal level of valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ uptake in K+-loaded Pgp reconstituted proteoliposomes. The ATP-dependent transport, calculated as the difference between the uptake values obtained in the presence of ATP and those obtained in the presence of its non-hydrolyzable analog AMPPCP, reached a maximum after 2 min (Fig. 4A) and was dissipated after 30 min of incubation (data not shown). The ATP-dependent uptake of 86Rb+ was observed only with K+-loaded proteoliposomes, indicating that the ATP-dependent uptake relies on the dilution of the isotope with trapped K+ ions and that this transport is directed into the intravesicular volume. As expected for Pgp-mediated activity, the ATP-dependent uptake component was restricted to proteoliposomes reconstituted with a Pgp-rich fraction from EmtR1 cells and was absent from proteoliposomes reconstituted with parallel fraction from parental drug-sensitive cells AA8 (Fig. 4B). In order to discern between the ATP-dependent uptake and the ATP-independent ionophore-mediated equilibration of 86Rb+, reconstituted proteoliposomes were incubated for 3 min in a transport buffer containing valinomycin but lacking ATP. Under these conditions, 86Rb+ was allowed to reach apparent equilibration with the K+ trapped in the proteoliposomes, and the intravesicular K+ concentration reached a transient constant concentration held by its diffusion potential (Fig. 4). At this point ATP or AMPPCP was added and 86Rb+ uptake was determined (Fig. 5). The ATP-dependent component of 86Rb+ uptake was not affected by the preincubation. Thus, the ATP-dependent uptake results from an authentic active 86Rb+ uptake and not from effects on the ionophore-mediated equilibration of 86Rb+ across the proteoliposome membrane. The ATP- and valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ uptake occurred only with K+-preloaded vesicles, indicating that the 86Rb+ ions were transported into the intravesicular milieu. As shown for Pgp from rat liver and MDR cells (6.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ATP- and valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ uptake mediated by CHO Pgp was specific to ATP and did not occur with UTP, CTP, ADP, and non-hydrolyzable trinucleotides (data not shown). On the one hand, substrate transport mediated by Pgp, was measured indirectly as the ATP-driven and valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ influx. On the other hand, the ATPase activity of reconstituted Pgp from EmtR1 cells can be readily measured. Assessment of both ATPase activity and drug transport under the same assay conditions should allow estimation of the stoichiometry of drug transport to ATP hydrolysis. Determination of the stoichiometry of drug transport to ATP hydrolysis relies on a quantitative assay of the valinomycin-dependent ATPase and transport activities of Pgp under identical experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, measurement of Pgp-mediated ATPase and 86Rb+ uptake as a function of increasing valinomycin concentrations, revealed valinomycin-dependent components of both activities. However, as pointed above, Pgp exhibited high basal activity, in absence of added substrate, which masked the increase in ATPase activity required to mediate the ATP-driven and valinomycin-dependent 86Rb+ uptake. We have overcome this obstacle by using poly-L-tryptophan to suppress the basal activity of Pgp. In the presence of poly-L-tryptophan, low valinomycin concentrations mediated an increase in both ATPase activity and 86Rb+ uptake (Fig. 6B). In five independent experiments, it was determined that 0.5-0.8 86Rb+ ions were transported/ATP molecule hydrolyzed. This apparent stoichiometry of drug transport to ATP hydrolysis was determined as the ratio of the components of 86Rb+ uptake to ATP hydrolysis, measured under identical conditions, which were dependent on both ATP and valinomycin. An alternative approach to determine the ratio of Pgp-dependent ATP hydrolysis to drug transport was to use inhibitors that suppress both the ATPase and 86Rb+ uptake and thereby determine the apparent stoichiometry as the ratio of parallel reductions in 86Rb+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis. The Pgp ATPase as well as the valinomycin- and ATP-dependent 86Rb+ uptake were both eliminated by established inhibitors of Pgp such as vanadate (Fig. 7A) and oligomycin (Fig. 7B). High concentrations of poly-L-tryptophan competitively inhibited both Pgp ATPase activity and the valinomycin-dependent and ATP-driven 86Rb+ uptake (Fig. 7C). The ratio of the drug transport component that was eliminated by these different three inhibitors to the fraction of ATPase activity inhibited by these compounds was again equivalent to 0.5-0.8 mol of 86Rb+ transported/mol of ATP hydrolyzed. Pgp substrates such as doxorubicin inhibited 86Rb+ uptake, with little or no effect on Pgp ATPase activity (Fig. 7D). Presumably, this well known Pgp substrate competed with valinomycin on the Pgp pharmacophore(13.Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, the different approaches revealed an apparent near stoichiometry of Pgp-mediated ionophore molecules transported to ATP molecules hydrolyzed. Pgp catalyzes the ATP-driven efflux of various cytotoxic xenobiotics out of MDR cells. However, the hydrophobicity of the various Pgp substrates hindered efforts aimed at estimating the stoichiometry of drug transport to ATP hydrolysis. In this respect, using a highly Pgp-rich proteoliposome system, Shapiro and Ling (9.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) recently reported a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of Hoechst 33342 transported/50 ATP molecules hydrolyzed; this low stoichiometry was attributed to the rapid rebinding of this hydrophobic chromophore to the liposome membrane, thus suggesting that the actual rate of transport is much faster. Recently, we devised an assay that circumvents this obstacle of the hydrophobicity of Pgp substrates; in this assay, Pgp-reconstituted proteoliposomes displayed an ATP-dependent uptake of 86Rb+-valinomycin complex(6.Eytan G.D. Borgnia M.J. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Pgp mediated an ATP-driven 86Rb+ accumulation, whereas the ionophore was recycled. Taking advantage of this assay of hydrophilic cation accumulation, we here combined a simultaneous determination of Pgp ATPase activity and its ability to take up 86Rb+-valinomycin as reflected in the 86Rb+ accumulation in the Pgp-reconstituted proteoliposomes. Using this approach, a stoichiometry of 0.5-0.8 substrate molecules transported/ATP molecule hydrolyzed was estimated. Thus, the high specific activity of Pgp ATPase (12.5 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) along with its near stoichiometric drug transport to ATP hydrolysis resemble various ion-translocating ATPases including Na+, K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase which handle millimolar substrate concentrations. Indeed, the ATP-driven, valinomycin-dependent uptake of 86Rb+ ions was equivalent to an intravesicular concentration of 8 mM. One perplexing theme that emerges from the present study is that 1) despite the millimolar substrate translocation capability of Pgp, even when consisting 18% (this paper) or 32% (8.Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) of total plasma membrane proteins, and 2) although Pgp can surprisingly consume as much as 12% of total cellular ATP in highly MDR cells(19.Broxterman H.J.

Lankelma J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Pgp can protect highly MDR cells only against 10 μM emetine (this paper) or 30 μM colchicine(8.Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy of 3 orders of magnitude between Pgp's translocation ability combined with its strong ATPase activity versus its low efficiency in protecting cells from cytotoxic agents is highly dependent on the preferred, rapid copartition, and rapid diffusion of these hydrophobic drugs through the membrane. This is best exemplified in the case of the hydrophobic peptide ionophores valinomycin and gramicidin D. Although valinomycin proved an excellent Pgp substrate (i.e. low Km and high ATPase Vmax), Pgp was shown to confer upon highly MDR cells only a modest protection against this ionophore (see (13.Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and (21.Assaraf Y.G. Borgnia M.J. Eur. J.

Biol. 1976; 27: 1441-1450Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, in spite of the slow gramicidin D translocation and consequent inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity, Pgp proved very efficient in protecting highly MDR cells against this channel-forming ionophore(13.Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21.Assaraf Y.G. Borgnia M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is not surprising given the relatively slow transmembrane flip-flop (i.e. minutes half-time) gramicidin D monomers must undergo prior to dimerization and channel formation(23.O'Connell A.M. Koeppe II, R.E. Andersen O.S. Science. 1990; 250: 1256-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Based on the turnover number of Pgp, which was estimated to be 900 substrate molecules/min (Kcat = 15 s; see (8.Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E.

Migration of A2058 human melanoma cells to soluble (chemotaxis) and substratum-bound (haptotaxis) vitronectin, mediated by αvβ3, provided a system with which to address these questions. Both chemotaxis and haptotaxis were completely inhibited by treatment with RGD-containing peptides. Chemotaxis was abolished by a blocking antibody to αvβ3 (LM609), whereas haptotaxis was inhibited only by approximately 50%, suggesting involvement of multiple receptors and/or signaling pathways. However, blocking antibodies to αvβ5, also present on A2058 cells, did not inhibit. Pertussis toxin treatment of cells inhibited chemotaxis by >80%, but did not inhibit haptotaxis. Adhesion and spreading over vitronectin induced the phosphorylation of paxillin on tyrosine. In cells migrating over substratum-bound vitronectin, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin increased 5-fold between 45 min and 5 h. Dilutions of anti-αvβ3 that inhibited haptotaxis also inhibited phosphorylation of paxillin (by ∼50%) and modestly reduced cell spreading. In contrast, soluble vitronectin (50-100 μg/ml) did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. The data suggest that soluble vitronectin stimulates chemotaxis predominantly through a G protein-mediated pathway that is functionally linked to αvβ3.

Medium, serum, and trypsin/EDTA were from Biofluids, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Cells in logarithmic phase of growth were detached by brief exposure to 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA and allowed to recover 1 h in DMEM, 10% FBS. Cells were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (DMEM/BSA). Where indicated, cells were pretreated at room temperature with PT, antibodies, or peptides after resuspension in DMEM/BSA. Pretreatment was 2 h for PT, 45 min for antibodies, and 30 min for peptides. CTX was assayed in triplicate as described previously using 48-well microchemotaxis chambers with 8-μm pore polycarbonate Nucleopore filters(3.Aznavoorian S. Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H. Schiffmann E.

Chambers were incubated at 37°C for 4 h, after which filters were removed, fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Scientific, McGaw Park, IL), and then mounted on glass slides. After removal of non-migrated cells, cells that had migrated were quantitated with a 2202 Ultroscan laser densitometer (LKB Instruments, Gaithersburg, MD), as described previously(2.Stracke M.L.

Alternatively, where indicated, migrated cells were quantitated by light microscopy under high power field (magnification, × 500)(3.Aznavoorian S. Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Untreated cells, as well as cells from every treatment group, were tested in each experiment for their unstimulated random motility to DMEM/BSA. Results are expressed as stimulated motility, which represents the total motility response minus unstimulated random motility. HTX was assayed in triplicate using individual modified Boyden chambers, with 8-μm pore polycarbonate Nucleopore filters (13-mm diameter) as described previously(3.Aznavoorian S. Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Filters were precoated on one side with VN at 10 μg/ml, diluted in DPBS. Filters were then washed and placed in the chamber with the protein-coated side facing the lower compartment, which contained DMEM/BSA. After addition of cells, chambers were incubated at 37°C for 5 h. Filters were processed and quantitated as for CTX. For HTX, random motility (over uncoated filters) did not exceed 2-4 cells/high power field. In one set of experiments (Fig. 7), cells were set up in four large single-well chambers (volume of lower wells is 12 ml, volume of upper wells is 9 ml, and they accommodate 25 × 80-mm filters). Triton X-100 lysates of migrating cells were collected at various time points for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. At 45 min, when cells had just attached to the upper filter surface, one chamber was disassembled, and all cells on the filter were collected in lysis buffer (see below). At all subsequent time points (90 min, 3 h, and 5 h), cells on the upper filter surface were first removed, allowing the separation and collection of only the migrating cells for lysis. A2058 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes until subconfluent, then labeled for 1 h with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. After labeling, cells were incubated overnight in DMEM, 10% FBS. Cells were then lysed at 4°C in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 4 mM AEBSF, 150 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Integrin αvβ3 was immunoprecipitated from the 15,000 × g supernatant as follows; lysate was precleared with mouse IgG1 (isotype control Ab, Chemicon International Inc.), followed by anti-mouse IgG agarose beads, then incubated with anti-integrin αvβ3 (or anti-αvβ5) at 1:100 dilution overnight, with end-over-end rocking. Anti-mouse IgG agarose beads were added for an additional 1 h, after which precipitate was washed extensively and eluted by boiling in SDS-containing sample buffer. Antibody incubations and washes were done at 4°C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 7% polyacrylamide gel, which was processed for autoradiography. Approximately 12,000 cpm/lane were loaded. 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight at 4°C with VN (10 μg/ml) or gelatin (100 μg/ml), diluted in DPBS. Before addition of cells, dishes were rinsed three times with DPBS and preincubated for 15 min with DMEM/BSA at 37°C. Subconfluent cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA as for motility assays and resuspended in DMEM/BSA before plating. Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells/dish were plated. In some experiments, an equal number of cells was left in suspension for the duration of the assay. At the indicated times after plating, Triton X-100 soluble lysates were collected as follows; cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM AEBSF, 150 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. The Triton-soluble lysate (15,000 × g supernatant) was collected and stored at −80°C until use. Protein determinations were performed with the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). For Western immunoblotting, samples were electrophoresed under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) through 8-16% precast gradient gels. Proteins were then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Novex), and membranes were blocked in casein-containing buffer before incubation with antibodies. Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Corp.)/ Blots were scanned with an Agfa photoscanner, using Adobe Photoshop 3.0 to create images for figures. Bands were quantitated by densitometry using Image 1.49. Blots chosen for scanning and quantitation were only those exposures that gave chemiluminescence signals within the linear range of detection. 120-150 μg of Triton X-100 lysate was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of monoclonal Ab to paxillin, similarly to the method described above for immunoprecipitation of integrins. Soluble VN stimulated a concentration-dependent motility response of A2058 human melanoma cells, which peaked at 50-100 μg/ml VN, reaching a value ∼3.5-4 fold above unstimulated motility (Fig. 1). Typically the response remained near peak values at higher concentrations of VN. All subsequent CTX assays were done at 50 μg/ml to conserve VN, unless otherwise indicated. We also observed a strong haptotactic response of A2058 cells to substratum-bound VN, maximal at a coating concentration of 10 μg/ml (data not shown). Adhesion of αv-containing integrins to VN is mediated by the RGD sequence at the amino terminus of VN(8.Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7 (275-310)Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 27.Zhao Y. Sane D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of receptor binding to this sequence in VN-mediated motility, cells were pretreated with a pentapeptide containing the RGD sequence (GRGDS) at 500 μM prior to CTX and HTX assays. The RGD-containing peptide abolished both CTX and HTX to VN (data not shown), indicating that integrin binding to the RGD site is an absolute requirement for both types of motility. Pretreatment with the control peptide GRGES at the same concentration resulted in 20-40% inhibition. Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates the α subunit of certain classes of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. This results in the functional uncoupling of G proteins from their receptors, blocking signal transduction(28.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Since CTX of A2058 cells to laminin and type IV collagen was inhibited by treatment of cells with PT(3.Aznavoorian S. Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of PT on CTX and HTX to VN (Fig. 2). Cells were treated with PT at the indicated concentrations, then tested for motility to soluble VN (50 μg/ml) (A) and substratum-bound VN (B). As illustrated, PT treatment results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of CTX, with maximal inhibition (∼100%) at 0.5 μg/ml (Fig. 2A). This concentration of PT also completely inhibited CTX to higher concentrations of VN (100-400 μg/ml; data not shown). However, the same batch of cells migrated at or near control levels over substratum-bound VN at all PT concentrations (Fig. 2B). These results implicate a PT-sensitive G protein in transduction of the chemotactic signal through αvβ3, whereas this signal transduction pathway does not regulate VN-mediated HTX. PT at 0.5 μg/ml did not inhibit adhesion or spreading of melanoma cells on VN- or gelatin-coated dishes (data not shown). Treatment with this concentration of PT is sufficient to completely ribosylate G proteins in these cells (data not shown). We next sought to identify and quantitate VN receptors on the surface of A2058 cells which may mediate the motility responses. Flow cytometry was performed on intact cells immunostained with anti-αvβ3 and anti-αvβ5, using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) (data not shown). The VN receptor αvβ3 stained with approximately 4-fold the staining intensity of αvβ5, which indicates ∼4 times the level of surface expression. Flow cytometry on A2058 cells has also revealed the presence of the β1 subunit (data not shown), which can combine with the αv chain to form αvβ1, another VN receptor(6.Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if αvβ1 exists as a heterodimer on A2058 cells. The VN receptor αvβ3 was also identified by immunoprecipitation from [35S]methionine-labeled lysates with monoclonal Ab LM609 (Fig. 3). SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions followed by autoradiography revealed bands of approximately 160 kDa (αv chain) and 95 kDa (β3 chain) in the immunoprecipitate (lane 4). Under reducing conditions (lane 2), the αv chain migrates at ∼140 kDa and the β3 chain at ∼110 kDa. Integrin αvβ5 was not detectable by immunoprecipitation with anti-αvβ5 (P1F6) (lanes 1 and 3). Immunofluorescent staining revealed the differential distribution of αVβ3 and αVβ5 on attached and spread A2058 cells (data not shown). αvβ3 is localized to focal adhesions, which were predominant along the cell margins, whereas αVβ5 had a more diffuse, nonfocal contact distribution throughout the cell, similar to previous observations in other human tumor cell lines(19.Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Results after treatment with a variety of blocking antibodies indicate that αvβ3 is the primary receptor mediating CTX of A2058 cells to VN. The effects of anti-αvβ3 (LM609) on CTX and HTX to VN is illustrated in Fig. 4. Anti-αvβ3 inhibited CTX to VN in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), with nearly 100% inhibition of stimulated motility at 1:10,000 dilution of Ab. In the experiment illustrated, a gelatin-coated filter was used in the CTX assay; gelatin is also an adhesive ligand for αvβ3. However, stimulated CTX to VN was also inhibited by this Ab using filters coated with type IV collagen, which does not bind αvβ3 (data not shown). Isotype control Ab at a wide range of dilutions had no inhibitory effect on CTX (data not shown). Whereas anti-αvβ3 treatment of A2058 cells nearly abolished CTX to VN, the same dilutions of Ab did not inhibit CTX to type IV collagen or laminin (data not shown), confirming the involvement of distinct receptors in CTX to these matrix components. A2058 cells also express αvβ5 on their surfaces, although at lower levels. This integrin mediates migration of keratinocytes (29.Kim J.P. Zhang K. Chen J.D. Kramer R.H. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26926-26932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pancreatic carcinoma cells (30.Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) over VN-coated substrata. As expected, however, treatment of A2058 cells with blocking Abs to αvβ5 (P1F6) or to the β1 subunit (JB1a) did not inhibit stimulated CTX to VN (at 1:200-1:10,000) (data not shown). As with CTX, HTX to VN was inhibited by treatment of cells with anti-αvβ3 (Fig. 4B), and this inhibition was maximal at an antibody dilution of 1:10,000 (data not shown). Unlike CTX, inhibition of HTX by anti-αvβ3 ranged from only 40% to 60% in several experiments. To test the possibility that αvβ5 and/or a β1 integrin contributed to HTX on VN, cells were treated (at 1:1000) with the corresponding blocking Abs and assayed for migration (Fig. 4B); one aliquot of cells was treated with a combination of Abs to αvβ3 and β1, each at 1:1000, to determine if additive inhibition would be observed. However, only anti-αvβ3 significantly inhibited HTX to VN (49%). Cells treated with anti-αvβ3 plus anti-β1 were not inhibited to any additional degree relative to those treated with anti-αvβ3 alone. A range of dilutions of anti-αvβ5 and isotypic control antibody had no inhibitory effect on HTX (data not shown). Therefore, although anti-αvβ3 did not inhibit HTX as completely as it inhibited CTX, αvβ3 still appears to be the major motility-promoting receptor in HTX; the other VN receptors αvβ5 and αvβ1 do not play a direct role. We then wanted to determine if soluble and/or substratum-bound VN induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in A2058 cells, at the concentrations that induced motility. In Fig. 5A, cells were plated onto dishes coated with VN (10 μg/ml) (lane 1) or gelatin (100 μg/ml) (lane 2) and allowed to adhere for 90 min before lysates were prepared for electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Another aliquot of cells was plated on tissue culture plastic for 4 h before lysis (lane 3). The anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot (10 μg/lane) shows that relatively few proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine under these conditions, including a cluster of ∼110-130 kDa in each lane, and a broad band of ∼68 kDa in lysate of VN-adherent cells (Fig. 5A, lane 1). One of the bands in the 110-130-kDa cluster was subsequently identified as p125FAK by immunoprecipitation with anti-FAK antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-FAK (data not shown). Fig. 5A illustrates that adhesion is sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the 110-130-kDa cluster, but the 68-kDa band is detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine only in VN-adherent cells (lane 1). We suspected the 68-kDa band to be paxillin, based on its molecular mass and phosphorylation on tyrosine upon adhesion (31.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Paxillin is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to a variety of signals, all involving cytoskeletal remodeling(32.Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). From the lysate of VN-adherent cells (Fig. 5A, lane 1), we immunoprecipitated paxillin with monoclonal Ab to paxillin. In Fig. 5B, the immunoprecipitate was divided into two portions for Western immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (lanes 1-3) and anti-paxillin (lanes 4-6). In lane 1, the anti-paxillin immunoprecipitate stains prominently at 68 kDa (arrow) with anti-phosphotyrosine. In lane 2, non-immunoprecipitated lysate was run alongside for comparison. Lane 4 is immunoprecipitated paxillin, which stains with anti-paxillin; this band co-migrates with a band from the nonfractionated lysate (lane 5). (Lanes 3 and 6 are immunoprecipitates of this lysate using isotype control mAb.) These results show that A2058 cells do contain paxillin, and that paxillin is a protein phosphotyrosine of 68 kDa in VN-adherent cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin increased over time in VN-adherent cells, coincident with cell spreading (Fig. 6). To determine the time course of phosphorylation, cells were plated on VN-coated dishes, and lysates were collected after 10 min (lane 3), 20 min (lane 4), 45 min (lane 5), 90 min (lane 6), and 4 h (lane 7); for comparison, two aliquots of cells were left in suspension for 90 min (lane 1, room temperature; lane 2, 37°C). Fig. 6A shows the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot (68-kDa region) of lysates from each time point (10 μg/lane). In Fig. 6B, a duplicate blot probed with anti-paxillin illustrates that nearly equal amounts of total paxillin were loaded per lane. To quantitate and correct for slight under- or overloading of lanes relative to lane 1 (using the paxillin signal in panel B as a standard), bands were quantitated by densitometry as described under “Materials and Methods.” For each lane we obtained a ratio of anti-phosphotyrosine to anti-paxillin signals; in lanes 2-7, these ratios were maintained as each paxillin value was adjusted to that of lane 1, and each phosphotyrosine value was correspondingly adjusted. In this manner, a more accurate comparison of phosphotyrosine signals between lanes is obtained. Fig. 6C shows the normalized values for phosphotyrosine signals (PY20); numbering of lanes corresponds to Fig. 6(A and B). After 10 min on VN, cells were adherent, but remained round (photomicrograph, panel A); these lysates had no detectable phosphorylated paxillin (lane 3, Fig. 6, A and C). However, with increasing time of adhesion and spreading on VN (photomicrograph, panels B-D), tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin increased ∼7-fold until it reached a maximum at 90 min (lane 6, Fig. 6, A and C), coincident with maximal spreading (photomicrograph, panel D). At 4 h (lane 7, Fig. 6, A and C"
https://openalex.org/W2025727102,"α-Phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) is a nitrone spin trap, which has shown efficacy in animal models of oxidative stress, including stroke, aging, sepsis, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We have prepared a series of novel cyclic variants of PBN and evaluated them for radical trapping activity in vitro. Specifically, their ability to inhibit iron-induced lipid peroxidation in liposomes was assessed, as well as superoxide anion (O∸2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) trapping activity as determined biochemically and using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. All cyclic nitrones tested were much more potent as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation than was PBN. The unsubstituted cyclic variant MDL 101,002 was approximately 8-fold more potent than PBN. An analysis of the analogs of MDL 101,002 revealed a direct correlation of activity with lipophilicity. However, lipophilicity does not solely account for the difference between MDL 101,002 and PBN, inasmuch as the calculated octanol/water partition coefficient for MDL 101,002 is 1.01 as compared to 1.23 for PBN. This indicated the cyclic nitrones are inherently more effective radical traps than PBN in a membrane system. The most active compound was a dichloro analog in the seven-membered ring series (MDL 104,342), which had an IC50 of 26 μM, which was 550-fold better than that of PBN. The cyclic nitrones were shown to trap •OH with MDL 101,002 being 20-25 times more active than PBN as assessed using 2-deoxyribose and p-nitrosodimethylaniline as substrates, respectively. Trapping of •OH by MDL 101,002 was also examined by using ESR spectroscopy. When Fenton's reagent was used, the •OH adduct of MDL 101,002 yielded a six-line spectrum with hyperfine coupling constants distinct from that of PBN. Importantly, the half-life of the adduct was nearly 5 min, while that of PBN is less than 1 min at physiologic pH. MDL 101,002 also trapped the O∸2 radical to yield a six-line spectrum with coupling constants very distinct from that of the •OH adduct. In mice, the cyclic nitrones ameliorated the damaging effects of oxidative stress induced by ferrous iron injection into brain tissue. Similar protection was not afforded by the lipid peroxidation inhibitor U74006F, thus implicating radical trapping as a unique feature in the prevention of cell injury. Together, the in vivo activity, the stability of the nitroxide adducts, and the ability to distinguish between trapping of •OH and O∸2 suggest the cyclic nitrones to be ideal reagents for the study of oxidative cell injury."
https://openalex.org/W2009650905,"We examined the idea that aspartate metabolism by Lactobacillus subsp. M3 is organized as a proton-motive metabolic cycle by using reconstitution to monitor the activity of the carrier, termed AspT, expected to carry out the electrogenic exchange of precursor (aspartate) and product (alanine). Membranes of Lactobacillus subsp. M3 were extracted with 1.25% octyl glucoside in the presence of 0.4% Escherichia coli phospholipid and 20% glycerol. The extracts were then used to prepare proteoliposomes loaded with either aspartate or alanine. Aspartate-loaded proteoliposomes accumulated external [3H]aspartate by exchange with internal substrate; this homologous self-exchange (Kt = 0.4 mM) was insensitive to potassium or proton ionophores and was unaffected by the presence or absence of Na+, K+, or Mg2+. Alanine-loaded proteoliposomes also took up [3H]aspartate in a heterologous antiport reaction that was stimulated or inhibited by an inside-positive or inside-negative membrane potential, respectively. Several lines of evidence suggest that these homologous and heterologous exchange reactions were catalyzed by the same functional unit. Thus, [3H]aspartate taken up by AspT during self-exchange was released by a delayed addition of alanine. In addition, the spontaneous loss of AspT activity that occurs when a detergent extract is held at 37°C prior to reconstitution was prevented by the presence of either aspartate (KD(aspartate) = 0.3 mM) or alanine (KD(alanine) ≥ 10 mM), indicating that both substrates interact directly with AspT. These findings are consistent with operation of a proton-motive metabolic cycle during aspartate metabolism by Lactobacillus subsp. M3.

These findings are consistent with operation of a proton-motive metabolic cycle during aspartate metabolism by Lactobacillus subsp. M3. Nutrient transport by bacteria is usually thought of as consuming metabolic energy, since this step is typically driven by an ion-motive gradient (e.g. Δt;ex2html_html_special_mark_amp;mgr;H+ or Δt;ex2html_html_special_mark_amp;mgr;Na+) or by hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond (e.g. ATP or PEP)(1.Maloney P.C.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, 1987: 127-141Google Scholar). Recently, however, a new class of nutrient transport reactions has been identified, one in which substrate transport is actually used to generate rather than consume energy. The first and best understood of these reactions is found in Oxalobacter formigenes(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe that exploits the decarboxylation of oxalate to support transmembrane ion-motive gradients(5.Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch Microbiol. 1985; 141: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This cell mediates the exchange of divalent oxalate with the product of its intracellular decarboxylation, monovalent formate(6.Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a membrane transporter named OxlT(4.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one-for-one exchange of oxalate2− and formate1− polarizes the membrane (electrically negative, inside), while the decarboxylation reaction serves to generate an internal alkalinity, since a single cytosolic proton is consumed during production of formate. As a result, the metabolic sequence, oxalate entry, oxalate decarboxylation, formate exit, acts as a proton pump (3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or “proton-motive metabolic cycle” ((3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (4.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

In the same way and in other bacteria, the transport (vectorial) and decarboxylation (scalar) reactions associated with conversion of malate to lactate (8.Poolman B. Molenaar D. Smid E.J. Ubbink T.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or histidine to histamine (11.Molenaar D. Bosscher J.S. TenBrink B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2864-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to act as proton-motive metabolic cycles. Such precedents suggest a new way of interpreting the relationship between anion transport and decarboxylation reactions in microorganisms. For example, some strains of the Lactobacilli catalyze the decarboxylation of either L-aspartate ( 1H. Hayashi, T. Higuchi, and K. Abe, unpublished data.) or L-glutamate, ( 2T. Higuchi, H. Hayashi, and K. Abe, unpublished data.) with a near-stoichiometric release of the products, L-alanine or γ-aminobutyrate (and CO2), respectively 1,2. These decarboxylations support ATP synthesis in a manner consistent with the idea that processing of these anions involves a proton-motive metabolic cycle1,2 (and see below). As their central element, proton-motive metabolic cycles have a vectorial component(s) that mediates the electrogenic exchange of precursor and product. Accordingly, the specific goal of work reported here was to determine whether this transport reaction is found in Lactobacilli subsp. M3, a cell which readily converts aspartate to alanine by intracellular decarboxylation. To approach this issue, we used reconstitution of membrane protein as an analytical tool to probe for the expected exchange of aspartate and alanine in proteoliposomes. Our experiments document that membranes of Lactobacilli subsp. M3 display an electrogenic aspartate:alanine exchange of the sort required by a proton-motive metabolic cycle. This precursor:product antiport is catalyzed by a single element, termed “AspT” (for aspartate transporter), which catalyzes both the homologous self-exchange of aspartate and the heterologous antiport of aspartate and alanine. Lactobacillus subsp. M3 was grown under anaerobic conditions at 30°C in MRS broth (Difco) supplemented with 30 mML-aspartate and 5% sodium chloride. After growth to stationary phase (∼3 days), cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), and membrane vesicles were prepared by high pressure lysis in the presence of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), as described (12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); vesicles were stored at −70°C as a concentrated stock (10-20 mg/ml protein). Membrane vesicles (1-2 mg of protein) were solubilized(12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 1.25% (w/v) octylglucoside in the presence of 0.4% (w/v) acetone/ether washed Escherichia coli phospholipid, 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 4 mM MgSO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.75 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol. Control extracts were prepared in the same way, but without added protein. Reconstitution was in a final volume of 1 ml, using 400 μl of detergent extract (or control lipid extract), 130 μl of bath-sonicated liposomes (5.9 mg of E. coli phospholipid), 18 μl of 15% octylglucoside, with the balance comprised of 100 mM phosphate (pH 7) as the potassium or NMG ( 3The abbreviations used are: NMGN-methylglucamineDCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideCCCPcarbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazoneMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.) salt, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. After 20 min on ice, proteoliposomes (or control liposomes) were formed at 23°C by rapid injection into 20 ml of a loading buffer containing 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) and 1 mM dithiothreitol, along with 25-150 mM aspartate (potassium, or NMG salts, as specified). After a further 20 min, the substrate-loaded proteoliposomes (or liposomes) were recovered by centrifugations and washings(12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with resuspension in 100 mM potassium or NMG sulfate plus 100 mM potassium or NMG-phosphate (pH 7) and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The final resuspension volume was usually 300 μl, giving protein and lipid at ∼50-250 μg/ml and 13 mg/ml, respectively(12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When proteoliposomes (liposomes) were loaded with 100 mM alanine, the same procedure was followed except that the buffer for washing and resuspension was the same as the loading buffer, and the resuspension volume was reduced to 80 μl. N-methylglucamine dicyclohexylcarbodiimide carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. For assay of [3H]aspartate transport by aspartate-loaded particles, proteoliposomes were diluted 20-fold from their concentrated stock into an appropriate volume of assay buffer (resuspension buffer lacking dithiothreitol) along with other required materials. After a 1-3-min preincubation at 23°C, labeled substrate was added to a nominal concentration of 100 μM, and at the required times aliquots of 100 μl, corresponding to about 0.065 μl internal volume (12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were removed for membrane filtration (0.22-μm pore sized GSTF Millipore filters), followed by two washes with 5 ml of assay buffer (12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transport assays of alanine-loaded proteoliposomes, or those prepared at pH 8, proteoliposomes were diluted 133-fold into assay buffer containing labeled substrate.

In these experiments, a detergent extract (250-450 μg of protein/ml) was placed at 37°C, along with desired additives. To quench the reaction, a 100-μl aliquot was removed and placed in a chilled tube containing 100 μl of 20 mM potassium aspartate and other components required for reconstitution (above), using amounts scaled to a final volume of 250 μl. Bath-sonicated liposomes (1.36 mg) were added after 5 min, and the mixture was allowed to remain on ice for 20 min before adding 5 ml of a solution of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) plus 100 mM potassium aspartate to form aspartate-loaded proteoliposomes. To assess transport, duplicate 0.2-ml aliquots were then applied, under vacuum, to the center of GSTF Millipore filters (0.22-μm pore size). External aspartate was removed by two 5-ml rinses with assay buffer, and after release of the vacuum, the reaction was initiated by overlaying proteoliposomes, on the filter, with 0.3 ml of this same buffer containing 100 μM [3H]aspartate. The reaction was terminated by vacuum filtration after the exchange reaction had reached its steady state (10 min); this was followed by three quick rinses with buffer to remove residual external radioactivity. Protein was measured using a modification of method of Schaffner and Weissmann(15.Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). ATP in boiled cell extracts was determined with the firefly assay, as described by Mason et al.(16.Mason P.W. Carbone D.P. Cushman R.A. Waggoner A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L-[2,3-3H]Aspartate acid (26.3 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN Corp. Phospholipid was purified from the crude E. coli lipid provided by Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.(12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Octylglucoside was from Boehringer Mannheim. In Gram-positive anaerobes such as the Lactobacilli, the proton-coupled F1F0-ATPase hydrolyzes ATP made during fermentation of sugars or amino acids to generate a proton-motive force. As a consequence, ATP levels do not change when such cells are treated with an ATPase inhibitor (e.g. DCCD) or with proton ionophores (e.g. CCCP, or the combination of nigericin and valinomycin)(17.Pavlasova E. Harold F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 198-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Maloney P.C. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1975; 25: 285-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19.Harold F.M. van Brunt J. Science. 1977; 197: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20.Maloney P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 564-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was unexpected, therefore, that these inhibitors strongly reduced ATP synthesis associated with the decarboxylation of aspartate and production of alanine plus carbon dioxide in Lactobacillus subsp. M3 (Table 1). By contrast, this inhibitor sensitivity is understandable if aspartate decarboxylation is organized as a proton-motive metabolic cycle (3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) involving the antiport of precursor (aspartate) and product (alanine), since in that case ATP synthesis would arise from reversal of the ATPase. With this possibility in mind, we used reconstitution of membrane protein to probe for the presence of a carrier which could mediate the required antiport reaction.Table 1 Open table in a new tab To identify the putative aspartate:alanine exchange carrier, AspT, our initial focus was a study of aspartate-loaded proteoliposomes, with the expectation that AspT would display an aspartate self-exchange. For this reason, proteoliposomes were loaded with 100 mM aspartate and suspended in a sulfate-based medium to which 100 μM external [3H]aspartate was added. For these general conditions, we found substantial transport of the labeled substrate. In the experiment shown (Fig. 1), the steady state incorporation of [3H]aspartate was approximately 500 nmol/mg of protein. Assuming [3H]aspartate had been taken up uniformly by all proteoliposomes (but see below), this corresponded to a 30-fold accumulation of substrate over its concentration in the medium. Moreover, the incorporated material was readily chased by a later addition of excess unlabeled aspartate, as expected if [3H]aspartate had been taken up by an exchange reaction. And since accumulated [3H]aspartate was released by either aspartate or alanine (Fig. 1), it seemed feasible that both compounds served as substrates. No accumulation of [3H]aspartate was observed when liposomes (no protein) were tested (Fig. 1), nor did aspartate accumulate in proteoliposomes in which internal sulfate replaced aspartate (not shown in Fig. 1; see Fig. 5). In other experiments of this sort we found transport of [3H]aspartate to be unaffected by the presence of the potassium ionophore, valinomycin (1 μM), or by addition of the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide carboxymethoxyphenylhydrazone (1 μM) (data not shown). Nor was [3H]aspartate transport influenced by substitution of sodium for potassium or by the presence of Mg2+ or EDTA (each at 10 mM; data not given). Based on these observations, we concluded that membranes of Lactobacillus subsp. M3 contain a carrier capable of mediating an aspartate self-exchange, as expected of AspT, and that this reaction is an electroneutral event operating independently of coupling cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Mg2+.Figure 5:The electrogenic nature of aspartate:alanine exchange. Proteoliposomes or liposomes were loaded with 100 mM alanine plus 100 mM phosphate (pH 7) as either the NMG (▵, □, ▪;) or potassium (○) salts. To start the experiment, proteoliposomes (or liposomes) suspended at 1.9 mg of protein/ml in their respective loading buffers were diluted 133-fold into assay media containing 100 μM [3H]aspartate along with 100 mM SO4 plus 100 mM phosphate as the potassium (▵) or NMG (○, □, ▪;) salts; with one exception (▪;), 1 μM valinomycin (Val) was also present. Control liposomes and proteoliposomes were assayed using the potassium-based medium, with valinomycin. These controls included liposomes prepared with either NMG or potassium salts of alanine and proteoliposomes containing 75 mM NMG sulfate rather than 100 mM NMG alanine; because these controls gave no significant aspartate transport, they are not individually noted in the figure for reasons of clarity. Aspartate transport was determined for all combinations of potassium or NMG alanine-loaded proteoliposomes using potassium- or NMG-based assay media, with and without valinomycin; data not shown here are included in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence of an aspartate-linked antiporter was also supported by an analysis of how steady state levels of [3H]aspartate accumulation were influenced by the relative sizes of the internal and external aspartate pools. For example, [3H]aspartate incorporation increased in direct proportion to elevation of internal substrate concentration (Fig. 2A). We also addressed this issue quantitatively by experiments in which [3H]aspartate transport was monitored as the external pool was expanded by known amounts (Fig. 2B). This led to predictably increased ratios of external to internal [3H]aspartate and that relationship was used to calculate an aspartate-accessible internal mass of 5.3 ± 1.3 nmol/mg lipid (Fig. 2, legend). Given an overall internal volume of about 1 μl/mg lipid (12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the internal aspartate concentration of 100 mM, the total internal aspartate pool should be about 100 nmol/mg lipid(12.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed accessible mass (5.3 nmol/mg lipid) indicates that only a small fraction (∼5%) of proteoliposomes carried out the aspartate self-exchange reaction. This level of activity was typical of the work reported here, and for this reason, presuming a random distribution of AspT among proteoliposomes, we concluded that no single proteoliposome contained more that one functional unit of AspT. We performed two additional experiments to characterize more directly the interaction between AspT and its substrate, aspartate. In one case, we undertook a simple kinetic study, relying on samples filtered after 10 s to estimate initial velocities (Fig. 3). In that experiment, we found that the self-exchange reaction had a Michaelis constant (Kt) of 0.36 ± 0.03 mM and a maximal velocity of 0.40 ± 0.03 μmol/min/mg of protein (means ± S.E.). We also obtained a direct measurement of the dissociation constant, Kd(aspartate), by monitoring the kinetics with which aspartate stabilized solubilized AspT. When a detergent extract was placed at 37°C, reconstitution at periodic intervals showed that recoverable AspT activity decayed in an exponential fashion, with a half-life of about 10 s (0.15 min) (Fig. 4). Added substrate was clearly protective, and AspT lifetime was increased roughly 75-fold by the presence of 20 mM substrate (half-life of 11 min; Fig. 4, legend). This stabilization is presumed to reflect the binding of substrate by AspT, with generation of liganded complex more resistant to denaturation, as noted for OxlT (14.Maloney P.C. Anantharam V. Allison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10531-10536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Provided that liganded AspT is very much more stable than the unliganded carrier, a realistic view given the observed response to excess aspartate (Fig. 4), the stabilization achieved by substrate can be analyzed quantitatively to derive the dissociation constant of the AspT-aspartate complex(14.Maloney P.C. Anantharam V. Allison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10531-10536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In such cases, the -fold increase in AspT lifetime (R) is related to Kd(aspartate) by the following expression, where (S) represents the aspartate concentration used for stabilization. For the aspartate levels tested here (2.5-20 mM), this relationship suggests a Kd(aspartate) of 0.3 ± 0.02 mM (Fig. 4, legend). Intact cells of Lactobacillus subsp. M3 convert aspartate to alanine plus CO2, and if this reflects operation of a proton-motive metabolic cycle, it seemed possible that AspT would carry out the heterologous exchange of aspartate and alanine. This was implied by the finding that substrate taken up during aspartate self-exchange was released by added aspartate or alanine (Fig. 1). Since conversion of aspartate to alanine is very nearly stoichiometric in Lactobacillus subsp. M3,1 one further expects the aspartate:alanine exchange ratio to be a one-for-one antiport, and for that case one anticipates that the reaction will be electrogenic, since near physiological pH (pH 7) the net charge on aspartate is −1 (pK1(COOH) = 2.09, pK2(NH3+) = 9.82, pK3(COOH) = 3.86), while that on alanine is 0 (pK1(COOH) = 2.34, pK2(NH3+) = 9.69). This view was examined in studies of aspartate transport by alanine-loaded proteoliposomes, using valinomycin along with external or internal potassium to generate a membrane potential that should accelerate or retard such an electrogenic reaction. In such experiments (Fig. 5), control proteoliposomes were prepared and assayed using NMG as the internal and external cation. These controls, whose behavior was largely unaffected by valinomycin, took up [3H]aspartate at an initial rate of about 2.2-2.8 nmol/15 s/mg of protein (Fig. 5; Table 2). Note, however, that when proteoliposomes were made with internal potassium, so that an internally negative potential was established in the presence of valinomycin, there was profound inhibition of [3H]aspartate transport (from 2.7 to 0.1 nmol/15 s/mg of protein), while in the reciprocal trial, when an internally positive potential was present, there was a stimulation of [3H]aspartate movement (from 7.9 to 15.1 nmol/15 s). In addition, the presence of external, but not internal, potassium appeared to stimulate the initial phases of aspartate transport (from 2.7 to 7.9 nmol/15 s; Table 2), although the reasons for this are unclear. (A similar finding was made during reconstitution of the oxalate:formate heterologous exchange from O. formigenes(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but potassium dependence was not evident for the purified OxlT protein(4.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) It seems unlikely that aspartate moved by a separate (electrogenic) pathway, independent of alanine, since [3H]aspartate did not accumulate within proteoliposomes loaded with sulfate instead of alanine (Fig. 5), despite the favorable electrical gradient (positive inside). Neither did the positive effect of membrane potential appear secondary to development of a pH gradient (alkaline inside), since lowering internal buffering power 4-fold had no effect on the 2-fold enhancement found for [3H]aspartate transport (not shown). We do note that while an unfavorable membrane potential gave strong inhibition of [3H]aspartate transport, the stimulation by a favorable electric gradient was modest (Table 2). Such an asymmetry might occur if the AspT carrier operates near saturation under our usual conditions. Indeed, results consistent with this idea were provided in an additional experiment that compared results obtained when internal alanine was reduced from 100 to 30 mM. In that case, basal and stimulated rates for proteoliposomes loaded with 100 mM alanine were comparable with those found earlier (12 ± 0.7 and 23 ± 1.3 nmol/15 s), as was the observed 1.9-fold rate stimulation by membrane potential. When internal alanine was reduced to 30 mM, we recorded a lower basal rate of [3H]aspartate transport, but the same stimulated value (5.6 ± 0.7 versus 21 ± 2.1 nmol/15 s), and a correspondingly increased (3.7-fold) stimulation by membrane potential. These supplemental experiments, together with those described earlier (Fig. 5 and Table 2), strongly suggest that aspartate:alanine antiport is an electrogenic reaction in which net negative charge moves in parallel with aspartate.Table 2 Open table in a new tab Having documented that AspT accepts both aspartate and alanine, our concluding work centered on identification of other possible substrates, using two different approaches. In one kind of experiment, we evaluated putative substrates by asking whether [3H]aspartate was taken up by substrate-loaded proteoliposomes (e.g.Fig. 5). Thus, proteoliposomes were loaded with the NMG salts of alanine, β-alanine, glycine, or glutamate (100 mM in each case) and then suspended in the usual assay buffer (i.e. K2SO4 plus potassium phosphate) in the presence of 1 μM valinomycin and 100 μM [3H]aspartate. In each case, proteoliposomes accumulated labeled [3H]aspartate, and in each case a later addition of unlabeled aspartate evoked a rapid discharge of the internalized material (not shown). A comparison of initial velocities of [3H]aspartate transport indicated an order of preference as alanine > glycine > β-alanine ≫ glutamate (rates in the ratios of 1.0, 0.67, 0.37, and 0.04, respectively). By contrast, [3H]aspartate accumulation was not found for proteoliposomes prepared with internal acetate, butyrate, formate, γ-aminobutyric acid, malonate, oxalate, propionate, or pyruvate (each at 100 mM); nor did the addition of these compounds at 30 mM affect the aspartate self-exchange reaction (not shown). From this work, we concluded that along with aspartate and alanine, β-alanine, glycine, and glutamate might serve as substrates for AspT, and that AspT accepts substrates with an amino function in the α or β, but not γ position. In further work we confirmed that these alternate substrates interacted directly with AspT by showing that their presence stabilized the solubilized protein (experiments similar to that of Fig. 4). Thus, when added at 20 mM, alanine, glycine, and β-alanine gave an increase in AspT lifetime comparable with the effect of about 0.65 mM aspartate. This implies that these substrates have a relatively low affinity for AspT (cf.) and places their Kd values at ≥10 mM). In similar trials, glutamate gave some slight protection, which was not quantitated, while γ-aminobutyric acid did not. In Lactobacillus subsp. M3, the inhibitor sensitivity of ATP synthesis associated with aspartate metabolism suggests operation of a proton-motive metabolic cycle (Table 1) involving the exchange of the precursor, aspartate, and its decarboxylation product, alanine. To test this idea we used reconstitution to characterize [3H]aspartate transport in this cell and searched for the two reactions likely to characterize the hypothetical antiporter, AspT: the exchange of aspartate with itself in aspartate-loaded proteoliposomes and the heterologous exchange of aspartate and alanine, as tested in alanine-loaded proteoliposomes. Both reactions were demonstrable (e.g.Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:) for conditions in which only a small fraction (∼5%) of the proteoliposomal population contained an exchange carrier. And since [3H]aspartate taken up by aspartate- or alanine-loaded particles was released by adding an excess of either substrate (e.g.Fig. 1), we conclude a single exchange carrier, AspT, carries out both homologous and heterologous antiport reactions. Equally important, by examining the effect of imposed electrical potential on the heterologous exchange (Fig. 5), it could be shown that negative charge moves in the same direction as aspartate. Given the relevant pK values of the carboxyl and amino groups on these substrates (see above), the heterologous exchange catalyzed by AspT likely involves movement of aspartate1− against alanine0; by extension, the aspartate self-exchange is probably based on movements of aspartate1−. The diagram of Fig. 6 summarizes the proposed proton-motive cycle in Lactobacillus subsp. M3 and in other cells that use decarboxylation to convert aspartate into alanine and CO2. In this model, entry of negatively charged aspartate is followed by its intracellular decarboxylation in a reaction that consumes a single cytosolic proton. The products of this decarboxylation, CO2 and alanine, are assumed to leave the cell by different routes. Owing to its small size and high lipid solubility, we presume that CO2 moves outward by passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer. Alanine, however, with its more limited capacity for passive diffusion, requires a specific efflux pathway, and this is provided by AspT itself. In the steady state, then, the result would be a proton-motive cycle in which the vectorial component (AspT) catalyzes import of a single negative charge, while the scalar reaction (decarboxylation) ensures the stoichiometric disappearance of a single internal proton. This association of vectorial and scalar elements resembles that described earlier for O. formigenes(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the biochemical nature of the individual proteins differs considerably in the two organisms. Thus, the antiporters, OxlT and AspT, are distinguished by both kinetic behavior and substrate specificity(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the decarboxylation reactions differ in their use of cofactor, coenzyme A in O. formigenes(6.Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but pyridoxal 5′-phosphate in L. subsp. M3.1 Our experiments indicate this thermodynamic proton pump (Fig. 6) will characterize the steady state during aspartate metabolism by Lactobacillus subsp. M3. On the other hand, the discrepancy between the affinity of AspT for aspartate and alanine (0.3 mM and ≥10 mM, respectively) suggests a proton-motive cycle may not come into play until internal alanine rises to an appropriately high value. Therefore, in the pre-steady state, we suggest that AspT mediates the electroneutral exchange of aspartate with hydroxyl ion, or the equivalent, H+/aspartate symport, ( 4The thermodynamically equivalent hydroxyl antiport and proton symport reactions cannot be distinguished at this stage. If one views AspT as catalyzing H+/aspartate1− symport, the efflux of alanine0 would reverse this reaction, so that H+ itself is driven outward.) thereby ensuring continued influx of aspartate until decarboxylation expands the alanine pool to a suitable size. In this way, AspT could also provide aspartate as a substrate for conventional metabolic pathways or for biosynthetic purposes. Analysis of anion transport and exchange in O. formigenes provided the first example of a proton-motive metabolic cycle(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Promiscuous editing was restricted to cytidines 5′ of the mooring sequence and only occurred on RNAs that had been edited at the wild type site. Moreover, RNAs with mutant editing motifs supported high efficiency but low fidelity editing in the presence of high levels of APOBEC-1.

In these cell lines, cytidines in addition to the one at the wild type site were edited. The occurrence and efficiency of this “promiscuous” editing increased with increasing expression of APOBEC-1. Promiscuous editing was restricted to cytidines 5′ of the mooring sequence and only occurred on RNAs that had been edited at the wild type site. Moreover, RNAs with mutant editing motifs supported high efficiency but low fidelity editing in the presence of high levels of APOBEC-1. This study demonstrates that overexpression of APOBEC-1 can increase the efficiency of site-specific editing but can also result in promiscuous editing."

INTRODUCTIONProton translocating F1F0 ATPases (also ATP synthases) are found in the membranes of bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, where they function in oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation to couple a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient to ATP synthesis. These complex enzymes are reversible and can use ATP hydrolysis to establish a proton gradient for subsequent use in substrate and ion transport processes (reviewed in Cross(1988), Senior (1990), and Boyer(1993)).As the name implies, F1F0 ATPases are made up of two parts, an extrinsic F1 part that contains the catalytic sites and a membrane-intrinsic F0 part that contains the proton channel. Cryo-electron microscopy shows these two parts separated by a stalk of 40-45 Å in length (Gogol et al., 1987; Lücken et al., 1990). In the bacterium Escherichia coli, the F1 part (ECF1) is made up of five different subunits (α, β, γ, δ, and ε) in the molar ratio 3:3:1:1:1. The F0 part contains three different subunits (a, b, and c) in the ratio 1:2:9-12 (Senior, 1990; Fillingame, 1992).The structure of the F1 part in the enzyme from bovine mitochondria has been obtained recently to 2.8 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (Abrahams et al., 1994). This shows three α and three β subunits arranged in a hexagon, with the γ subunit extending the length of the cavity within the hexagon, projecting from one end of the structure into an extension that is part of the stalk. The δ subunit of MF1, which is the equivalent of the ε subunit in bacterial and chloroplast enzymes, is also in the stalk but, in the crystal form studied, is probably disordered and not resolved.There is now considerable evidence that the γ and ε subunits play an important role in coupling catalytic site events with proton translocation (e.g. Gogol et al., 1990; Nakamoto et al., 1993; Abrahams et al., 1994; Capaldi et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994) and that this coupling involves conformational changes and, probably, translocations of one or both subunits (Aggeler et al., 1992, 1993; Turina and Capaldi, 1994a, 1994b; Wilkens and Capaldi, 1994). It is important, therefore, to obtain the detailed structures of, and interaction sites between, these two subunits.We have recently determined the structure of the ε subunit in solution by NMR spectroscopy (Wilkens et al., 1995). Here, we describe experiments that identify the γ subunit binding site on the ε subunit, and that locate regions of the γ subunit involved in the ε subunit binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzyme PreparationsMutants εS10C, εH38C, and εS108C have been described previously (Aggeler et al., 1992; Skakoon and Dunn, 1993; Aggeler et al., 1995a). the mutation εM138C was created in the unc operon-containing plasmid, pRA100 (Aggeler et al., 1992), for isolation of ECF1 and ECF1F0. Mutations T43C and S65C were introduced into the uncC gene on plasmid pEX2 (Skakoon and Dunn, 1993) for overexpression and isolation of the altered ε. Pure ε subunit was isolated as described by Patel et al.(1990). ECF1 depleted of δ and ε subunits (ECF1∗) was prepared by one passage through an anti-ε subunit monoclonal antibody affinity column according to Dunn (1986) but in a buffer containing 0.2% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide, followed by one passage through a Sephacryl S200 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.) column to remove N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide. Trypsin-treated ECF1 was prepared as described by Tang et al.(1994), with a trypsin digestion time of 1 h for pH 7.0 samples and 4 h for pH 8.0 samples, respectively, followed by one Sephacryl S200 sizing column to separate proteolytically treated ECF1 from other components. Mutants γS8C, γT106C, and γV286C are described by Aggeler and Capaldi(1992). ECF1 isolated from these mutants was labeled with CM ( 1The abbreviations used are: CMN-[4-[7-(diethylamino)-4-methyl]coumarin-3-yl]maleimideNEMN-ethylmaleimideFMfluoroscein maleimideTFPAM3tetrafluorophenylazide maleimideMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidmAbmonoclonal antibody.) or NEM as described by Tang et al.(1994) before being treated with trypsin in MOPS buffer (50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol), plus additional 5 mM ATP at room temperature for 1 h. The monoclonal antibodies used in this study were prepared and characterized as described by Aggeler et al.(1990).Titration of ECF1 Preparations with ε SubunitECF1∗ or trypsin-treated enzyme for the mutant γT106C at 4-5 μg were pre-incubated with specified amounts of pure ε subunit or maleimide-modified ε subunit containing the mutation S10C in MOPS buffer containing additional ATP (5 mM) and Mg2+ (5.5 mM). Samples were analyzed for ATPase activity at 37°C using an ATP regenerating system (Aggeler et al., 1990).Cross-linking ExperimentsECF1 isolated from mutants εS10C and εM138C was cross-linked with 200 μM TFPAM3 under different nucleotide conditions, essentially as described by Aggeler et al.(1992). Cross-linking with mutant ε subunits εH38C, εT43C, and εS65C was conducted by first reacting the isolated subunit with TFPAM3 in the dark, removing excess label by passage through one Sephadex G25 centrifuge column, binding of the subunit to trypsin-treated ECF1 in MOPS buffer with 5 mM ATP for 0.5 h at room temperature, and then photolysis of the sample for 2 h. Samples were analyzed for cross-linking by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the subunits involved in cross-linked products were identified by immunoblotting as described before (Aggeler et al., 1992).Labeling StudiesPurified ε subunit from the mutant εS10C (4 mg/ml) was reacted with 1 mM NEM or FM at room temperature for 30 min before 20 mM cysteine was added, and the labeled protein was isolated by a single passage through a Sephadex G25 centrifuge column.Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation ExperimentsECF1 treated with trypsin at pH 7.0 or pH 8.0 as described by Tang et al.(1994) was incubated with 10-fold excess of pure wild-type ε subunit in 200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mM ATP, 5 mM Pi, 5 mM Mg2+ at room temperature for 0.5 h. Samples were applied onto a 10-40% sucrose step gradient in the same buffer and run at 4°C for 18 h in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and assayed for ATPase activity. The fractions containing ATPase activity were pooled, and sodium deoxycholate (0.3%) and trichloracetic acid (8%) were added to precipitate the protein. Immunoblotting following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the protein.Mapping of Cross-linking SitesECF1 from the mutant εS10C that had been cross-linked by TFPAM3 was incubated with trypsin in MOPS buffer plus 5 mM ATP at room temperature for 1 h, and trypsin digestion was stopped by addition of freshly made phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (4 mM). The digestion products were loaded on a 10-18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis to separate the truncated γ-ε cross-linked product from other polypeptides. The 19,000-dalton band was excised and electroeluted from the gel using an ISCO electrophoretic concentrator (Isco, Inc.). The cross-linked product was purified further by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Brownlee Aquapore RP-300 (C18, 2.1 × 3.0 mm) column on an Applied Biosystems model 130A. Mobile phase A contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, while mobile phase B had 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and 70% acetonitrile. The gradient of mobile phase B was set to 0-35% in the first 35 min and then 35-45% for 20 min before 45-75% in the last 15 min. Peak fractions were detected at 200 nm. The γ-ε cross-linked product appeared at 58 min and was concentrated with a SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant) before addition of an equal volume of a buffer containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.1), 10% acetonitrile, and 1 mM CaCl2. Trypsin (0.6 μg) was added to complete digestion at 37°C overnight. Tryptic fragments were isolated by using the same reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography system and conditions as mentioned above. Each fragment was identified by sequencing the first four N-terminal amino acids. The fragment containing the N terminus Ala-Met-Thr-Tyr was analyzed further. Peptide sequencing was performed on a protein-sequenator (Applied Biosystems model 470A) with a phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems model 120A).Other MethodsProtein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay from Pierce. Coomassie Brilliant Blue R staining of gels was carried out as described by Downer et al. (1976).RESULTSA number of mutants were used in the present study. Mutants εS10C (Aggeler et al., 1992), εH38C (Skakoon and Dunn, 1993), εS108C (Aggeler et al., 1992), and εM138C (this study) were created in the unc operon containing plasmid pRA100 (Aggeler et al., 1992). These mutants each showed wild-type growth on limiting glucose. Mutants T43C and S65C were created in the plasmid pEX2 containing the uncC, i.e. ε subunit, gene (Skakoon and Dunn, 1993). The inhibitory effect of the ε subunit when bound to isolated ECF1 (Sternweis and Smith, 1980) was used as a convenient measure of the binding of the ε subunit to the core complex (α3β3γ). Table 1 summarizes the activity effects of the various ε subunit mutations. It includes data for ECF1 isolated from strains, in which the mutation was in the unc operon, and data from experiments in which wild-type ECF1 has been depleted of endogenous ε subunit and then reconstituted with an excess of the mutant ε subunit. The ATPase activity of wild-type ECF1 was 10 ± 0.5 units/mg (μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of enzyme), under our assay conditions at pH 7.5, with 2 mM ATP and 5 mM Mg2+. The activities of ECF1 isolated from the mutants εH38C and εS108C were very similar to that of wild-type, while that of enzyme from mutants εS10C and εM138C were around 4- and 2-fold higher than the wild-type, respectively. The ATPase activity of δ and ε-free ECF1 was 51 ± 3 units/mg, an activation of around 5-fold, which could be reduced to a basal of around 7 units/mg by addition of excess wild-type ε subunit. Addition of purified ε subunit carrying the H38C or S108C mutations had similar effects to the addition of wild-type subunits. In all cases, excess of the ε subunit inhibited activity below that of isolated ECF1, suggesting that there is some loss of ε subunit during isolation of the intact ECF1 complex. Rebinding of εS10C gave a minimal activity of 13 units/mg. Addition of a 9-fold excess of ε subunit with the mutation T43C also failed to inhibit the core ECF1 complex (α3β3γ) to levels found using wild-type, consistent with the mutant having a reduced affinity for the core complex. Addition of mutant εS65C gave a higher inhibition, giving a final ATPase activity that was only 70% of wild-type enzyme. The activity data, therefore, indicate that mutations S10C and T43C reduce, while the mutation S65C increases, the inhibitory effect of the ε subunit on the core ECF1 complex.Table 1 Open table in a new tab The ε mutants S10C and T43C were examined further in experiments in which the introduced Cys was reacted with various maleimides, and the effect of this modification on activity was monitored. Fig. 1 shows the concentration dependence of the inhibition of ATPase activity of the mutant εS10C before and after modification with different maleimides. It can be seen that both the concentration for half-maximal inhibition and the absolute extent of inhibition of this mutant were altered significantly by NEM and dramatically by modification with FM. Modification of the mutant T43C with FM had a much smaller, although significant, effect on the binding affinity and maximal inhibition (results not shown). These results indicate that the regions of the enzyme around residue 10 and, to a lesser extent, around residue 43 are important for interaction of the ε subunit with the core ECF1 and the resulting inhibition of enzymatic activity.Figure 1:Effect of chemical modification of the subunit from the mutant εS10C subunit on its inhibitory function. Filled circles, εS10C labeled with FM; open squares, εS10C labeled with NEM; open triangles, unlabeled εS10C; open circles, wild-type ε subunit as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cross-linking of the Mutant ε Subunit in the ECF1 ComplexPrevious studies have shown that the ε subunit can be cross-linked to the γ subunit by reaction of the Cys introduced at positions 10 or 38, with the maleimide group of the photoaffinity reagent, TFPAM, and subsequent UV photolysis to activate the tetrafluorophenylazide (TFPA) group to a nitrene (Aggeler et al., 1992, 1995b). Using the same approach, the ε subunit in the mutant εS108C was found to cross-link to an α subunit (Aggeler et al., 1992). Fig. 2 shows a cross-linking experiment involving ECF1 from the mutant εM138C. Reaction of the mutant with TFPAM3 generated one major cross-linked product of Mr approximately 75,000, which monoclonal antibody blots (not shown) revealed to be a cross-linked product between the mutant ε subunit and a β subunit. As shown in Fig. 2, the yield of this cross-linked product was nucleotide dependent, highest with ADP in catalytic sites and low with ATP + EDTA (or AMP•PNP + Mg2+) bound.Figure 2:Cross-linking between the β and ε subunits in ECF1 from the mutant εM138C. ECF1 from the mutant εM138C was labeled with photoreactive maleimide TFPAM3 at room temperature for 1 h. After removal of the excess label by one centrifuge column, ATP (5 mM) or ATP (5 mM) + Mg2+ (5.5 mM) was added to the sample and incubated for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by 10-18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

A cross-linked product between the ε and γ subunits was observed in ECF1 containing the T43C mutation (see below). No cross-link was observed with the S65C mutant.Localization of the Sites of Cross-linking from Residue 10 of ε in the γ SubunitThe site(s) of TFPAM cross-linking from Cys-10 in the mutant εS10C to the γ subunit was determined by peptide mapping and protein sequencing. The cross-link was formed as described previously in ECF1 (Aggeler et al., 1992) and then the enzyme treated with trypsin (1:25) for 1 h at room temperature. Trypsin cleavage under these conditions has been found to generate two fragments of the γ subunit, labeled as γA and γD (Tang et al., 1994). The protease treatment of the TFPAM-treated ECF1 from mutant εS10C (Fig. 3A) gives these same products by cleavage of non-cross-linked γ subunit and, in addition, generated a product of Mr approximately 19,000, which reacted with mAbs to the C-terminal part of the γ subunit (Fig. 3B), tentatively identifying it as a cross-linked product of the N terminus of ε (via Cys-10) and the γD fragment (residues 202-286) of the γ subunit.Figure 3:Cross-linking and trypsin digestion of ECF1 from the mutant εS10C. ECF1 from the mutant εS10C was cross-linked by TFPAM3 and treated with trypsin for 1 h. After stopping the trypsin digestion with 4 mM freshly prepared phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, samples were analyzed by 10-18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (panel A), and the presence of a truncated γ-ε cross-linked product was confirmed by immunoblotting (panel B). Panel A, lane 1, photolyzed; lane 2, photolyzed + trypsin; lane 3, unphotolyzed + trypsin. Panel B, Western blot of the sample of photolyzed + trypsin was incubated with anti-γIII mAb (lane 1) and anti-εI mAb (lane 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The approximate Mr 19,000 band was excised from polyacrylamide gels, protein was collected by electroelution, purified by HPLC, and then digested further with trypsin. The small fragments, so generated, were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography, and the peaks were resolved and then analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. One peak contained a peptide of ε containing Cys-10, present in equimolar amounts with a fragment of the γ subunit identified by its sequence as including residues 222-242.As shown in Fig. 4, the sequence of the ε fragment continued beyond Cys-10, as expected, because the cross-link involves the side chain of the Cys, and Edman degradation is not prevented. In contrast, sequencing of the γ fragment stopped abruptly before tyrosine 228, consistent with cross-linking via the tetrafluorophenylazide into the backbone of the polypeptide between residues 227 and 228. We have seen a similar insertion of TFPAM into the backbone of the β subunit next to a tryptophan residue in experiments to identify the interaction site between γ and β (Aggeler et al., 1993). It appears that the TFPA moiety tends to stack against aromatic residues, such as tyrosines and tryptophans, in an orientation that causes insertion of the reactive nitrene into the backbone.Figure 4:Sequencing to determine the site of cross-linking from εS10C to the γ subunit. Complete trypsin digestion of the truncated γ-ε cross-linked product generated a tryptic fragment containing the N-terminal sequence of the ε subunit, i.e. AMTY. Further Edman degradation of this tryptic fragment allowed identification of two sequences, one the N-terminal amino acid sequence of ε (upper plot) and the second identified as the sequence of the γ subunit beginning at residue γ222.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the Sites of Cross-linking from Residues 38 and 43 of ε into the γ SubunitAttempts to use the same general approach described above for εS10C to identify interaction sites on γ from the Cys at residue 38 or 43 of the ε subunit failed because of the low yield of cross-linking observed with these mutations, i.e. 10-20% compared with 50% for the εS10C mutant. Instead, the location of the cross-linking in these mutants was assessed by tagging different parts of the γ subunit for identification after the covalent linkage with the ε subunit.An experiment involving the mutant εH38C is shown in Fig. 5. Isolated ε subunit containing the mutation H38C was reacted with TFPAM3 in the dark, and then the modified ε subunit reacted with ECF1 that had been treated with trypsin to remove endogenous δ and ε subunits and at the same time cleave γ to γA and γD. Two forms of ECF1 were used, one containing the mutation γS8C, the other γV286C (Aggeler and Capaldi, 1992). These sites were labeled with CM to identify the N-terminal γA fragment or C-terminal γD fragment on gels. As shown in Fig. 5, cross-linking from the Cys at 38 to the γ subunit with TFPAM3 gave a product of approximate Mr 22,000, which contained Cys-286 but not Cys-8 of the γ subunit and is, therefore, a covalent product of the ε subunit at position 38 with the C-terminal region 202-286 of γ.Figure 5:Localization of the site of TFPAM3 cross-linking between εH38C and the γ subunit. Pure εH38C subunit, labeled with TFPAM3 in the dark, was added to trypsin-treated and CM-labeled ECF1 from the mutants γS8C and γV286C. After photolysis, the samples were analyzed by 10-18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was later visualized on a UV light box. Lanes 1 and 2, cross-linking using ECF1 from the mutant γV286C; lanes 3 and 4, cross-linking using ECF1 from the mutant γS8C.

These show cross-linking of the ε fragment to the same C-terminal part of the γ subunit (results not shown).Binding Sites for the ε Subunit on the γ Subunit from Protease Digestion StudiesAs described above, trypsin digestion of ECF1 at pH 7.0 leads to generation of two fragments, γA and γD. Trypsin cleavage is more efficient at pH 8.0 when the γ subunit yields three fragments, γC involving residues 1 to approximately 70, γB from residues 71 to about 202, and γE, residues 212-286 (Tang et al., 1994). The fragment, or fragments, that includes 11 residues between 202 and 211 is not resolved on gels. Trypsin cleavage at pH 7.0 or 8.0 activates the ECF1 complex to the same level by removing the ε subunit (final activity of about 50 unit/mg, cf. 10 units/mg for untreated enzyme). Addition of a 6-fold excess of pure ε was found to fully inhibit the activity of ECF1 treated with trypsin at pH 7.0 (i.e. the activity was reduced to less than 10 units/mg). However, there was no inhibition of sample that had been treated with the protease at pH 8.0. The inability of enzyme cleaved by trypsin at pH 8.0 to be inhibited by isolated ε subunit resulted from its low affinity for the ε subunit, as shown by sedimentation studies in Fig. 6. Taken together, these data indicate that the cleavage of γ at residue 70 and/or cleavage of the subunit at 212 with probable removal of residues 202-211 alters ε binding to ECF1.Figure 6:Sucrose gradient centrifugation to measure the binding of ε subunit to trypsin-treated ECF1. ECF1 that had been treated with trypsin at pH 7.0 or 8.0 was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of pure wild-type ε subunit, and the mixtures were applied on a 10-40% sucrose step gradient. Samples from the gradient were concentrated and then loaded onto a 10-18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western blot was later analyzed with anti-εI mAb. Lane 1, pure ε subunit (applied on the gel as control); lane 2, ECF1 treated with trypsin at pH 8.0; lanes 3 and 4, ECF1 (pH 8.0) +ε; lane 5, ECF1, treated with trypsin at pH 7.0 +ε.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chemical Labeling of the Mutant γT106C Places This Residue in the γ Subunit Binding RegionInsertion of a Cys for Thr at position 106 of the γ subunit has no effect on the activity of ECF1. This introduced Cys residue could be reacted with NEM without affecting the binding of, or the inhibition by, the ε subunit added to ε-free ECF1 from the mutant (γT106C). However, as shown in Fig. 7, reaction of the Cys at position 106 with the more bulky maleimide, CM, altered both the binding, as judged by the half-maximum concentration of ε for inhibition, and the absolute level of inhibition, obtained on binding wild-type ε subunit.Figure 7:Effects of chemical modification of a Cys at position 106 of the γ subunit on ε subunit inhibition. ECF1 from the mutant γT106C modified with NEM or CM was digested with trypsin to remove the ε subunit. Purified ε subunit (wild type) was added at different molar ratios with respect to ECF1, and the ATPase activity was measured. The filled circles show γT106C labeled with CM; the open squares are for γT106C labeled with NEM; the open circles are for unmodified γT106C, while the open triangles show wild-type ECF1, with all three experiments fitted to a single rate (dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONStudies presented here focus on the interaction faces of the ε and the γ subunits for each other. The results are summarized in Fig. 8, which shows the recently obtained structure of the N-terminal domain of the ε subunit involving residues 1-86 in part A (Wilkens et al., 1995) and the predicted folding pattern of the γ subunit in part B. Genetic studies have predicted that the ε subunit is a 2-domain protein (Kuki et al., 1988), and this is evident in the NMR structure determination of the isolated ε subunit in solution. Residues 1-86 form a 10-stranded β barrel, or sandwich, while the C-terminal 48 residues are arranged as an α-helix-loop-α-helix structure. In solution, the helix-loop-helix domain binds back on the β barrel at one end.Figure 8:Structural models of the γ and the ε subunits from ECF1.

The shaded spheres are side chains of the residues 15, 9, 79, 77, 68, and 42 that provide a hydrophobic patch on the side of ε that binds the γ subunit. B, hypothetical secondary structure of the γ subunit based on 1) the secondary structure prediction methods of Chou and Fasman(1978) and Garnier et al.(1978), 2) the crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase; and 3) our previous trypsin digestion studies (Tang et al., 1994) along with chemical modification and cross-linking studies reported here. Column, α helix; arrow, β sheet; line, β turn or undefined region. The residue number at the ends of the α helix/β sheet are labeled, and the trypsin cleavage sites are identified along with residue Thr-106.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ε subunit interacts with the α and β subunits of the F1 part through the C-terminal domain, as indicated by cross-linking from Ser-108 to Glu-381 in the DELSEED region of the β subunit by 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (Dallmann et al., 1992), by disulfide bond formation from a Cys at position 108 of ε to a Cys in place of Glu-381 in β (Aggeler et al., 1995b), and by disulfide bond formation between Cys at 108 of ε and a Cys at position 411 in the α subunit (this is the equivalent residue to Glu-381 of β). ( 2R. Aggeler and R. A. Capaldi, manuscript in preparation.) Finally, as shown here, there is cross-linking of the ε subunit to a β subunit by TFPAM3 from a Cys replacing Met-138 at the C terminus of ε.In addition to interacting with α and β subunits, the ε subunit is now known to interact with the c subunits of the F0 (Zhang et al., 1994, 1995; Watts et al., 1995), and this linkage is via the opposite end of the β sheet sandwich from that which binds the helix-loop-helix domain (Fig. 8A).The ε subunit also binds to the γ subunit in ECF1 (Dunn, 1986; Aggeler et al., 1992; Skakoon and Dunn, 1993). The homologous subunit in chloroplasts (ε) also binds to the γ subunit in CF1 (Suss, 1986; Soteropoulos et al., 1994). The results presented here identify Ser-10, His-38, and Thr-43 as close to, or involved in, this reaction based on mutagenesis to Cys and then cross-linking from these sites and/or by chemical modification of the introduced Cys residue and consequent steric effects on ε binding. These three residues are on one face of the β barrel and, as shown in Fig. 8, are close to a patch of hydrophobic residues, which may play a key role in the binding to the γ subunit.The cross-linking results presented here indicate a role of residues between 202 and around 240 in ε subunit binding. TFPAM cross-linking from the Cys-10 of ε is with a tyrosine at residue 228 of the γ subunit. Cross-linking from Cys-38 or Cys-43 in the mutants εH38C and εT43C is within the region of γ from 202 to 286. The C terminus from residues 222-286 is organized as a long α helix that, from around residue 240 to the very C terminus, is intercalated within the cavity formed by the hexagonally arranged α and β subunits (Abrahams et al., 1994). Our data indicate that the ε subunit binds at, or close to, this α helix as it extends from the α3β3 barrel through the stalk region and makes contact with the c subunits of the F0 part somewhere between residues 202 and 229 (Watts et al., 1995).The protease digestion data focus attention on the region of γ around residue 70, as well as on the region between residues 202 and 212 in binding the ε subunit. Residue 70 is in the epitope for a monoclonal antibody to the γ subunit, described by Dunn and colleagues, which reacts with ECF1 only when the ε subunit is first removed (Skakoon and Dunn, 1993). Residues 202-212 are close to the region of the γ subunit in which there is an insertion in the γ subunit of chloroplasts that contains two Cys residues, which regulate CF1 activity by reduction and oxidation reactions involving the protein thioredoxin (reviewed by Soteropoulos et al. (1994)). The ε subunit has been shown to affect the oxidation and reduction reaction of these Cys residues and protect this region from proteolytic digestion in CF1 (Schumann et al., 1985).In addition to the region around residue 70 and the C-terminal part from residues 202 to around 240, our chemical modification studies also place Thr-106 of γ in the ε subunit binding site. The recent x-ray structure determination shows that the γ subunit has three segments in contact with α and β subunits, an N-terminal α-helix of residues 1-50, a short central α-helical residue region 83-99 in the numbering system of E. coli, as well as the C-terminal α-helix (Abrahams et al., 1994). It is noteworthy that the remainder of this subunit, including several of the sites identified here as in, or close to, the ε binding site, is predicted to be in the β sheet and turn structure. It seems likely, then, that the β barrel of the ε subunit binds in part to an equivalent structure formed by much of the region of the γ subunit, as well as binding to the extension of the C-terminal helix region. INTRODUCTIONProton translocating F1F0 ATPases (also ATP synthases) are found in the membranes of bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, where they function in oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation to couple a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient to ATP synthesis. These complex enzymes are reversible and can use ATP hydrolysis to establish a proton gradient for subsequent use in substrate and ion transport processes (reviewed in Cross(1988), Senior (1990), and Boyer(1993)).As the name implies, F1F0 ATPases are made up of two parts, an extrinsic F1 part that contains the catalytic sites and a membrane-intrinsic F0 part that contains the proton channel. Cryo-electron microscopy shows these two parts separated by a stalk of 40-45 Å in length (Gogol et al., 1987; Lücken et al., 1990). In the bacterium Escherichia coli, the F1 part (ECF1) is made up of five different subunits (α, β, γ, δ, and ε) in the molar ratio 3:3:1:1:1. The F0 part contains three different subunits (a, b, and c) in the ratio 1:2:9-12 (Senior, 1990; Fillingame, 1992).The structure of the F1 part in the enzyme from bovine mitochondria has been obtained recently to 2.8 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (Abrahams et al., 1994). This shows three α and three β subunits arranged in a hexagon, with the γ subunit extending the length of the cavity within the hexagon, projecting from one end of the structure into an extension that is part of the stalk. The δ subunit of MF1, which is the equivalent of the ε subunit in bacterial and chloroplast enzymes, is also in the stalk but, in the crystal form studied, is probably disordered and not resolved.There is now considerable evidence that the γ and ε subunits play an important role in coupling catalytic site events with proton translocation (e.g. Gogol et al., 1990; Nakamoto et al., 1993; Abrahams et al., 1994; Capaldi et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994) and that this coupling involves conformational changes and, probably, translocations of one or both subunits (Aggeler et al., 1992, 1993; Turina and Capaldi, 1994a, 1994b; Wilkens and Capaldi, 1994). It is important, therefore, to obtain the detailed structures of, and interaction sites between, these two subunits.We have recently determined the structure of the ε subunit in solution by NMR spectroscopy (Wilkens et al., 1995). Here, we describe experiments that identify the γ subunit binding site on the ε subunit, and that locate regions of the γ subunit involved in the ε subunit binding."

In the present study, we have analyzed the biosynthesis and regulation of TGF-α production in human tumor-derived cell lines that endogenously express pro-TGF-α and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. These cells biosynthesized membrane-anchored forms of the TGF-α that accumulated on the cell surface. Membrane-bound pro-TGF-α interacted with the EGF receptor, and complexes of receptor and pro-TGF-α contained tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor. Activation of the EGF receptor by soluble EGF or TGF-α had a dual effect on TGF-α production: an increase in pro-TGF-α mRNA levels and an increase in pro-TGF-α cleavage. These effects were largely prevented by preincubation with an anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody that blocked ligand binding. Growth factor autoinduction of cleavage could be stimulated by several second messenger pathways that are activated by the EGF receptor, including protein kinase C and intracellular calcium, and by other alternative mechanisms. EGF-stimulated cleavage of pro-TGF-α could be partially blocked by inhibition of these second messenger pathways. These results suggest that juxtacrine stimulation takes place in human tumor cells that coexpress both the EGF receptor and membrane-anchored TGF-α and that TGF-α is able to induce its own endoproteolytic cleavage by activating the EGF receptor.

Enzyme activity rises in a similar fashion, which also parallels the induction of laminin and type IV collagen. Nuclear run-on assays indicate that this increase in α1,3GT in RA-treated F9 cells, like that of type IV collagen, is transcriptionally regulated.

The presence of this enzyme is consistent with studies suggesting that glycoproteins from F9 and RA/F9 cells contain terminal α-galactosyl residues(29.Cummings R.D. Mattox S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 511-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36.Fushuku N. Muramatsu H. Uezono M.M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10086-10092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the activity of the α1,3GT is higher in RA/F9 cells, and there is an apparent increase in α-galactosylation of surface glycoconjugates induced by RA(29.Cummings R.D. Mattox S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 511-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little information is available about the induction of the α1,3GT by RA, the glycosylation of proteins accompanying this induction, and whether there is a relationship between changes in the expression of terminal α-galactosyl residues on cellular glycoproteins and the apparent decrease in expression of LeX antigens.We have now examined the steady-state levels of the α1,3GT transcript during differentiation by RA and the enzymatic activities in both cell extracts and cell culture media following RA treatment. Our findings demonstrate that (i) α1,3GT is transcriptionally regulated by RA treatment; (ii) differentiation of F9 cells results in increased activity of the enzyme and increased expression of terminal α-galactosyl residues on selected cellular glycoproteins; and (iii) the apparent loss of the LeX antigens on cell surface glycoconjugates in RA/F9 cells is in part due to masking by terminal α-galactosyl residues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction enzymes, Escherichia coli tRNA, RNase-free DNase I, proteinase K, and green coffee bean α-galactosidase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim.

All other chemicals used were of the highest grade available.Cell CultureMouse teratocarcinoma F9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates as described(12.Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). For induction of differentiation, cells were grown under identical conditions in media supplemented with either 10−7M RA alone or 10−7M RA plus 10−3M dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) for 3 days. Differentiation was assessed by measuring the amount of laminin secreted in the cell culture media using a solid-phase assay described below. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in α-minimal essential media containing 10% fetal calf serum.RNA Blot AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was isolated from cultured cells essentially as described(38.Strohman R.C. Moss P.S. Eastwood J.M. Spector D. Przybyla A. Paterson B. Cell. 1977; 10: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, RNA samples were transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary action in 20 × SSPE for 16 h and immobilized by UV cross-linking (Autocrosslink on Stratalinker 2400). The filters were prehybridized for at least 4 h in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (0.18 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 1 mM EDTA), phycoerythrin (250 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium pyrophosphate, 5% SDS, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% Ficoll 400, and 1% bovine serum albumin), and 150 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. RNA bound to nylon membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA inserts from murine α1,3GT clone PCDM7-αGT(34.Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Ruff M.M. Kukowska-Latallo J. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), murine α-actin cDNA, and rat tubulin cDNA (a gift from Dr. Kelley Moremen, University of Georgia). The RNA blots were hybridized separately with the individual probes. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C overnight in the prehybridization solution using a hybridization incubator (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). The filters were washed twice in 6 × SSPE, 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, twice in 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 15 min, and three times in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography, using Kodak XAR-5 film (Kodak). After development, exposed areas of film were quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics model 3008 computing densitometer). The signals were normalized for variations in the amount and quality of RNA using actin mRNA or tubulin mRNA as internal controls.Nuclear Run-on AssaysNuclei were isolated from F9 or RA/F9 cells as described (39.Wang S.Y. LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 107: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and run-on transcription reactions were carried out as described (40.Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. Transcription was initiated by incubating 0.2 ml of nuclei (2-3 × 107 nuclei) with 12.5 μl of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl) in a 0.4-ml reaction volume containing 126 μl of reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 35% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, and 300 mM KCl), 20 μl of 10 mM GTP, CTP, ATP, respectively, 1 μl of 0.5 M dithiothreitol, and 80 units of RNase inhibitor. After mixing the components, the reactions were incubated at 30°C for 40 min with shaking. RNase-free DNase I (50 units) was added with 22.5 μl of 20 mM CaCl2. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, 5 μl of 16 mg/ml proteinase K and 47.25 μl of proteinase K buffer (5% SDS, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.4) was added along with the 10 μl of 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The 32P-labeled transcripts were resuspended in 0.5% SDS and hybridized onto DNA fragments immobilized on nylon membranes at 65°C for 36 h.Glycosyltransferase AssaysCell extracts were prepared as described (29.Cummings R.D. Mattox S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 511-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). Concentrated cell culture media were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was concentrated using centriprep-10 concentrators (Amicon Inc.).Reaction mixtures for the α1,3GT routinely contained 30 mMN-acetyllactosamine, 20 mM MnCl2, 0.5 mM UDP-[3H]Gal (35,000 cpm/nmol), 5 mM ATP, 50 mMD-galactono-1,4-lactone, and about 80 μg of cell extracts or 12.5 μl of 10-fold concentrated cell culture media in a final volume of 25 μl. The reactions were carried out at 37°C for 3 h. The product of the enzyme reaction was analyzed by Dionex high performance anion-exchange chromatography using a Carbopac PA1 column (4 × 250 mm). The separation was carried out in 160 mM sodium hydroxide for 15 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions were collected and monitored by scintillation counting. The radioactivity corresponding to the position of standard Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc was taken as the product of α1,3GT. The values obtained from assays performed in the absence of the acceptor were used as background. Assays for UDP-Gal:GlcNAc β1,4-galactosyltransferase (β1,4GT) were performed as described for α1,3GT, except that 20 mM GlcNAc was used as an acceptor, and cell culture media centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h were used as an enzyme source without concentration. The product N-acetyllactosamine was identified by high performance anion-exchange chromatography, as described above.Detection of Laminin by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent AssayThe wells of Immulon 4 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated at 4°C overnight with 100 μl of either F9 or RA/F9 cell culture media or 100 μl of varying concentrations of mouse EHS laminin in carbonate coating buffer (150 mM Na2CO3, 348 mM NaHCO3, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.6). After blocking with 5% BSA in PBS/NaN3 (PBS containing 0.02% NaN3), laminin was detected by incubating the wells with rabbit anti-mouse EHS laminin (100 μl of 1:2,000 dilution) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (100 μl of 1:4,000 dilution). Antibody solutions were prepared in dilution buffer (PBS/NaN3 containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20), and incubation was performed at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were treated with 100 μl of a freshly prepared 1 mg/ml alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate in coating buffer containing 1 mM MgCl2 at 37°C. The optical density at 405 nm of each well was recorded by V-Max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). Each assay was performed in triplicate.Lectin BlottingGS I-B4 was biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microsomes were prepared as described (41.Cummings R.D. Trowbridge I.S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13421-13427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). Streptavidin-agarose was added to the microsomes to remove cellular proteins that nonspecifically interact with streptavidin, and the supernatant fraction was recovered following centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 s. Total protein was determined by the BCA protein assay. For the preparation of serum-free cell culture media, F9 and RA/F9 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum for 3 days, as described above, and the culture media were replaced with serum-free media. Media were collected after 1 day and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (soluble proteins) was concentrated about 10-fold using a centriprep-10 concentrator. The microsomal fraction and soluble proteins in culture media were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gels(42.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL Western, Amersham)(43.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with TBS (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), 5% BSA at room temperature for 3 h, then incubated with 10 μg/ml of biotinylated GS I-B4 in dilution buffer (TBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.3% Tween 20) for 1 h. Control lanes were incubated with a lectin solution containing 200 mM hapten sugar raffinose. Following three 15-min washes in TTBS (TBS, 0.3% Tween 20), the lectin blots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:5,000 in dilution buffer. Blots were washed three times (15 min each) in TTBS followed by one wash in TBS and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Molecular weight determinations were made using prestained high molecular mass standards (14.3-200 kDa, Life Technologies, Inc.).Immunoprecipitation of Laminin in RA/F9 Culture MediaSerum-free RA/F9 cell culture media were prepared, as described above, and 84 μl from each of these (corresponding to 400 μg of soluble protein) was incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4°C for 1 h to remove components that react nonspecifically with protein A. The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and incubated with 5 μl of rabbit anti-mouse laminin antibody at 4°C for 2 h. The mixture was subsequently incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and centrifuged to pellet immunoprecipitated complexes. The laminin-antibody complexes immobilized on the protein A-Sepharose were washed five times with washing buffer (1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% SDS in PBS) and finally boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (42.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) for 5 min to dissociate the immune complexes. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% SDS-PAGE followed by GS I-B4 lectin blotting, as described above.Immunoblotting of Laminin in RA/F9 MediaMouse EHS laminin and RA/F9 serum-free culture media were separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose sheets as described above. Immunoblotting was performed as described for the GS I-B4 blotting, except that rabbit anti-mouse laminin antibody (1:2,000) and anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5,000) were used as first and second antibodies, respectively.Flow Cytometry AnalysisCells were harvested and washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were incubated with 100 milliunits of green coffee bean α-galactosidase in HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 6.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2) at 37°C for 1 h. Enzymes boiled for 20 min were used as controls. The cells were washed four times with staining buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 1% heat inactivated goat serum) and incubated with 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-LeX monoclonal antibody without dilution or 50 μl of biotinylated GS I-B4 (22 μg/ml), followed by incubation with 8 μl of phycoerythrin-streptavidin (1 mg/ml) in 100 μl of staining buffer on ice for 30 min, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed with a FACStar-Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry, San Jose, CA).RESULTSα1,3GT mRNA Is Increased upon RA Treatment of F9 CellsTo address the mechanism(s) underlying the apparent induction of α1,3GT in F9 cells, we first examined the effect of 72 h of RA treatment on the induction of α1,3GT transcripts. A representative time course of the Northern blot analysis using cells treated with RA is shown in Fig. 1A. The steady-state levels of α1,3GT mRNA begin to increase at 36 h following RA treatment and reached a maximum level at 48 h. This result was reproducible in four separate experiments, and the average of all the results obtained from densitometric scans is shown in Fig. 1B. The results demonstrate that RA treatment causes a 9-fold induction of the α1,3GT mRNA within 48 h. As a control, we analyzed total RNA from CHO cells and COS7 cells. These cells lack α-galactosyltransferase activity (34.Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Ruff M.M. Kukowska-Latallo J. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 45.Smith D.F. Larsen R.D. Mattox S. Lowe J.B. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6225-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lack any detectable transcript for the α1,3GT (Fig. 1A).It has been reported that dbcAMP enhances the transcriptional activation of genes by RA(44.Gudas L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the combined effects of RA and dbcAMP on the changes induced in the transcript for the α1,3GT. About 15 μg of total cellular RNA from untreated and treated cells was analyzed by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-radiolabeled murine α1,3GT cDNA in pCDM7. The results demonstrate that after 3 days of treatment the inclusion of dbcAMP and RA only slightly enhances the level of transcript over that of RA alone (Fig. 2, A and B). Since the levels of α1,3GT mRNA message of RA/F9 and that of RA/dbcAMP/F9 are rather similar, we focused on the effect of RA alone in all other experiments.Figure 2:Expression of α1,3GT mRNA in F9 cells upon induced differentiation by RA or RA combined with dbcAMP. A, F9 cells were treated for 3 days with either 10−7M RA alone or 10−7M retinoic acid plus 10−3M dibutyryl cyclic AMP (RA/dbcAMP). 15 μg of total RNA was isolated from the cells and analyzed as in Fig. 1. B, densitometry scans were used to quantify the relative signal in each lane. Tubulin mRNAs were used to normalize for variations in the amount and quality of RNA loaded in each lane. The level of expression of α1,3GT transcript in undifferentiated F9 cells was arbitrarily taken as 1 unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RA Increases the Transcriptional Rate of α1,3GTNuclear run-on assays were conducted to address the question of whether the change in α1,3GT mRNA induced by RA reflects an effect at the transcriptional level. For these nuclear run-on assays, we also analyzed expression of type IV collagen (α1), which is known to have a higher rate of transcription in RA/F9 cells compared to F9 cells (46.Dony C. Kessel M. Gruss P. Nature. 1985; 317: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). RNA “run-on” transcripts were synthesized by incubating the nuclei isolated from both F9 and RA/F9 cells in the presence of [α-32p]UTP, and similar amounts of radiolabeled RNA (∼2 × 106 cpm/ml) were then hybridized to DNA fragments immobilized on nylon filters. The transcriptional rate of the type IV collagen (α1) gene increases during F9 cell differentiation (Fig. 3), which is consistent with earlier reports(39.Wang S.Y. LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 107: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 46.Dony C. Kessel M. Gruss P. Nature. 1985; 317: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Likewise, the transcriptional rate of the α1,3GT gene is much higher in RA/F9 cells than in F9 cells (Fig. 3). As controls, there was no significant change in run-on transcripts for actin, and no transcripts were detected for the control pBluescript vector DNA. These results demonstrate that elevated transcripts for the α1,3GT in RA/F9 cells results from an increase in the transcriptional rate for the gene.Figure 3:Nuclear run-on analysis of α"

Transient transfection assays and nuclear run-off experiments showed that PMA increased EGF receptor gene transcription. Cell-free transcription with promoter mutants revealed that the region of the promoter containing nucleotides −150 to −16 was sufficient for PMA inducibility. A promoter fragment containing nucleotides −167 to −105 showed increased binding of a factor present in extracts prepared from PMA-treated cells. When this factor was partially purified by column chromatography, it showed specific PMA-dependent binding to an EGF receptor promoter fragment. This binding was competed by an SV40 fragment containing binding sites for Sp1, AP1, and AP2. Purified AP2 was used in DNase I footprinting experiments to show that this factor can bind to the EGF receptor promoter. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP2 binding sites found in the EGF receptor promoter showed the ability to bind AP2 and compete for the binding of a factor induced by PMA treatment. The addition of AP2 to nuclear extract resulted in increased transcription from the EGF receptor promoter. These results demonstrate that AP2 can activate EGF receptor gene expression and may mediate the PMA response of this gene.

The regulation of the EGFR is of considerable importance. The receptor is the cellular homolog of the avian erythroblastosis virus erbB oncogene product(17.Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scarce G.

Overexpression of the EGFR has been detected in some tumors and cell lines derived from tumors (19.Libermann T.A. Razon N. Bartal A.D. Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Soreq H.

Furthermore, retroviral mediated overexpression of the EGFR in NIH 3T3 cells results in cell transformation and EGF-induced malignancy and tumorigenicity(28.Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C.

Thus, regulation of the EGFR appears to play a vital role in cellular growth and transformation. To understand how the EGFR gene is regulated, we have located and isolated the EGFR gene promoter(30.Ishii S. Xu Y.-H. Stratton T.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4920-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The promoter is GC-rich, contains multiple transcriptional start sites, and lacks both CAAT and TATA boxes(30.Ishii S. Xu Y.-H. Stratton T.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4920-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The promoter binds the transcription factor Sp1 at multiple sites and has binding sites for additional nuclear proteins(31.Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5693-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of those additional DNA binding proteins, termed ETF (EGFR transcription factor), has been obtained in a highly purified form. Both Sp1 and ETF promote EGFR transcription in cell-free extracts(32.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6329-6336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5016-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The promoter contains an S1 nuclease-sensitive region that binds ERDP-1, EGF responsive DNA binding protein(34.Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4174-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35.Chen L.L. Clamson M.L. Bilgromi S. Carmichael G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 975-983PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type p53 can also activate the EGFR promoter(36.Deb S.P. Munoz R.M. Brown D.R. Subler M.A. Deb S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1341-1349PubMed Google Scholar). Two repressor proteins have been identified that bind to the EGFR promoter, ETR (EGFR transcriptional repressor) and GCF (GC factor). ETR is a 128-kDa protein that binds to a site located between −889 and −870(37.Hou X. Johnson A.C. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4307-4312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A GCF cDNA was cloned, and GCF was shown to repress EGFR promoter activity by binding to three sites in the promoter(38.Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The regulation of the EGFR gene by various agents is likely to be mediated by trans-acting factors that bind to the promoter region of the gene. The T3 receptor has been shown to suppress Sp1-dependent transcription from the EGFR promoter via overlapping binding sites(39.Xu J. Thompson K.L. Shephard L.B. Hudson L.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16065-16073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional responses to phorbol esters, cAMP, and retinoic acid have also been reported for the EGFR promoter(40.Hudson L.G. Santon J.B. Gill G.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters and cAMP responses are reported to be mediated via the transcription factors AP1 and AP2(41.Angel P. Imagawa M.

The EGFR gene promoter contains sequences similar to the binding sites for AP1 and AP2. To investigate whether the response of the EGFR gene to PMA treatment was transcriptional and perhaps mediated by AP2, I have performed transient transfection assays, nuclear run-off experiments, in vitro transcription analyses, and binding studies. The results indicate that PMA increases EGF receptor gene transcription and that the transcription may be mediated through AP2. KB and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were treated with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) in Me2SO (Aldrich) for 24 h in the above medium. Nuclei were isolated from KB cells treated with 100 nM PMA or Me2SO (control cells) for 1.5 and 3 h by lysing the cells in 0.25% Nonidet P-40 as described(45.Tyagi J.S. Hirano H. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5787-5793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription took place under standard reaction conditions in the presence of 200 mM KCl and [32P] GTP(45.Tyagi J.S. Hirano H. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5787-5793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Groudine M. Peretz M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). RNA samples of equal radioactivity were hybridized to immobilized DNA for 3-4 days at 42°C in 50% (v/v) formamide. Filters were washed in 30 mM NaCl, 3 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS at 50°C for 1 h, treated with RNase A and subjected to autoradiography(45.Tyagi J.S. Hirano H. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5787-5793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from control and PMA treated cells by modifications of Wildeman et al. (47.Wildeman A.G. Sassone-Corsi P. Grundstroem T. Zenke M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Dignam et al. (48.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) as described previously(32.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6329-6336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNAs were synthesized from promoter-CAT constructs and analyzed by hybridizing a CAT-specific primer to the RNA and reverse transcribing(32.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6329-6336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primer-extended products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to Whatman 3 MM paper and exposed to Kodak XAR film at −70°C with an intensifying screen. Films were developed and scanned by a laser densitometer for quantitation. Mobility shift assays were performed as described previously(31.Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5693-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, end-labeled DNA fragments or oligonucleotides were incubated with crude nuclear extract, fractionated extract, or purified AP2 at room temperature (23°C) for 15 min in the presence of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 72 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 12.5 A260/ml poly(dI•dC), 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. Samples (20 μl) were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 2 h using 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE = 89 mM Tris, 8 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) as running buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to Whatman No. 3MM paper and exposed to Kodak XAR film with intensifying screens at −70°C. The oligonucleotide containing the AP2 consensus sequence was purchased from Promega Corporation. All other oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bioserv Technologies (Laurel, MD). DNase I footprinting was performed according to Dynan et al.(49.Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 669-680Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For the SV40 promoter, pSV2CAT was labeled at the HindIII site and then cut with PvuII to obtain the 340-base pair promoter fragment. The EGFR gene promoter fragment (−771 to −16) was labeled at the HindIII site, and a 553-base pair (−569 to −16) fragment was isolated after cutting with TaqI. Purified AP2 and Sp1 were obtained from Promega Corp. KB cells or HeLa cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/100 mM dish 24 h prior to the addition of CaPO4-DNA precipitate(50.Haley J. Whittle N. Bennett P. Kinchington D. Ullrich A. Waterfield M. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 375-396PubMed Google Scholar). One milliliter of the precipitate containing 10 μg of pERCAT plasmid DNA was added to the medium; cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C and then exposed to glycerol for 30 s. Cells were incubated overnight at 37°C, and new medium containing PMA or Me2SO was added the following day. Twenty-four hours after PMA addition, cells were harvested, extracts were prepared, and CAT activity was assayed as previously reported(51.Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). EGFR mRNA levels and synthesis of the receptor itself are increased by EGF and phorbol ester tumor promoters(9.Clark A.J.L. Ishii S. Richert N. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8374-8378Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 10.Earp H.S. Austin K.S. Blaisdell J. Rubin R.A. Nelson K.G. Lee L.W. Grisham J.W. J. Biol.

To determine if the PMA was acting at the level of transcription, nuclear run-off assays were performed. Samples of radiolabeled RNA isolated from the nuclei of KB cells treated with or without 100 nM PMA were hybridized to EGFR DNA to see if there were any changes in the transcription of this gene (Fig. 1). The RNA hybridized at increased levels of 3.5- and 4.3-fold to the EGFR DNA (pE7) after PMA treatment of cells for 1.5 and 3.0 h, respectively. No significant increase in hybridization of labeled RNA with ribosomal DNA or β-actin DNA was detected (data not shown). No hybridization with pBR322 occurred (Fig. 1). These results indicate that PMA is acting to influence the level of EGFR gene transcription. To localize the region of the promoter that may be involved in the enhanced transcription, deletion mutants of the promoter fused to the CAT gene were used for transient transfection assays (Table 1) and transcription assays in vitro with nuclear extracts from control and PMA-treated KB cells (Fig. 2). Transient transfection assays show that EGFR promoter CAT constructs deleted to −105 respond to PMA treatment of KB cells. As indicated in Fig. 2, a band corresponding to the transcription product from the major in vitro start site was detected and shown to be PMA-inducible (Fig. 2A). Deletion mutants of the promoter (−771 to −16, −384 to −16, −150 to −16, and −105 to −16) all showed an increased response to PMA. The largest deletion (−105 to −16) showed the smallest response, 1.8-fold (Table 1). As a positive control for these experiments, pSV2CAT was used in these reactions. The SV40 promoter contains elements that are stimulated by phorbol esters(33.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5016-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34.Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4174-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When pSV2CAT is used in these experiments, we can also detect an increase of 3-4-fold in response to PMA (Fig. 2A). As a negative control, a CAT construct containing an SV40 minimal promoter (NcoI-HindIII), in which PMA-responsive elements and GC boxes have been removed, was used. This construct exhibited similar amounts of expression in control and PMA-treated extracts (Fig. 2B). Thus, the EGFR and SV40 promoters respond to PMA treatment in KB cells. Deletion mutants of the EGFR promoter down to −150 show similar amounts of increased expression and therefore probably contain a DNA element through which the action of PMA is mediated.Table 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Cell-free transcription analysis. RNAs were made in vitro using various EGFR promoter-CAT constructs and nuclear extracts from control and PMA-treated (1 h) cells. The RNAs were analyzed by hybridizing a specific CAT primer and reverse transcription. Primer-extended products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described. A, EGFR construct (1 μg) plus pSV2CAT (0.1 μg); B, pSV40(-)CAT (1 μg), which contains no GC boxes or enhancer binding region (−107 to +1) but does contain the TATA box region. EGFR promoter deletion 5′ end point and ± PMA treatment are shown at the top. Lane 1 for each section is an α-amanitin control. Arrows indicate respective transcripts. Complete regions for EGFR promoter constructs are given in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transcriptional enhancement of SV40 by PMA is mediated by trans-acting factors that bind to the promoter region(33.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5016-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34.Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4174-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To investigate whether a similar type of factors(s) mediated the EGFR promoter response, DNA binding studies were performed. Since the deletion mutants indicated that the −150 to −16 region contained PMA-responsive elements and the −105 to −16 region had lost part of the response, an AvaI fragment containing nucleotides −167 to −105 was used in gel retardation assays. When crude extracts from control and PMA-treated cells were used with this fragment, two retarded bands were observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). The lower retarded band (B2) was substantially increased when the PMA extract was used as compared with control extracts. The upper band (B1) was not changed under the same conditions. Thus, a PMA-responsive trans-acting factor may be retarding band B2. To partially purify and characterize this factor, the crude extracts were subjected to column chromatography on heparin-agarose followed by DEAE-Sepharose. Fractions from each column were tested for the presence of this trans-acting factor by gel retardation (Fig. 3). This factor appears primarily in the 0.4 M KCl heparin-agarose fraction (Fig. 3A) and the 0.25 M KCl DEAE-Sepharose fraction (Fig. 3B). The difference in the amount of this factor binding to the EGF receptor promoter fragment in control versus PMA-treated extracts is somewhat reduced during the purification. However, the difference remains significant after both columns. To determine the DNA sequences in the promoter to which this factor may be binding, DNase I footprinting was performed using the enriched DEAE-Sepharose fraction from PMA-treated cells. DNase I footprints were observed at six sites within the EGFR fragment (Fig. 4). These sites contain recognition sequences similar to the AP2 binding site. The DEAE-Sepharose fraction also protected the AP2 binding region of the SV40 promoter from DNase I digestion (data not shown). When purified AP2 was used in DNase I footprinting experiments with the EGFR promoter fragment, strong footprints were observed that corresponded to sites 2, 3, 5, and 6, and a weak AP2 footprint was observed at site 4 (Fig. 5). Some of these footprints also overlap DNase I footprints found when Sp1 was used with the EGFR promoter fragment (data not shown).Figure 5:DNase I footprinting with AP2 and the EGFR promoter. DNase I footprinting was performed as in Fig. 4. Lanes 1, 4, and 7, no addition. Lanes 2 and 3, 10 and 25 μg, respectively, of fractionated PMA-stimulated nuclear extract after DEAE-Sepharose. Lanes 5 and 6, 1 and 2 footprint units of purified AP2. The location of each footprint and recognition sequence is given in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further examine whether AP2 is involved in the increased binding of nuclear protein to the EGFR promoter region after PMA treatment, gel mobility shift assays were performed. Oligonucleotides corresponding to sites 2 and 3 were labeled and used with the fractionated extract from heparin agarose. Both oligonucleotides showed increased binding using the PMA-induced sample (Fig. 6). Also, both oligonucleotides bound purified AP2 (data not shown). The EGFR promoter fragment containing nucleotides −167 to −105 was also end-labeled and used in gel mobility shift assays with competition. When excess amounts of this fragment in an unlabeled form were used to compete against the labeled fragment in a gel retardation assay, bands B1 and B2 were diminished in intensity (Fig. 7A, lane 4). These bands were also competed with the SV40 enhancer fragment (Fig. 7A, lane 5). When excess amounts oligonucleotides containing AP2 binding sites in the EGFR promoter or consensus AP2 oligonucleotide were used as competitors, retarded band B1 remained the same intensity, while B2 was reduced in intensity (Fig. 7B, lanes 4-6). Neither retarded band was diminished in intensity when nonspecific (ϕX174) DNA was used as a competitor (Fig. 7B, lane 7).Figure 7:Gel mobility shift assays with competition. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Competitors were added and incubated for 5 minutes with extract before the addition of the labeled EGFR promoter fragment (−167 to −105). A, lane 1, no extract; lane 2, control extract; lane 3, PMA extract; lane 4, PMA extract plus 10-fold excess unlabeled fragment; lane 5, PMA extract plus 10-fold excess SV40 enhancer fragment; lane 6, PMA extract plus 10-fold excess ϕX174 DNA. B, lane 1, no extract; lane 2, control extract; lane 3, PMA extract; lane 4, PMA extract plus 10-fold excess site 2 oligonucleotide; lane 5, PMA extract plus 10-fold excess site 3 oligonucleotide; lane 6, PMA extract plus oligonucleotide containing AP2 consensus binding site sequence; lane 7, PMA extract plus 10-fold excess ϕX174 DNA. Sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: site 2, CCCGAGTCCCCGCCTCGCCGCCAA; site 3, CGAGCTAGCCCCGGCGGCGCCGCCGCCC; consensus AP2 binding sequence, GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the effect of AP2 on EGFR promoter activity, in vitro transcription experiments were performed using HeLa nuclear extract. Upon addition of AP2 to the extract, an increase in both SV40 and EGFR promoter activity was detected (Fig. 8). Thus, AP2 can bind to specific sequences in the EGFR promoter and stimulate EGFR gene transcription in vitro. In this study, I report that the mechanism by which PMA increases EGFR mRNA levels is at least in part through an enhancement of transcription. Nuclear run-off assays, transfection assays, and cell-free transcription analyses showed increased production of EGFR RNA in the nuclei and in nuclear extracts prepared from PMA-treated cells. To localize the region of the EGFR gene promoter involved in PMA-enhanced transcription, mutants with various portions of the EGFR promoter deleted were used for in vitro transcription. The results from these experiments indicate that the region from −150 to −16 is sufficient for PMA inducibility, although at a level less than that of the full promoter. Gel mobility shift assays with a promoter fragment that contains this region showed two bands with altered mobility, one of which was more prevalent in extracts from PMA-treated cells. DNase I footprinting of the EGFR gene promoter showed distinct regions of binding with fractionated extracts from PMA-treated cells. The binding to this promoter by the fractionated extract was identical to that of purified AP2. AP2 was able to bind to oligonucleotides containing EGFR promoter sequences similar to the consensus AP2 binding site. AP2 was also able to stimulate EGFR transcription in vitro. These results indicate that induction of EGFR promoter activity by PMA can be modulated by binding of AP2 to the promoter. The EGFR gene promoter contains elements that bind a variety of trans-acting factors. Sp1 binds to at least four sites in the promoter (31.Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5693-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ETF binds to the −248 to −233 region of the promoter and exerts a positive influence on EGFR gene transcription(32.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6329-6336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5016-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Another factor termed TCF (TC factor) binds to TCCTCCTCC repeats in the promoter region that contains an S1 nuclease-sensitive site(34.Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4174-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to these three factors, other nuclear factor binding sites have been located using A431 nuclear extracts and exonuclease III protection(31.Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5693-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter region of the EGFR gene contains two sequences located between −286 and −264 that are similar to AP2 binding sequences(30.Ishii S. Xu Y.-H. Stratton T.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4920-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31.Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol.

Purified AP2 does not bind to these sequences but does recognize other sites in the promoter that differ from the AP2 consensus recognition site by up to three base pairs (Table 2). The AP2 binding site located −105 to −82 is a perfect match for an AP2 consensus sequence previously reported(42.Imagawa M. Chui R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). There is another perfect match for this sequence located between −291 and −281, but purified AP2 does not footprint in this area (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the DNA sequence surrounding the recognition site or a DNA structural element may play a role in the recognition of the EGFR promoter by AP2.Table 2 Open table in a new tab A sequence similar to the AP1 binding sequence is located between −56 and −48. This eight-base pair sequence differs by only one base pair from the consensus AP1 sequence(51.Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription analysis with the −105 to −16 region of the promoter constructs resulted in a 50% higher activity using extract prepared from PMA-treated cells compared with extracts from control cells (Fig. 2, Table 1). Thus, although the PMA stimulation is maintained, it is diminished. Our experiments suggest that AP2 may mediate the effect of PMA on the EGFR gene. However, they do not preclude the involvement of additional factors such as AP1 and/or Sp1. The response of the EGFR gene to PMA may involve interactions or competitions of AP2 and Sp1, since some of these binding sites overlap. Protein complexes involving AP2 and Sp1 have been reported for the rat preprotachykinin-A promoter (52.Quinn J.P. McAllister J. Mendelson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). T3 receptor suppression of Sp1-dependent EGFR transcription has already been shown to be mediated via overlapping binding sites(39.Xu J. Thompson K.L. Shephard L.B. Hudson L.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16065-16073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The response of the EGFR gene to various agents at the level of transcription requires the identification of the transcription factor(s) that act to mediate the signal of specific agents. The response of the EGFR gene to PMA is at least, in part, mediated by AP2. I am deeply indebted to Dr. Adrian Clark for nuclear run-off analyses. I would also like to thank Drs.

We and others have previously demonstrated that the transcription of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain (c-sis) by EC is stimulated severalfold by thrombin. Here we examine the molecular mechanism of this regulatory process using bovine aortic EC transiently transfected with a vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of a 400-base pair fragment of the human PDGF B-chain promoter. Thrombin treatment of these cells caused a severalfold increase in CAT expression. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the region spanning nucleotides −61 to −53 from the transcription initiation site (referred to as the thrombin response, or ThR, region) was critical for the transcriptional response to thrombin. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the region −64 to −44, which contained the ThR region, led to the identification of a thrombin-inducible nuclear factor (TINF) in extracts from thrombin-treated, but not control, EC. TINF was formed as early as 40 min post-thrombin treatment, persisted for at least 7 h, but was no longer present after 24 h. TINF appeared in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. The ThR region consists of a repeat of a CCACCC element in an ABBA configuration, which, based on mutation analysis and transfection assays, appears to be critical in mediating thrombin stimulation of the PDGF B-chain gene. The conservation of the ThR region in the promoter of the PDGF B-chain among three species (human, feline, and murine) further supports the importance of this region as a cis-acting regulatory element.

The molecular mechanism underlying thrombin stimulation of transcription of the PDGF B-chain gene or, in fact, thrombin induction of any gene in EC, as well as in any other cell type, remains unknown. Regulation of PDGF B-chain gene transcription has been explored in multiple cell types. Specific sequences have been defined within the 5′ untranslated region of the B-chain gene, which may be important in the regulation of its transcription(23.Rao C.D. Igarashi H. Chiu I.M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2392-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments in K-562 cells (a hematopoietic cell type) have defined a minimal promoter region which includes the sequence extending 400 bp 5′ of the transcription initiation site(24.Pech M. Rao C.D. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, several DNase I-hypersensitive sites have been located in the human PDGF B-chain gene, although localization of these sites has focused on the first intron and the region downstream of the coding sequence with little known about the 5′ flanking region(25.Franklin G.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have defined a minimal promoter for basal expression of the PDGF B-chain gene in EC. This promoter region contains several consensus sequences for binding such transcriptional factors as Ets family members and AP-1 complexes. These investigators, however, have not examined the role of any of these elements in agonist-stimulated transcription of this gene in EC. Others have used linker scanning of the PDGF B-chain core promoter to identify an element essential for TPA-induced activation of this gene in K562 cells (28.Jin H.-M. Brady M.L. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7563-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence supporting the identification of a 9-bp region in the PDGF B-chain promoter as being responsible for thrombin-induced transcription of this gene. We further demonstrate that a thrombin-inducible nuclear factor (TINF) and the transcription factor Sp1 are two distinct factors that bind to this region of DNA. Bovine thrombin was purchased from Miles, Inc. (Kankakee, IL). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12) culture medium was from Irvine Scientific (Santa Anna, CA) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Whittaker Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD). Rabbit polyclonal IgG to Sp1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and human recombinant Sp1 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Tissue culture plastic was from Costar (Cambridge, MA). All other chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Sigma. Bovine aortic EC were isolated as described previously (29.DiCorleto P.E. de la Motte C.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM/F-12 containing 5% FBS. At confluence the EC were routinely subcultured at 1:3 or 1:5 ratios by trypsin-EDTA treatment. Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were included in the media of cells cultured for assay. Bovine aortic EC were used at passages 3-12. Human umbilical vein EC were isolated from undamaged segments of 1-3-day-old umbilical cords, as described previously(29.DiCorleto P.E. de la Motte C.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 20% FBS. Human umbilical vein EC were used in primary culture. Based on the published sequence of the 5′ flanking region of the PDGF B-chain gene(24.Pech M. Rao C.D. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we synthesized several primers, which were used for amplification of regions of the promoter. A 400-bp region upstream of the transcription initiation site, as well as several shorter fragments, were amplified using human EC DNA (200 ng) (30.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar) and primers (130 pM of each) shown in Table 1 in a total volume of 100 μl of 1 × Taq DNA polymerase buffer (Promega). The amplification was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermal cycler. Cycling times were 3 min at 95°C (denaturation), 3 min at 40°C (annealing), and 3 min at 72°C (extension). Twenty-five cycles were performed, concluding with a 3-min extension at 72°C. The resulting PCR products were resolved by low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis(31.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The purified DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme PstI in order to cleave the synthetic sites flanking the amplified DNA and then cloned into pBluescript (KS+) vector (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and into a promoterless pBasicCAT vector from Promega. Plasmid DNAs were purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. All the amplified DNA fragments were confirmed by sequencing (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Table 1 Open table in a new tab Bovine aortic EC were grown in six-well plates to about 80% confluence and washed with Opti-MEM I reduced-serum media (Life Technologies, Inc.) prior to transfection. The optimal transfection efficiency was obtained using 5 μg of DNA and 15 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of Opti-MEM I as described by the manufacturer. Following incubation for 16 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with fresh Opti-MEM I with or without bovine α-thrombin (10 units/ml or as specified). At the time indicated in the figure legends, cells were harvested by scraping from the plates and lysed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. The CAT assay was performed using [14C]chloramphenicol and Tris buffer according to the method of Rosenthal(32.Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and the reaction products were extracted by simple phase-extraction(33.Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 6: 271-277Crossref Scopus (830) Google Scholar). All determinations were obtained within the linear range of the assay, typically between 0.7 and 30% conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol. Presented data represent the mean of at least duplicate transfection wells and are normalized to protein content per well, as determined by the BCA protein assay (microtiter plate protocol) (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al.(34.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Double-stranded synthetic probes for EMSA were prepared by heating equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides to 65°C and allowing then to cool to room temperature. All the oligonucleotides used in these studies were end-labeled using T4 kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-2P]ATP (DuPont NEN). The binding buffer solution contained Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 7.5), NaCl (50 mM), MgCl2 (1 mM), EDTA (0.5 mM), dithiothreitol (0.5 mM), glycerol (4%, v/v), poly(dI-dC) (0.1 mg/ml) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), with protease inhibitors pepstatin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), and antipain (5 μg/ml) (Boehringer Mannheim) added immediately before use, and 5 μg of nuclear extract protein in a final volume of 10 μl. Labeled oligonucleotide (∼50,000 cpm/35 fmol) was added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 22.5 mM Tris base, 22.5 mM boric acid, and 0.5 mM EDTA at room temperature in a cooled circulating electrophoresis apparatus and visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated, competing oligonucleotides at a 100-fold molar excess (3.5 pmol) were used. To investigate the effects of thrombin on the promoter region of the PDGF B-chain gene, we first generated a 400-bp promoter fragment directly 5′ to the transcription initiation site of this gene using PCR and primer oligonucleotides, the sequences of which were derived from the published sequence of Pech et al.(24.Pech M. Rao C.D. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For functional studies, the amplified fragment was subcloned into the pCAT-basic vector upstream of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Thrombin responsiveness of the promoter region of the PDGF B-chain gene was evaluated by transiently transfecting bovine aortic EC with the synthesized 400-bp CAT construct, subsequently treating these cells with increasing concentrations of bovine α-thrombin (0-8 units/ml) for 24 h, and ultimately quantitating CAT activity in the cell lysates. A 24-h period following thrombin addition was sufficient to allow for readily detectable CAT in the lysates of transfected EC. Increased levels of CAT were observed in the bovine aortic EC containing the 400-bp CAT construct in response to as little as 0.1 units/ml thrombin, and maximal CAT expression was achieved at 8 units/ml thrombin (Fig. 1). EC transfected with the pCAT-basic vector alone showed no increase in response to thrombin (data not shown). In a study with several independently isolated strains of bovine aortic EC transfected with the p400-CAT construct, we reproducibly observed a 3-7-fold increase in CAT expression induced by thrombin. These thrombin-stimulated levels of CAT correlated quantitatively with thrombin induced levels of PDGF in the conditioned media of these cells, as measured by radioreceptor assay (data not shown). To define further the region corresponding to the thrombin response element, we generated deletion mutants of the 400-bp promoter region using PCR technology and the primers described in Table 1. A schematic representation of these constructs appears in Fig. 2A. Promoter fragments were ligated into our reporter vector, transfected into bovine aortic EC, and the cultures tested for the ability to respond to thrombin. As shown in Fig. 2B, the smallest construct that retained thrombin responsiveness was p86. Construct p43, which contained the minimal promoter activity required for expression in these cells, demonstrated no increased CAT expression in response to thrombin. This observation suggested that the region spanning oligonucleotides −86 to −44 (see Fig. 2A) was involved in the transcriptional response to thrombin. To further identify the specific sequence within the p86 construct of the PDGF B promoter responsible for thrombin induction, we employed an alternative approach. Transcription factors present in the nuclear extracts of thrombin-treated, but not in untreated EC, should bind to their specific DNA sequence, allowing visualization by EMSA. Oligonucleotides corresponding to two segments of the region containing the thrombin response element, one corresponding to the 5′ half, designated A (nucleotides −79 to −66) and the second, the 3′ half, designated B (nucleotides −64 to −44) were synthesized. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the −43 to −31 sequence, outside of the thrombin response region, designated C was prepared as a control (Fig. 3). Each oligomer was radiolabeled for use in EMSA. Incubation of oligonucleotide A or C with nuclear extracts prepared from bovine aortic EC that had been treated with thrombin did not reveal any novel shifted bands compared with nuclear extracts from untreated EC (data not shown). The B oligomer, however, yielded a thrombin-dependent DNA-protein complex that migrated more rapidly than several other complexes that were constitutively present in nuclear extracts (Fig. 4). The specificity of these DNA-protein complexes was demonstrated by competition experiments with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides, representing several consensus binding site sequences for known transcription factors as well as other sequences that are proximal to the B region (Fig. 4). These oligonucleotides are fully defined in Table 1. The competition study showed that among the many oligomers tested, only an excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide B competed efficiently with labeled B oligomer in binding to TINF.Figure 4:Characterization of the thrombin response region by EMSA. Nuclear extracts prepared from bovine aortic EC treated without (control) or with thrombin (10 units/ml) for times indicated were used in EMSA. The 5′ end-labeled B sequence oligomer (see Fig. 3) was incubated with nuclear extracts (5 μg) in the absence or presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the B region, C region, A region, AP1 binding sequence, NFκB binding sequence, AP2 binding sequence, TFIID binding sequence, and the CREB binding sequence. The TINF complex is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate that the B region was a functional thrombin response element, we generated a construct that contained the B region attached to the thrombin-unresponsive minimal promoter region p43 (Fig. 2B) and assayed for thrombin-stimulated CAT activity in EC. This new PCR-generated construct, designated p64, was linked to the CAT reporter gene and used for transfection into bovine aortic EC. As shown in Fig. 5, EC containing the p64 construct responded to thrombin with greater than a 3-fold increase in CAT expression over similarly transfected controls that were not treated with thrombin, and this level was comparable to cells containing the fully thrombin-responsive p86 construct. In addition, thrombin treatment of the p64 construct-transfected EC yielded 3 times the -fold induction in CAT activity than was seen with the p43 construct-transfected EC, indicating that the B region was sufficient to restore thrombin responsiveness to the p43 construct. Taken together, these data strongly suggested that the B region contained the element(s) necessary to increase the transcription of the PDGF B-chain gene as a result of thrombin stimulation. With the observation that an oligomer corresponding to the B region formed a specific protein-DNA complex when incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from thrombin-treated EC, we were led to investigate further the properties of this nuclear factor. First, we examined the kinetics of TINF appearance in the nucleus following thrombin treatment. As visualized by EMSA, the TINF complex was apparent in EC nuclear extracts as early as 40 min after thrombin addition, remained at a peak level for up to 7 h, and became undetectable by 24 h (Fig. 6). When EC were pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 30 min, followed by 1 h with the inhibitor plus thrombin, TINF still appeared in the nuclear extracts, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was not required (data not shown). The rapid appearance of this binding protein in the nucleus of EC following thrombin treatment is consistent with a lack of requirement of new protein synthesis. In an attempt to identify other nuclear proteins in thrombin-stimulated EC that bind to the B region and to determine the novelty of TINF, competition assays were performed using oligonucleotides containing consensus binding site sequences for several known nuclear factors. As shown in Fig. 4, many consensus sequence oligonucleotides failed to cause any reduction in the TINF-DNA complex. Effective competition was observed, however, with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligomer representing the consensus binding site for Sp1 (Fig. 8A). This result suggested that in addition to the TINF complex, Sp1-like proteins may bind to the B region. To determine whether TINF and Sp1 are distinct proteins, a “supershift” experiment was performed in which Sp1 antibody, Egr-1 antibody, or purified IgG was incubated with the nuclear extract-labeled oligomer mixture prior to the mobility shift assay. One of the major constitutively present bands (band 1) was shifted to a lower mobility in the gel (band ss-Sp1) with the Sp1 antibody, whereas TINF migration was unaltered (Fig. 7). The Egr-1 antibody as well as the IgG control had no effect on any of the bands from the EC extracts. Evidence that TINF is distinct from Sp1 includes its gel mobility, which is greater than the Sp1 proteins, its insensitivity to heat treatment (47°C for 10 min; data not shown)(35.Farnham P.J. Cornwell M.M. Gene Exp. 1991; 1: 137-148PubMed Google Scholar), and the inability of an Sp1 polyclonal antibody to either deplete nuclear extracts of TINF or to supershift TINF in the EMSA.Figure 7:Supershift evidence that TINF and Sp1 are distinct proteins. Nuclear extracts were prepared from bovine aortic EC treated without (control) or with thrombin (10 units/ml) for 5 h. Labeled double-stranded oligomer B was incubated with nuclear extracts (5 μg) from EC as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then incubated with 1 μl of medium, anti-Sp1 antiserum, anti-Egr-1 antiserum, or IgG prior to electrophoresis. SS refers to the supershifted Sp1 band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oligonucleotides containing several substitutions in the B region were tested as competitors in an EMSA in order to identify more specifically the DNA sequence requirements for TINF-DNA complex formation. As shown in Fig. 8A, oligonucleotides corresponding to the B region, ThR, and the Sp1 consensus binding site efficiently competed with TINF in binding to the B region oligomer. Common to all of these binding site oligomers was a CCACCC element, which has been reported to have high affinity for Sp1-like proteins(36.Hartzog G.A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Blanchard-McQuate K.L. Gray T.A. Saulino A. Collins F.S.

Included in the B region is also an inverted repeat of the sequence CCACCC in an ABBA configuration (Fig. 8B). To test whether this element may be involved in mediating thrombin responsiveness of the PDGF B-chain promoter, a series of mutant oligonucleotides were synthesized and tested in an EMSA. Fig. 8A shows that the B region substitution mutant oligomers, S64-59 and S55-50, each of which had only one end of the ABBA motif mutated but still contained a single intact CCACCC sequence, competed with TINF, as well as the Sp1-like proteins for binding to the B oligomer. However, binding of these nuclear proteins to the labeled B oligonucleotide was not inhibited by an excess of the oligomer S-ABBA, in which both the forward and inverted repeat formed by the CCACCC elements had been disrupted. Additionally, oligomer S610587, which contained four point mutations within the CCACCC sequence, and oligomer S60-56, in which the CACCC (position −60 to −56) of the B region had been replaced with AGTTT, did not compete for TINF binding. Direct nuclear factor binding studies, visualized in EMSA, showed that the labeled B mutant and S610587 failed to bind TINF, as well as the lower mobility, constitutively expressed, nuclear proteins. These results suggest that the ABBA configuration of bases CCACCC, which constitutes the CCACCCACC sequence, referred to as the ThR element within the PDGF B-chain promoter B region, is responsible for the binding of both TINF and Sp1-like proteins and that the minimum sequence required for a thrombin-induced response is CCACCC (Fig. 9). To confirm that the CCACCC element is mediating thrombin-induced transcription of the PDGF B-chain gene in bovine aortic EC, we generated several mutants of the PDGF B-chain promoter by PCR and ligated them into the CAT expression vector in order to perform functional analyses. These mutants included a p64 mutant plasmid, in which the CCACCCACC (ThR region) sequence was fully substituted by AAGTTTGAA, and p64S610587, in which four base substitutions were made within the CCACCC element. These mutant plasmid constructs were used to transfect bovine aortic EC, and CAT activity was measured in replicate cultures following treatmen"

Chemical and proteolytic digests of heparinase I were used in direct binding and competition assays, to map the regions of heparinase I that interact specifically with heparin. We find the heparin binding site contains two Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequences and a calcium co-ordination consensus motif. We show that heparin binding to heparinase I is independent of calcium (Kd of 60 nM) and that calcium is able to activate heparinase I catalytically. We find that sulfhydryl selective labeling of cysteine 135 of heparinase I protects the lysines of the heparin binding sequence from proteolytic cleavage, suggesting the close proximity of the heparin binding site to the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis of H203A (contained in the heparin binding site) inactivated heparinase I; however, a H203D mutant retained marginal activity, indicating a role for this residue in catalysis. The above results taken together suggest that histidine 203 (hence the heparin binding site) is immediately adjacent to the scissile bond. We propose that the heparin binding site and active site are in close proximity to each other and that the calcium coordination motif, contained in the heparin binding site, may bridge heparin to heparinase I through calcium in a ternary complex during catalysis.

Glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, play a key role in the extracellular matrix (Jackson et al., 1991; Lindahl et al., 1994). Heparin is an acidic polysaccharide, characterized by a disaccharide repeating unit of hexosamine and uronic acid (L-iduronic or D-glucuronic acid) connected through 1-4 linkages. Heparin is heterogeneous due to the varying degree of modification of the functional groups in the disaccharide unit (Comper, 1981; Linhardt and Loganathan, 1989). Heparinases are heparin-degrading enzymes that cleave certain sequences of heparin/heparan sulfate specifically (Lohse and Linhardt, 1992; Ernst et al., 1995). Heparinases have aided in the understanding of important physiological roles of heparin, which include anticoagulation, angiogenesis, etc. (Linhardt et al., 1993; Sasisekharan et al., 1994; Ernst et al., 1995). Additionally, heparinases themselves have therapeutic and diagnostic applications such as heparin detection and removal (Langer et al., 1982; Bernstein et al., 1988; Baugh et al., 1992; Tejidor et al., 1993; Linhardt et al., 1993; Sasisekharan et al., 1994; Ernst et al., 1995). Flavobacterium heparinum produces three heparinases, which are specific for different sequences of heparin (Linhardt et al., 1990; Lohse and Linhardt, 1992; Desai et al., 1993). While there are several reports on the substrate specificity of heparinases (Rice and Linhardt, 1989; Linhardt et al., 1990; Nader et al., 1990; Desai et al., 1993; Ernst et al., 1995), there is limited information on the molecular features of the enzymes that confer this specificity (Linhardt et al., 1986; Lohse and Linhardt, 1992; Sasisekharan et al., 1995; Ernst et al., 1995). There have been numerous recent reports on the high degree of specificity in the binding interactions of heparin and heparan sulfate with cytokines, growth factors and other molecules of the extracellular matrix (Jackson et al., 1991; Varki, 1993; Ernst et al., 1995). In several heparin-binding proteins, the binding specificity is dependent on certain sequences of the polysaccharide as well as characteristic amino acid sequences of the protein (Jackson et al., 1991; Lindahl et al., 1994). On the protein side, Cardin and Weintraub identified two consensus sequences (XBBBXXBX or XBBXBX (B = basic residues; X = hydrophobic or other residues)) found in many heparin-binding proteins (Cardin and Weintraub, 1989). Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis and binding studies with synthetic or isolated peptides from several of these proteins have confirmed that this consensus region often is involved in binding specifically to heparin (Bae et al., 1994; Baird et al., 1988; Bober Barkalow and Schwarzbauer, 1991; Jackson et al., 1991; Smith and Knauer, 1987; Thompson et al., 1994). On the polysaccharide side, oligosaccharides with certain sequences of modifications in the disaccharide repeat have been isolated and shown to confer binding specificity for antithrombin III, bFGF, ( 1The abbreviations used are: bFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorIAAiodoacetic acidMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPCMBp-chloromercuribenzoatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRPHPLCreverse-phase HPLCr-heparinase Irecombinant heparinase IHBPheparin-binding peptideACEaffinity co-electrophoresis.) and others (Lindahl et al., 1984; Maccarana et al., 1993; Maimone and Tollefsen, 1990; Parthasarathy et al., 1994). This is parallel to the substrate specificities of heparinases and suggests that the mechanism of substrate binding to heparinases may be involved in generating specificity. basic fibroblast growth factor iodoacetic acid 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid p-chloromercuribenzoate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography reverse-phase HPLC recombinant heparinase I heparin-binding peptide affinity co-electrophoresis. Earlier studies suggested the importance of basic residues in heparinase I activity (Comfort et al., 1989; Leckband and Langer, 1991). Recently, we found that cysteine 135 of heparinase I is catalytically active (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). In addition, the observation of a decrease in the rate of heparinase I inactivation by chemical modification of cysteine 135 in the presence of heparin, along with other experiments, led to the hypothesis that a heparin binding domain is in close proximity to cysteine 135 (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). In this study, we map and characterize the heparin binding domain of heparinase I and test the hypothesis of the binding domain being in proximity to the active site. Heparin, from porcine intestinal mucosa with an average molecular mass of 12 kDa and activity of 157 USP units/mg was from Hepar (Franklin, OH). Heparin was radioiodinated to a specific activity of 5.86 × 108 cpm/nmol (6 kDa, average molecular mass), and was purified as described (Lee and Lander, 1991). Low melting point agarose (SeaPlaque) and GelBond were from FMC (Rockland, ME). Urea, dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, trifluoroacetic acid, PCMB, and acetonitrile were from Allied Chemicals (Deerfield, IL). Chondroitin sulfate was from Sigma. Other chemicals were from Mallinckrodt. Molecular weight standards were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Molecular biology reagents and their sources are listed in the appropriate sections below. Heparinase I was purified as described (Yang et al., 1985; Sasisekharan et al., 1993). The heparinase I used for activity measurements was extensively desalted using a Centricon P-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Protein concentration was determined using Micro-BCA reagent (Pierce) relative to a bovine serum albumin standard. The heparin-binding peptides HBP-I and Maxadilan were synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry (Stewart and Young, 1984) on an Applied Biosystems model 430A solid phase peptide synthesizer (Biopolymers Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge, MA). The peptides were purified by RPHPLC on a Vydac C18 reverse-phase column using a gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile for 40 min. HBP-I is an 18-amino acid peptide representing residues 196-213, ( 2For complete DNA and protein sequence of heparinase I, refer to Sasisekharan et al.(1993) or GenBank(™) accession no. L12534.) with the sequence IFKKNIAHDKVEKKDKDG. Maxadilan was used as the control peptide. This peptide contains a basic cluster with a sequence VFKESMKQKKKKEFSSEK (Lerner and Shoemaker, 1992). For studying the effect of Ca2+, 0.5 μg of heparinase I was added to 25 mg/ml heparin in 100 mM (MOPS) buffer at pH 7.0 with varying amounts of calcium acetate, in a total volume of 900 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C. At various time intervals (up to 6 min), aliquots of 50-70 μl were withdrawn in duplicate and quenched in 1.5 ml of 0.03 N HCl, and the absorbance at 232 nm was measured essentially as described by Bernstein et al. (1988). For measuring r-heparinase I activity during purification, the assay was done essentially as described by Sasisekharan et al.(1993). Heparin (0.2 or 2 mg/ml) was incubated with heparinase I, r-heparinase I, or mutant enzymes in 5 mM calcium acetate, 100 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, for 18 h. The reaction was then subjected to anion-exchange HPLC to separate the oligosaccharide products, as described by Sasisekharan et al.(1993). Heparin affinity chromatography was carried out using a heparin POROS (4.6 mm × 100 mm) column (PerSeptive BioSystems, Cambridge, MA). A nanomole (∼40 μg) of heparinase I in 100 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0 (with and without 5 mM calcium acetate), was loaded onto the heparin POROS column, connected to a BIOCAD workstation (PerSeptive BioSystems, Cambridge, MA). The protein was eluted in a salt gradient of 0-1 M NaCl (in 5 min.), in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and monitored at 210 and 277 nm. Affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE) on heparin binding to heparinase I was performed with 0 (buffer 1) or 5 mM (buffer 2) calcium acetate essentially as described (Lee and Lander, 1991). The heparinase I concentrations were from 0.05 to 25 μg/ml, either untreated, or pretreated with IAA as reported previously (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). The binding constant was determined using Scatchard analysis, using weighted, nonlinear least-squares curve fitting (Lee and Lander, 1991). One nmol (∼40 μg) of heparinase I was digested with CNBr as described by Matsudaira(1993). The digest was diluted 10-fold with water and then lyophilized under vacuum. SDS-PAGE of the CNBr-digested heparinase I fragments was carried out on a 15% polyacrylamide gel using a Mini PROTEAN II electrophoresis apparatus (120 V for 90 min) (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized with a 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 solution, followed by destaining with a 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid (v/v) solution. Following gel electrophoresis CNBr digests of heparinase I were blotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schüll) according to the method of Matsudaira(1993). Transfer was carried out in the following amperage sequence: 30 min at 50 mA, 30 min at 100 mA, and 60 min at 275 mA. The nitrocellulose membrane was stained for 1 min with 0.1% Ponceau S solution (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in 0.1% acetic acid and then washed with 1% acetic acid for 1 min (Tempst et al., 1990). For heparin hybridization, the membrane was further processed by washing it with 10 mM Tris•HCl, 10 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.0 (TNE-10) twice, and once with the probing buffer. The heparin binding domain was probed using 125I-labeled heparin at a concentration 106 cpm/ml in the probing buffer. The membrane was hybridized at 37°C for 18 h followed by washing of the membrane to remove excess radiolabel. The membrane was cut into bands corresponding to the stained peptide fragments, and each band was counted for 125I incorporation on a scintillation counter (model LS 3801, Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The bands that were positive for 125I incorporation were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and sequenced as described below. Alternatively, the stained membrane was cut into bands before hybridization and the bands were then washed in a microcentrifuge tube, prehybridized, and probed individually. CNBr peptides were extracted from the nitrocellulose membrane using essentially the procedure described by Matsudaira(1993) for sequencing (see below). The tryptic digestion was carried out essentially as described by Sasisekharan et al., 1993. In some experiments, heparin was added to heparinase I before trypsin digestion. The reaction was terminated by heating the sample at 65°C for 2 min. In the PCMB protection experiment, heparinase I was first labeled with PCMB as described (Sasisekharan et al., 1995), under nonreduced conditions, and then digested with trypsin as described above. A total of 2.5 nmol of heparinase I was digested and then divided into five batches (500 pmol each; ∼20 μg) inclusive of one control digest. For the competition experiments, heparin was added in varying concentrations (5, 50, 100, and 200 μg) to the digests, which were subsequently separated using RPHPLC, with a 20-min isocratic run, followed by 0-80% acetonitrile (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 120 min, and monitored at 210 and 277 nm. Chondroitin sulfate was used as control for nonspecific competition. In dot blot assays, 2.5 nmol of heparinase I digested with trypsin were separated by RPHPLC as described above. The peptide fragments were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper. The blots were washed with TNE-10 twice and then probed with 125I-labeled heparin for 2 h, at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, 1 mg/ml chondroitin sulfate, and 0.01% Tween 20 in 10 mM MOPS containing 5 mM calcium acetate, pH 7.0 (probing buffer). The blots were washed twice with 10 mM MOPS containing 5 mM calcium acetate, pH 7.0, and then counted for 125I-heparin binding. Binding data was analyzed using weighted, nonlinear least-squares curve fitting (McPherson, 1985). Small amounts of heparin (0.05% of total counts) bound to nitrocellulose filters dotted either with buffer or with 1 mM bovine serum albumin. Peptides were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems model 477 sequencer, with an on-line model 120 PTH amino acid analyzer (Biopolymers Laboratory, MIT). The recombinant and mutant heparinases I were expressed without the putative F. heparinum leader sequence, i.e. as a construct ((-L)r-heparinase I) that reads Met-Glu22-Glu23- … (Sasisekharan et al., 1993). To facilitate purification, the heparinase I gene was expressed using the pET15b system with a histidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site in a 21-amino acid N-terminal leader sequence (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). The mutation was introduced via 12-cycle PCR, as described previously (Sasisekharan et al., 1995), by the method of Higuchi (Higuchi, 1990). The primers2 for the H203A mutation were 5′-AATATCGCCGCTGATAAAGTT-3′ and 5′-AACTTTATCAGCGGCGATATT-3′ and for the H203D mutation were 5′-AATATCGCCGATGATAAAGTT-3′ and 5′-AACTTTATCATCGGCGATATT-3′. The mutant genes were cloned into pET-15b and were sequenced essentially as described by Sasisekharan et al.(1995). The constructs were transformed in BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and the protein purified as described previously (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) was carried out using precast 12% gels and a Mini PROTEAN II apparatus and stained with the Silver Stain Plus kit (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). CNBr-digested heparinase I separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, resulted in 10 peptide fragments (Fig. 1). Heparinase I contains five internal methionine residues (CNBr sites), two of which are adjacent to each other, so for complete digestion, only five fragments should be expected. However, only four of the 10 peptides could be sequenced and two others were contaminating peptides (Table 1). The remaining four fragments, based on molecular weights and sequencing, probably represented partial digests from the N terminus, which was shown previously to be blocked (Sasisekharan et al., 1993). The CNBr-generated heparinase I fragments on nitrocellulose were hybridized with 125I-labeled heparin, and counted for 125I incorporation. The binding of 125I-heparin to CNBr-8 was significantly higher compared to the other bands and to controls (Table 1). Similar results were obtained by an alternative method, where the peptide bands on nitrocellulose were cut out and hybridized individually. CNBr-8 spans amino acids 195 to approximately 290 of the heparinase I primary sequence. It has a lysine-rich N-terminal region, containing two potential Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequences (Cardin and Weintraub, 1989) and a calcium binding loop of the “EF-hand” structural domain (Kretsinger, 1975, 1980). It is interesting to note that CNBr-9 also contains a putative Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequence; however, this fragment does not seem to bind heparin significantly. Since CNBr-7 (residues 272-360) did not bind heparin and inasmuch as residues 272-290 are common to CNBr-7 and CNBr-8, this region is excluded from being a part of the heparin binding domain. Therefore, the region 195-270 contains the primary heparin binding site of heparinase I.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab It is important to point out that an unavoidable limitation of the technique described here is that when ligand-protein binding is probed on nitrocellulose (with the protein being denatured), only the primary (non-folded) structures that bind to the ligand can be detected. In order to further investigate the heparin binding region of heparinase I, we carried out proteolytic digests of heparinase I as described below. Tryptic digestion was used to map the heparin binding site of bFGF, by showing that heparin protects this site from trypsin cleavage (Coltrini et al., 1993). We tested the ability of heparin in protecting the heparin binding domain of heparinase I from trypsin cleavage. Under the conditions tested, heparin was ineffective in protecting the heparin binding domain; however, it was able to compete specifically with the binding of some heparinase I tryptic peptides to the reverse-phase column. Peaks that shifted significantly in their elution time, or disappeared (presumably eluting in the void volume), represent tryptic peptides that bind to heparin. Chondroitin sulfate was used as a control to account for nonspecific ionic effects. Compared to a control tryptic map (Fig. 2A), in the presence of increasing concentrations of heparin, the following peaks were altered reproducibly: peak at 34 min (td4), peak at 43 min (td9), peaks eluting between 52 and 58 min, peak at 71 min (td45), peak at 77 min (td39), and peak at 84 min (td50) (Fig. 2B). As the peptides td9, those eluting in the region between 52 and 58 min, and td50 were all altered by both heparin and chondroitin sulfate (data not shown), it can be inferred that only td4, td39, and td45 bind heparin specifically. In a dot blot assay using 125I-heparin and in the presence of a 100-fold excess of cold chondroitin sulfate, only td45 showed 125I signal (data not shown). It should be pointed out that td45 is a partial digest of td39, with the common region being residues 215-221. From the competition and dot blot experiments, it can be concluded that td45 (residues 215-221) and td4 (residues 132-141) are the only peptides that bind specifically to heparin. While this is consistent with td45 being a part of CNBr-8 peptide, it is interesting to note that td4 contains the active site cysteine 135 (see “Discussion”) (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). The combined heparin binding experiments, with CNBr and tryptic digests of heparinase I, point to the residues 195-221 as being primarily involved in heparin binding. As mentioned earlier, this region contains two potential Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequences (residues 197-204 and 207-212) and a calcium binding loop of the EF-hand structural domain (residues 206-220). Importantly, as this region contains multiple lysines it is likely to be degraded to very short peptides (di- and tripeptides) by trypsin. Thus, it was not expected to show up on the tryptic digest chromatogram, and its potential heparin binding properties might therefore have gone undetected in these experiments. To investigate the heparin-binding properties of these residues, a peptide corresponding to this region was synthesized and characterized as described below. A synthetic peptide (HBP-I) corresponding to the residues 196-213 has a ∼4 μM binding affinity for heparin dodecasaccharides. Interestingly, HBP-I affected the product profile of heparinase I degradation of heparin. As mentioned earlier, heparinase I depolymerization of heparin results in two disaccharides, three tetrasaccharides (1-3), and a hexasaccharide (Fig. 3A) (Rice and Linhardt, 1989). In a concentration-dependent manner, the addition of HBP-I to the reaction mixture caused the peak corresponding to tetrasaccharide 3 (ΔU2S HNS,6S I2S HNS,6S) to disappear (Fig. 3, B and C). When tetrasaccharide 3 was isolated and degraded with heparinase I in the presence of HBP-I, a marked increase in the amount of disaccharide was observed (data not shown). A control peptide (Maxadilan) with similar charge properties (and at the concentration ranges tested above) had no effect on the enzyme activity or on the oligosaccharide product profile (Fig. 3D). This demonstrates that HBP-I affects the selectivity of heparin degradation by heparinase I; tetrasaccharide 3, but not tetrasaccharides 1 or 2, is degraded in the presence of HBP-I. It must be pointed out that HBP-I does not degrade heparin or heparin oligosaccharides. Region 206-220 was found to be homologous to the calcium binding loop of the EF-hand structural domain (Table 2) (Kretsinger, 1975, 1980). Four of the five amino acids that are involved in coordinating calcium in the loop of the EF-hand structural domain are conserved in heparinase I. This led us to investigate the role of calcium in heparinase I activity. There are conflicting reports on the effect of calcium on heparinase I activity (Linker and Hovingh, 1965; Dietrich et al., 1973; Linhardt et al., 1986; Lohse and Linhardt, 1992). The relative heparinase I activity increases with calcium concentrations up to around 5 mM as shown in Fig. 4. In order to further investigate the calcium-based heparinase I activation, the role of calcium in heparin binding to heparinase I was studied using heparin affinity chromatography. These experiments indicate that heparin binding to heparinase I is independent of calcium (heparinase I elutes at a salt concentration of 200 mM) and the presence of calcium leads to a loss in binding to heparin column (as calcium activates heparinase I catalytically) (data not shown). The above results suggest a possible co-factor role for calcium in heparinase I activity.Table 2 Open table in a new tab Figure 4:Effect of calcium on heparinase I activity. Plot of the relative reaction rate as a function of calcium concentration. Heparin concentration was fixed at 25 mg/ml, and the calcium concentration was varied in the assay. Heparinase I (0.5 μg) was desalted and added to the reaction mixture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of heparinase I to bind heparin, in the absence of calcium, led us to investigate the heparin binding affinity of heparinase I. ACE was used to determine a heparin binding constant for heparinase I (Lee and Lander, 1991). ACE was carried out in the presence or absence of IAA to determine the importance of the active site cysteine 135 in the binding of heparin to heparinase I (Sasisekharan et al., 1995), and in the absence of calcium to prevent heparin degradation. The Kd for heparinase-heparin binding was found to be 60 nM by this technique. Fig. 5A shows the ACE gel of native heparinase I (nondenatured), and Fig. 5B shows the ACE gel of heparinase I modified with IAA. There is no difference in the retardation of heparin for the IAA-modified heparinase I when compared to the unmodified heparinase I. This result indicates that blocking the active site cysteine does not alter heparin binding. An ACE gel of heparin-heparinase I carried out in the presence of calcium (data not shown) showed extensive smearing of the heparin band. Heparinase I derivatization by sulfhydryl-specific reagent PCMB inactivated the enzyme due to selective modification of cysteine 135, and the inactivation kinetics were altered in the presence of heparin, suggesting a heparin binding site in close proximity to cysteine 135 (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). To test this hypothesis, tryptic digestion of PCMB-modified heparinase I was carried out to determine if PCMB (being a bulky negatively charged molecule) could impede trypsin access to the basic residues contained in the heparin binding domain. Such a protection of the basic residues from proteolytic digestion could argue for the close proximity of these residues to cysteine 135. The PCMB-heparinase I tryptic map (data not shown) has the appearance of a new peak (about 31 min) with a sequence representing residues 199-209. The results suggest that PCMB-labeled cysteine 135 protects the lysine-rich peptide (contained in the heparin binding sequence) from trypsin cleavage, when compared to a control digest where this peptide is not observed. This result supports the notion that a heparin binding site is in close proximity to the active site cysteine 135 (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). To further investigate a functional role of the heparin binding domain, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. Histidine 203, as a basic residue, was targeted for site-directed mutagenesis, because it is known to play a role in both heparin binding as well as an acid/base catalyst in some proteins (Fersht, 1985; Talpas and Lee, 1993; Fan et al., 1994). Furthermore, it has been suggested that histidine may act as a nucleophilic residue in the elimination mechanism of lyases (Greiling et al., 1975). H203A and H203D mutations were introduced, and mutant r-heparinases I were expressed in E. coli. While the H203A mutant had no detectable enzymatic activity, the H203D mutant showed a 30-fold decrease in activity. The kinetic parameters for (-L)r-heparinase I and for the mutants are shown in Table 3. These results strongly indicate that histidine 203 is an essential amino acid for enzyme activity. In addition, the results point to the fact that the heparin binding region around residue 203 is in close proximity to the scissile bond during catalysis.Table 3 Open table in a new tab For enzymatic reactions the interplay between binding and catalysis determines both specificity and rate of reaction. This interplay is especially interesting for eliminases/lyases that degrade complex acidic polysaccharides like pectin and heparin, which are highly heterogeneous polymers. In the case of the pectate lyases, while the three-dimensional structures of the enzymes are available, there is limited information and understanding of the residues and the domains of the enzyme involved in catalysis (Yoder et al., 1993a). Little is known of the role of binding in catalysis for the eliminases in general, and the current study addresses this issue. Chemical and proteolytic digests of heparinase I in direct binding and in competition assays, were used to identify peptides that interact specifically with heparin. CNBr digests of heparinase I reproducibly gave eight fragments, six of which were partial digests from the blocked N terminus. Hybridization of the CNBr-generated fragments to radiolabeled heparin showed that only one fragment (CNBr-8) bound significant amounts of heparin (Table 1). CNBr-8 spanned residues 195-290 and is also a partial digest, as it contained a part of CNBr-7 (residues 273-290). Since CNBr-7 did not bind heparin, the binding site is most likely located in the former half of CNBr-8 (residues 195-272). It is noteworthy that undigested heparinase I and partial N-terminal CNBr-generated fragments (CNBr-1, −2, −3, and −5) that contained the heparin binding sequence bound relatively less heparin than the CNBr-8 fragment. It is possible that greater heparin binding to CNBr-8 was due to better accessibility of the heparin binding site in CNBr-8. Tryptic peptides td4, td39, and td45 were selectively affected by heparin, and not chondroitin sulfate, thus reinforcing the specificity of binding of these peptides to heparin. Peptides td39 and td45 are contained in CNBr-8, while td4 contains the active site cysteine 135 (see below). The results of heparin binding and competition experiments, taken together, point to the residues 195-221 as being directly involved in heparin binding. Furthermore, a synthetic 18-mer peptide (HBP-I; corresponding to residues 196-213 in the region) not only bound heparin specifically in a dot blot assay, but also altered enzyme activity. It can thus be concluded that residues 195-221 constitute the primary heparin binding site in heparinase I. This site belongs to a very basic region of heparinase I, with two Cardin-Weintraub heparin binding consensus sequences and a calcium coordination motif. However, heparin competition experiments indicate heparin binding to td4. It is possible that in the native heparinase I, protein folding brings the lysine and/or arginine residues contained in td4 close to the heparin binding site, and all these residues together constitute a heparin binding domain in heparinase I. The presence of such a domain is supported by the PCMB labeling results, where PCMB-labeled heparinase I protects the lysine residues in the heparin binding site from tryptic cleavage. Heparin binding to heparinase I (Kd 60 nM) was demonstrated using ACE. This is about 1 order of magnitude higher than the dissociation constants determined by the same technique for binding of heparin to bFGF (2.2 nM) and AT III (11 nM) (Lee and Lander, 1991). This also is consistent with heparinase I eluting from a heparin affinity column at 200 mM NaCl, while bFGF and other heparin binding growth factors typically elute around 1-1.5 M NaCl (Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987). When ACE was performed with modified heparinase I (where the cysteines were blocked with IAA), there was no alteration on the heparin retardation, indicating that cysteine 135 does not influence heparin binding, but affects only enzyme catalysis. As a region of the heparin binding site of heparinase I (residues 206-220) is homologous to the calcium binding loop of EF-hand domains, we set out to investigate the role of calcium in heparinase I activity. We find that heparinase I activity increases with calcium concentrations up to around 5 mM. It is possible that purification of heparinase I with a hydroxyl apatite-binding step in earlier reports (Dietrich et al., 1973; Langer et al., 1982; Linhardt et al., 1986; Yoshida, 1991) obscured calcium-based activation of heparinase I. From equilibrium dialysis, it was found that calcium binds to heparin at a stoichiometry of about 1 calcium ion/tetrasaccharide (Boyd et al., 1980; Hunter et al., 1988), and fiber diffraction studies show that calcium causes a significant change in the helical structure of heparin, heparan sulfate, and other glycosaminoglycans (Nieduszynski, 1985). This suggests that calcium, by binding to specific regions of heparin, alters heparin conformation and hence activates heparinase I. Furthermore, pectate lyase, an enzyme from the same family of acidic polysaccharide eliminases as heparinase I, is also activated by calcium (Yoder et al., 1993b). The recently solved crystal structures of three pectate lyases showed that the substrate binding cleft was embedded with one or more calcium ions (at the calcium binding loop of EF-hand domains), indicating a direct interaction between calcium and the enzyme (Pickersgill et al., 1994; Yoder et al., 1993a, 1993b). Interestingly, the putative calcium binding sequence in heparinase I is contained in the heparin binding site, which appears to be close to the active site cysteine 135 in the correctly folded active protein. Therefore, the effect of calcium on heparinase I and other acidic polysaccharide lyases, is possibly mediated through a conformational change of the substrate upon calcium binding, which is further stabilized by direct interaction between enzyme and calcium at the active site. Specific interactions between the heparin binding domain of heparinase I and unique heparin sequences might determine the catalytic specificity of heparinases. The three heparinases from F. heparinum are specific for different linkages in the heparin chain (Desai et al., 1993), and heparinase I is much less active in cleaving tetrasaccharides compared to full-length heparin (Rice and Linhardt, 1989). This argues that heparin binding to heparinase I involves at least a pentasaccharide or longer region of heparin, similar to the heparin binding regions of bFGF and antithrombin III, which have rather large (20 Å or more) binding regions to accommodate close contacts (Rapraeger, 1993; Margalit, 1993; Schreuder et al., 1994). It is interesting to note that in the presence of HBP-I, tetrasaccharide 3 (ΔU2SHNS,6S) (Rice and Linhardt, 1989) was cleaved by heparinase I. It is possible that HBP-I “presents” this saccharide to heparinase I and facilitates cleavage. Alternately, tetrasaccharide 3 containing sequence in heparin perhaps is a “hot spot” region to which heparinase I binds during its random endolytic cleavage of heparin (Cohen and Linhardt, 1990). Histidine residues are involved in several enzymatic reactions via different mechanisms, which include acid/base catalysis, electrophilic catalysis, and substrate binding through electrostatic interactions (Munier et al., 1992). To differentiate between a substrate binding and a catalytic role for histidine 203 in heparinase I, this residue was replaced with alanine (which can perform neither of the above functions) and with aspartic acid (which can play a role in acid/base catalysis but is not known to participate in heparin binding). The H203A mutation abolished enzyme activity, while the H203D mutant retained residual activity, strongly suggesting a catalytic role for this residue. ( 3Godavarti, R., Ernst, S., Venkataraman, G., Cooney, C. L., Langer, R., and Sasisekharan, R., manuscript in preparation.) It is considered unlikely that a change in the binding site far away from the scissile bond could produce such a dramatic change in enzyme activity. It is possible that histidine acts as a nucleophilic residue in the elimination mechanism, similar to that suggested for hyaluronate lyase (Greiling et al., 1975). Alternately, the scissile bond cleavage might occur through a proton relay mechanism involving histidine 203 and another nucleophile in close proximity to this residue during elimination reaction (Gacesa, 1987). The site-directed mutation experiments taken together with the biochemical studies provide compelling evidence for histidine 203 being in close proximity to the scissile HI linkage during catalysis. In a previous report, an active site residue (cysteine 135) was identified and characterized by chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis (Sasisekharan et al., 1995). It was found that this active site has a net positive environment and may be close to the heparin binding region. From the results described in this work and from the earlier study (Sasisekharan et al., 1995), a molecular mechanism for the interplay between binding and catalysis is emerging; cysteine 135 is catalytically active, but is not a determinant for heparin binding. The heparin binding site (residues 195-221) drives enzymatic selectivity in terms of substrate size, and the histidine 203 from this region also assists the catalytic mechanism, possibly by acting as a secondary nucleophile or as an essential amino acid in a possible “proton relay system.” This site also contains the calcium co-ordination site, which bridges heparin to heparinase through calcium and may orient the substrate to the active site region. In conclusion, we propose that the heparin binding site (residues 195-221) and the basic residues (lysine 132, arginine 141) close to cysteine 135 together constitute a heparin binding domain in heparinase I. The heparin binding domain provides the necessary charge complementarity for very specific heparin binding on the one hand, while on the other it creates a basic environment for biasing the active site reactivity (Fig. 6).

Here we demonstrate that both thrombin and a synthetic peptide ligand for the thrombin receptor (sequence SFLLRN) caused phosphorylation and heterologous desensitization of the receptors for C5a, IL-8, and PAF but not that for formylpeptides as measured by agonist-stimulated [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding to membranes. Consistent with the PAF receptor phosphorylation, both thrombin and thrombin receptor peptide inhibited phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, and degranulation stimulated by PAF. Unexpectedly, despite heterologous desensitization at the level of receptor/G protein activation, there was enhancement (“priming”) by thrombin of subsequent activities stimulated by C5a and IL-8 as well as fMLP. The priming effect of thrombin was blocked by its inhibitor, hirudin. However, two other activators of the thrombin receptor, the peptide SFLLRN and trypsin, stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells but did not cause priming. In addition, SFLLRN and the thrombin receptor antagonist peptide FLLRN both inhibited thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization but not priming. Furthermore, the proteolytically active γ-thrombin, which does not stimulate the tethered ligand thrombin receptor and caused little or no Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells, effectively primed the response to fMLP. These data demonstrate that heterologous receptor phosphorylation and attenuation of G protein activation are not, by themselves, sufficient for the inhibition of biological responses mediated by C5a and IL-8. Moreover, thrombin appears to utilize mechanism(s) independent of its tethered ligand receptor to selectively prime phospholipase C-mediated biological responses of the C5a, IL-8, and formylpeptide receptors but not PAF. Because C5a, IL-8, and formylpeptide activate phospholipase Cβ2, whereas PAF stimulates a different phospholipase C, the striking selectivity of thrombin's priming may be mediated via its ability to enhance receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ2.

Phagocytic leukocytes respond to multiple inflammatory signals and play a key role in immunological reactions. Among the well defined stimulants for leukocytes are chemoattractants: a cleavage product of the fifth component of complement (C5a), interleukin-8 (IL-8), ( 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8interleukin-8fMLPN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylanalinePAF1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineET-FRET-C5aR, ET-IL-8R, and ET-PAFR, epitope-tagged receptors for fMLP, C5a, IL-8, and PAF, respectivelyPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTRPthrombin receptor peptidePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphateGPIbglycoprotein IbPtxpertussis toxinPLCphospholipase C.) platelet-activating factor (PAF), and N-formylated peptides (e.g. fMLP)(1.Snyderman R.

These chemoattractants mediate their biological responses via the activation of cell surface receptors that are coupled to phospholipase C via G proteins. Leukocyte responsiveness to chemoattractants can be “primed” or desensitized by prior stimulation(1.Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R.

Priming or enhanced responsiveness to subsequent stimuli may be caused by low concentrations of substance P, chemoattractants, phorbol esters, Ca2+ ionophores, and cytokines, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor-α(1.Snyderman R.

There is convincing evidence that receptor phosphorylation is one mechanism by which many G protein-coupled receptors undergo both homologous and heterologous desensitization. Recent evidence indicates an additional mechanism for chemoattractant receptor desensitization, a process resulting in reduced phosphoinositide hydrolysis via a decreased activity of phospholipase C (9.Richardson R.M.

The present study was undertaken to more precisely define the effects of thrombin on responses stimulated by fMLP, C5a, and other chemoattractant receptors. Here we describe a novel finding that thrombin, utilizing a mechanism unrelated to the activation of its tethered ligand G protein coupled receptor, selectively primes phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, and exocytosis stimulated via the activation of receptors for formylpeptide, C5a, and IL-8 but not PAF.

Calcium measurements were carried out in a Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (Model 650-19) with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm. Maximum and minimum fluorescence were determined in the presence of 0.1% Triton-X and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH. 8.0, 5 mM EGTA, respectively.

Total [3H]inositol phosphates were separated on columns of Dowex formate(4.Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the assay of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ([3H]PIP2), RBL-2H3 cells (0.5 × 105) were labeled overnight with [3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml). The lipids were extracted and separated by chromatography on silica gel 60 F254 that had been treated with a solution of 2 mM EDTA and 1% potassium oxalate as described(24.Lo T. Saul W. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4141-4145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled PIP2 (20 μg) were added to all extracts, which were then evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The residues were dissolved in chloroform:methanol (2:1), and mixture was applied to the plates. The chromatographs were developed with the following solvent system: chloroform:methanol:4 N NH4OH (9:7:2, v/v/v). The plates were exposed to iodine vapor to visualize the PIP2. The spots were scraped from the plate, and the amount of [3H]PIP2 was determined by scintillation counting. RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing epitope-tagged receptors for fMLP (ET-FR), C5a (ET-C5aR), IL-8 (ET-IL-8R), and PAF (ET-PAFR) were incubated with [32P]orthophospate and stimulated with their respective ligands, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), thrombin (1 unit/ml), or TRP (sequence SFLLRN, 100 μM). All receptors underwent homologous phosphorylation (Fig. 1). PMA, thrombin, and TRP caused phosphorylation of ET-C5aR, ET-IL-8R, and ET-PAFR but not ET-FR. The extent of thrombin- and TRP-induced phosphorylation of the susceptible receptors was less than agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation. To determine whether receptor phosphorylation was correlated with desensitization at the level of G protein activation, cells expressing selected receptors (ET-C5aR and ET-PAFR) were treated with their respective ligands (C5a or PAF), PMA, thrombin, or TRP, and agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, thrombin, TRP, and PMA inhibited the responses to C5a and PAF. Similar to receptor phosphorylation, the extent of heterologous desensitization was less than homologous desensitization for both receptors (Fig. 2). Thrombin did not cause inhibition of fMLP-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes(4.Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2:Effects of thrombin and TRP on chemoattractant receptor-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes. RBL-2H3 cells expressing ET-C5aR and ET-PAFR were left untreated (CON) or treated with their respective ligands C5a or PAF, PMA, thrombin (THR), or TRP as in Fig. 1. Membranes were prepared and assayed for agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS. The values are presented as percentages of net [35S]GTPγS bound, which is defined as the maximum amount of agonist-stimulated response from untreated membranes. For ET-C5aR the basal and C5a-stimulated responses (untreated) were 7097 ± 216 and 15472 ± 47 cpm, respectively. For ET-PAFR, the basal and PAF-stimulated (untreated) responses were 6446 ± 350 and 12330 ± 48 cpm, respectively. The basal [35S]GTPγS bound to membranes treated with ligand, PMA, thrombin, and TRP were similar to basal responses in the absence of pretreatment. The data are the means ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thrombin (1 unit/ml) and TRP (100 μM) caused a rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which reached a maximum of 1074 ± 60 and 814 ± 25 nM respectively, 5-10 s after stimulation and returned to basal within 2-3 min. These responses were due to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ because chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA had no significant effect on thrombin- or TRP-induced response (data not shown). Exposure of cells to thrombin followed 3 min later by a submaximal concentration of fMLP (10 nM) resulted in a 4-fold enhancement of Ca2+ mobilization when compared with the response in the absence of thrombin (Fig. 3). TRP, however, had no effect on the Ca2+ response stimulated by fMLP. Pertussis toxin (Ptx, 100 ng/ml, 4 h) had no effect on Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by thrombin but totally blocked the response to fMLP both in thrombin-treated and untreated cells (data not shown). The effects of thrombin and TRP were also tested on Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by C5a, IL-8, and PAF in cells expressing appropriate receptors. As shown in Fig. 3, thrombin but not TRP-primed Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by the C5a and IL-8 by 2-3-fold. In contrast, both thrombin and TRP inhibited PAF-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization. To further test the specificity of thrombin for priming, its effect on Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by cross-linking by antigen of endogenously expressed cell surface IgE receptors (24.Lo T. Saul W. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4141-4145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was determined. Antigen (dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin; 1 ng/ml) alone stimulated a 152 ± 14 nM mobilization of Ca2+, whereas pretreatment with thrombin (1 unit/ml, 3 min) followed by antigen resulted in a 128 ± 12 nM mobilization of Ca2+. In the absence of thrombin or TRP, fMLP caused a dose-dependent increase in the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates and release of β-hexosaminidase (Fig. 4). Thrombin enhanced the maximum responses stimulated by fMLP by 2-3-fold. TRP (100 μM), however, had no effect on fMLP-induced responses. The dose-response effect of thrombin on fMLP-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis demonstrated that the EC50 and EC100 values for priming by thrombin were approximately 0.1 and 1.0 unit/ml, respectively (data not shown). The effects of thrombin and TRP on the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates and secretion of β-hexosaminidase stimulated by C5a, IL-8, and PAF were also determined. Cells were preincubated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) or TRP (100 μM) for 3 min and then stimulated with concentrations of chemoattractants that alone caused a 2-3-fold increase in the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates and release of about 20-30% of total cellular β-hexosaminidase. As shown in Fig. 5, thrombin but not TRP primed both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and secretion stimulated by C5a and IL-8. In contrast, both thrombin and TRP inhibited these responses to PAF. The fMLP-induced generation of [3H]inositol phosphates was used to further characterize the priming phenomenon. The priming effect of thrombin was not dependent on its continuous presence because replacement of thrombin-containing buffer 3 min after its addition with fresh buffer without thrombin resulted in the same magnitude of priming as when thrombin was not removed by washing (Fig. 6A). The priming effect of thrombin reached a maximum by 3-5 min, remained elevated for about 15 min, and returned to basal by 60 min (Fig. 6B). When cells were preincubated for 5 min with thrombin in the presence of Ca2+ (1 mM) or EGTA (100 μM; no added Ca2+), washed, and stimulated with fMLP in the presence of Ca2+ (1 mM), the extent of priming was the same (data not shown). To test whether the effect of thrombin correlated with an increase in substrate availability for phospholipase C, RBL-H3 cells were labeled with [3H]inositol and exposed to thrombin (1 unit/ml) or TRP (100 μM) for 5 min and then the amount of [3H]PIP2 was determined. The levels of incorporation of [3H]inositol in to PIP2 in response to buffer, thrombin, and TRP were 4309 ± 95, 4329 ± 210, and 4286 ± 105, respectively. Thrombin receptor agonist and antagonist peptides SFLLRN and FLLRN (16.Vu T.-K. H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Choughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2676) Google Scholar) were utilized to test the role of the tethered ligand thrombin receptor on priming. As shown in Table 1, the peptide SFLLRN stimulated a substantial Ca2+ mobilization and desensitized the thrombin-stimulated Ca2+ response by >70% but did not inhibit the priming effect of thrombin. The thrombin receptor antagonist peptide FLLRN caused no Ca2+ mobilization and inhibited the response to thrombin by > 75% but did not block priming by thrombin (Table 1).Table 1 Open table in a new tab Hirudin binds to the anion binding exosite and the enzymatic cleavage pocket of thrombin and prevents thrombin from binding and cleaving its receptor(25.Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 847: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hirudin completely blocked both Ca2+ mobilization and priming of the fMLP response by thrombin but had no effect on the fMLP response itself (Table 2). Thrombin inactivated by diisopropylphosphofluoridate has no catalytic activity but still binds to the seven transmembrane domain thrombin receptor via the anion binding exosite(26.Carney D.H. Stiernberg J. Fenton II, J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Diisopropylphosphofluoridate-inactivated α-thrombin did not stimulate Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells and had no effect on the fMLP response (Table 2). γ-Thrombin retains its catalytic activity, but its binding site for the tethered ligand thrombin receptor is disrupted(26.Carney D.H. Stiernberg J. Fenton II, J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). γ-Thrombin itself caused only a small increase in Ca2+ mobilization but primed the response to fMLP by about 3-fold. Trypsin, a serine protease, stimulated a substantial mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in RBL-2H3 cells but did not prime the response to fMLP. Another serine protease, elastase, which did not stimulate Ca2+ mobilization, had no effect on the fMLP response (Table 2). Other proteases, such as chymotrypsin and cathepsin G stimulated little or no Ca2+ mobilization but primed the response to fMLP by approximately 1.5-fold. This compares with a 4-fold priming of the fMLP response by thrombin.Table 2 Open table in a new tab Regulation of receptor action has been the subject of intense investigation with one focus being the mechanisms of desensitization. There is abundant evidence for a role of receptor phosphorylation in homologous and heterologous desensitization(8.Dohlman D.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Indeed, the inability of the formylpeptide receptor to undergo heterologous desensitization was attributed to the absence of a phosphorylation site for protein kinase C on any of its predicted intracellular loops(4.Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Tardif M. Merey L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented herein demonstrate that both thrombin and TRP stimulated phosphorylation of the chemoattractant receptors for C5a, IL-8, and PAF but not for fMLP. Furthermore, phosphorylation of susceptible receptors was correlated with heterologous desensitization at the level of receptor/G protein coupling. Unexpectedly, although both thrombin and TRP decreased G protein activation by C5a, thrombin primed subsequent phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, and degranulation stimulated by all the peptide chemoattractants (fMLP, C5a, and IL-8). The specificity of thrombin for the priming of peptide chemoattractant-mediated responses is demonstrated by the finding that thrombin inhibited these responses to PAF and had no effect on Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by the IgE receptors. These data suggest a surprising complexity in the regulation of receptor actions. Whereas signals can lead to receptor phosphorylation and desensitization at an early stage in the peptide chemoattractant signal transduction pathway, the same or other signals may result in markedly enhanced downstream activities. The data herein indicate that the priming effect of thrombin requires its proteolytic activity but is unlikely to be mediated via its tethered ligand receptor. This contention is based on the following observations. The peptide agonist of the thrombin receptor, SFLLRN, stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells but did not prime the response to fMLP. Desensitization of the thrombin receptor by SFLLRN and treatment with the thrombin receptor antagonist peptide FLLRN both inhibited thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization by >70%, but neither blocked thrombin's ability to prime Ca2+ mobilization to fMLP. γ-Thrombin, which does not bind to the tethered ligand thrombin receptor but has proteolytic activity(26.Carney D.H. Stiernberg J. Fenton II, J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), stimulated little or no Ca2+ mobilization but effectively primed the response to fMLP. The priming signal is also unlikely to be derived from peptide chemoattractant receptors, because they desensitize each other's inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation and Ca2+ mobilization(9.Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The effect of thrombin is not solely due to its serine protease activity because trypsin and elastase, which are serine proteases(28.Jones C.L.A. Witte D.P. Feller M.J. Fugman D.A. Dorn II, G.W. Lieberman M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 271-282Google Scholar), did not cause priming. However, other proteases such as cathepsin G and chymotrypsin primed fMLP-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization, albeit to a lesser extent than thrombin. Whether cathepsin G and chymotrypsin utilize the same or different mechanisms to cause priming remains to be determined. In fibroblasts, both thrombin and TRP stimulate a transient Ca2+ mobilization of similar magnitude, but only thrombin is mitogenic(14.Vouret-Craviari V. van Obberghen-Schilling E. Rasmussen U.B. Pavirani J. Leccocq J.P. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mitogenic signal of thrombin persist long after (30 min) the transient Ca2+ mobilization has returned to basal(29.Vouret-Craviari V. Obberghen-Schilling E.V. Scimeca J.C. Obberghen E.V. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the existence of an additional receptor for thrombin's mitogenic activity has been postulated(14.Vouret-Craviari V. van Obberghen-Schilling E. Rasmussen U.B. Pavirani J. Leccocq J.P. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29.Vouret-Craviari V. Obberghen-Schilling E.V. Scimeca J.C. Obberghen E.V. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The identity of this putative receptor or mechanism is yet to be determined. The data herein showing that both thrombin and TRP stimulate transient Ca2+ mobilization but only thrombin provides a sustained priming signal suggest that the priming and mitogenic responses of thrombin may be mediated via a similar pathway. In platelets, two glycoproteins (GPIb and GPV) interact with thrombin, but the biological significance of these interactions is not known(18.Lopez J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S.

Guillin M.-C. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GPIb is a high affinity thrombin receptor in human platelets(18.Lopez J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 19.Gralnick H.R. Williams S. McKeown L.P. Hansmann K. Fenton II, J.W. Krutzsch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The demonstration that γ-thrombin, which does not bind to GPIb in human platelets(33.Jandrot-Perrus M. Didry D. Guillin M.-C. Nurden A.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), causes priming in RBL-2H3 cells suggests that GPIb is unlikely to be involved in priming. GPV (molecular mass, 82 kDa) is the only detectable membrane surface protein to be hydrolyzed by both α- and γ-thrombin as well as by chymotrypsin(30.McGowan E.B. Ding A. Detwiler T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11243-11248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Bienz D. Schnippering W. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1986; 68: 720-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Jandrot-Perrus M. Guillin M.-C. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Its proteolysis results in the generation and extracellular release of a 69.5-kDa soluble fragment. If GPV is expressed in RBL-2H3 cells, it is a candidate for involvement in priming. The phenomenology of priming of chemoattractant receptor-mediated responses have been well delineated, but the molecular mechanisms are not known. For example, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor enhances Ca2+ mobilization and superoxide generation stimulated by both peptide (fMLP and C5a) and lipid (PAF) chemoattractants as well as by direct activation of G proteins(6.McColl S.R. Beauseigle D. Gilbert C. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3047-3053PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the priming effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor may reside in its ability to cause de novo synthesis of cellular G proteins or activation of phosphoinositide kinase, which increases the availability of substrates for phospholipase C(7.Naccache P.H. Hamelin B. Gaudry M. Bourgoin S. Cell. Signalling. 1991; 3: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34.MacPhee C.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the studies presented here, the effect reached a maximum 3-5 min after thrombin addition, and thus de novo protein synthesis is unlikely to be involved. In addition, thrombin actually decreased G protein activation by the C5a receptor yet primed its subsequent responses. Furthermore, under optimal conditions of priming, thrombin had no significant effect on PIP2 levels in RBL-2H3 cells. The striking selectivity of thrombin for priming responses for peptide chemoattractants (fMLP, C5a, and IL-8) indicates that the target is distal to the receptor but is a component of the signal transduction pathway shared by fMLP, C5a, and IL-8 but not PAF. The peptide chemoattractant receptors couple to a Ptx-sensitive G protein, presumably Giα2, whereas PAF receptors utilize a predominantly Ptx-insensitive G protein(3.Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 35.Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Cotransfection studies in COS cells demonstrated that fMLP, C5a, and IL-8 utilize βγ subunit (Gβγ) of Giα2 to activate PLCβ2, whereas PAF utilizes the α subunit of a Gq-like G protein to activate a different PLC(2.Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Dhar A. Shukla S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9123-9127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Kuruvilla A. Pielop C. Shearer W.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5433-5442PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that Ptx blocks fMLP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in both thrombin-treated and untreated cells indicates that priming is not simply a switch in the coupling of the fMLP receptor from a Ptx-sensitive to a Ptx-insensitive G protein. The activity of PLC is a likely locus for the priming event because phosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by peptide chemoattractants is enhanced, although the enzyme's substrate level is not. How thrombin primes chemoattractant receptor-mediated phospholipase C activation can only be speculated at present. Thrombin primes responses to chemoattractant receptors that utilize Gβγ to activate PLC, so modification of either Gβγ or PLC by thrombin may lead to enhanced generation of inositol phosphates. The γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gγ) are members of a family of proteins that are post-translationally modified at their carboxyl termini by isoprenylation, proteolytic cleavage, and carboxymethylation(38.Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). This modification of Gγ is essential for membrane association of Gβγ and activation of effector molecules such as PLCβ2(39.Dietrich A. Meister M. Brazil D. Camps M. Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, demethylation of Gβγ, which does not affect receptor-mediated GTPγS binding to G proteins, is at least 10-fold less effective in stimulating PLCβ2 than its methylated counterpart(40.Parish C.A. Smrcka A.V. Rando R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7722-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, fMLP-stimulated carboxymethylation of Gγ2 is associated with neutrophil activation(41.Philips M.R. Staud R. Pillinger M. Feoktistov A. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2283-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42.Pike M.C. Snyderman R. Cell. 1982; 28: 107-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that thrombin enhances the carboxymethylation levels of Gγ2, resulting in more efficient stimulation of PLCβ2. This would explain the observation that thrombin enhances PLC-mediated respones to peptide chemoattractant receptors despite the fact that thrombin partially inhibits their G protein activation, as measured by GTPγS binding to membranes. In human platelets, thrombin causes proteolytic cleavage of the 155-kDa PLCβ3 in a calpain-dependent manner to generate a 100-kDa fragment(43.Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The demonstration that this and a 110-kDa truncated form of the enzyme display markedly enhanced stimulation by Gβγ when compared with the native PLCβ3 (43.Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 44.Blank J.L. Shaw K. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25184-25191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that priming by thrombin could involve proteolytic cleavage of PLCβ. In addition, a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 448-464 of PLCβ2 stimulates the activity of this enzyme(45.Simones A.P. Schnabel P. Pipkorn R. Camp M. Gierschik P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the peptide does not stimulate PLCβ2 activity per se but enhances the ability of an already active enzyme to hydrolyze additional substrates. It has not been determined whether thrombin leads to the formation of such a peptide in RBL-2H3 cells. There is evidence that PLCγ possesses a domain within its structure that inhibits the catalytic activity of the enzyme(46.Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, processes that enhance the ability of PLC to be activated may do so via the release of an inhibitory constraint. Therefore, the ability of thrombin to modify the Gβγ, cause proteolytic cleavage of PLCβ2, remove an inhibitory constraint from the enzyme or enhance its activation by other mechanisms could explain the observed specificity for thrombin-induced priming. These possibilities are amenable to future investigations. The data herein demonstrate that thrombin modifies RBL-2H3 cells to selectively enhance the phospholipase C-mediated responses to peptide chemoattractants (fMLP, C5a, and IL-8). We speculate that the striking selectivity of thrombin for priming peptide chemoattractant receptor-mediated responses is due to its ability to enhance the ligand-stimulated activation of PLCβ2. Of note, we have recently characterized a new form of cross-desensitization among receptors for peptide chemoattractants and suggested that the mechanism of this type of regulation involves inhibition of PLCβ2 activity(9.Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 47.Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3267-3275PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of the activity of phospholipases could have a major regulatory role in cross-receptor signaling. Understanding the molecular details of how differential regulation of PLCβ2 activity results in the priming and cross-desensitization of peptide chemoattractant receptors should provide new and important information on the mechanisms controlling receptor regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2084920621,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a member of the CXC chemokine family, is a key activator of neutrophils. We have previously shown that two novel CC chemokine-like properties, namely monocyte chemoattraction and binding to CC CKR-1, are introduced into IL-8 by mutating Leu25 to the conserved tyrosine present in CC chemokines. To further investigate the role of this position in receptor selectivity, we have mutated Leu25 to cysteine. The protein folds correctly with two disulfide bonds and a free thiol group at Cys25. This mutant behaves overall like wild-type IL-8, with little change in neutrophil chemotaxis and IL-8 receptor binding, and has no effect on CC CKR-1. These data are consistent with cysteine being approximately isosteric with the natural amino acid leucine. However, modification of the cysteine by addition of a fluorescent N-methyl-N-(2-N-methyl, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)aminoethyl)acetamido (NBD) group lowers potency in neutrophil chemotaxis and affinity in IL-8 receptor binding assays by 2 orders of magnitude. This Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant introduces monocyte chemoattractant activity and the ability to displace 125I-labeled macrophage inflammatory protein-1α from the recombinant CC CKR-1 receptor. Additionally, we show a specific interaction between the fluorescent mutant and the N-terminal 34-amino acid peptide from CC CKR-1. This confirms the importance of this region in IL-8 in receptor binding and in conferring specificity between CXC and CC chemokines. Circular dichroism spectra of the IL-8 mutants having CC chemokine-like activity show a consistent drop in α-helical content compared with the spectra for wild-type IL-8. This suggests that distortion of the C-terminal helix may play a role in chemokine receptor-ligand selectivity. Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a member of the CXC chemokine family, is a key activator of neutrophils. We have previously shown that two novel CC chemokine-like properties, namely monocyte chemoattraction and binding to CC CKR-1, are introduced into IL-8 by mutating Leu25 to the conserved tyrosine present in CC chemokines. To further investigate the role of this position in receptor selectivity, we have mutated Leu25 to cysteine. The protein folds correctly with two disulfide bonds and a free thiol group at Cys25. This mutant behaves overall like wild-type IL-8, with little change in neutrophil chemotaxis and IL-8 receptor binding, and has no effect on CC CKR-1. These data are consistent with cysteine being approximately isosteric with the natural amino acid leucine. However, modification of the cysteine by addition of a fluorescent N-methyl-N-(2-N-methyl, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)aminoethyl)acetamido (NBD) group lowers potency in neutrophil chemotaxis and affinity in IL-8 receptor binding assays by 2 orders of magnitude.

This suggests that distortion of the C-terminal helix may play a role in chemokine receptor-ligand selectivity. Chemokines are a large family of 8-10-kDa proteins that are important in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes in inflammatory diseases. CXC chemokines, for example interleukin-8 (IL-8), ( 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8interleukin-8IL-8R-A and IL-8R-Binterleukin-8 receptors A and B, respectivelyMIP-1α and MIP-1βmacrophage inflammatory protein-1α and −1β, respectivelyRANTESregulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secretedMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1IANBD-amideN,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamineNBDN-methyl-N-(2-N-methyl, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)aminoethyl)acetamidoPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPTHphenylthiohydantoin.) play a key role in acute inflammation by attracting and activating neutrophils. Two receptors, IL-8R-A (1.Holmes M.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and IL-8R-B(2.Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), have been identified that bind with nanomolar affinity to IL-8. The regions necessary for receptor activation and subsequent signaling through G-proteins have been localized at the flexible amino terminus of IL-8 (Glu4-Leu5-Arg6) by mutagenesis and peptide synthesis studies(3.Hébert C.A.

Members of the CC chemokine family, such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) and RANTES, activate a variety of cell types including monocytes during chronic inflammation. The CC chemokines mediate this effect through a different family of receptors including CC CKR-1, which binds MIP-1α and RANTES(5.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J.

As in CXC chemokines, it is the amino-terminal region of the ligand that is responsible for receptor activation. Truncated N-terminal mutants of MCP-1 have been shown to be antagonists of MCP-1-induced monocyte chemotaxis(12.Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants of RANTES that have an additional methionine residue at the amino terminus have been shown to be antagonists of THP-1 and T-cell activation (13.Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.-O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To date, no natural human CXC ligand has been found to bind a CC chemokine receptor. To investigate the molecular basis of this selectivity, we have compared the primary sequences of CXC and CC chemokines. In the region of IL-8 corresponding to the inner β-sheet, there is a leucine residue, corresponding to Leu25, that is conserved as a small hydrophobic amino acid in CXC chemokines, but is always a tyrosine in CC chemokines. We have made the Leu25xrarr; Tyr mutant and shown its ability to attract peripheral blood monocytes and displace MIP-1α from its CC CKR-1 receptor, two activities that IL-8 does not possess (14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have further investigated the molecular basis of this receptor selectivity by making the Leu25xrarr; Cys mutation. Cysteine is approximately isosteric with leucine and would be expected to have similar activity compared with wild-type IL-8. However, the free thiol group is chemically reactive and can be modified with a variety of reagents such as the fluorescent group N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD-amide) that we added onto Cys25. We show here that the Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant binds to IL-8R-A and IL-8R-B and activates neutrophils while having no effect on monocytes. Chemical modification of the cysteine residue with a fluorescent NBD group, however, introduces monocyte chemoattraction and the ability to displace MIP-1α from its CC CKR-1 receptor. This fluorescent probe has been used to study heterodimer formation when unlabeled IL-8 is added as well as binding to a 34-amino acid peptide from the C terminus of the CC CKR-1 receptor. Finally, by comparison of the CD spectra, we can show that IL-8 mutants showing CC chemokine activity have a lower α-helical content compared with IL-8. This indicates that a distortion of the C-terminal helix is important in altering the selectivity between CXC and CC chemokines and suggests a possible mechanism for receptor selectivity. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Human IL-8, cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a peripheral blood monocyte λgt11 cDNA library, was expressed in Escherichia coli B-cells using the trp promoter (19.Alouani S. Gaertner H.F. Mermod J.-J. Power C.A. Bacon K.B. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins were made by resynthesizing a cassette of DNA between the NdeI and SacI sites coding for amino acids 1-50. The Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant was constructed using the following oligonucleotides, and the sequence was verified by the dideoxy chain termination method: 5′-CCTTTCCACCCCAAATTTATCAAAGAATGTAGAGTGATTGAGAGT-3′ (upper strand) and 5′-TGGTCCACTCTCAATCACTCTACATTCTTTGATAAATTTGGGGTG-3′ (lower strand). Both wild-type IL-8 and the Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant are highly expressed using this system. The purification using 100 g of E. coli cells, wet weight, was similar to the method described previously(14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The glutathione used in the renaturation step was shown to be attached to the thiol and was consequently removed by dissolving the protein lyophilysate in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4), adding dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1 mM, and incubating for 1 h at 37°C. The sample was desalted on a PD-10 gel filtration column in the same buffer, dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and lyophilized. The molecular mass of the final protein was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy(15.Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Magnenat E. Bacon K.B. Wells T.N.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was performed after gas-phase hydrolysis of 1 nmol of protein in 6 M HCl containing 1 mg/ml phenol at 112°C for 24 h. The resultant amino acids were quantified using a Beckman 6300 system. Titration of thiols was done using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (Ellman's reagent) (16.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21610) Google Scholar). For the determination of accessible free thiols, 1 mg of protein was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. A fresh solution of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (0.01 M in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was added to the protein solution, and the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored until a stable value was reached. The calculation of the number of free thiol groups was carried out using an absorbance coefficient of ε = 13,000 M−1 cm−1. To determine the total number of sulfhydryl groups, 1 mg of protein was reduced with 1 mM dithiothreitol and denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride at 60°C for 1 h. Excess dithiothreitol was removed on a Brownlee C-8 HPLC column (220 × 2.1 mm), and the protein was lyophilized. The lyophilysate was taken up in the above-mentioned Tris buffer, and the determination of thiols was carried out as described above. IANBD-amide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) is a hydrolytically stable iodoacetamide that has fluorescein-like spectra with excitation and emission maxima at 472 and 536 nm, respectively. The iodoacetamide group reacts irreversibly with free thiols. 0.84 mg of 100 μM IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mM borate buffer, pH 8.5. IANBD-amide dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide was added to the protein solution in 10-fold excess. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark, and the reaction was quenched by addition of 10 μl of 1 M cysteine. The modified protein was dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 6 h and then lyophilized. Mass spectroscopy was carried out to verify the correct molecular mass of the mutant protein coupled to IANBD-amide, and peptide mapping was carried out to verify that the modified residue was Cys25 and not one of the four other cysteines present in IL-8. For the peptide mapping, 4 μg of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Boehringer Mannheim; sequencing-grade) was added to 10 nM protein solubilized in 25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8 (protein/enzyme ratio of 20:1), and the solution was incubated at 37°C for 18 h in the dark. The peptides generated by proteolytic digestion were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Brownlee C-18 column (220 × 2.1 mm). The peptides were eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using a gradient from 0 to 55% over 60 min with 90% acetonitrile, 10% H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were monitored using a diode array detector at 214 and 480 nm and collected manually for sequencing. The peptide showing absorbance at 480 nm was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Model 477A pulsed liquid-phase protein sequencer with a Model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivative analyzer. One-third of the PTH-derivatives were collected in the internal fraction collector. Cycle 25 showed an amino acid with a novel PTH-derivative retention time. The absorption spectrum of this PTH-derivative was measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer against a blank containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purification of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes was carried out using fresh blood by sedimentation over dextran sulfate followed by Ficoll gradient centrifugation(14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Neutrophil chemotaxis was measured using a colorimetric assay described by Shi et al.(17.Shi Y. Kornovski B.S. Savani R. Turley E.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 164: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A 96-well chamber in which a microtiter plate can be placed (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) was used. Serial dilutions of the chemoattractants were made in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mML-glutamine, 25 mM Hepes, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. 370 μl of chemoattractant was added to the lower chamber of the assay wells and covered with a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membrane (pore size of 3 μm). 200 μl of 106 cells/ml was added to the top wells, and the assay plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The liquid in the upper wells was removed by aspiration, and 100 μl of ice-cold PBS containing 20 μM EDTA was added to each well in order to detach the cells from the underside of the membrane. After 30 min of incubation at 4°C, the liquid was removed by aspiration. Centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min allowed the migrating cells to collect in the bottom wells. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and 100 μl of 5 mg/ml dye solution (Promega) in RPMI 1640 medium was added to the cells and incubated overnight at 37°C in the dark. The reaction that monitors the conversion of tetrazolium blue into its formazan product was stopped with 100 μl of propan-2-ol acid (2 mM HCl), and the plate was left at room temperature for 3 h. Absorbance was recorded at 540 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Thermomax, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The protocol for the monocyte chemotaxis assay using the 48-well micro-Boyden chamber was described previously(14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B.

This assay was performed using HL-60 cells transfected by electroporation with the cDNA sequence for IL-8R-A and IL-8R-B. A final volume of 150 μl was added to 96-well multiscreen filter plates containing 3 × 105 HL-60 cells, 0.23 nM125I-labeled IL-8, and varying concentrations of chemokine. After incubation at 4°C, the cells were washed, and the bound radioactivity was counted(14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The data obtained were fitted using Grafit Version 3.01 (18.Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.01. Erithicus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK1993Google Scholar) with simple weighting to the equation describing a competition for a single binding site: B = Bmax/(1 + [L]/IC50). Binding of 0.3 nM125I-labeled MIP-1α to CC CKR-1 receptors on 3 × 105 COS-7 cells was competed by addition of varying concentrations of unlabeled chemokine. The activity retained on the filters after washing was counted as described previously(14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the NBD group was measured at 20°C on a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer (Omnilab AG, Geneva) using a quartz cuvette of 1-cm path length with an excitation wavelength of 472 and detecting emitted light at 536 nm. The mutant protein was dissolved at a concentration of 7.5 nM in PBS, pH 7.4. The effect of added IL-8 was studied by incubating the Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant with increasing concentrations of wild-type IL-8. The interaction of the fluorescent NBD mutant with the amino terminus of CC CKR-1 was studied using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal extracellular domain of this receptor. This amino-terminal peptide, M34A (Neosystem S. A., Strasbourg, France), has the following sequence: 1METPNTTEDYDTTTEFDYGDATPCQKVNERAFGA34. The change in fluorescence intensity was monitored when varying concentrations of the receptor peptide (10−5 to 10−11M) were added to 10 nM Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant in PBS, pH 7.4, using the same conditions described above. Two control studies were carried out; one used IL-8 that was labeled with NBD at the N terminus using a procedure similar to that described by Alouani et al.(19.Alouani S. Gaertner H.F. Mermod J.-J. Power C.A. Bacon K.B. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The second control study used RANTES that had been coupled with a NBD group via a lysine spacer to the oxidized N-terminal serine of RANTES using the same method. CD spectroscopy measurements were made in the far-ultaviolet range (198-250 nm), where the spectrum of proteins in solution is sensitive to their secondary structure. The measurements were done on an Aviv Model 62DS circular dichroism spectrometer using quartz cuvettes of 1-cm path length at 20.5°C. Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 0.03 mg/ml. A modified method of Hennessey and Johnson (20.Hennessey J.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the CD spectra in which 26 data points were used to describe the measured CD spectrum between 198 and 250 nm. These points were then fitted with a reference data set of 15 proteins of known three-dimensional structure(21.Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4562-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A trp expression system was used to express human recombinant IL-8 in E. coli B-cells(19.Alouani S. Gaertner H.F. Mermod J.-J. Power C.A. Bacon K.B. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant was assembled using an oligonucleotide cassette method. The purification and renaturation methods were identical for both proteins. The molecular mass of the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant was found to be 8676.3 ± 0.9 Da instead of 8372 Da. This additional mass of 304 could be attributed to the presence of glutathione (predicted additional molecular mass = 305.3) used in the renaturation step attached to the free thiol. Upon removal of the glutathione, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy for the mutant gave the expected mass of 8371.0 ± 1.3 Da. 100 g of cell paste yielded ∼5 mg of pure protein, which was judged to be 98% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). The determination of free sulfhydryl groups was performed using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) with wild-type IL-8 as a control(16.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21610) Google Scholar). The total number of thiols and the free number of thiols were found to be 3.95 and 0.02 for wild-type IL-8, respectively. This increased to 4.63 and 0.65 for the Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant protein. Amino acid analysis of the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys protein confirmed the expected composition. Analysis of the HPLC profile of the mutant protein after labeling with IANBD-amide indicated that all the initial material had reacted (Fig. 2). The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant migrated as a single species on reverse-phase HPLC, with a retention time of 32.78 min. After incubation with IANBD, a new peak appeared at 34.97 min on the HPLC trace. Base-line separation of the starting material and product indicated that the neutrophil activity seen for the modified protein was not due to contamination with the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant. To confirm the position of the incorporation of the NBD group, a peptide digest was performed using Glu-C protease. The fragments were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC, detecting absorbance at 495 and 214 nm. Only one peptide had significant absorbance at 495 nm, indicating the presence of the NBD group. Sequencing of this peptide gave the sequence Glu24-Xaa-Arg-Val-Ile-Glu29. The unidentified PTH-derivative at position 25 had an absorption spectrum showing a maximum at 495 nm, confirming the incorporation of NBD at this position (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Asp-N digest of Leu25xrarr; Cys. A, a single major peak was seen when absorbance was monitored at 495 nm; B, Edman sequencing of this peptide showed the release of a PTH-derivative in cycle 25 with a characteristic absorbance at 495 nm, confirming the site of modification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In neutrophil chemotaxis, IL-8 shows a saturating dose-response curve with a midpoint at ∼1.2 nM and a maximum efficacy of 12 (Fig. 4). The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant has a midpoint at 3 nM, and the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant has a midpoint at 27 nM. In these assays, RANTES showed no ability to cause neutrophil chemotaxis. Receptor binding was assayed by displacement of 125I-labeled IL-8 from IL-8R-A or IL-8R-B on HL-60 cells. IL-8 shows equal affinity for both receptors, with IC50 values of 1.4 ± 0.1 nM for IL-8R-A and 1.9 ± 0.3 nM for IL-8R-B (Fig. 5). Under the conditions of the assay, where the concentration of 125I-labeled IL-8 is much lower than its Kd value, the IC50 values for the mutants equal the Kd values, to a first approximation(28.Cheng Y. Prussoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12326) Google Scholar). The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant shows a decrease in affinity for both receptors, with IC50 values of 59 ± 0.5 and 19 ± 0.6 nM for IL-8R-A and IL-8R-B, respectively. The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant is almost 100-fold weaker than IL-8 in binding to the receptors, with IC50 values of 170 ± 0.4 nM for IL-8R-A and 150 ± 0.6 nM for IL-8R-B. In a chemotaxis assay using peripheral blood monocytes, RANTES gives a bell-shaped curve with a maximum at 1 nM and a maximal efficacy of 6 (Fig. 6). The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant protein is also able to induce monocyte chemotaxis, with a maximum at 12 nM and an efficacy similar to that of RANTES. This mutant also displaces MIP-1α from the MIP-1α/RANTES (CC CKR-1) receptor (Fig. 7). MIP-1α can displace the radioactive ligand from the receptor, with an IC50 of 0.97 ± 0.03 nM, and the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant displaces 125I-labeled MIP-1α, with an IC50 of 118 ± 0.8 nM. Both IL-8 and the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant show no activity in these two assays.Figure 7:Competition with 125I-labeled MIP-1α by MIP-1α and IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD for binding to COS-7 cells transfected with the CC CKR-1 receptor. Data are shown for IL-8 (○), Leu25xrarr; Cys (□), Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD (▪;), and MIP-1α (▵). Data are an average of duplicate measurements, and the maximal binding was 5000 cpm. Similar data were obtained in each of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Addition of varying amounts of wild-type IL-8 to a solution of 7.5 nM IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD caused a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence (Fig. 8). These data fitted well with the binding isotherm, ϕ = ϕfinal + (ϕinitial - ϕfinal) × L/([L]/IC50+ [L]), where ϕinitial = 1217 units was the initial fluorescence of the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD in solution and ϕfinal = 2052 units was the limiting fluorescence at infinite concentration of added IL-8. The IC50 or midpoint concentration was 110 nM. When IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD was mixed with a 34-amino acid peptide from the amino terminus of CC CKR-1, there was a dose-dependent fluorescence decrease from 802 to 461 units (Fig. 9). The data were fitted to the binding isotherm, and a value of 156 nM was calculated for the IC50. Similar data were obtained when RANTES specifically labeled at the N terminus was used, giving an IC50 of 40 nM. However, no change in fluorescence was observed with N-terminally labeled IL-8, confirming that the change in fluorescence was due to a specific interaction with the N-terminal receptor peptide.Figure 9:Interaction between the N-terminal CC CKR-1 peptide and the fluorescent Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutant. The fluorescence intensity was monitored by addition of increasing amounts of N-terminal receptor peptide to 7.5 nM chemokine at 25°C in PBS, pH 7.4.

As can be seen in Fig. 10, there are clear differences between the spectra obtained for CXC and CC chemokines. In addition, the spectra for the IL-8 mutants showing monocyte chemotactic activity and CC CKR-1 binding show a third class of spectra compared with the wild-type chemokine data. The results were compared with a standard data set (21.Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4562-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) in order to determine the relative amounts of the secondary structural elements such as α-helix and β-sheet. To validate our results, we compared the results obtained experimentally by CD with the theoretical values from known NMR data of IL-8(22.Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 1689-1696Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar), RANTES(23.Chung C.-W. Cooke R.M. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C.

Science. 1994; 263: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Table 1). We see that in all three cases, the experimental and theoretical values are only different by 1%. The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant shows similar structure to IL-8, but with a slight loss of α-helix. The IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Tyr and IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD mutants, however, show a marked decrease in the α-helical content with percent averages of 6 and 8, respectively, which is even lower than that for the CC chemokines. The other two secondary structural classes remain unchanged when compared with IL-8.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Chemokines play a key role in inflammatory diseases by selectively recruiting and activating a wide variety of cells, including leukocytes. The initial stage of this cellular activation involves the binding of chemokines to a family of seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors. To date, two receptors have been cloned for CXC chemokines: IL-8R-A (1.Holmes M.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and IL-8R-B(2.Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L.

The available data using these recombinant receptor clones clearly show that CXC chemokines do not bind to CC chemokine receptors or vice versa. The only receptor that has been found that binds both classes of ligand is a ubiquitous chemokine receptor on erythrocytes known as the Duffy antigen(25.Horuk R. Colby T.J. Darbonne W.C. Schall T.J. Neote K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5733-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). So far, however, this has not been shown to induce a signaling response to any chemokine. In the attempt to understand the molecular basis of this selectivity, the three-dimensional structures of the ligands were initially studied. These studies show that the monomeric structures of both CXC and CC chemokines are similar, even though their sequence identity is lower than 25% in many cases. However, the dimeric interfaces for CXC and CC chemokines are different, suggesting that factors such as the hydrophobicity of the dimeric interface play a role in receptor selectivity. Multiple sequence alignments have enabled us to identify a conserved small hydrophobic amino acid in CXC chemokines, corresponding to Leu25 in IL-8(14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), that is always replaced by a much larger tyrosine in CC chemokines. The Leu25xrarr; Tyr mutation introduces two novel CC chemokine-like activities into IL-8, namely monocyte chemotaxis and the ability to bind CC CKR-1. To further investigate the role of this important residue, we have made the Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant. Since leucine and cysteine are approximately isosteric, we would predict that this mutation would produce only a minimal change in the activity of IL-8. However, this mutation introduces a chemically reactive group, which could be modified with a variety of reagents such as a hydrophobic fluorescent group. This in turn would enable us to monitor the binding of mutant IL-8 to form receptor complexes. The Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant refolds correctly with two disulfide bonds and one free thiol that can be attributed to Cys25. There should be no disulfide bond formation across the dimeric interface since the distance between the two thiols (calculated from the structure of wild-type IL-8) is 5.8 Å. This distance is much longer than the 3 Å normally seen in disulfide bonds. The Leu25xrarr; Cys mutant is overall similar to wild-type IL-8. It binds IL-8R-A 50-fold and IL-8R-B 10-fold weaker than wild-type IL-8 and activates neutrophils with only 2-fold less potency. No effect was seen in monocyte chemotaxis assays, and the mutant was unable to displace MIP-1α from its CC CKR-1 receptor. The modification of the free cysteine with the fluorescent NBD group was shown to be stoichiometric. HPLC purification confirmed that there was no unlabeled starting material in the final product. Addition of the bulky aromatic NBD group caused a dramatic 100-fold decrease in binding to IL-8R-A and IL-8R-B and a concomitant 30-fold decrease in potency in neutrophil chemotaxis assays. These results are consistent with those reported for the IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Tyr mutation (14.Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the NBD-modified mutant can compete with MIP-1α for binding to CC CKR-1, with a 118-fold lower potency compared with MIP-1α. The mutant protein can also signal through the receptor, as can be seen by its ability to attract monocytes. The fluorescent NBD probe is sensitive to its local environment(26.Turcatti G. Vogel H. Chollet A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and this property can be used to study the interaction of IL-8 Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD with other proteins. When the labeled mutant protein is incubated with wild-type IL-8, there is an increase in the fluorescent signal, which corresponds to a local increase in hydrophobicity around residue 25. We predict that the proteins are forming heterodimers and that the NBD group is buried in the hydrophobic pocket between the two IL-8 C-terminal helices. We are currently trying to crystallize the mutant protein to verify this hypothesis. The four CC chemokine receptors show over 50% amino acid identity along their entire length, but have N-terminal extracellular regions that are very different. We have synthesized the N-terminal 34-amino acid extracellular region of CC CKR-1 and studied the effect of adding this peptide to Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD. The N-terminal extracellular region has been shown to be important in determining the ligand specificity of IL-8R-A and IL-8R-B. NMR studies have shown that an interaction occurs between a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal fragment of the type 1 human IL-8R and IL-8 complexes (27.Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Addition of the CC CKR-1 peptide to Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD causes a decrease in fluorescence intensity, suggesting that a complex is formed when the NBD group enters a more polar environment. The specificity of the receptor is maintained in this peptide since a similar change in fluorescence can be seen when N-terminally labeled RANTES is used as the ligand. However, no change is fluorescence is observed with N-terminally labeled IL-8. We are currently attempting to obtain high levels of receptor expression for CC CKR-1, which would enable us to study the interaction with the receptor in the membrane. To analyze the possible three-dimensional effects of the mutations, we have studied the CD spectra of wild-type and mutant chemokines. When the secondary structure compositions of the wild-type chemokines such as IL-8, RANTES, and MIP-1β were calculated from the CD data, there was a very good agreement of the α-helical and β-sheet content as compared with the NMR determinations. The CD spectra of the CXC and CC chemokines are clearly different: the CC chemokines show a much lower α-helical content, consistent with a much shorter C-terminal helix. However, the IL-8 mutants that bind to CC CKR-1 and that can induce monocyte chemotaxis (Leu25xrarr; Tyr and Leu25xrarr; Cys-NBD) show a characteristic third class of CD spectra with a lower α-helical content compared with wild-type IL-8. Since in the IL-8 structure, Leu25 is close to the C-terminal helix, it is tempting to suggest that the introduction of a large aromatic and hydrophobic group close to the helix is causing some distortion of the helix/sheet interface. This helical distortion in turn may lead to a distortion of the amide bonds and a characteristic new CD spectrum. We are currently solving the structures of these mutants by x-ray crystallography in order to investigate the three-dimensional basis of the change in receptor selectivity.

Because N-acetylglucosamine is an essential building block of both bacterial cell walls and fungal cell wall chitin, the enzyme is a potential target for antibacterial and antifungal agents. N-Iodoacetylglucosamine 6-phosphate is an active site-directed irreversible inactivator of GlmS from Escherichia coli (k/K = 17 (±3) M s). Both fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine protect the enzyme from inactivation, indicating that this reagent is directed at both the sugar binding site and the glutamine binding site. Protection studies with fructose 6-phosphate demonstrate that the value of the dissociation constant for fructose 6-phosphate is 3.3 (±0.5) × 10M, approximately 3 orders of magnitude less than the K value for this substrate determined from initial velocity experiments (Badet, B., Vermoote, P., and Le Goffic, F.(1988) Biochemistry 27, 2282-2287)."

Sulfation is an important pathway in the biotransformation of many drugs, xenobiotics, neurotransmitters, bile acids, and hormones. The sulfate donor for these reactions is 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS).

Adenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate (PAP) is a product of the reaction catalyzed by all sulfotransferases (STs) and competitively inhibits PAPS binding(1.Weinshilboum R.H. Fed.

Direct photoaffinity labeling with radioactively labeled PAPS has been used to identify PAPS-binding proteins. Lee et al.(3.Lee R.W.H. Suchanek C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11153-11156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used direct labeling with 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′[32P]phosphosulfate to identify an Mr = 34,000 protein involved in PAPS translocation in Golgi membrane preparations of bovine adrenal medulla (3.Lee R.W.H. Suchanek C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11153-11156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Otterness et al. (4.Otterness D.M. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. Weinshilboum R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 34-41Google Scholar) utilized a similar approach, using [35S]PAPS for direct photoaffinity labeling of human liver STs. It was shown that UV irradiation of [35S]PAPS in the presence of partially purified human liver thermostable phenol sulfotransferase (PST) resulted in the labeling of 35-kDa proteins with properties identical to those of thermostable PST. These results indicated that [32P]PAPS and [35S]PAPS can be used as direct photoaffinity ligands for the study of ST and other PAPS-dependent proteins; however, the reaction with the enzyme depends on high energy UV light activation of pyrimidine residues, and it is not always possible to distinguish covalent binding from nonspecific enzyme inactivation. Another strategy for affinity labeling and probing nucleotide binding sites in protein molecules is to use photoreactive substrate analogs or inhibitors containing an azido group, such as 2-azidoadenosine and 8-azidoadenosine(5.Cusack N.J. Born G.V.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1976; 193: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 6.Haley B.E. Fed. Proc. 1983; 42: 2831-2836PubMed Google Scholar). A new photoreactive pyrimidine analog, 2-azidoadenosine 3′,5′-[5′32P]bisphosphate (2-azido-[32P]PAP), was synthesized by Sylvers et al. (7.Sylvers L.A. Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and applied to the photoaffinity labeling of Escherichia coli ribosomes. In this paper, we report photoaffinity labeling studies of human and rat liver cytosolic ST and several recombinant human STs with 2-azido-[32P]PAP synthesized and characterized according to Sylvers et al.(7.Sylvers L.A. Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Studies were performed that demonstrated specific photoinsertion of 2-azido-[32P]PAP into these enzymes and also indicated the potential usefulness of this approach in the purification and molecular characterization of purified native and cloned PAPS- and PAP-binding proteins, including the STs. Moreover, photolabeling with 2-azido-[32P]PAP will be also useful in studies investigating the structure of the ST active sites. PAP, PAPS, 4-nitrophenol, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. 2,6-Dichloro-4-nitrophenol (DCNP) was obtained from K and K Laboratories (Plainview, NY). 2-Azido-[32P]PAP was synthesized and purified as described previously(7.Sylvers L.A. Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN (Irvine, Ca). The incorporation of 32P from ATP was usually over 70%, and the specific activity of 2-azido-[32P]PAP was 1-3 mCi/μmol. Cytosolic fractions from male rat (Sprague-Dawley, 220-250 g) and human livers were prepared as described previously (8.Radominska A. Green M.D. Zimniak P. Lester R. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method(9.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression vectors containing cDNAs encoding HAST1, HAST3, and HAST4 were transfected into COS-7 cells as described previously(10.Zhu X. Veronese M.E. Sansom L.N. McManus M.E. Biochem. Biophys, Res.

The vectors contain SV40 sequences, which permit high level expression of individual STs. After 40-48 h, an aliquot of the transfected COS-7 cells was incubated in medium containing [35S]methionine before determining the amount of nascent enzyme synthesized by immunoadsorption and SDS-PAGE(13.Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9744-9749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining transfected cells were stored at −70°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, until assay. To clarify nomenclature, HAST1 corresponds to p-PST or thermostable PST, HAST3 is m-PST or thermolabile PST, and HAST4 is a new form of PST differing from HAST1 by 12 amino acids. HAST4, unlike HAST1 and HAST3, is incapable of sulfating dopamine, and its Km for 4-nitrophenol sulfation (74 μM) ( 2M. E. McManus, unpublished data.) is markedly different from those of HAST1 (0.6 μM) and HAST3 (2200 μM)(12.Veronese M.E. Burgess W. Zhu X. McManus M.E. Biochem.

Biophys. 1990; 278: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17.Comer K.A. Falany C.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 645-651PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Heroux J.A. Falany C.N. Roth J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 36: 29-33Google Scholar), and these antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis of DHEA-ST and EST expressed in bacteria. Human or rat liver cytosol (50 μg) or recombinant STs (10 μg) were suspended in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, and 5 mM MgCl2 at 37°C in a final volume of 25 μl. 2-Azido-[32P]PAP (200 μM, 2-5 mCi/μmol) was added to a final concentration of 10-40 μM and allowed to equilibrate for 20 s, followed by UV irradiation with a hand-held UV lamp (UVP-11, 254 nm, Ultraviolet Products, Inc.) for 90 s at room temperature. For competition experiments, the appropriate unlabeled competing nucleotide was added to the reaction mixture just before addition of the probe. Any deviations from the above procedures are described in the appropriate figure legends. Reactions were terminated and processed for SDS-PAGE as described previously(19.Drake Jr., R.R. Evans R.K. Wolf M.J. Haley B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11928-11933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated as described previously (19.Drake Jr., R.R. Evans R.K. Wolf M.J. Haley B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11928-11933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 12.5% gels, followed by autoradiography for 1 h to 2 days. In some cases, the separated proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, and Western blot analysis was performed by the method of Towbin et al.(20.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were quantified using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer. Cytosol and microsomal fractions from human and rat livers were irradiated in the presence of 40 μM 2-azido-[32P]PAP. Fig. 1 shows an autoradiograph of the PAP-binding proteins separated on SDS-PAGE. The labeling was strictly dependent on UV irradiation as evidenced by the absence of labeled proteins in non-irradiated samples (Fig. 1, lanes 1, 5, 8, and 12). With human liver microsomes, there was no significant specific photolabeling of proteins in the 30-40-kDa range (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3), and detergent treatment of the membranes resulted in no apparent increase in photolabeling (Fig. 1, lane 4). The labeling pattern in human cytosol, however, showed a high degree of specificity. Photolabeling of the human cytosolic fraction resulted in the specific labeling of two protein bands at approximately 32 and 34 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 6) corresponding to the established molecular masses of human cytosolic STs. Photoincorporation could be competitively inhibited by 200 μM concentrations of unlabeled PAP (Fig. 1, lane 7), and unlabeled PAPS inhibited photolabeling as well as PAP (data not shown). Protein bands at 31 and 40 kDa were also photolabeled, but the photoincorporation was not totally specific as evidenced by incomplete protection (31 kDa) or a lack of protection (40 kDa) in the presence of unlabeled PAP (Fig. 1, lane 7). Several protein bands in rat liver microsomes photoincorporated 2-azido-[32P]PAP (Fig. 1, lane 9), but the photolabeling was inhibited by unlabeled PAP only in the approximately 40-kDa band, and even here protection was not complete (Fig. 1, lane 10). The only significant effect of detergent treatment of microsomes was to completely abolish photolabeling of a protein band of approximately 28 kDa, outside the mass range of the STs (Fig. 1, lane 11). With cytosolic preparations from rat liver, on the other hand, proteins having molecular masses of 30-38 kDa, corresponding to the reported molecular masses of rat liver STs, were specifically photolabeled (Fig. 1, lane 13). Except for a band at approximately 40 kDa, the labeling was effectively inhibited by preincubation with 200 μM cold PAP (Fig. 1, lane 14). The pattern of rat liver cytosolic STs is different from the human ST pattern and is consistent with the presence of different forms of ST. The effect of increasing concentrations of 2-azido-[32P]PAP on photoincorporation into ST was investigated using HAST3 expressed in COS-7 cells. Concentrations from 0.1 to 50 μM were investigated. The extent of photoincorporation of the probe into the 34-kDa fraction in the HAST3 preparation increased with increasing concentrations of probe. As shown in Fig. 2, photolabeling of HAST3 by 2-azido-[32P]PAP was saturable, with half-maximal photoincorporation between 2.5 and 10 μM, as determined by densitometry. A concentration of 10 μM was chosen to optimize the quantity of radioactivity incorporated into the protein while at the same time minimizing the nonspecific background. To characterize the specificity of the photolabeling reaction, the effect of unlabeled PAP and PAPS was examined by adding the corresponding nucleotide over a range of concentrations from 10 to 50 μM. Photoincorporation of 2-azido-[32P]PAP into HAST3 was found to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both nucleotides (Fig. 3), with PAP (lanes 2-4) being somewhat more effective than PAPS (lanes 5-7). COS-7 expressed HAST3 is enzymatically active in sulfating 4-nitrophenol, a model substrate for the phenol-sulfating form of human sulfotransferases, and is inhibited by the ST inhibitor, DCNP. Therefore, the effect of both compounds on photolabeling of HAST3 by 2-azido-[32P]PAP was investigated. As shown in Fig. 3(lanes 8-10), 4-nitrophenol was not required for photolabeling of the 34-kDa protein with 2-azido-[32P]PAP. In fact, 100 μM concentrations of 4-nitrophenol inhibited photoaffinity labeling (Fig. 3, lane 10). Concentrations of DCNP from 1.0 to 100 μM inhibited photoaffinity labeling of the 34-kDa protein (Fig. 3, lanes 11-13). Although it may not be evident from the figure, because of the exposure of the film and the high degree of inhibition even at the lowest concentration, the inhibition by DCNP was dose dependent (63, 66, and 78% inhibition at 1, 10, and 100 μM, respectively). Three recombinant human liver STs, HAST1, −3, and −4, expressed in COS-7 cells were tested for their ability to photoincorporate 2-azido-[32P]PAP. Fig. 4 shows the photolabeling of the recombinant enzymes with 10 μM probe. Human liver cytosol labeled under the same conditions has been included for comparison (Fig. 4, lanes 1-3). With each recombinant enzyme, the major photolabeled protein band detected by autoradiography (Fig. 4, lanes 8, 10, and 12) corresponded to the major Coomassie Blue-stained protein seen on the gel. Furthermore, the labeling was completely inhibited in presence of 50 μM PAP (Fig. 4. lanes 3, 9, 11, 13). No labeling was detected with control, non-transfected COS-7 cell homogenates (Fig. 4, lanes 4-6). The preparations used in these experiments were human DHEA-ST and EST expressed in E. coli and partially purified by DEAE chromatography as described previously(14.Falany C.N. Wheeler J. Oh T.S. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. 1994; 48: 369-375Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21.Falany C.N. Krasnykh V. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 5, and, as with the previous figure, photolabeling of human liver cytosol has been included for comparison (Fig. 5, lanes 1-3). Exposure of the recombinant proteins to UV light in the presence of 2-azido-[32P]PAP resulted in the labeling of proteins with approximate molecular masses of 36 kDa for DHEA-ST (Fig. 5, lane 4) and 31 and 36 kDa for EST (Fig. 5, lane 6). The specificity of the photolabeling was demonstrated by the high degree of inhibition of photoincorporation in the presence of unlabeled PAP (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 7). To verify that 31-36-kDa proteins that are photolabeled with 2-azido-[32P]PAP in both expression systems were indeed sulfotransferases, antibodies known to recognize STs were used for Western blot analyses of photolabeled COS-7 and E. coli-expressed preparations. The proteins from both expression systems were photolabeled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were subjected to autoradiography followed by immunodetection with specific antibody. Human STs expressed in COS-7 cells were detected with a specific rabbit anti-human PST antibody. For the identification of the human cytosolic STs and E. coli-expressed EST, anti-human EST antibody was used(21.Falany C.N. Krasnykh V. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and for E. coli-expressed DHEA-ST, DHEA-specific antibody was used(17.Comer K.A. Falany C.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 645-651PubMed Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 6(COS-7 cell-expressed HAST1, −3, and −4) and Fig. 7(E. coli-expressed DHEA-ST and EST). Human liver cytosol has been included in each figure for comparison. As shown in Fig. 6, human cytosolic protein and HAST1, −3, and −4 proteins were recognized by the PST antibody (Fig. 6A), and the immunoreactive bands also photoincorporated 2-azido-[32P]PAP (Fig. 6B, lanes 5, 7, and 9). Protein detected in samples photolabeled in the presence of unlabeled PAP (Fig. 6A, lanes 6. 8, and 10) did not photoincorporate significant amounts of the probe (Fig. 6B, lanes 6, 8, and 10). Further, no photoincorporation was observed in control, non-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 11-13). The same results were found with the E. coli-expressed proteins. Recombinant protein detected with its corresponding antibody on the Western blot (Fig. 7A) was found by autoradiography to be photolabeled when incubated in the absence of unlabeled nucleotide (Fig. 7B, lanes 4 and 6) and protected when unlabeled PAP was present (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 and 7).Figure 7:Western blot analysis and photolabeling of human liver cytosol and E. coli-expressed human recombinant sulfotransferases. Western blot (A) and autoradiograph (B) of human liver cytosol and E. coli-expressed EST and DHEA-ST proteins (50 μg) photolabeled with 10 μM 2-azido-[32P]PAP are shown as described under “Materials and Methods.” On the Western blot, human cytosolic ST was detected with anti-human PST antibody and E. coli-expressed EST and DHEA-ST with specific anti-human EST and DHEA-ST antibodies. In both A and B, samples are as follows: lanes 1-3, human liver cytosol without and with UV irradiation and with 50 μM unlabeled PAP, respectively; lanes 4 and 5, EST with UV irradiation and with 50 μM unlabeled PAP; lanes 6 and 7, DHEA-ST with UV irradiation and with 50 μM unlabeled PAP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Direct photoaffinity labeling of various proteins with adenosine derivatives, such as ATP, ADP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, has been described previously(22.Yu P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23.Steinmaus H. Rosenthal I. Elad D. J. Org. Chem. 1971; 36: 3594-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, reports in the literature have suggested that direct affinity labeling with adenosine 3′-[32P]phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate can be used to label PAPS-binding proteins(3.Lee R.W.H. Suchanek C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11153-11156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of photoactivation of purines and purine nucleosides postulates the involvement of the C-8 position of the purine ring system(23.Steinmaus H. Rosenthal I. Elad D. J. Org. Chem. 1971; 36: 3594-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that UV irradiation results in the formation of free radicals of aromatic amino acids, which scavenge the nucleotide. In this work, we have developed an approach to ST labeling using PAP containing a 2-azido function as a photoreactive group. This mechanism, which involves covalent binding of the azido groups into specific amino acids, uses different functional groups than the procedure described above and, thus, targets different areas of the protein. Therefore, it can be anticipated that different amino acids could become radiolabeled. Moreover, labeling with probes that contain 32P allows for a much higher level of sensitivity in detecting the photolabeled proteins due to the higher energy of the decay products. This feature is especially important when using radiolabeling for the purification and characterization of the recombinant proteins. A first series of studies was used to determine whether the probe, 2-azido-[32P]PAP, could be used as an effective photoaffinity ligand for specific labeling of PAPS-binding proteins in the mixture of proteins from crude human cytosolic preparations. Additionally, photoaffinity labeling of recombinant STs from COS-7 cell and E. coli expression systems was examined. We were able to demonstrate that, under standard conditions, the 2-azido-[32P]PAP probe efficiently bound to cytosolic STs as well as to several recombinant proteins with a high specificity (Fig. 1, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5). As the next step, optimal photolysis conditions were determined using COS-7 cell-expressed human liver HAST3. We demonstrated that incubation of HAST3 with 2-azido-[32P]PAP followed by UV irradiation resulted in the photolabeling of a single 34-kDa protein (Fig. 2). The binding of 2-azido-[32P]PAP was concentration dependent with half-maximal binding at approximately 7.5 μM. Additionally, the labeling was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by cold PAP and PAPS with 50% inhibition at 6.0 μM and 5.8 μM, respectively. This protection is an obligatory feature for demonstrating the true specificity of the photoaffinity labeling process. Moreover, labeling of HAST3 after preincubation with DCNP, a known inhibitor of the enzyme(24.Rein G. Glover V. Sandler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25.Campbell N.R.C. Van Loon J. Weinshilboum R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of photoincorporation. The inhibition of labeling of ST by DCNP was in agreement with previously published studies on the effect of DCNP on direct photoaffinity labeling with [35S]PAPS as the affinity probe(4.Otterness D.M. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. Weinshilboum R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 34-41Google Scholar). The observation that DCNP, a cosubstrate directed inhibitor which interferes with catalysis of the HAST3 reaction, also strongly inhibited the covalent binding of 2-azido-[32P]PAP could be explained by the possibility that PAP and/or PAPS bind to both the cosubstrate and the PAP/PAPS binding sites. As has been demonstrated previously(4.Otterness D.M. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. Weinshilboum R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 34-41Google Scholar), 4-nitrophenol, a model sulfate acceptor for the phenol-specific STs, was neither required for nor enhanced the labeling of human HAST3 with 2-azido-[32P]PAP. Indeed, at high concentrations of 4-nitrophenol, photolabeling was significantly inhibited. The significance of this observation is not clear at the present. After determination of the optimal photolysis conditions, we designed experiments to determine whether 2-azido-[32P]PAP could also be used to photolabel other human STs expressed in different expression systems. Figure 4:, Figure 5: show the photoaffinity labeling of COS-7 and E. coli-expressed human STs. In both series of experiments, crude liver cytosol was photolabeled for comparison. These studies demonstrated that three human STs, HAST1, −3, and −4, were each expressed as one single protein with apparent molecular masses of 32, 34, and 32 kDa, respectively. It should be emphasized that, in our experience, only a fully expressed enzyme that possesses catalytic activity can be photolabeled. Therefore, the ability to photoincorporate the probe can be used as a criterion of successful expression. The above considerations can be also applied for the characterization of the bacteria-expressed proteins. Fig. 5 shows the photolabeling of two human cDNA-expressed steroid STs, DHEA-ST and EST, which were expressed as single proteins in an E. coli expression system. The labeling was UV-dependent, competitively inhibited by unlabeled PAP, and the labeled proteins were identified as STs by Western blot analysis using specific anti-DHEA-ST and EST antibodies. Although progress in molecular biology has provided a better understanding of the overall genetic organization and expression of the STs, the amount of information available on the relationship between the structure and function of these enzymes is limited. STs require the activated sulfate donor PAPS as a cofactor. A putative nucleotide binding motif in the STs was noted by Hashimoto et al. in 1992(26.Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirshberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus sequence they cited, GXXGXXK, was significantly similar to a previously described motif termed the P-loop, found in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins(27.Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar), and the authors suggested that this consensus sequence might constitute the PAPS binding site. It was recently confirmed by Komatsu et al.(28.Komatsu K. Driscoll W.J. Koh Y. Strott C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that the P-loop, highly conserved in all STs, is required, at least in part, for binding of the activated sulfate donor. In different studies, Falany et al.(29.Falany C.N. Zhuang W. Falany J.L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), using site-directed mutagenesis techniques, investigated the suggestions from previous experiments (16.Falany C.N. Vazquez M.E. Heroux J.A. Roth J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that a cysteine residue might be located near the PAPS binding site of the STs. Bacterial expression of human p-PST with the cysteine at position 70 converted to serine indicated that the cysteine was not essential for activity or substrate binding. However, the mutant enzyme is significantly more sensitive to thermal inactivation. Recently, Zheng et al.(30.Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the PAPS binding site using ATP dialdehyde as an active site-directed affinity label for the PAPS binding site of rat aryl ST IV. It was demonstrated that the affinity label was bound to a hexapeptide at both lysine 65 and cysteine 66. These affinity-labeled amino acids are located within a region in the sequence of AST IV that shows considerable homology with various STs possessing diverse specificities for acceptor substrates. In this paper, we have demonstrated that 2-azido-[32P]PAP can be used as a photoaffinity probe to covalently and specifically tag PAP-binding proteins in cytosolic and membrane fractions of rat and human liver and recombinant ST proteins. Investigations of the actual site of this linkage of protein and radioactive probe are in progress in our laboratory."
