https://openalex.org/W1601529928,"Platelet activation is accompanied by the appearance on the platelet surface of approximately 45,000 receptor sites for fibrinogen. The binding of fibrinogen to these receptors is required for platelet aggregation. Although it is established that the fibrinogen receptor is localized to a heterodimer complex of the membrane glycoproteins, IIb and IIIa, little is known about the changes in this complex during platelet activation that result in the expression of the receptor. In the present studies, we have developed and characterized a murine monoclonal anti-platelet antibody, designated PAC-1, that binds to activated platelets, but not to unstimulated platelets. PAC-1 is a pentameric IgM that binds to agonist-stimulated platelets with an apparent Kd of 5 nM. Binding to platelets is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ (KCa = 0.4 microM) but is not dependent on platelet secretion. Platelets stimulated with ADP or epinephrine bind 10,000-15,000 125I-PAC-1 molecules/platelet while platelets stimulated with thrombin bind 20,000-25,000 molecules/platelet. Several lines of evidence indicate that PAC-1 is specific for the glycoprotein IIb.IIIa complex. First, PAC-1 binds specifically to the IIb.IIIa complex on Western blots. Second, PAC-1 does not bind to thrombasthenic platelets or to platelets preincubated with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid at 37 degrees C, both of which lack the intact IIb.IIIa complex. Third, PAC-1 competitively inhibits the binding of 125I-A2A9, and IgG monoclonal antibody that is specific for the IIb.IIIa complex. Fourth, the antibody inhibits fibrinogen-mediated platelet aggregation. These data demonstrate that PAC-1 recognizes an epitope on the IIb.IIIa complex that is located near the platelet fibrinogen receptor. Platelet activation appears to cause a Ca2+-dependent change involving the glycoprotein IIb.IIIa complex that exposes the fibrinogen receptor and, at the same time, the epitope for PAC-1."

https://openalex.org/W2080312964,"The T-cell tropic retrovirus of macaque monkeys STLV-III has morphologic, growth, and antigenic properties indicating that it is related to HTLV-III/LAV, the etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. Four of six rhesus monkeys died within 160 days of STLV-III inoculation with a wasting syndrome, opportunistic infections, a primary retroviral encephalitis, and immunologic abnormalities including a decrease in T4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes. These data show that an immunodeficiency syndrome can be produced experimentally in a nonhuman primate by an agent from the HTLV-III/LAV group of retroviruses. The STLV-III-macaque system will thus provide a useful model for the study of antiviral agents and vaccine development for human AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1498670072,"Fibronectin immobilized onto polystyrene surface was found to bind plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) but only slightly the urokinase type as determined using mono- and polyclonal antibodies against the activators. Of the defined fibronectin fragments tested, the Mr 120,000-140,000 fragment was found to bind both plasminogen and t-PA. Proteolytically modified plasminogen (Lys-plasminogen) bound considerably better than the native form (Glu-plasminogen). Experiments with 125I-plasminogen yielded Kd = 9.1 X 10(-8) M for the binding to immobilized fibronectin. The partially or completely inactive single-chain form of t-PA (pro-t-PA) bound considerably better than the activated two-chain form. Lysine at greater than 3 mM inhibited the binding of plasminogen. The interaction was independent of calcium ions. CaCl2 (greater than 0.5 mM) and NaCl (greater than 0.2 M) inhibited the binding of pro-t-PA and of t-PA. Fibronectin-bound t-PA retained its ability to activate plasminogen. The observed interactions may operate in directional proteolysis localizing plasminogen and plasminogen activator to degrade fibronectin-containing extracellular matrix including fibrin clots."

(1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2919-2924). This paper describes cDNA cloning and the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for Sarcophaga lectin. Although active lectin consists of alpha and beta subunits in a molar ratio of 2:1, the fat body of injured larvae was found to contain only mRNA for the alpha subunit, suggesting that these two subunits are derived from a common gene and that the alpha subunit is converted to the beta subunit post-translationally. The alpha subunit was found to consist of 260 amino acid residues with an additional signal sequence of 19 or 23 amino acid residues."

https://openalex.org/W1995324078,"During normal mouse development the relative amounts of two types of U1 small nuclear RNA's (U1 RNA) change significantly. Fetal tissues have comparable levels of the two major types of mouse U1 RNA's, mU1a and mU1b, whereas most differentiated adult tissues contain only mU1a RNA's. Those adult tissues that also accumulate detectable amounts of embryonic (mU1b) RNA's (for example, testis, spleen, and thymus) contain a significant proportion of stem cells capable of further differentiation. Several strains of mice express minor sequence variants of U1 RNA's that are subject to the same developmental controls as the major types of adult and embryonic U1 RNA. The differential accumulation of embryonic U1 RNA's may influence the pattern of gene expression during early development and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1566171893,"The effect of insulin on protein biosynthesis was examined in differentiated 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Insulin altered the relative rate of synthesis of specific proteins independent of its ability to hasten conversion of the fibroblast (preadipocyte) phenotype to the adipocyte phenotype. Although more than one pattern of response to insulin was observed, we focused on the induction of a Mr 33,000 protein which was identified as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Exposure of 3T3 adipocytes to insulin throughout differentiation specifically increased GAPDH activity and protein content by 2- to 3-fold as compared to 3T3 adipocytes differentiated in the absence of insulin. These changes in enzyme activity and content could be accounted for by a 4-fold increase in the relative rate of synthesis of GAPDH and a 9-fold increase in hybridizable mRNA levels. Within 2 h of insulin addition to 3T3 adipocytes differentiated in the absence of hormone, hybridizable GAPDH mRNA levels increased 3-fold, and within 24 h GAPDH mRNA levels increased 8-fold, and [35S] methionine incorporation into GAPDH protein increased 5-fold. The increase in GAPDH mRNA and GAPDH biosynthesis could be demonstrated using physiologic concentrations of insulin (0.24 nM), indicating that these effects are mediated through a specific interaction with the insulin receptor. These studies demonstrate that insulin, as the sole hormonal perturbant, can increase the synthesis of certain 3T3 adipocyte proteins by altering the cellular content of a specific mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1647944260,"Abstract Proteoglycans were extracted from nuclease-digested sonicates of 10(9) rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells by the addition of 0.1% Zwittergent 3-12 and 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and were purified by sequential CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, DE52 ion exchange chromatography, and Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration chromatography under dissociative conditions. Between 0.3 and 0.8 mg of purified proteoglycan was obtained from approximately 1 g initial dry weight of cells with a purification of 200-800-fold. The purified proteoglycans had a hydrodynamic size range of Mr 100,000-150,000 and were resistant to degradation by a molar excess of trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, Pronase, papain, chymopapain, collagenase, and elastase. Amino acid analysis of the peptide core revealed a preponderance of Gly (35.4%), Ser (22.5%), and Ala (9.5%). Approximately 70% of the glycosaminoglycan side chains of RBL-1 proteoglycans were digested by chondroitinase ABC and 27% were hydrolyzed by treatment with nitrous acid. Sephadex G-200 chromatography of glycosaminoglycans liberated from the intact molecule by beta-elimination demonstrated that both the nitrous acid-resistant (chondroitin sulfate) and the chondroitinase ABC-resistant (heparin/heparan sulfate) glycosaminoglycans were of approximately Mr 12,000. Analysis of the chondroitin sulfate disaccharides in different preparations by amino-cyano high performance liquid chromatography revealed that 9-29% were the unusual disulfated disaccharide chondroitin sulfate di-B (IdUA-2-SO4----GalNAc-4-SO4); the remainder were the monosulfated disaccharide GlcUA----GalNAc-4-SO4. Subpopulations of proteoglycans in one preparation were separated by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography and were found to contain chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans whose disulfated disaccharides ranged from 9-49%. However, no segregation of subpopulations without both chondroitin sulfate di-B and heparin/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans was achieved, suggesting that RBL-1 proteoglycans might be hybrids containing both classes of glycosaminoglycans. Sepharose CL-6B chromatography of RBL-1 proteoglycans digested with chondroitinase ABC revealed that less than 7% of the molecules in the digest chromatographed with the hydrodynamic size of undigested proteoglycans, suggesting that at most 7% of the proteoglycans lack chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1874814209,"Monoclonal antibodies were raised against Swarm rat chondrosarcoma link protein 2. Two of the resultant hybridomas (9/30/6-A-1 and 9/30/8-A-4) were used in structural analyses of the link proteins. The 9/30/6-A-1 monoclonal antibody recognized an epitope which was only present on rat chondrosarcoma link protein 2. This epitope was absent in rat chondrosarcoma link protein 3 obtained after trypsin or clostripain treatment of rat chondrosarcoma proteoglycan aggregate, indicating that proteolytic digestion either removed or modified the epitope. Contrasting this, the 9/30/8-A-4 monoclonal antibody recognized an epitope present in link protein(s) 1, 2, or 3 isolated from cartilage of several animal species (rat, bovine, human, and chicken). Rat chondrosarcoma link protein 2 was digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and the resulting peptides were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunolocation analyses. The 9/30/6-A-1 and 9/30/8-A-4 monoclonal antibodies recognized epitopes in two different halves of the link protein molecule. The 9/30/8-A-4 monoclonal antibody was used to identify proteolytic cleavage peptides common to the individual link proteins (1, 2, or 3) purified from cartilage proteoglycans of several animal species. Digestion of rat chondrosarcoma link protein 2 with endoglycosidase H or alpha-mannosidase increased its electrophoretic mobility to that of link protein 3 and removed or altered the determinant recognized by the 9/30/6-A-1 monoclonal antibody, indicating that a high-mannose oligosaccharide chain was part of the antigenic determinant. The 9/30/8-A-4 monoclonal recognition of epitope was unaffected by endo- or exoglycosidase treatment. Endo- and exoglycosidase treatment of bovine nasal cartilage link proteins also altered their electrophoretic mobility, indicating that high-mannose oligosaccharide structures on the various link proteins (1, 2, or 3) accounted for the microheterogeneity observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W1597634219,"The substrate specificity of phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) was studied using synthetic peptides, in particular those corresponding to the amino acid sequence around serine 115 in bovine myelin basic protein (MBP). It was found that MBP (104-118) and MBP (104-123) were substrates for the enzyme, with apparent Km values of 14 and 10 microM, respectively. Neither MBP (111-118) nor MBP (111-123) were phosphorylated, indicating that an additional segment of sequence extending toward the N terminus, but not toward the C terminus, was essential for the substrate activity of the peptides. Of the alanine-substituted analogs examined, [Ala 105] MBP (104-118) was comparable to the parent peptide, whereas [Ala 107] MBP (104-118) and [Ala 113] MBP-(104-118) were much poorer substrates. These findings indicated that lysine 105 was not essential, but both arginine 107 and arginine 113 were important specificity determinants. Initial studies revealed that [Ala 113] MBP (104-118) inhibited phosphorylation by the enzyme of the parent peptide and, to a lesser extent, the intact MBP(1-170). Serine 115 was the only site phosphorylated in the analog peptides [Ala 105] MBP (104-118) and [Ala 107]MBP (104-118). In the parent peptide, serine 115 was the initial site of phosphorylation but after prolonged phosphorylation other sites became phosphorylated (serine 110 and/or serine 112), further supporting the concept that arginine residues act as essential substrate specificity determinants for phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1527784366,"Human plasminogen, a glycoprotein with NH2-terminal Glu, is rapidly converted by traces of plasmin to proteolytic derivatives with NH2-terminal Met 68, Lys 77, or Val 78 (Lys-plasminogen), which are much more readily activated to plasmin than is Glu-plasminogen. It has, therefore, been proposed that physiological activation of Glu-plasminogen occurs mainly via Lys-plasminogen intermediates (Wiman, B., and Wallen, P. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 36, 25-31). In the present study we have characterized a murine monoclonal antibody (LPm1) directed against an epitope exposed in Lys-plasminogen but not in Glu-plasminogen. The antibody was secreted by a hybridoma obtained by fusion of mouse myeloma cells (P3X63-Ag8-6.5.3) with spleen cells of a mouse immunized with purified Lys-plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex. Coupling of the alpha-amino groups of Lys-plasminogen with phenylisothiocyanate resulted in complete loss of immunoreactivity for LPm1, which was, however, fully restored by cleavage of the derivatized NH2-terminal amino acid. After a second cycle, immunoreactivity was not restored, indicating that the LPm1 antibody-binding site depends on the presence of Lys 77 and/or Val 78 as NH2-terminal amino acids. The immunoreactivity of Lys-plasminogen with LPm1 is abolished by reduction of the protein, suggesting that conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen is associated with a conformational alteration exposing the epitope for the LPm1 monoclonal antibody. In order to investigate the pathways of plasminogen activation in vivo, total plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin and Lys-plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complexes were measured with sandwich-type micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Therefore, microtiter plates were coated with monoclonal antibodies against alpha 2-antiplasmin, and bound antigen was quantitated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated LPm1 or a monoclonal antibody reacting equally well with Glu-plasmin as with Lys-plasmin. In 25 healthy subjects the plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin levels in plasma were undetectable (less than 0.1 nM). Infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator in patients with thromboembolic disease resulted in generation of high concentrations of Glu-plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex (620 +/- 150 nM, n = 7) whereas neither Lys-plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex nor Lys-plasminogen were consistently detected. It is, therefore, concluded that activation of the fibrinolytic system in vivo occurs by direct cleavage of the Arg 560-Val 561 bond in Glu-plasminogen and not via formation of the Lys-plasminogen intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W185162359,"The contributions of various amino acids to the structure and function of cholera toxin B subunit were assessed with quantifiable, chemically conservative, reversible derivatizations, and sensitive assays of activity. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was employed to monitor the conformational integrity of modified protein and help distinguish the direct from indirect effects of chemical derivatization. We describe a novel monoclonal antibody, which competes with the receptor GM1 for binding to cholera toxin B subunit, and use this reagent to help identify critically located residues. Our data support the hypothesis that tryptophan participates directly in binding GM1. In addition, we propose a dual role for lysine: first, these basic residues maintain an electrostatic attraction vital to receptor recognition; second, at least 1 lysine resides near the receptor binding domain and may interact with GM1. The influence of arginyl and tyrosyl residues upon activity is re-examined. Finally, we present data which suggest, in variance with previous studies, that the intramolecular disulfide bond is vital to the structure and function of cholera toxin B subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1562566862,"Movements of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme) in replicating a template multiprimed with synthetic pentadecadeoxynucleotides (15-mers) annealed at known positions on a single-stranded circular or linear DNA have been analyzed. After extension of one 15-mer on a multiprimed template, holoenzyme moves downstream in the direction of chain elongation to the next primer. Holoenzyme readily traverses a duplex, even 400 base pairs long, to exploit its 3'-hydroxyl end as the next available primer. This downstream polarity likely results from an inability to diffuse upstream along single-stranded DNA. These holoenzyme movements, unlike formation of the initial complex with a primer, do not require ATP. Time elapsed between completion of a chain and initiation on the next downstream primer is rapid (1 s or less); dissociation of holoenzyme to form a complex with another primed template is slow (1-2 min). Thus, holoenzyme diffuses rapidly only on duplex DNA, probably in both directions, and forms an initiation complex with the first primer encountered. Based on these findings, schemes can be considered for holoenzyme action at the replication fork of a duplex chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1539548918,"Recently we presented the partial covalent structure of a type V collagen chain. Analysis of amino acids 796-1020 in the human alpha 2(V) Gly-X-Y region showed strong conservation of charged positions with the interstitial collagens but also revealed substitutions unique to type V. To gain more information about this procollagen and primarily to resolve the ambiguous nature of the 3' noncollagenous propeptide, we sequenced several cDNA clones coding for amino acids adjacent to the carboxyl end of the alpha chain. Here we report the complete primary structure of the alpha 2(V) COOH-terminal propeptide. In general, the latter sequence (270 residues) bears a greater degree of similarity to those of the interstitial rather than the basement membrane procollagens. Compared to the interstitial procollagens, however, more divergence has occurred in alpha 2(V) surrounding the conserved N-asparaginyl-linked carbohydrate attachment site at residues 171-173, and alpha 2(V) possesses an additional potential glycosylation site (Asn-Lys-Thr) located in a hypervariable region near the NH2 terminus. Although certainly premature to form any rigid hypothesis, a pattern emerges that may be characteristic of alpha 2 versus alpha 1 chains. Both the alpha 2(I) and alpha 2(V) telopeptides are devoid of a lysine, which in alpha 1 chains forms an interchain cross-link with residue 87 of the collagenous region. Also in contrast to the interstitial alpha 1 carboxyl propeptides is the absence in alpha 2(I) and alpha 2(V) of a cysteine that probably participates in an interchain disulfide bond. Therefore, one can speculate that those alpha 2 chains, represented only once in procollagen trimers, may not be under the same selective pressure as alpha 1 chains to maintain certain residues responsible for stabilizing the triple helical molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1528618733,"The rat major acute phase protein (alpha 1-MAP) is a cysteine protease inhibitor. The stoichiometry of the interaction between the inhibitor and enzyme was shown to be 1:2. A cDNA clone specific for rat alpha 1-MAP was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from an inflamed rat liver RNA template. The 1458-base pair insert was sequenced and positively identified by alignment with a partial amino acid sequence obtained by radiosequence analysis of the primary translation product for alpha 1-MAP. Complete sequence analysis determined the alpha 1-MAP cDNA coded for the entire protein with the exception of the first four amino acids of the signal peptide, all of which were identified by radiosequencing. The coding sequence spans 1282 nucleotides, followed by 115 base pairs of a 3' untranslated region. Two putative active sites, suggested by the enzyme-inhibitor ratio, have been identified by analysis of internal duplications of the alpha 1-MAP sequence and the alignment of these regions with the sequences of several low molecular weight cysteine protease inhibitors. A computer homology analysis of the protein sequence revealed a 59.3% overall identity between rat alpha 1-MAP and bovine low molecular weight (LMW) kininogen. The homology included the signal peptide regions. LMW kininogen is a precursor of bradykinin. alpha 1-MAP does contain a bradykinin sequence; the flanking amino acids are different, however. Evidence for the expression of the LMW and a high molecular weight kininogen from the same gene, and the high degree of homology between these proteins and the rat acute phase protein suggest that all three proteins belong to a precisely regulated gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1588493346,"Purified sodium channels incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles mediate neurotoxin-activated 22Na+ influx but do not bind the alpha-scorpion toxin from Leiurus quinquestriatus (LqTx) with high affinity. Addition of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or phosphatidylserine to the reconstitution mixture restores high affinity LqTx binding with KD = 1.9 nM for PC/PE vesicles at -90 mV and 36 degrees C in sucrose-substituted medium. Other lipids tested were markedly less effective. The binding of LqTx in vesicles of PC/PE (65:35) is sensitive to both the membrane potential formed by sodium gradients across the reconstituted vesicle membrane and the cation concentration in the extravesicular medium. Binding of LqTx is reduced 3- to 4-fold upon depolarization to 0 mV from -50 to -60 mV in experiments in which [Na+]out/[Na+]in is varied by changing [Na+]in or [Na+]out at constant extravesicular ionic strength. It is concluded that the purified sodium channel contains the receptor site for LqTx in functional form and that restoration of high affinity, voltage-dependent binding of LqTx by the purified sodium channel requires an appropriate ratio of PC to PE and/or phosphatidylserine in the vesicle membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2087315910,"A repeated 82 base pair sequence in genomic DNA of the rat was previously proposed as being a control element governing brain (neuron) specific genetic expression. This intronic sequence, termed the brain ""identifier"" (ID), is complementary to small RNA species localized in brain cytoplasm, and it was thought to be represented specifically in RNA produced by brain nuclei in vitro. The RNA blot analyses of total nuclear and polyadenylated heterogeneous nuclear RNA described in the present report show that this ID sequence is also present in the liver and kidney in abundances similar to those in the brain. This repeated sequence is not, therefore, restricted to transcripts produced in the brain as suggested from previous transcriptional ""runoff"" experiments. Measurements on rat and mouse nuclear RNA indicate that the abundance of ID sequence transcript is roughly proportional to the number of copies of this repeat in the respective genomes. This suggests a rather random genomic location and transcription of this sequence. From these results it seems improbable that the ID sequence functions as a transcriptional-level control element in genes expressed specifically in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W58960875,"DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme) processively and rapidly replicates a primed single-stranded DNA circle to produce a duplex with an interruption in the synthetic strand. The precise nature of this discontinuity in the replicative form (RF II) and the influence of the 5' termini of the DNA and RNA primers were analyzed in this study. Virtually all (90%) of the RF II products primed by DNA were nicked structures sealable by Escherichia coli DNA ligase; in 10% of the products, replication proceeded one nucleotide beyond the 5' DNA terminus displacing (but not removing) the 5' terminal nucleotide. With RNA primers, replication generally went beyond the available single-stranded template. The 5' RNA terminus was displaced by 1-5 nucleotides in 85% of the products; a minority of products was nicked (9%) or had short gaps (6%). Termination of synthesis on a linear DNA template was usually (85%) one base shy of completion. Thus, replication by holoenzyme utilizes all, or nearly all, of the available template and shows no significant 5'----3' exonuclease action as observed in primer removal by the nick-translation activity of DNA polymerase I."

The secondary and tertiary structure of this new inhibitor appears similar to that of BPTI. Whereas its affinity for bovine trypsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsinogen is almost identical to that of BPTI, the affinity for porcine pancreatic kallikrein is decreased, as expected on the basis of the amino acid substitutions. Analysis of the pH dependence of the affinity constant confirms the previous assignment of the ionizable groups, whose pK values are perturbed on complex formation, to kallikrein and not to the inhibitor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2414551341,"The effects of seven monoclonal antibodies on various functions of rat brain hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose-6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) have been assessed. Specifically, effects on catalytic properties (Km values for substrates, glucose and ATP X Mg2+; Ki for inhibition by glucose 6-phosphate), binding to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and glucose 6-phosphate-induced solubilization of mitochondrially bound hexokinase were examined. Epitope mapping studies with the native enzyme provided information about the relative spatial distribution of the epitopes on the surface of the native molecule. Binding of nucleotides (ATP or ATP X Mg2+) was shown to perturb the epitopes recognized by two of these antibodies. Neither nucleotides nor other ligands (glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, Pi) had detectable effect on epitopes recognized by the other five antibodies. Peptide mapping techniques in conjunction with immunoblotting permitted assignment of the epitopes recognized by several of the antibodies to specific segments within the overall primary structure. These results, together with previous work relating to the organization of structural domains within the molecule, permitted development of a three-dimensional model which provides a useful representation of major structural and immunological features of the enzyme, and depicts the association of those features with specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W2430818260,"Radioiodinated human choriogonadotropin was affinity-cross-linked with a cleavable (nondisulfide) homobifunctional reagent to the hormone receptor on porcine granulosa cells and the solubilized sample was electrophoresed. Cross-linked samples revealed four additional bands of slower electrophoretic mobility in addition to the hormone alpha, beta, and alpha beta dimer bands. The four bands corresponded to masses of 68, 74, 102, and 136 kDa whereas the alpha beta dimer band corresponded to 50 kDa. Formation of the four bands requires the 125I-hormone to bind specifically to the receptor with subsequent cross-linking. Binding can be prevented by excess of native hormone but not by follitropin. A monofunctional analog of the cross-linking reagent failed to produce the four bands. They were also produced by cross-linking Triton X-100-solubilized hormone-receptor complexes. Reagent concentration-dependent cross-linking revealed that their formation was sequential; smaller complexes formed first and then larger ones. When gels of the cross-linked sample were treated with reagents that cleave covalent cross-links and then electrophoresed in a second dimension gel, 18-, 24-, 28-, and 34-kDa components were released, in addition to the alpha and beta subunits of the native hormone. Simultaneous peptide mapping of the cross-linked complexes in the gel matrix with Staphylococcus V8 protease or papain revealed progressive proteolysis to generate terminal fragments of 30 or 27 kDa, respectively. These fragments were unique to and commonly present in the 74-, 102-, and 136-kDa hormone-receptor complexes but were not produced by proteolysis of the cross-linked human choriogonadotropin (hCG) alpha beta dimer or the hCG alpha subunit. Apparently, the radioactively labeled segment(s) of the alpha subunit of 125I-hCG was cross-linked to the 24-kDa component. The results demonstrate the protein nature of the receptor and suggest that 125I-hCG was initially cross-linked to the 24-kDa component to generate the 74-kDa complex, then the 28- and 34-kDa components were sequentially cross-linked to the 24-kDa component in the 74-kDa complex to generate the 102- and 134-kDa complexes."

Ca2+ uptake by heavy SR showed two phases, a slow uptake phase and a fast uptake phase. By contrast, Ca2+ uptake by light SR exhibited a monophasic time course. In both fractions a steady state of Ca2+ uptake was observed when the concentration of free Ca2+ outside the vesicles was reduced to less than 0.1 microM. In the steady state, the addition of 5 microM Ca2+ to the external medium triggered rapid Ca2+ release from heavy SR but not from light SR, indicating that the heavy fraction contains a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release channel. During Ca2+ uptake, heavy SR showed a constant Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity (1 mumol/mg protein X min) which was about 150 times higher than the rate of Ca2+ uptake in the slow uptake phase. Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, enhanced the rate of Ca2+ uptake during the slow phase without affecting Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. Adenine nucleotides, activators of Ca2+ release, reduced the Ca2+ uptake rate. These results suggest that the rate of Ca2+ accumulation by heavy SR is not proportional to ATPase activity during the slow uptake phase due to the activation of the channel for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. In addition, they suggest that the release channel is inactivated during the fast Ca2+ uptake phase."
https://openalex.org/W1565749427,"Two new haplotypes of the [Gus] gene complex have been characterized following their transfer from Mus musculus castaneus, where they were found, to a C57BL/6J genetic background. The [GUS]CS haplotype carries a new structural allele, Gus-scs, coding for enzyme with decreased thermolability and lacking an antigenic site present in other beta-glucuronidase allozymes. The [Gus]CL haplotype carries another new structural allele, Gus-scl, that codes for enzyme with increased thermolability and possessing the antigenic site. Both CS and CL beta-glucuronidase have the same catalytic activity/molecule as the standard B allozyme from C57BL/6J mice. Mice carrying either the [Gus]CS or [Gus]CL haplotype have reduced enzyme activity in all tissues examined at all stages of development. The reduced enzyme activity is partially accounted for by reduced rates of enzyme synthesis, and the remainder probably results from increased rates of enzyme turnover. beta-Glucuronidase mRNA levels in these mice were not reduced suggesting that the observed reduction in enzyme synthesis is due to a decreased efficiency of translation for CS and CL mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W123072179,"Both of the alpha and beta subunits of intact human follitropin (FSH) were radioiodinated with 125I-sodium iodide and chloramine-T and could be resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Radioiodinated FSH was affinity-cross-linked with a cleavable (nondisulfide) homobifunctional reagent to its membrane receptor on the porcine granulosa cell surface as well as to a Triton X-100-solubilized form of the receptor. Cross-linked samples revealed three additional bands of slower electrophoretic mobility, corresponding to 65, 83, and 117 kDa, in addition to the hormone bands. The hormone alpha beta dimer band corresponded to 43 kDa. Formation of the three bands requires the 125I-hormone to bind specifically to the receptor with subsequent cross-linking. Binding was prevented by an excess of the native hormone but not by other hormones. A monofunctional analog of the cross-linking reagent failed to produce the three bands. Reagent concentration-dependent cross-linking revealed that their formation was sequential; smaller complexes formed first and then larger ones. When gels of cross-linked complexes were treated to cleave covalent cross-links and then electrophoresed in a second dimension, 18-, 22-, and 34-kDa components were released, in addition to the alpha and beta subunits of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1480119707,"A second gene has been discovered at a previously studied Balbiani ring in Chironomus. Northern hybridizations demonstrated that cDNA clone pCt35 originated from a salivary gland specific 6.5-kilobase (kb) RNA that was abundant, nonribosomal, and apparently poly(A)+. pCt35 had a 120-base pair (bp) insert with 1.6 copies of a 75-bp sequence that contained two open reading frames. Southern hybridizations indicated that pCt35 was homologous to at least a 4-kb block of genomic DNA organized as a hierarchy of 150- and 300-bp tandem repeats. In situ hybridization localized these sequences to Balbiani ring 1. From these results we postulated that a 6.5-kb RNA gene may have evolved by stepwise duplication and amplification of a 75-bp ancestral sequence."
https://openalex.org/W231063009,"Yeast protoplasts were coated with different amounts of concanavalin A. Upon subsequent lysis and centrifugation in isopycnic density gradients, it was found that the buoyant density of plasma membranes was progressively increased from 1.125 to 1.21, according to the amount of bound concanavalin A. Enzymes that are attached to the plasma membrane showed the same density modifications and could thus be distinguished from constituents of intracellular membranes and organelles. With this methodology, it was confirmed that about two-thirds of yeast chitin synthetase is associated with the plasma membrane. The remainder of the enzyme was found in a peak at a lower density. Vanadate-sensitive ATPase showed a similar pattern, whereas GDP-mannose dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase, an enzyme attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, remained in the same position in the gradients, irrespective of the amount of concanavalin A associated with the plasma membrane. Potential applications of this technique to the determination of plasma membrane markers and to the separation of subcellular organelles are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1566524662,"Abstract The electrophoretic mobility of radioiodinated follitropin (FSH) alpha and beta subunits as well as the alpha beta dimer changed markedly depending on the concentration of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol. The changes were more dramatic in the beta subunit than in the alpha subunit. 125I-FSH, complexed to the receptor on porcine granulosa cells or in Triton X-100 extracts, was cross-linked with a cleavable (nondisulfide) homobifunctional reagent, solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate without reducing agents, and electrophoresed. The cross-linked sample revealed three bands of high molecular mass, in addition to the hormone subunit and dimer bands. The band of lightest mass, 110 kDa, was the major band and the other two of 76 and 62 kDa were barely noticeable. Upon reduction with dithiothreitol, the 110-kDa band decreased while the 76- and 62-kDa bands increased, indicating the existence of disulfides between components of the 110-kDa complex. Formation of the disulfide-linked complexes requires 125I-FSH, specifically bound to the hormone receptor and cross-linking, and can be prevented with an excess of native FSH but not human choriogonadotropin. Complex formation was independent of blocking free sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide. When the cross-linked complexes were reduced in the gel matrix and analyzed on fresh gels, the 76- and 62-kDa complexes were generated from the 110-kDa band, indicating the loss of two components. The lost components were estimated to be at 14 and 34 kDa. The rate of formation and cleavage of the cross-linked complexes indicated a sequential and incremental addition of 22-, 14-, and 34-kDa components to the FSH alpha beta dimer. The results of reduction of the cross-linked complexes demonstrate the existence of disulfide linkage between the three components."
https://openalex.org/W1570890681,"In primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes, the relative rate of ornithine aminotransferase synthesis is increased approximately 7- to 8-fold in response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The corresponding increase in ornithine aminotransferase messenger RNA under these conditions was observed to be only 2- to 3-fold. The levels of ornithine aminotransferase mRNA were measured by hybridization of cellular RNA to a cloned cDNA probe. The ribosomal transit time (20-25 min) along ornithine aminotransferase mRNA was the same in both control and induced cultures. The level of ornithine aminotransferase nascent chains in cAMP-induced cultures was increased 7-fold over the level in control cultures. In the face of a 2- to 3-fold increase in the amount of ornithine aminotransferase mRNA, this suggests an approximately 3-fold increase in the rate of initiation per copy of ornithine aminotransferase messenger RNA. These results indicate that cAMP may regulate ornithine aminotransferase synthesis at both transcriptional and translational levels in cultured hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1663187563,"Abstract Rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase catalyzes, in addition to its normal biosynthetic or forward reaction (HMG-CoA + 2 NADPH + 2H+----mevalonate + 2 NAD+ + CoASH), the reverse reaction (mevalonate + CoASH + 2 NADP+----HMG-CoA + 2 NADPH + 2H+) and two that involve the presumed intermediate mevaldate (mevaldate + CoASH + NADP+----HMG-CoA + NADPH + H+ and mevaldate + NADPH + H+----mevalonate + NADP+). These reactions were studied using both enzyme solubilized by the traditional freeze-thaw method and enzyme solubilized with a nonionic detergent in the presence of inhibitors of proteolysis. All four reactions were inhibited by mevinolin, a known inhibitor of the forward (biosynthetic) reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. When the enzyme was inactivated by ATP and a cytosolic, ADP-dependent HMG-CoA reductase kinase, the rates of both the forward reaction and the half-reactions decreased to comparable extents. Although coenzyme A is not a stoichiometric participant in the second half-reaction (mevaldate + NADPH + H+----mevalonate + NADP+), it was required as an activator of this reaction. This observation implies that coenzyme A may remain bound to the enzyme throughout the normal catalytic cycle of HMG-CoA reductase."
