https://openalex.org/W3026091149,"In an effort to mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries have imposed drastic lockdown, movement control or shelter in place orders on their residents. The effectiveness of these mitigation measures is highly dependent on cooperation and compliance of all members of society. The knowledge, attitudes and practices people hold toward the disease play an integral role in determining a society’s readiness to accept behavioural change measures from health authorities. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge levels, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 among the Malaysian public. A cross-sectional online survey of 4,850 Malaysian residents was conducted between 27th March and 3rd April 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking precautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices."
https://openalex.org/W3028392965,"Background Novel-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is currently a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern, as avowed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Ethiopia has become one of the affected countries as of March 15, 2020. Objective This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and practices among the Jimma University medical center (JUMC) visitors in Jimma town. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 247 sampled visitors, from 20–24 March 2020. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit the participants. The study tools were adapted from WHO resources. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the status of knowledge, perception, and practices. Logistic regression was executed to assess the predictors of dominant preventive practices. Results Of the 247 respondents, 205 (83.0%) knew the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. 72.0% knew that older people who have chronic illnesses are at high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19. About 95.1% knew that the COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected people, while 77 (31.2%) of the respondents knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Only 15 (6.1%) knew that children and young adults had to involve preventive measures. Overall, 41.3% of the visitors had high knowledge. The majority, 170(68.8%), felt self-efficacious to controlling COVID-19. 207(83.3%) believed that COVID-19 is a stigmatized disease. Frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant practices. Knowledge status and self-efficacy (positively), older age, and unemployment (negatively) predicted hand washing and avoidance of handshaking. Conclusions The status of knowledge and desirable practices were not sufficient enough to combat this rapidly spreading virus. COVID-19 risk communication and public education efforts should focus on building an appropriate level of knowledge while enhancing the adoption of recommended self-care practices with special emphasis on high-risk audience segments."
https://openalex.org/W3126006919,"This paper examines the market for initial coin offerings (ICOs). ICOs are smart contracts based on blockchain technology that are designed for entrepreneurs to raise external finance by issuing tokens without an intermediary. Unlike existing mechanisms for early-stage finance, tokens potentially provide investors with rapid opportunities thanks to liquid trading platforms. The marketability of tokens offers novel insights into entrepreneurial finance, which I explore in this paper. First, I document that investors earn on average 8.2% on the first day of trading. However, about 40% of all ICOs destroy investor value on the first day of trading. Second, I explore the determinants of market outcomes and find that management quality and the ICO profile are positively correlated with the funding amount and returns, whereas highly visionary projects have a negative effect. Among the 21% of all tokens that get delisted from a major exchange platform, highly visionary projects are more likely to fail, which investors anticipate. Third, I explore the sensitivity of the ICO market to adverse industry events such as China’s ban of ICOs, the hack of leading ledgers, and the marketing ban on FaceBook. I find that the ICO market is highly susceptible to such environmental shocks, resulting in substantial welfare losses for investors."
https://openalex.org/W3027118700,"A new version of the fuzzy logic model, called the co-active neuro fuzzy inference system (CANFIS), is introduced for predicting standardized precipitation index (SPI). Multiple scales of drought information at six meteorological stations located in Uttarakhand State, India, are used. Different lead times of SPI were computed for prediction, including 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, with inputs abstracted by autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial-ACF (PACF) analysis at 5% significance level. The proposed CANFIS model was validated against two models: classical artificial intelligence model (e.g., multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN)) and regression model (e.g., multiple linear regression (MLR)). Several performance evaluation metrices (root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, coefficient of correlation, and Willmott index), and graphical visualizations (scatter plot and Taylor diagram) were computed for the evaluation of model performance. Results indicated that the CANFIS model predicted the SPI better than the other models and prediction results were different for different meteorological stations. The proposed model can build a reliable expert intelligent system for predicting meteorological drought at multi-time scales and decision making for remedial schemes to cope with meteorological drought at the study stations and can help to maintain sustainable water resources management."
https://openalex.org/W3028462361,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an auto-immune, multi organ disease marked by severe gastrointestinal (GI) involvement and gut dysbiosis. Here, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using commercially-available anaerobic cultivated human intestinal microbiota (ACHIM) in SSc.Ten patients with SSc were randomized to ACHIM (n = 5) or placebo (n = 5) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week pilot. All patients had mild to severe upper and lower GI symptoms including diarrhea, distention/bloating and/or fecal incontinence at baseline. Gastroduodenoscopy transfer of ACHIM or placebo was performed at weeks 0 and 2. Primary endpoints were safety and clinical efficacy on GI symptoms assessed at weeks 4 and 16. Secondary endpoints included changes in relative abundance of total, immunoglobulin (Ig) A- and IgM-coated fecal bacteria measured by 16s rRNA sequencing.ACHIM side effects were mild and transient. Two placebo controls experienced procedure-related serious adverse events; one developed laryngospasms at week 0 gastroduodenoscopy necessitating study exclusion whilst one encountered duodenal perforation during gastroduodenoscopy at the last study visit (week 16). Decreased bloating, diarrhea and/or fecal incontinence was observed in four of five patients in the FMT group (week 4 or/and 16) and in two of four in the placebo group (week 4 or 16). Relative abundance, richness and diversity of total and IgA-coated and IgM-coated bacteria fluctuated more after FMT, than after placebo.FMT of commercially-available ACHIM is associated with gastroduodenoscopy complications but reduces lower GI symptoms by possibly altering the gut microbiota in patients with SSc."
https://openalex.org/W3026264042,"Italy was one of the first European countries affected by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with over 105,000 infected people and close to 13,000 deaths, until March 31st. The pandemic has hit especially hard because of the country's demographic structure, with a high percentage of older adults. The authors explore the possibility, recently aired in some studies, of extensive intergenerational contact as a possible determinant of the severity of the pandemic among the older Italian adults. We analyzed several variables to test this hypothesis, such as the percentage of infected patients aged >80 years, available nursing home beds, COVID-19 incidence rate, and the number of days from when the number of positive tests exceeded 50 (epidemic maturity). We also included in the analysis mean household size and percentage of households comprising one person, in the region. Paradoxically, the results are opposite of what was previously reported. The pandemic was more severe in regions with higher family fragmentation and increased availability of residential health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3027336172,"Many biologically active factors are present in human milk including proteins, lipids, immune factors, and hormones. The milk composition varies over time and shows large inter-individual variability. This study examined variations of human milk immune factors and cortisol concentrations in the first three months post-partum, and their potential associations with maternal psychosocial distress.Seventy-seven healthy mothers with full term pregnancies were enrolled, of which 51 mothers collected morning milk samples at 2, 6 and 12 weeks post-delivery. Maternal psychosocial distress was assessed at 6 weeks post-delivery using questionnaires for stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Immune factors were determined using multiplex immunoassays and included innate immunity factors (IL1β, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, TNFα), acquired immunity factors (IL2, IL4, IL10, IL13, IL17), chemokines (IL8, Groα, MCP1, MIP1β), growth factors (IL5, IL7, GCSF, GMCSF, TGFβ2) and immunoglobulins (IgA, total IgG, IgM). Cortisol was quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A linear mixed effects model was fit to test whether stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms individually predicted human milk cortisol concentrations after accounting for covariates. Repeated measurement analyses were used to compare women with high (n = 13) versus low psychosocial distress (n = 13) for immune factors and cortisol concentrations.Virtually all immune factors and cortisol, with the exception of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), were detected in the human milk samples. The concentrations of the immune factors decreased during the first 3 months, while cortisol concentrations increased over time. No correlation was observed between any of the immune factors and cortisol. No consistent relationship between postnatal psychosocial distress and concentrations of immune factors was found, whereas higher psychosocial distress was predictive of higher cortisol concentrations in human milk.In the current study we found no evidence for an association between natural variations in maternal distress and immune factor concentrations in milk. It is uncertain if this lack of association would also be observed in studies with larger populations, with less uniform demographic characteristics, or with women with higher (clinical) levels of anxiety, stress and/or depressive symptoms. In contrast, maternal psychosocial distress was positively related to higher milk cortisol concentrations at week 2 post-delivery. Further investigation on maternal psychosocial distress in relation to human milk composition is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3026498331,"It is well-documented that the representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities diminishes at higher levels of academia, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Sense of belonging—the extent to which an individual believes they are accepted, valued, and included in a community—is often emphasized as an important predictor of retention throughout academia. While literature addressing undergraduate sense of belonging is abundant, there has been little investigation of sense of belonging in graduate communities. Because graduate training is required to generate new scientific leaders, it is important to understand and address sense of belonging at the graduate level—paying explicit attention to devising strategies that can be used to increase representation at higher levels of academia. Here, a visual narrative survey and item response modeling are used to quantify sense of belonging among graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty within the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Results suggest that graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty all experience impostor phenomenon. Respondents struggle most with maintaining positive self-perceptions of their productivity, capabilities as a scientist, and success—particularly in comparison to their peers. Communicating about science with peers, talking about teaching hurdles, and engaging in mentoring relationships also contribute significantly to sense of belonging. Faculty members have the highest sense of belonging, while senior graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are least likely to feel a sense of belonging. Additionally, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who identify as underrepresented, as well as those who submit manuscripts for publication less than their peers, are less likely to feel a sense of belonging. This is the first study to generate a quantitative, nuanced understanding of sense of belonging within the entire graduate academic community of an R1 STEM department. We envision that these methods can be implemented within any research-focused academic unit to better understand the challenges facing community members and identify factors to address in promoting positive culture change. Furthermore, these methods and results should provide a foundation for devising interventions that academic stakeholders can use to directly improve graduate education."
https://openalex.org/W3028313533,"Background Cannabis use is common among marginalized people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) but reasons for use remain poorly investigated. We sought to explore how different intentions for cannabis use relate to social, structural, and behavioural factors among PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. Methods We used data from cannabis-using participants in two community-recruited prospective cohort studies of PWUD. Using latent class analysis, we identified discrete cannabis-using groups based on self-reported intentions for use. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine correlates of class membership. Results Between June 2016 and December 2018, 2,686 observations from 897 participants cannabis-using PWUD were analyzed. Four latent classes of cannabis use emerged: Class 1 (31.6%), characterized by non-medical purposes; Class 2 (37.5%), characterized by non-pain therapeutic use (e.g., stress, nausea/loss of appetite, and insomnia); characterized by Class 3 (21.9%) predominantly pain relief; and Class 4 (9.0%), characterized by a wide range of therapeutic uses in addition to pain management, including insomnia, stress, nausea/loss of appetite, and harm reduction. Class-specific structural, substance-, and health-related differences were observed, including indicators of better physical and mental health among the “recreational” class, despite evidence of more structural vulnerabilities (e.g., homelessness, incarceration). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate a wide spectrum of motivations for cannabis use among PWUD. We observed important health-related differences between latent classes, demonstrating possible unmet healthcare needs among PWUD reporting therapeutic cannabis use. These findings inform ongoing policy surrounding access to cannabis for harm reduction purposes and applications of medical cannabis for PWUD."
https://openalex.org/W3027396293,"Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is an extracellular monomeric single-chain glycoprotein expressed by many types of cells. Its elevated levels were found in cerebrospinal fluid in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases patients. The aim of the study was 1) to validate the reference interval of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CHI3L1 in a control group; 2) to measure the CHI3L1 concentration in different diagnosis groups .including multiple sclerosis (MS); and 3) to correlate those values with other biomarkers of axonal damage or neuroinflammation in different grous.The study included 132 CSF samples sent to the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Ostrava. Concentrations of CHI3L1, CXCL13 chemokine, neurofilament light chains, and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. IgG oligoclonal bands were detected by isoelectric focusing in agarose gels followed by immunofixation. IgM and FLC oligoclonal bands were analyzed by IEF followed by affinity immunoblotting. The group consisted of 42 patients with multiple sclerosis, 14 with clinically isolated syndrome, 11 with other central nervous system inflammatory diseases, 46 with non-inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, 4 with inflammatory diseases of the peripheral nervous system, and 15 controls.The estimated reference values of CHI3L1 were 28.6-182.5 μg.L-1. Statistically significant differences of CSF CHI3L1 concentrations were found among diagnosis groups (p < 0.0001), after age adjustment (p = 0.002). There was a statistically significant relationship between CHI3L1 and NFL in the MS group (rs = 0.460; P = 0.002), and between CHI3L1 and pNFH in the MS group (rs = 0.691; P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found in the categorical comparison of CHI3L1 in the MS group and other diagnostic groups as well as when using the Mann-Whitney U test for CHI3L1 with additional parameters with and without oligoclonal bands present.CSF CHI3L1 values differ depending on diagnosis and correlate significantly with concentrations of the axonal damage markers CSF neurofilament light chains, and CSF phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains, but not with CSF concentrations of the inflammatory marker CXCL13. Thus, CSF CHI3L1 could be another promising prognostic, albeit probably etiologically nonspecific, biomarker of MS."
https://openalex.org/W3028224972,"Digital e-cigarette marketing is largely unregulated and remains easily accessible to young people. The growing public concern around youth JUUL use and its viral presence on social media led the company to engage in several voluntary actions to remove and reduce JUUL-related content on Instagram in May 2018. The current study examined how JUUL-related Instagram content changed in the US following JUUL Labs' wave of voluntary actions in May 2018.In 2019, we collected a total of 50,817 JUUL-relevant posts by 16,323 unique users on Instagram from March 1-May 15, 2018 (Phase 1) and May 16-November 11, 2018 (Phase II) using the application programming interface. We conducted a semantic network analysis to identify major topic clusters over time.Approximately 14,838 JUUL-related posts were made by 5,201 accounts in Phase I and 35,979 posts were made by 11,122 accounts in Phase II. Major content clusters remained unchanged over time-key topics were JUUL-related product characteristics and JUUL-communities; the general vape community; and cannabis-related behavior. Of note, cannabis-related content grew in Phase II, particularly use of the term CBD.Our results reflect the limits of voluntary industry actions to reduce or change vaping-related content on social media. Rather, strong federal restriction on commercial tobacco marketing is the optimal pathway to reduce initial product marketing exposure among youth. These limits would make the emergence and viral contagion of brand-related social media content less likely and reduce its influence on youth behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3026258903,"This study compares thirteen rice-based cropping systems in the coastal part of West Bengal, India in terms of productivity, profitability, energetics, and emissions. Information on the crop management practices of these systems was collected on 60 farms through a questionnaire survey. Rice-bitter gourd system was observed to have the highest system yield (49.88 ± 4.34 tha-1yr-1) followed by rice-potato-ridge gourd (37.78 ± 2.77 tha-1yr-1) and rice-potato-pumpkin (36.84 ± 2.04 tha-1yr-1) systems. The rice-bitter gourd system also recorded the highest benefit:cost ratio (3.92 ± 0.061). The lowest system yield and economics were recorded in the rice-fallow-fallow system. Rice-sunflower system recorded highest specific energy (2.54 ± 0.102 MJkg-1), followed by rice-rice (2.14 ± 0.174 MJkg-1) and rice-fallow-fallow (1.91 ± 0.327 MJkg-1) systems, lowest being observed in the rice-bitter gourd (0.52 ± 0.290 MJkg-1) and rice-pointed gourd (0.52 ± 0.373 MJkg-1) systems. Yield-scaled GHGs (YSGHG) emission was highest (1.265 ± 0.29 t CO2eqt-1 system yield) for rice-fallow-fallow system and was lowest for rice-vegetable systems. To estimate the uncertainty of the YSGHG across different systems under study, Monte-Carlo Simulation was performed. It was observed that there was a 5% probability of recording YSGHG emission > 1.15 t CO2eqt-1 system yield from different cropping systems in the present experiment. Multiple system properties such as productivity, economics, energy, and emission from all rice-based systems taken together, the rice-vegetable system performed consistently well across parameters and may be practised for higher economic returns with judicious and sustainable utilization of resources in the coastal saline tracts of the region."
https://openalex.org/W3027997653,"Background Colonoscopy is a valuable screening tool for colorectal cancer. However, patients experience anxiety when faced with attending a first colonoscopy, and negative attitudes may contribute to non-attendance. Few studies in Europe have explored these attitudes, despite increasing colorectal cancer incidence. Study aim We conducted an online survey of the public in five European Union countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK), with the aim of understanding public knowledge of, perceptions of, and attitudes towards, colonoscopy and bowel preparation, amongst colonoscopy-naïve respondents. Attitudes towards colonoscopy were also gathered from colonoscopy-experienced patients. Methods Survey answers were gathered from 2,500 colonoscopy-naïve respondents and 500 colonoscopy-experienced patients, divided equally between countries. Results Across Europe, 72% of colonoscopy-naïve respondents showed receptiveness to colonoscopy if advised by their doctor to receive one, but only 45% understood its use to prevent colorectal cancer. Forty-three percent of colonoscopy-experienced respondents would still be embarrassed about having another colonoscopy, although 59% said that the experience had been better than expected. Colonoscopy-experienced respondents had greater aversion to bowel preparation than colonoscopy-naïve respondents (47% vs 26%), and 67% of colonoscopy-naïve respondents thought that only 1 litre of bowel preparation or less is required. Italians and the Spanish wanted more information than on average in Europe, while Germans had more realistic expectations of bowel preparation. Discussion There are perceptual gaps amongst the public around the purpose of colonoscopies, the subjective experience of the colonoscopy procedure, and the quantity of bowel preparation needed. These concerns could be mitigated by better education and using lower-volume bowel preparation techniques. Conclusion Europeans would have a colonoscopy, but its preventive medical purpose is poorly understood and there are misconceptions around the process. Further education about the procedure, its benefits and bowel preparation is vital to improve understanding and compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3028139034,"Vitreo-retinal (VR) surgeries induce conjunctival changes. However, there are no study reports regarding prevalence and severity of dry eye after these surgeries. This study evaluated dry eye outcome after VR surgery. Patients undergoing VR surgery classified as scleral buckle and microincision vitrectomy surgery (n = 44, mean age: 56.09±10.2 years) were recruited. Dry eye evaluation was done before and 8 weeks after surgery (2 weeks after omitting topical eye drops). Conjunctival imprint cytology for goblet cell count and tear Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) protein estimation was done. Gene expressions of MUC5AC, MUC4, MUC16, Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and AQP5 were analyzed in the conjunctival imprint cells by qPCR. None of the patients exhibited clinical signs of dry eye after VR surgery. But the conjunctival goblet cell density (GCD) was significantly lowered post-VR surgery (63% cases, **p = 0.012) with no alterations in the tear MUC5AC protein. Post-VR surgery, the conjunctival cell gene expression of MUC4, MUC16 and AQP4 were significantly increased (*p = 0.025, *p = 0.05 and *p = 0.02 respectively) and AQP5 was significantly lowered (*p = 0.037), with no change in MUC5AC expression. Tear cytokines were significantly increased post-VR surgery (anti-inflammatory: IL1RA, IL4, IL5, IL9, FGF; PDGFbb and pro-inflammatory: IL2, IL6, IL15, GMCSF and IFNg). Though clinical signs of dry eye were not observed after VR surgery, ocular surface changes in the form of reduced GCD, altered MUC5AC, MUC4, MUC16, AQP4, AQP5 and cytokines are suggestive of dry eye outcome at the molecular level especially inpatients aged above 51 years, especially female gender and those who are diabetic."
https://openalex.org/W3026678896,"Systemic delivery of conventional chemotherapies can cause negative systemic toxicity, including reduced immunity and damage to organs such as the heart and kidneys-limiting the maximum dose that can be administered. Targeted therapies appear to address this problem by having a specific target while mitigating off-target effects. Biocompatible perfluorocarbon-based nanodroplet emulsions encapsulated by a phospholipid shell are in development for delivery of molecular compounds and hold promise as vehicles for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumors. When ultrasound is applied, perfluorocarbon will undergo a phase change-ultimately inducing transient perforation of the cell membrane when in close proximity, which is more commonly known as ""sonoporation."" Sonoporation allows enhanced intracellular delivery of molecular compounds and will reseal to encapsulate the molecular compound intracellularly. In this study, we investigated delivery of thymoquinone (TQ), a natural hydrophobic phytochemical compound with bioactivity in cancer cells. In addition, we conjugated a G-quadruplex aptamer, 'AS1411', to TQ-loaded nanodroplets and explored their effects on multiple human cancer cell lines. AS1411 binds nucleolin, which is over-expressed on the surface of cancer cells, and in addition to its tumor-targeting properties AS1411 has also been shown to induce anti-cancer effects. Thymoquinone was loaded onto AS1411-conjugated nanodroplet emulsion to assess activity against cancer cells. Confocal microscopy indicated uptake of AS1411-conjugated nanodroplets by cancer cells. Furthermore, AS1411-conjugated nanoemulsions loaded with TQ significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells compared to free compound. These results demonstrate that AS1411 can be conjugated onto nanodroplet emulsions for targeted delivery to human cancer cells. This novel formulation offers significant potential for targeted delivery of hydrophobic chemotherapeutics to tumors for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3027154466,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has already changed our globalised world and its long-term impact is not yet known. It is apparent that businesses and institutions are increasingly affected. COVID-19 discussions often focus on intensive care units in hospitals. However, COVID-19 also effects life-saving and -prolonging radiotherapy for patients suffering from cancer. Method We have conducted a structured online survey among medical physicists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland from March 23rd to 26th 2020. In total 154 responses (82 completed, 72 partially completed) were analysed in the context of the COVID-19 dissemination. Results 72.4% of the respondent’s state that their processes are affected due to COVID-19, while the top three answers are longer processing times (54.2%), patient no-shows (42.5%) and staff reduction (36.7%). 75.8% expect further unavailability of their personnel in the upcoming weeks. All participants have already taken several measures, especially providing information for patients at the entrance (89.6%) or over the phone (73.6%), restricting access for accompanying persons (77.4%) and providing disinfectant at the entrance (72.6%). Discussion The results presented in this article aim to support business continuity and risk management for radiotherapy centres to prepare for future challenges. The results show that most radiotherapy centres has implemented initial contingency measures, applying them pragmatically. The main problem however remains, that is the high risk of infection both for patients and medical personnel along with the associated risk of temporarily loss of personnel and ordered closure of business."
https://openalex.org/W3027285663,"Conflicts caused by reintroduced native species are increasing; however, there is a knowledge gap concerning ecological knowledge and perception of local community members regarding the impact of these species on local ecosystem services and livelihoods. We studied local knowledge about beavers and the perception of their impact on ecosystem services and local livelihoods, and the perception of their general harmfulness and usefulness in Hungary and Romania in three ecologically distinct, diverse rural landscapes. Structured interviews were carried out with 45 knowledgeable and 45 randomly selected local informants. We found that locals were knowledgeable about legal status, biology and behavior of beavers and their diverse impact on nature and ecosystem services. Perceptions included mostly negative impacts on provisioning services, while both negative and positive impacts on regulating and cultural services were perceived, including some contradictory impacts of the species. In spite of the actual and anticipated potential future harms caused by beavers, most people appreciated its precise building mastery and ‘cute’ nature. We argue that communication between nature conservationists and locals should reflect this complexity of perceptions, while reciprocal learning could help to moderate local conflicts and develop adaptive management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3027247549,"Hypertrophy, associated with adipocyte dysfunction, causes increased pro-inflammatory adipokine, and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, leading to insulin resistance and obesity-related-health problems. By combining DNA microarray and genomic data analyses to predict DNA binding motifs, we identified the transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor 7 (IRF7) as a possible regulator of genes related to adipocyte hypertrophy. To investigate the role of IRF7 in adipocytes, we examined gene expression patterns in 3T3-L1 cells infected with a retrovirus carrying the IRF7 gene and found that enforced IRF7 expression induced the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a key initial adipokine in the chronic inflammation of obesity. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated-suppression of IRF7 significantly reduced MCP-1 mRNA. Luciferase assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR analysis and gel shift assay showed that IRF7 transactivates the MCP-1 gene by binding to its proximal Interferon Stimulation Response Element (ISRE), a putative IRF7 binding motif. IRF7 knockout mice exhibited lower expression of MCP-1 in epidydimal white adipose tissue under high-fat feeding conditions, suggesting the transcription factor is physiologically important for inducing MCP-1. Taken together, our results suggest that IRF7 transactivates MCP-1 mRNA in adipocytes, and it may be involved in the adipose tissue inflammation associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3027304484,"The use of 3D visualization technologies has increased rapidly in many applied fields, including geovisualization, and has been researched from many different perspectives. However, the findings for the benefits of 3D visualization, especially in stereoscopic 3D forms, remain inconclusive and disputed. Stereoscopic “real” 3D visualization was proposed as encouraging the visual perception of shapes and volume of displayed content yet criticised as problematic and limited in a number of ways, particularly in visual discomfort and increased response time in tasks. In order to assess the potential of real 3D visualization for geo-applications, 91 participants were engaged in this study to work with digital terrain models in different 3D settings. The researchers examined the effectivity of stereoscopic real 3D visualization compared to monoscopic 3D (or pseudo 3D) visualization under static and interactive conditions and applied three tasks with experimental stimuli representing different geo-related phenomena, i.e. objects in the terrain, flat areas marked in the terrain and terrain elevation profiles. The authors explored the significant effects of real 3D visualization and interactivity factors in terms of response time and correctness. Researchers observed that the option to interact (t = -10.849, p < 0.001) with a virtual terrain and its depiction with real 3D visualization (t = 4.64, p < 0.001) extended the participants’ response times. Counterintuitively, the data demonstrated that the static condition increased response correctness (z = 5.38, p < 0.001). Regarding detailed analysis of data, an interactivity factor was proposed as a potential substitute for real 3D visualization in 3D geographical tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3027828031,"Depression is one of the most prevalent health problems, frequently being a medium- and long-term condition, with a high comorbidity rate and with frequent relapses and recurrences. Although numerous studies have compared the effectiveness of specific antidepressant therapy drugs and have assessed relapses, scientific evidence on the relationship between pharmacologic treatments and recurrence is scarce. The objective of this study is to describe depressive episodes in a primary care patient cohort, the percentage of depression recurrences and the administered pharmacologic treatment, from a naturalistic perspective.Retrospective descriptive study. 957 subjects were included. The dependent variable was a depression diagnosis and independent variables were: gender, age at time of data collection; age of onset, first-episode treatment, number of recurrences, age at recurrences, treatment prescribed for recurrences using therapeutic groups categorization.Recurrences are frequent, affecting more than 40% of the population. In the first episode, 13.69% of the patients were not prescribed pharmacological treatment, but this percentage decreased over the following depression episodes. 80.9% of the patients who did not receive drug treatment in the first depression episode did not experience subsequent episodes. Monotherapy, and specifically, SSRIs were the most frequently prescribed treatment option for all depressive episodes. Regards the combined pharmacologic treatment, the most frequent drug combinations were SSRIs and benzodiazepines.In order to increase the power of results, the statistical analysis was performed using therapeutic groups categorization, not individually analyzing each drug and dose.Depressive episode recurrence is frequent in primary care patients. Further studies having a prospective design are needed in order to expand on this issue."
https://openalex.org/W3026097806,"The overexploitation of medicinal plants is depleting gene pool at an alarming rate. In this scenario inducing the genetic variability through targeted mutations could be beneficial in generating varieties with increased content of active compounds. The present study aimed to develop a reproducible protocol for in vitro multiplication and mutagenesis of Hyoscyamus niger targeting putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) and 6β-hydroxy hyoscyamine (H6H) genes of alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. In vitro raised callus were treated with different concentrations (0.01% - 0.1%) of Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS). Emerging multiple shoots and roots were obtained on the MS media supplemented with cytokinins and auxins. Significant effects on morphological characteristics were observed following exposure to different concentrations of EMS. EMS at a concentration of 0.03% was seen to be effective in enhancing the average shoot and root number from 14.5±0.30 to 22.2 ±0.77 and 7.2±0.12 to 8.8±0.72, respectively. The lethal dose (LD50) dose was calculated at 0.08% EMS. The results depicted that EMS has an intense effect on PMT and H6H gene expression and metabolite accumulation. The transcripts of PMT and H6H were significantly upregulated at 0.03–0.05% EMS compared to control. EMS treated explants showed increased accumulation of scopolamine (0.639 μg/g) and hyoscyamine (0.0344μg/g) compared to untreated."
https://openalex.org/W3026161652,"Objectives To determine the incidence of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) and presumed contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) following contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with intravenous application of a reduced dose of the iso-osmolar contrast agent iodixanol in cancer patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods 198 oncology patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60ml/min/1.73m2 undergoing a total of 237 CECTs using a reduced dose of 60ml iodixanol were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed for the entire cohort and subgroups. The effect of additional risk factors on the occurrence of PC-AKI was evaluated. Results The overall PC-AKI incidence was 6.3%. Excluding patients with concurrent medical conditions known to directly and independently impact kidney function and patients with AKI preceding the CT-scan resulted in a presumed CI-AKI incidence of 3.8%. No permanent post-contrast worsening of renal function and no AKI treatment were required. Subgroups considering baseline eGFR yielded PC-AKI incidences of 4.6% (eGFR 45-60ml/min/1.73m2, n = 130), 7.4% (eGFR 30-45ml/min/1.73m2, n = 95) and 16.7% (eGFR <30ml/min/1.73m2, n = 12). Additional patient related risk factors did not show any significant effect on the occurrence of PC-AKI. Conclusions Low incidences of PC-AKI/CI-AKI suggest that a reduced dose of an iso-osmolar contrast agent is safe in high-risk oncological patients with impaired renal function."
https://openalex.org/W3028412342,"Female genital mutilation is a harmful traditional practice that violates girls’ right to health and overall well-being. Most research cites social acceptance, marriageability, community belonging, proof of virginity, curbing promiscuity, hygiene, and religion as motivations for the practice. It is generally assumed that individual attitudes of parents and other family members have an impact on decisions related to the cutting of girls, and that such attitudes are influenced by social norms. The aim of this study is to understand how parental attitudes towards the practice of female genital mutilation influence decision making related to the cutting of girls. Data from 15 Demographic and Health Surveys were analyzed to assess whether couples with at least one living daughter aged 0 to 14 years share the same opinions about the continuation of the practice, and to what extent couples’ opinions are associated with the risk of daughters being cut. The analysis reveals that a significant percentage of couples hold discordant opinions on the continuation of the practice including in countries where the practice is very common. While a daughter’s likelihood of being cut is much higher when both parents think the practice should continue, the analysis also shows that many cut girls have parents who oppose the practice. It further suggests that female genital mutilation is more prevalent among daughters whose mothers want the practice to continue and whose fathers are opposed or undecided, compared to daughters with fathers who are the sole parent supporting its continuation. Understanding the extent to which parental opinions influence decisions and which girls are most likely to be cut is essential for developing appropriate interventions aimed at promoting the abandonment of the practice."
https://openalex.org/W3026248130,"SPARCL1 is a matricellular protein with anti-adhesive, anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic functions and is frequently downregulated in tumors such as colorectal carcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer. Studies have identified SPARCL1 as an angiocrine tumor suppressor secreted by tumor vessel endothelial cells, thereby exerting inhibitory activity on angiogenesis and tumor growth, in colorectal carcinoma. It is unknown whether SPARCL1 may exert these homeostatic functions in all organs and in other species. Therefore, SPARCL1 expression was comparatively analysed between humans and mice in a systematic manner. Murine Sparcl1 (mSparcl1) is most strongly expressed in the lung; expressed at an intermediate level in most organs, including the large intestine; and absent in the liver. In human tissues, SPARCL1 (hSPARCL1) was detected in all organs, with the strongest expression in the stomach, large intestine and lung, mostly consistent with the murine expression pattern. A striking difference between human and murine tissues was the absence of mSparcl1 expression in murine livers, while human livers showed moderate expression. Furthermore, mSparcl1 was predominantly associated with mural cells, whereas hSPARCL1 was detected in both mural and endothelial cells. Human SPARCL1 expression was downregulated in different carcinomas, including lung and colon cancers. In conclusion, this study revealed species-, organ- and cell-type-dependent expression of SPARCL1, suggesting that its function may not be similar between humans and mice."
https://openalex.org/W3026357397,"Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is often used to monitor wildlife populations and to develop statistical population models. Animals caught and released are often not included in CPUE metrics and their inclusion may create more accurate indices of abundance. We used 21 years of detailed harvest records for bobcat (Lynx rufus) in Wisconsin, U.S.A., to calculate CPUE and 'actual CPUE' (ACPUE; including animals caught and released) from bobcat hunters and trappers. We calibrated these metrics to an independent estimate of bobcat abundance and attempted to create simple but effective models to estimate CPUE and ACPUE using harvest success data (i.e., bobcats harvested/available permits). CPUE showed virtually no relationship with bobcat abundance across all years, but both CPUE and ACPUE had stronger, non-linear, and negative relationships with abundance during the periods when the population was decreasing. Annual harvest success strongly predicted composite ACPUE and CPUE from hunters and trappers and hunter ACPUE and CPUE but was a poorer predictor of trapper ACPUE and CPUE. The non-linear, and sometimes weak, relationships with bobcat abundance likely reflect the increasing selectivity of bobcat hunters for trophy animals. Studies calibrating per-unit-effort metrics against abundance should account for population trajectories and different harvest methods (e.g., hunting and trapping). Our results also highlight the potential for estimating per-unit-effort metrics from relatively simple and inexpensive data sources and we encourage additional research into the use of per-unit-effort metrics for population estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3028483605,"Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder that affects pigment cell-containing organs such as the eye (e.g., chronic and/or recurrent granulomatous panuveitis). While the exact etiology and pathogenic mechanism of VKH disease are unclear, HLA-DR4 alleles have been documented to be strongly associated with VKH disease in various ethnic groups. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) found two new genetic risk factors (IL23R-C1orf141 and ADO-ZNF365-EGR2) in a non-HLA region from a Han Chinese population. In this study, we replicated these GWAS findings in a Japanese population. A total of 1,643 Japanese samples (380 cases with VKH disease and 1,263 healthy controls) were recruited. We assessed four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shown in previous GWAS: rs78377598 and rs117633859 in IL23R-C1orf141, and rs442309 and rs224058 in ADO-ZNF365-EGR2. A significant allelic association with VKH disease was observed for all of the four SNPs (rs78377598: pc = 0.0057; rs117633859: pc = 0.0017; rs442309: pc = 0.021; rs224058: pc = 0.035). In genotypic association analysis, the minor alleles of IL23R-C1orf141 rs78377598 and rs117633859 had the strongest association with disease susceptibility under the additive model (pc = 0.0075 and pc = 0.0026, respectively). The minor alleles of ADO-ZNF365-EGR2 rs442309 and rs224058 were most strongly associated with disease susceptibility under the dominant model (pc = 0.00099 and pc = 0.0023, respectively). The meta-analysis of the current and previous studies found that all of the four SNPs exhibited a significantly strong association with VKH disease (meta-p < 0.00001: rs78377598, meta-odds ratio (OR) = 1.69; rs1176338, meta-OR = 1.82; rs442309, meta-OR = 1.34; rs224058, meta-OR = 1.33). In summary, our study replicated significant associations with VKH disease susceptibility reported in a previous GWAS. Thus, the IL23R-C1orf141 and ADO-ZNF365-EGR2 loci may play important roles in the development of VKH disease through genetic polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W3027202621,"Objective Aggressive antidiabetic therapy and rapid glycemic control are associated with diabetic neuropathy. Here we investigated if this is also the case for Charcot neuroarthropathy. Research design and methods HbA1c levels and other relevant data were extracted from medical databases of 44 cases of acute Charcot neuroarthropathy. Results HbA1c levels significantly declined from 8.25% (67mmol/mol) [7.1%–9.4%](54-79mmol/mol), at -6 months (M-6), to 7.40%(54mmol/mol) [6.70%–8.03%] (50–64 mmol/mol) during the six months preceding the diagnosis of Charcot neuroarthropathy (P <0.001). Conclusions HbA1c levels significantly declined during the six months preceding the onset of Charcot neuroarthropathy. This decline seems to be a associated factor with the appearance of an active phase of Charcot neuroarthropathy in poorly controlled patients with diabetic sensitive neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W3027443473,"Purpose To determine the concordance rate between core needle biopsy/vacuum-assisted biopsy (CNB/VAB) and postoperative histopathology in B3 (lesions of uncertain malignant potential) and B5a (in situ) lesions found on mammograms or ultrasound. Material and methods 2,029 consecutive biopsies performed over 10 years for patients who underwent mammograms or ultrasounds. For CNB 14G needle and for VAB 8G/10G needles were used. In all biopsies, we identified the age, BI-RADS®, histopathological biopsy results, B-category, nuclear grade for DCIS and postoperative histopathology results in B3 and B5a cases from the biopsy. Results The B-categories from CNB/VAB were as follows: B2 42.2 percent (n = 856), B3 4.5 percent (n = 91), B5a 5.7 percent (n = 115), and B5b 47.6 percent (n = 967). In the B3-category, 72/91 patients underwent surgical excision, with a concordance rate of 83.3 percent (n = 60/72) and a discordance rate of 16.7 percent (n = 12/72) to postoperative histopathology. From the discordant cases, 67.7 percent (n = 8/12) showed DCIS and 32.3 percent (n = 4/12) showed invasive breast cancer. The BIRADS of the discordant cases was 4b in 41.7 percent (n = 5/12) and 5 in 58.3 percent (n = 7/12). The PPVs for malignancy of B3 lesions were 0.21, with no statistical significance between subgroups. In the B5a-category, 101 of 115 patients underwent surgery in our hospital, with a concordance rate of 80.2 percent (n = 81/101) and a discordance rate of 19.8 percent (n = 20/101) to postoperative histopathology. From the discordant cases, 55 percent (n = 11/20) showed invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (NST). Conclusion Our concordance rate for B3 (83.3 percent) and B5a (80.2 percent) lesions in the biopsies to postoperative histopathology is matching to previously published literature. Surgical excision is our recommendation for lesions biopsied with a B3 category in the histopathology and a BIRADS category of (4b, 4c and 5). The PPVs for malignancy of B3 lesions showed no statistical significance between subgroups. Also, the nuclear grade of DCIS was not statistically significant in terms of upgrade into invasive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3027926044,"Background Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) remains the most sensitive and specific marker for the differentiation of ascites due to portal hypertension from ascites due to other causes. SAAG has some limitations and may fail in selected conditions. Voltammetric analysis (VA) has been used for the detection of electroactive species of biological significance and has proven effective for detection infections in biological fluids. Aims In this study, we compared the accuracy of voltammetric analysis (VA) with that of SAAG to differentiate ascites due to portal hypertension from that having a different origin. Methods 80 ascites samples were obtained from patients undergoing paracentesis at the Campus Bio-Medico Hospital of Rome. VA was performed using the BIONOTE device. The ability of VA to discriminate ascitic fluid etiology and biochemical parameters was evaluated using Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), with ten-fold cross-validations. Results Mean age was 68.6 years (SD 12.5), 58% were male. Ascites was secondary to only portal hypertension in 72.5% of cases (58 subjects) and it was secondary to a baseline neoplastic disease in 27.5% of cases (22 subjects). Compared to SAAG≥1.1, e-tongue predicted ascites from portal hypertension with a better accuracy (92.5% Vs 87.5%); sensitivity (98.3% Vs 94.8%); specificity (77.3% Vs 68.2%); predictive values (PPV 91.9% Vs 88.7% and NPV 94.4% Vs 83.3%). VA correctly classified ascites etiology in 57/58 (98.2%) of cases with portal hypertension and in 17/22 (77.2%) of cases with malignancy. Instead, VA showed poor predictive capacities towards total white blood count and polymorphonuclear cell count. Conclusions According to this proof of concept study, VA qualifies as a promising low-cost and easy method to discriminate between ascites secondary to portal hypertension and ascites due to malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W3028009069,"The most common method used to estimate ages of harvested white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and other cervids is a criterion based on tooth replacement-and-wear (TRW). Previous studies have shown this method is prone to considerable error because TRW is partially subjective. A presumably more accurate, but more labor intensive and expensive, method to estimate age involves the counting of cementum annuli (CA) of cross-sectioned incisors. Quantifying rate of error of the CA aging method is not possible without known-aged specimens, but precision of duplicate CA age estimates for two teeth may be related to accuracy if identical factors influence both CA accuracy and precision. The objective of this research was to identify and assess factors affecting precision of paired CA ages as well as evaluate congruence between TRW and CA age estimates. We obtained paired CA age estimates from a laboratory specializing in CA aging for 473 adult (≥ 1 year old), male white-tailed deer harvested in Iowa (USA; 2014–2018). Not all CA age estimates of paired incisors agreed with one another and probability of agreement between the paired CA ages decreased as the certainty level of the CA ages provided by the laboratory decreased and was dependent upon the batches in which they were aged by the laboratory. We also estimated the age of 1,292 adult, male deer using both TRW and CA methods and compared the congruence between the TRW and CA age estimates. Congruence rates of CA and TRW ages differed among age classes (80% congruence in yearling TRW age classification, 65% with 2-year-olds, 78% with ≥3-year-olds). Our results showed that CA aging is imperfect and that the certainty level is an important factor to consider with CA ages, as shown in previous research, as is the batch in which the teeth were aged. We also confirmed previous studies’ findings that CA and TRW ages for adult deer are not always congruent, particularly in age classes other than the yearling age class. Our results suggest managers are best served by using TRW to age adult deer as yearlings or ≥2-years-old. If additional age classes are required, CA aging is likely to be a better tool than TRW."
https://openalex.org/W3028254638,"Environmental changes cause stress, Reactive Oxygen Species and unfolded protein accumulation which hamper synaptic activity and trigger cell death. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) assist protein refolding to maintain proteostasis and cellular integrity. Mechanisms regulating the activity of HSPs include transcription factors and posttranslational modifications that ensure a rapid response. HSPs preserve synaptic function in the nervous system upon environmental insults or pathological factors and contribute to the coupling between environmental cues and neuron control of development. We have performed a biased screening in Drosophila melanogaster searching for synaptogenic modulators among HSPs during development. We explore the role of two small-HSPs (sHSPs), sHSP23 and sHSP26 in synaptogenesis and neuronal activity. Both sHSPs immunoprecipitate together and the equilibrium between both chaperones is required for neuronal development and activity. The molecular mechanism controlling HSP23 and HSP26 accumulation in neurons relies on a novel gene (CG1561), which we name Pinkman (pkm). We propose that sHSPs and Pkm are targets to modulate the impact of stress in neurons and to prevent synapse loss."
https://openalex.org/W3028278526,"Microbial community functional diversity is a sensitive indicator of soil quality, soil management such as tillage and crop residue which can affect the microbial community functional diversity of paddy field. However, there is still limited information about the influence of different tillage and crop residue management on rhizosphere soil microbial community functional diversity in a double-cropping rice (Oryza sativa L.) field. Therefore, four tillage treatments were set up in paddy field, tillage treatments were included: conventional tillage with residue incorporation (CT), rotary tillage with residue incorporation (RT), no-tillage with residue retention (NT), and rotary tillage with residue removed as control (RTO). And the effects of CT, RT, NT, and RTO treatments on the average well color development (AWCD), genetic diversity indices and carbon source utilization of rhizosphere soil were studied in the present paper. The results showed that the values of AWCD with CT, RT and NT treatments were higher than that of RTO treatment. It was implied that application of crop residue management resulted in the variation of the carbon utilization efficiency of rhizosphere soil microbial communities. At maturity stages of early and late rice, the Richness indices, Shannon indices and McIntosh indices with CT treatment were significantly higher than that of RTO treatment, and with the order as CT>RT>NT>RTO. Principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated that there were significant differences in carbon substrate utilization patterns among different tillage treatments. Carbohydrates and amino acids were the main carbon resources utilized by rhizosphere soil microbes. Therefore, the combined application of tillage with crop residue management could significantly increase the rhizosphere soil microbial community functional diversity in the double-cropping paddy field of southern China."
https://openalex.org/W3027842994,"Influenza causes numerous deaths worldwide every year. Predicting the number of influenza patients is an important task for medical institutions. Two types of data regarding influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) are often used for flu prediction: (1) historical data and (2) user generated content (UGC) data on the web such as search queries and tweets. Historical data have an advantage against the normal state but show disadvantages against irregular phenomena. In contrast, UGC data are advantageous for irregular phenomena. So far, no effective model providing the benefits of both types of data has been devised. This study proposes a novel model, designated the two-stage model, which combines both historical and UGC data. The basic idea is, first, basic regular trends are estimated using the historical data-based model, and then, irregular trends are predicted by the UGC data-based model. Our approach is practically useful because we can train models separately. Thus, if a UGC provider changes the service, our model could produce better performance because the first part of the model is still stable. Experiments on the US and Japan datasets demonstrated the basic feasibility of the proposed approach. In the dropout (pseudo-noise) test that assumes a UGC service would change, the proposed method also showed robustness against outliers. The proposed model is suitable for prediction of seasonal flu."
https://openalex.org/W3028303954,"Background Recent infectious disease outbreaks highlight the importance of competent professionals with expertise on public health preparedness and response at airports. The availability of a competency profile for this workforce supports efficient education and training. Although competency profiles for infectious disease control professionals are available, none addresses the complex airport environment. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop a competency profile for professionals involved in infectious disease preparedness and response at airports in order to stimulate and direct further education and training. Methods We developed the competency profile through the following steps: 1) extraction of competencies from relevant literature, 2) assessment of the profile in a national RAND modified Delphi study with an interdisciplinary expert group (n = 9) and 3) assessment of the profile in an international RAND modified Delphi study with an airport infectious disease management panel of ten European countries (n = 10). Results We systematically studied two competency profiles on infectious disease control and three air transport guidelines on event management, and extracted 61 relevant competencies for airports. The two RAND modified Delphi procedures further refined the profile, mainly by specifying a competency’s target group, the organizational level it should be present on, and the exact actions that should be mastered. The final profile, consisting of 59 competencies, covers the whole process from infectious disease preparedness, through the response phase and the recovery at airports. Conclusion We designed a profile to support training and exercising the multidisciplinary group of professionals in infectious disease management in the airport setting, and which is ready for use in practice. The many adaptations and adjustments that were needed to develop this profile out of existing profiles and air transport guidelines suggest that other setting-specific profiles in infectious disease control are desirable."

We observed growth improvement in Group 2 more pronounced in males (weight z-score) at D42 (-1.688±0.758 vs. -1.370±0.762, p = 0.045), D49 (-1.696±0.776 vs. -1.370±0.718, p = 0.051), D56 (-1.748±0.855 vs. -1.392±0.737, p = 0.072), D63 (-1.885±0.832 vs. -1.336±0.779 p = 0.016), and D70 (-2.001±0.747 vs. -1.228±0.765 p = 0.004). There was no difference in females or in morbidities between the groups. We observed low compliance to the protocol in both groups: similar energy intake but higher lipid intake in Group 1 and higher protein intake in Group 2.The quality of nutritional care with a strictly-defined protocol may significantly improve weight gain for very preterm infants. As compliance remained low, an educational reinforcement is needed to prevent PGR.This retrospective study was registered by ClinicalTrials.gov under number NCT03217045, and by the CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés) under study number R2015-1 for the Maternity of the CHRU of Nancy."
https://openalex.org/W3028356263,"Skin forms a physical barrier that protects the body against outside agents. The deepest layer of the skin, the stratum basale, contains two cell types: agent-sensing keratinocytes, and melanin-producing melanocytes. Keratinocytes can sense both harmless commensal organisms and harmful pathogens via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and keratinocytes subsequently drive immune responses. Activation of TLR3 is required for barrier repair because it stimulates essential genes, including tight junction genes, and inflammatory cytokines. Within the basal layer of the skin, resident melanocytes use their dendritic processes to connect with approximately 30-40 neighboring keratinocytes. Most studies have focused on the transfer of melanin-synthesizing melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes, but the potential regulation of melanogenesis by soluble factor(s) produced by keratinocytes remains to be explored. Studying such regulation in vivo is challenging because of the keratinocyte:melanocyte ratio in the epidermis and the location of the cells within the skin. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether keratinocytes affected melanocyte melanogenesis in vitro under normal or inflammatory conditions. We found that polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] stimulation induced PD-L1 secretion from HaCaT cells and that poly(I:C)-induced PD-L1 inhibited melanin production by B16F10 cells. These data provide key evidence that keratinocytes can alter melanocyte melanogenesis via the production of soluble factors under inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3027368915,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and it may promote the progression of atherosclerosis, but the mechanisms behind this process are not completely understood. We previously showed that the phosphorylation of Akt within THP-1 macrophages is increased in response to the lipid hydrolysis products generated by LPL from total lipoproteins. Notably, the free fatty acid (FFA) component was responsible for this effect. In the present study, we aimed to reveal more detail as to how the FFA component may affect Akt signalling. We show that the phosphorylation of Akt within THP-1 macrophages increases with total FFA concentration and that phosphorylation is elevated up to 18 hours. We further show that specifically the palmitoleate component of the total FFA affects Akt phosphorylation. This is tied with changes to the levels of select molecular species of phosphoinositides. We further show that the total FFA component, and specifically palmitoleate, reduces apolipoprotein A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux, and that the reduction can be reversed in the presence of the Akt inhibitor MK-2206. Overall, our data support a negative role for the FFA component of lipoprotein hydrolysis products generated by LPL, by impairing macrophage cholesterol efflux via Akt activation."
https://openalex.org/W3027605967,"Bird-window collisions are the second leading cause of human-related avian mortality for songbirds in Canada. Our ability to accurately estimate the number of fatalities caused by window collisions is affected by several biases, including the removal of carcasses by scavengers prior to those carcasses being detected during surveys. We investigated the role of scavenger behavior in modifying perceived carcass removal rate while describing habitat-specific differences for the scavengers present in a relatively scavenger-depauperate island ecosystem. We used motion activated cameras to monitor the fate of hatchling chicken carcasses placed at building (under both windows and windowless walls) and forest (open and closed canopy) sites in western Newfoundland, Canada. We recorded the identity of scavengers, timing of events, and frequency of repeat scavenging at sites. Using 2 treatments, we also assessed how scavenging varied with 2 levels of carcass availability (daily versus every third day). Scavenger activities differed substantially between forest and building sites. Only common ravens (Corvus corax) removed carcasses at building sites, with 25 of 26 removals occurring under windows. Burying beetles (Nicrophorus spp.) dominated scavenging at forest sites (14 of 18 removals), completely removing carcasses from sight in under 24 hours. Availability had no effect on removal rate. These findings suggest that ravens look for carcasses near building windows, where bird-window collision fatalities create predictable food sources, but that this learning preceded the study. Such behavior resulted in highly heterogeneous scavenging rates at fine spatial scales indicating the need for careful consideration of carcass and camera placement when monitoring scavenger activity. Our observations of burying beetle activity indicate that future studies investigating bird collision mortality near forested habitats and with infrequent surveys, should consider local invertebrate community composition during survey design. The high incidence of invertebrate scavenging may compensate for the reduced vertebrate scavenger community of insular Newfoundland."

This study hypothesized that adolescents with educational aspirations have greater motivation to invest in the future, including maintenance of oral health status. Aim To analyze the association between a school academic climate of educational aspirations and tooth loss (first permanent molars) among adolescents. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed to include 2,500 adolescents (aged 14–19 years) enrolled in public high schools of Olinda located in Northeast Brazil. Multilevel Poisson regression random intercept models were conducted with tooth loss (first permanent molars) as the outcome. The primary cohort of interest was school academic climate, as measured by the proportion of students taking the national high school exams. Results Tooth loss of the first permanent molars (assessed by clinical exam) was more prevalent in adolescents from more disadvantaged backgrounds (receiving family allowance, low maternal education). However, after controlling for a wide range of individual characteristics, adolescents enrolled in schools with lower academic climate had a higher prevalence of tooth loss (PR 1.42, 95%CI: 1.09,1.85). Conclusion The school academic climate is associated with tooth loss, suggesting that educational aspirations are linked to adolescent oral health maintenance behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3028262384,"High plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) concentration is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR) regulates LDL metabolism, and thereby plasma LDL-c concentration. Recently, we have identified the (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] as a novel regulator of LDL metabolism, which regulates LDLR degradation and hence its protein abundance and activity. In silico analysis suggests that the (P)RR is a target of miR-148a. In this study we determined whether miR-148a could regulate LDL metabolism by regulating (P)RR expression in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. We found that miR-148a suppressed (P)RR expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of the (P)RR mRNA. Mutating the binding sites for miR-148a in the 3'-UTR of (P)RR mRNA completely abolished the inhibitory effects of miR-148a on (P)RR expression. In line with our recent findings, reduced (P)RR expression resulted in decreased cellular LDL uptake, likely as a consequence of decreased LDLR protein abundance. Overexpressing the (P)RR prevented miR-148a-induced reduction in LDLR abundance and cellular LDL uptake. Our study supports a new concept that miR-148a is a regulator of (P)RR expression. By reducing (P)RR abundance, miR-148a decreases LDLR protein abundance and consequently cellular LDL uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3028436826,"Real-time reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) normalized to an internal reference gene (RG), is a frequently used method for quantifying gene expression changes in neuroscience. Although RG expression is assumed to be constant independent of physiological or experimental conditions, several studies have shown that commonly used RGs are not expressed stably. The use of unstable RGs has a profound effect on the conclusions drawn from studies on gene expression, and almost universally results in spurious estimation of target gene expression. Approaches aimed at selecting and validating RGs often make use of different statistical methods, which may lead to conflicting results. Based on published RG validation studies involving hypoxia the present study evaluates the expression of 5 candidate RGs (Actb, Pgk1, Sdha, Gapdh, Rnu6b) as a function of hypoxia exposure and hypothermic treatment in the neonatal rat cerebral cortex–in order to identify RGs that are stably expressed under these experimental conditions–using several statistical approaches that have been proposed to validate RGs. In doing so, we first analyzed RG ranking stability proposed by several widely used statistical methods and related tools, i.e. the Coefficient of Variation (CV) analysis, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the ΔCt method. Using the Geometric mean rank, Pgk1 was identified as the most stable gene. Subsequently, we compared RG expression patterns between the various experimental groups. We found that these statistical methods, next to producing different rankings per se, all ranked RGs displaying significant differences in expression levels between groups as the most stable RG. As a consequence, when assessing the impact of RG selection on target gene expression quantification, substantial differences in target gene expression profiles were observed. Altogether, by assessing mRNA expression profiles within the neonatal rat brain cortex in hypoxia and hypothermia as a showcase, this study underlines the importance of further validating RGs for each individual experimental paradigm, considering the limitations of the statistical methods used for this aim."
https://openalex.org/W3028498448,"Bowel preparation with low-residue diet (LRD) has resulted in higher patient satisfaction and similar polyp detection rates compared to conventional clear liquid diet. However, there is limited experience with LRD in veterans, in whom conditions associated with poor bowel preparation are more prevalent than the general population. To examine risk factors associated with inadequate bowel preparation, we conducted a chart review of outpatient colonoscopies at the Manhattan VA Medical Center from February 2017 to April 2018. To examine patient satisfaction and compliance, we administered an anonymous questionnaire to patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopy from March to August 2018. Patients assessed by chart review (n = 660) were 92% male with a mean age of 64 years. An adequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score ≥2 in each colonic segment was achieved in 94% of procedures. Higher BMI, diabetes, prior inadequate bowel preparation, bowel preparation duration of two days, and opioid use were associated with inadequate bowel preparation on univariable analysis. On multiple logistic regression, only higher BMI remained a predictor, with every one-unit increase associated with a 6% increased odds of poor bowel preparation. Questionnaire responses showed 84% of patients were willing to repeat LRD bowel preparation, 85% found the process easy or acceptable, and 78% reported full adherence to LRD. These findings demonstrate that bowel preparation quality, patient satisfaction, and compliance were all high among veterans using LRD."

https://openalex.org/W3026237064,"In animal studies on bone healing, the effect of housing space and physical activity are seldom taken into account. Bone formation was evaluated in New Zealand White rabbits (mean ± SEM BW: 3.9 ± 0.11 kg) with a critical bone defect after 12 weeks of rehabilitation in pair-housing in 3 m2 large floor pens (Floor, n = 10) or standard single housing in 0.43 m2 cages (Cage, n = 10). In the randomised full-factorial study, a bone replica of calcium phosphate cement (CPC, n = 10) or autologous bone (AB, n = 10) was implanted in the unilateral 20 mm radius defect. Post-mortem, the oxidative capacity was measured by citrate synthase (CS) activity in M. quadriceps and the defect filling volume and density evaluated by microcomputer tomography (μ-CT). Histology sections were evaluated by subjective scoring and histomorphometry. Fourteen rabbits remained until the end of the study. Group Floor (n = 7; 3 CPC + 4 AB) had a higher CS activity and a larger bone defect filling volume and lower density by μ-CT measurements than group Cage (n = 7; 3 CPC + 4 AB). Three out of four rabbits in AB-Floor presented fusion of the defect with reorganisation of trabecular bone, whereas three of four in AB-Cage showed areas of incomplete healing. Floor rabbits had a higher score of bony fusion between the radius and ulna than Cage rabbits. There were no differences between groups in histomorphometry. The study found that a larger housing space increased physical activity and promoted bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W3026868131,"Over twenty years of work on the Hanson Ranch (HR) Bonebed in the Lance Formation of eastern Wyoming has yielded over 13,000 individual elements primarily of the hadrosaurid dinosaur Edmontosaurus annectens. The fossil bones are found normally-graded within a fine-grained (claystone to siltstone) bed that varies from one to two meters in thickness. Almost all specimens exhibit exquisite preservation (i.e., little to no abrasion, weathering, and breakage), but they are disarticulated which, combined with our sedimentological observations, suggests that the bones were remobilized and buried after a period of initial decay and disarticulation of Edmontosaurus carcasses. Because of the large number of recovered fossil elements, we have been able to gain deeper insight into Edmontosaurus biostratigraphy including disarticulation and transport of skeletal elements. The most common postcranial elements in the bonebed are pubes, ischia, scapulae, ribs, and limb bones. By contrast, vertebrae, ilia, and chevrons are rare. The most common craniomandibular bones include dentaries, nasals, quadrates, and jugals, whereas the premaxillae, predentaries, and braincase bones are underrepresented. Thus, overall, chondrocranial and axial elements, as well as distal elements of the limbs, are distinctly underrepresented. We hypothesize that following decay and disarticulation, hydraulic winnowing removed the articulated sections (e.g., vertebral columns) and the small, distal-most elements before, or at the same time, the remaining bones were swept up in a subaqueous debris flow that generated the deposit. Comparison of the HR Bonebed with other widely dispersed Upper Cretaceous hadrosaurid-dominated bonebeds reveals many shared attributes, which suggests similar processes at work in the formation of these bonebeds across space and time. This in turn reflects similar behavior by populations of these species around the world resulting in similar modes of death, becoming interred in similar depositional settings."
https://openalex.org/W3026971627,"The innovation of a particular company benefits the whole industry when innovation technology transfers to others. Similarly, the development and innovation in internet companies influence the development and innovation of the industry. This investigation has applied a unique approach of meta-frontier analysis to estimate and analyze the innovation in internet companies in China. A unique dataset of Chinese internet companies from 2000 to 2017 has been utilized to estimate and compare the innovation over the period of study. The change in technology gap ratio (TGR) and a shift in production function have translated into innovation which was overlooked by previous studies. It is found that the production function of internet companies is moving upward in the presence of external factors such as smartphones invention, mobile internet, mobile payments, and artificial intelligence, etc. Consequently, a sudden increase in TGR is captured due to the innovation of some companies. Hence, the average TE of the industry falls caused by the increased distance of other companies form industry production function. However, the innovation advantage defused when other companies start imitating and the average TE elevates. A steady increase in the TGR index revealed that the continuous innovation-based growth of some companies lifting the production frontier upward. This provides the opportunity for other companies to imitate and provides continuous growth in the industry. This study provides a novel methodological approach to measure innovation and also provide practical implication by empirical estimation of innovation in Chinese internet companies."
https://openalex.org/W3027320665,"Due to climate change, numerous ice bodies have been lost in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). As a consequence, deglaciation is expected to impact the marine environment and its biota at physiological and ecosystem levels. Nuculana inaequisculpta is a marine bivalve widely distributed around Antarctica that plays an important role for ecosystem functioning. Considering that N. inaequisculpta inhabits coastal areas under effect of glacial melt and retreat, impacts on its nutritional condition are expected due to alterations on its physiology and food availability. To test this hypothesis, biochemical composition (lipids, proteins, and fatty acids) and energy content were measured in individuals of N. inaequisculpta collected in a fjord at different distances to the retreating glacier in the WAP. Oceanographic parameters of the top and bottom-water layers (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a) were measured to investigate how the environment changes along the fjord. Results showed that surface oceanographic parameters displayed a lower temperature and dissolved oxygen, but a higher salinity and chlorophyll-a content at nearest compared to farthest sites to the glacier. In contrast, a lower temperature and chlorophyll-a, and a higher salinity and dissolved oxygen was measured in the bottom-water layer toward the glacier. N. inaequisculpta had a higher amount of lipids (17.42 ± 3.24 vs. 12.16 ± 3.46%), protein (24.34 ± 6.12 vs. 21.05 ± 2.46%) and energy content (50.57 ± 6.97 J vs. 39.14 ± 5.80 J) in the farthest compared to the nearest site to the glacier. No differences were found in total fatty acids among all sites. It seems likely that lower individual fitness related to proximity to the glacier would not be related to nutritional quality of sediment food, but rather to food quantity."
https://openalex.org/W3016501128,"Introduction To evaluate efficacy of antithrombotic agents in critically ill patients with elevated troponin I level during intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods and results It was a retrospective observational study which was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. All patients hospitalized in ICU for >3 days and with available serum troponin I data from December 2015 to July 2017 were included. Patients with definite diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were excluded. We divided patients with troponin I elevation into three groups; no prescription, chronic prescription and new prescription of antithrombotic agents during ICU admission. We defined new prescription when patients were on antithrombotic agents, including antiplatelet agents, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin after troponin I was found to be elevated at ICU admission and chronic prescription, if antithrombotic agents were on medication list more than 30 days before ICU admission. Primary outcomes were 30-day and one-year all-cause mortality. Of 597 subjects who met inclusion criteria, 407 (68%) patients had elevated troponin I (>0.1 ng/mL) on ICU admission. These patients had increased 30-day [hazard ratio (HR), 1.679; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.132–2.491; p = 0.009] and one-year (HR, 1.568; 95% CI, 1.180–2.083; p = 0.002) all-cause mortality compared with those without elevated troponin I. In patients with elevated troponin I, there was no significant difference of 30-day all-cause mortality among three groups (p = 0.051) whereas patients on chronic prescription showed significant survival benefit in one-year all-cause mortality when compared to those without or with new prescription (p = 0.008). Conclusions In critically ill patients, elevated troponin I in the absence of AMI was associated with poor prognosis. Newly prescribed antithrombotic agents in ICU didn’t reveal the difference in short and long-term prognosis while chronic antithrombotic agent use was associated with better one-year survival rate, suggesting that these drugs play a protective role in this high-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W3026968444,"The enzymatic reactions leading to the deamination of β-lysine, lysine, or 2-aminoadipic acid are of great interest for the metabolic conversion of lysine to adipic acid. Enzymes able to carry out these reactions are not known, however ammonia lyases (EC 4.3.1.-) perform deamination on a wide range of substrates. We have studied 3-methylaspartate ammonia lyase (MAL, EC 4.3.1.2) as a potential candidate for protein engineering to enable deamination towards β-lysine, that we have shown to be a competitive inhibitor of MAL. We have characterized MAL activity, binding and inhibition properties on six different compounds that would allow to define the molecular determinants necessary for MAL to deaminate our substrate of interest. Docking calculations showed that β-lysine as well as the other compounds investigated could fit spatially into MAL catalytic pocket, although they probably are weak or very transient binders and we identified molecular determinants involved in the binding of the substrate. The hydrophobic interactions formed by the methyl group of 3-methylaspartic acid, together with the presence of the amino group on carbon 2, play an essential role in the appropriate binding of the substrate. The results showed that β-lysine is able to fit and bind in MAL catalytic pocket and can be potentially converted from inhibitor to substrate of MAL upon enzyme engineering. The characterization of the binding and inhibition properties of the substrates tested here provide the foundation for future and more extensive studies on engineering MAL that could lead to a MAL variant able to catalyse this challenging deamination reaction."
https://openalex.org/W3026437382,"This paper reports an experimental study on the electrical properties of five coal samples taken from various Chinese coal mines. The dielectric permittivity and specific resistivity of grinded coal samples subjected to electromagnetic (EM) fields in a wide frequency spectrum were determined. Based on the experimental data, a set of approximating equations of the change in electric properties the 100-1000 MHz frequency region was obtained. These equations, along with EM equations for EM speed and attenuation, were used for modeling and studying radar-wave propagation in a coal seam and radar-wave reflection from the body of miners trapped in collapsed tunnels. The modeling concept assumes that a radar transducer with the dominating frequency of 500 MHz is lowered through a vertical or inclined rescue borehole to the depth of the coal seam. It is assumed that only the miner is present in the part of the tunnel that did not collapse. Thus, in the path of the radar wave from the transducer to the human body, only one geological interface reflecting the radar signals is present (coal-air) and one is connected with human body. The human (acting as the reflector) can be located at various distances from the tunnel face; this factor was included in the analyzed geometrical model. Based on the modeling results of different thickness coal seams (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8m), conclude that a radar wave reflected from a human body can be reliably measured, when the distance between the human and the transducer is not exceed 8m."
