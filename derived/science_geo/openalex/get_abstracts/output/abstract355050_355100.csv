https://openalex.org/W2069871552,"Background Tobacco dependence is the leading cause of preventable death and disabilities worldwide and nicotine is the main substance responsible for the addiction to tobacco. A vaccine against nicotine was tested in a 6-month randomized, double blind phase II smoking cessation study in 341 smokers with a subsequent 6-month follow-up period. Methodology/Principal Findings 229 subjects were randomized to receive five intramuscular injections of the nicotine vaccine and 112 to receive placebo at monthly intervals. All subjects received individual behavioral smoking cessation counseling. The vaccine was safe, generally well tolerated and highly immunogenic, inducing a 100% antibody responder rate after the first injection. Point prevalence of abstinence at month 2 showed a statistically significant difference between subjects treated with Nicotine-Qβ (47.2%) and placebo (35.1%) (P = 0.036), but continuous abstinence between months 2 and 6 was not significantly different. However, in subgroup analysis of the per-protocol population, the third of subjects with highest antibody levels showed higher continuous abstinence from month 2 until month 6 (56.6%) than placebo treated participants (31.3%) (OR 2.9; P = 0.004) while medium and low antibody levels did not increase abstinence rates. After 12 month, the difference in continuous abstinence rate between subjects on placebo and those with high antibody response was maintained (difference 20.2%, P = 0.012). Conclusions Whereas Nicotine-Qβ did not significantly increase continuous abstinence rates in the intention-to-treat population, subgroup analyses of the per-protocol population suggest that such a vaccination against nicotine can significantly increase continuous abstinence rates in smokers when sufficiently high antibody levels are achieved. Immunotherapy might open a new avenue to the treatment of nicotine addiction. Trial Registration Swiss Medical Registry 2003DR2327; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00369616"
https://openalex.org/W1984171637,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has at least nine multidrug efflux pumps. Among these pumps, AcrAB is effective in generating drug resistance and has wide substrate specificity. Here we report that indole, bile, and an Escherichia coli conditioned medium induced the AcrAB pump in Salmonella through a specific regulator, RamA. The RamA-binding sites were located in the upstream regions of acrAB and tolC. RamA was required for indole induction of acrAB. Other regulators of acrAB such as MarA, SoxS, Rob, SdiA, and AcrR did not contribute to acrAB induction by indole in Salmonella. Indole activated ramA transcription, and overproduction of RamA caused increased acrAB expression. In contrast, induction of ramA was not required for induction of acrAB by bile. Cholic acid binds to RamA, and we suggest that bile acts by altering pre-existing RamA. This points to two different AcrAB regulatory modes through RamA. Our results suggest that RamA controls the Salmonella AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux system through dual regulatory modes in response to environmental signals."

Potyvirus is one of the two largest plant virus genera and contains about 15% of all named plant virus species. When and why did the potyviruses become so numerous? Here we answer the first question and discuss the other. Methods and Findings We have inferred the phylogenies of the partial coat protein gene sequences of about 50 potyviruses, and studied in detail the phylogenies of some using various methods and evolutionary models. Their phylogenies have been calibrated using historical isolation and outbreak events: the plum pox virus epidemic which swept through Europe in the 20th century, incursions of potyviruses into Australia after agriculture was established by European colonists, the likely transport of cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus in cowpea seed from Africa to the Americas with the 16th century slave trade and the similar transport of papaya ringspot virus from India to the Americas. Conclusions/Significance Our studies indicate that the partial coat protein genes of potyviruses have an evolutionary rate of about 1.15×10−4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year, and the initial radiation of the potyviruses occurred only about 6,600 years ago, and hence coincided with the dawn of agriculture. We discuss the ways in which agriculture may have triggered the prehistoric emergence of potyviruses and fostered their speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2090545754,"X-chromosome inactivation, which occurs in female eutherian mammals is controlled by a complex X-linked locus termed the X-inactivation center (XIC). Previously it was proposed that genes of the XIC evolved, at least in part, as a result of pseudogenization of protein-coding genes. In this study we show that the key XIC gene Xist, which displays fragmentary homology to a protein-coding gene Lnx3, emerged de novo in early eutherians by integration of mobile elements which gave rise to simple tandem repeats. The Xist gene promoter region and four out of ten exons found in eutherians retain homology to exons of the Lnx3 gene. The remaining six Xist exons including those with simple tandem repeats detectable in their structure have similarity to different transposable elements. Integration of mobile elements into Xist accompanies the overall evolution of the gene and presumably continues in contemporary eutherian species. Additionally we showed that the combination of remnants of protein-coding sequences and mobile elements is not unique to the Xist gene and is found in other XIC genes producing non-coding nuclear RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2038123362,"Ci-VSP contains a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) homologous to that of voltage-gated potassium channels. Using charge displacement (‘gating’ current) measurements we show that voltage-sensing movements of this VSD can occur within 1 ms in mammalian membranes. Our analysis lead to development of a genetically encodable fluorescent protein voltage sensor (VSFP) in which the fast, voltage-dependent conformational changes of the Ci-VSP voltage sensor are transduced to similarly fast fluorescence read-outs."
https://openalex.org/W1998676843,"Background An understanding of BC cell (BCC) entry into bone marrow (BM) at low tumor burden is limited when compared to highly metastatic events during heavy tumor burden. BCCs can achieve quiescence, without interfering with hematopoiesis. This occurs partly through the generation of gap junctions with BM stroma, located close to the endosteum. These events are partly mediated by the evolutionary conserved gene, Tac1. Methodogy/Principal Findings This study focuses on the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), Tac1, SDF-1 and CXCR4 in BCC entry into BM. The model is established in studies with low numbers of tumor cells, and focuses on cancer cells with low metastatic and invasion potential. This allowed us to recapitulate early event, and to study cancer cells with low invasive potential, even when they are part of larger numbers of highly metastatic cells. A novel migration assay showed a facilitating role of MSCs in BCC migration across BM endothelial cells. siRNA and ectopic expression studies showed a central role for Tac1 and secondary roles for SDF-1α and CXCR4. We also observed differences in the mechanisms between low invasive and highly metastatic cells. The in vitro studies were verified in xenogeneic mouse models that showed a preference for low invasive BCCs to BM, but comparable movement to lung and BM by highly metastatic BCCs. The expressions of Tac1 and production of SDF-1α were verified in primary BCCs from paired samples of BM aspirates and peripheral blood. Conclusions/Significance MSC facilitate BCC entry into BM, partly through Tac1-mediated regulation of SDF-1α and CXCR4. We propose a particular population of BCC with preference for BM could be isolated for characterization. This population might be the subset that enter BM at an early time period, and could be responsible for cancer resurgence and resistance to current therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2074875824,"The gaseous hormone ethylene is perceived in Arabidopsis by a five member receptor family that consists of the subfamily 1 receptors ETR1 and ERS1 and the subfamily 2 receptors ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. Previous work has demonstrated that the basic functional unit for the ethylene receptor, ETR1, is a disulfide-linked homodimer. We demonstrate here that ethylene receptors isolated from Arabidopsis also interact with each other through noncovalent interactions. Evidence that ETR1 associates with other ethylene receptors was obtained by co-purification of ETR1 with tagged versions of ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 from Arabidopsis membrane extracts. ETR1 preferentially associated with the subfamily 2 receptors compared with the subfamily 1 receptor ERS1, but ethylene treatment affected the interactions and relative composition of the receptor complexes. When transgenically expressed in yeast, ETR1 and ERS2 can form disulfide-linked heterodimers. In plant extracts, however, the association of ETR1 and ERS2 can be largely disrupted by treatment with SDS, supporting a higher order noncovalent interaction between the receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that the receptor GAF domains are capable of mediating heteromeric receptor interactions. Kinetic analysis of ethylene-insensitive mutants of ETR1 is consistent with their dominance being due in part to an ability to associate with other ethylene receptors. These data suggest that the ethylene receptors exist in plants as clusters in a manner potentially analogous to that found with the histidine kinase-linked chemoreceptors of bacteria and that interactions among receptors contribute to ethylene signal output."
https://openalex.org/W1975098913,"Venomous animals from distinct phyla such as spiders, scorpions, snakes, cone snails, or sea anemones produce small toxic proteins interacting with a variety of cell targets. Their bites often cause pain. One of the ways of pain generation is the activation of TRPV1 channels. Screening of 30 different venoms from spiders and sea anemones for modulation of TRPV1 activity revealed inhibitors in tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa venom. Several separation steps resulted in isolation of an inhibiting compound. This is a 56-residue-long polypeptide named APHC1 that has a Bos taurus trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)/Kunitz-type fold, mostly represented by serine protease inhibitors and ion channel blockers. APHC1 acted as a partial antagonist of capsaicin-induced currents (32 +/- 9% inhibition) with half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) 54 +/- 4 nm. In vivo, a 0.1 mg/kg dose of APHC1 significantly prolonged tail-flick latency and reduced capsaicin-induced acute pain. Therefore, our results can make an important contribution to the research into molecular mechanisms of TRPV1 modulation and help to solve the problem of overactivity of this receptor during a number of pathological processes in the organism."
https://openalex.org/W1980172171,"Behavioral studies of Caenorhabditis elegans traditionally are done on the smooth surface of agar plates, but the natural habitat of C. elegans and other nematodes is the soil, a complex and structured environment. In order to investigate how worms move in such environments, we have developed a technique to study C. elegans locomotion in microstructures fabricated from agar.When placed in open, liquid-filled, microfluidic chambers containing a square array of posts, we discovered that worms are capable of a novel mode of locomotion, which combines the fast gait of swimming with the more efficient movements of crawling. When the wavelength of the worms matched the periodicity of the post array, the microstructure directed the swimming and increased the speed of C. elegans ten-fold. We found that mutants defective in mechanosensation (mec-4, mec-10) or mutants with abnormal waveforms (unc-29) did not perform this enhanced locomotion and moved much more slowly than wild-type worms in the microstructure.These results show that the microstructure can be used as a behavioral screen for mechanosensory and uncoordinated mutants. It is likely that worms use mechanosensation in the movement and navigation through heterogeneous environments."
https://openalex.org/W2009751329,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is known to play an important role in motility of tumor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with HA-promoted melanoma cell motility are not fully understood. Treatment of cells with HA was shown to increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a CD44-dependent manner. Antioxidants, such as N-acetyl-l-cysteine and seleno-l-methionine, prevented HA from enhancing cell motility. Protein kinase C (PKC)-α and PKCδ were responsible for increased Rac1 activity, production of ROS, and mediated HA-promoted cell motility. HA increased Rac1 activity via CD44, PKCα, and PKCδ. Transfection with dominant negative and constitutive active Rac1 mutants demonstrated that Rac1 was responsible for the increased production of ROS and cell motility by HA. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase by diphenylene iodonium and down-regulation of p47Phox and p67Phox decreased the ROS level, suggesting that NADPH oxidase is the main source of ROS production. Rac1 increased phosphorylation of FAK. FAK functions downstream of and is necessary for HA-promoted cell motility. Secretion and expression of MMP-2 were increased by treatment with HA via the action of PKCα, PKCδ, and Rac1 and the production of ROS and FAK. Ilomastat, an inhibitor of MMP-2, exerted a negative effect on HA-promoted cell motility. HA increased interaction between CD44 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). AG1478, an inhibitor of EGFR, decreased phosphorylation of PKCα, PKCδ, and Rac1 activity and suppressed induction of p47Phox and p67Phox. These results suggest that CD44-EGFR interaction is necessary for HA-promoted cell motility by regulating PKC signaling. EGFR-Akt interaction promoted by HA was responsible for the increased production of ROS and HA-promoted cell motility. In summary, HA promotes CD44-EGFR interaction, which in turn activates PKC signaling, involving Akt, Rac1, Phox, and the production of ROS, FAK, and MMP-2, to enhance melanoma cell motility.

The dominant negative PKCα and PKCδ constructs were kindly provided by Prof. Soh Jaewon (Inha University, Korea). Pep-1 (GAHWQFNALTVR) and a control peptide (GFWCRRSGLVGV) were synthesized by Peptron (Daejon, Korea). Cell Culture—The melanoma B16F10 cell line was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. ROS Measurement—Serum-starved melanoma cells on coverslips were treated with or without various concentrations of HA (20, 100, 200 μg/ml) for 20 min. DCFH-DA (10 μm) was then added for 10 min to measure the production of ROS. Cells were then immediately observed by the use of laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 410, Carl Zeiss). The samples were excited by a 488-nm argon laser, and the images were filtered by use of a long pass 515-nm filter. About 20 cells were randomly chosen from three independent experiments, and the dichlorofluorescein fluorescence intensities of melanoma cells treated with hyaluronic acid were measured. For the measurement of peroxynitrite (ONOO–), 5 μm DHR123 was used instead of DCFH-DA. To examine the effect of CD44 on ROS generation by following HA exposure, melanoma cells were preincubated with a monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody (3 μg/ml) for 2 h. Cells were then treated with HA (200 μg/ml) for 20 min. Cells were further incubated with DCFH-DA for 10 min. The effect of PKC on ROS production was determined by transiently transfecting cells with a control vector (2 μg), or a dominant negative PKCα (2 μg), or dominant negative PKCδ (2 μg). After transfection (48 h), cells were treated without or with HA (200 μg/ml). ROS measurements were performed as described. To ensure that the hyaluronic acid used in this study was free of contaminants, cells were treated with hyaluronic acid in the presence or absence of hyaluronidase (30 units/ml). Hyaluronidase was activated by preincubation at 37 °C for 30 min and was inactivated by preincubation at 65 °C for 30 min. NADPH Oxidase Activity Assay—NADPH oxidase activity was measured according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Stratagene). The assay medium, comprised of 100 μm luminol and enhancer, was added to melanoma cells. HA (200 μg/ml), in the presence or absence of DPI (10 μm), was then added. Incubation was continued for 30 min. Chemiluminescence was measured continuously in a luminometer. To examine the effect of down-regulation of p47Phox and p67Phox on NADPH oxidase, cells were transiently transfected with 10 nm each of a control siRNA, p47Phox siRNA, or p67Phox siRNA. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured by using xanthine oxidase/xanthine luminol solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene). Western Blot Analysis—For PAGE and Western blot, cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10 mm NaF, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The samples were boiled for 5 min, and equal amounts of protein (20 μg/well) were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to immunoblotting. The antibodies and dilutions included anti-Rac1 (1:1,000), anti-rhoGDI (1:1,000), anti-phospho-rhoGDI (1:1,000), anti-FAK (1:1,000), anti-phospho-FAKY397 (1:1,000), anti-phospho-FAKY925 (1:1,000), anti-p40Phox (1:1,000), anti-p47Phox (1:1,000), anti-p67Phox (1:1,000), anti-CD44 (1:2,000), anti-EGFR (1:3,000), anti-Akt (1:2,000), anti-phospho-AktS473(1:2,000), anti-snail (1: 3000), anti-E-cadherin (1:2,000), anti-N-cadherin (1:3,000), anti-vimentin (1:3,000), and anti-actin (1:2,000). After extensive washing, blots were further incubated with an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody at a 1:3,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature and were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (5 μg), anti-EGFR antibody (5 μg), or anti-Akt antibody (5 μg) on ice for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose was then added, and the reaction was performed at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotary shaker. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, and 2× sample buffer was added to the beads. Boiled samples were then loaded on gels. Western immunoblot analyses were followed according to standard procedures. Chemoinvasion Assay—The invasive potential of melanoma cells was determined by using a Transwell chamber system with 8-μm pore polycarbonate filter inserts (Costar, Acton, MA). The lower and upper sides of the filter were coated with gelatin and Matrigel, respectively. Melanoma cells treated with HA for 16 h were harvested by trypsinization and counted. Trypsinized cells (2 × 104) in the serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were then added to each upper chamber of the Transwell. RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower chamber, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were fixed with methanol, and invaded cells were stained and counted. To determine effect of ROS on chemoinvasion, melanoma cells were treated with H2O2 (10 μm) or ONOO– (10 μm) for 2 h. Trypsinized cells were then subjected to chemoinvasion assays. To determine the effect of antioxidants on HA-promoted chemoinvasion, melanoma cells were pretreated with or without NAC (100 μm) or sL-MT (10 μm) for 1 h. The effect of PKC, Rac1, FAK, MMP-2, and EGFR on chemoinvasion was also determined. Results were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student’s t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Wound Migration Assays—Melanoma cells were cultured on 6-well plates coated with fibronectin, type IV collagen, or Matrigel (10 μg/cm2 each) until confluent. Confluent cultures of melanoma cells were treated with hyaluronic acid. Wounds were made by scraping with micropipette tips. Photographs were taken at 48 h after a wound was made. The migration distance and the number of cells migrated was measured for the determination of cell motility. To determine the effect of antioxidants on HA-promoted wound migration, melanoma cells were pretreated with NAC (100 μm), DPI (10 μm), or sL-MT (30 μm) for 1 h, followed by treatment with HA (200 μg/ml). The direct effect of ROS on wound migration was determined by addition of H2O2 (10 μm) or ONOO– (10 μm) for various time intervals. Wound migration assays were performed as described above. Results were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student’s t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Rac1 Activity Assay—Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and treated with HA (200 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were quickly rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) plus protease inhibitors. Cells were scraped, and cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. To determine the levels of Rac1-GTP, 400 μl of each cell lysate was incubated with PAK (CRIB)-GST beads for 1 h with rocking at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm, and supernatant was discarded. The beads were then washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Finally, 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to the beads, and the mixture was boiled for 10 min. The levels of active Rac1, Rac1-GTP, were detected by Western blotting using specific monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). Approximately 10 μgof total lysate was analyzed to examine the levels of total Rac1, rhoGDI, phospho-rhoGDI, or actin (Sigma). Analysis of Interaction between Rac1 and Phox in the Membrane—Cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and were lysed by sonication. The lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants constitute the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in the above buffer, which also contained 0.1% Triton X-100, and the mixture was lysed by sonication and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the membrane fraction (supernatant). The Rac1 levels in these membrane fractions were analyzed by Western blotting to determine the extent of Rac1 translocation to the membrane. To determine the binding of the translocated Rac1 to rhoGDI and phox, the membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Rac1 antibody (5 μg), and the levels of rhoGDI, p47Phox, p67Phox, and anti-p40Phox in the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, cells treated with HA were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and lysed in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Anti-Rac1 antibody (5 μg) was added to the cell lysates, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h on ice. After incubation, 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads was added and incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were eluted with 2× sample buffer, and the proteins were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. Preparation of siRNA Duplexes—The siRNA duplexes were constructed with the following target sequences: p47Phox, sense (5′-AAATGTTCCCTATTGAGGCAGCCTGTCTC-3′), and antisense (5′-AACTGCCTCAATAGGGAACATCCTGTCTC-3′); p67Phox, sense (5′-AAGTACACGGTAGTCATGAAGCCTGTCTC-3′), and antisense (5′-AACTTCATGACTACCGTGTACCCTGTCTC-3′); and control, sense (5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTCCTGTCTC-3′), and antisense (5′-AAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAACCTGTCTC-3′). The construction of siRNAs was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). Transfection of the siRNA construct was performed by Lipofectamine. Gelatin Zymography—Conditioned medium from cells cultured in serum-free medium was mixed 3:1 with substrate gel sample buffer (40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE containing type I gelatin (2 mg/ml). After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in Triton X-100 and shaken for 30 min with one change of solution. The gel was rinsed and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3). After incubation, the gel was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 40% water. To determine the effect of PKCα and PKCδ on the secretion and induction of MMP-2, cells were pretreated with Gö6976 (1 μm) or rottlerin (10 μm) for 1 h. Cells were then treated with or without HA (200 μg/ml) for 4 h. Gelatin zymography was performed as described. To determine the effect of Rac1 on the secretion and induction of MMP-2, cells were transiently transfected with a control vector (2 μg) or dominant negative Rac1 construct (2 μg) plasmid. After transfection (48 h), cells were then treated with or without HA (200 μg/ml) for 4 h. Gelatin zymography was performed as described. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—pGL3 vector (2 μg; Promega, Madison, WI) containing wild type or mutant MMP-2 promoter was transiently transfected into melanoma cells, along with 0.6 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector. For transfection, Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was used. Twenty four hours after the transfection, cells were treated with or without HA (200 μg/ml) for 4 h, and a luciferase activity assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Tropix, Applied Biosystems). Luciferase activities were measured with the use of a luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A pGL3-basic control vector, without an insert, was used as a negative control for the transfection experiments. Luciferase activities were normalized using β-galactosidase. Transfections of other constructs for luciferase activity assays were carried out as described. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—AP-1-binding assays in nuclear extracts were performed with biotin-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides (Panomics, Fremont, CA), and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay gel shift kit (Panomics). A reaction mixture containing 10 μg of nuclear protein was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 10 μl with a binding mixture containing 10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 2 pmol of oligonucleotide probe, with or without a nonlabeled 10-fold excess of competitor oligonucleotides. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE buffer (1× TBE: 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA), transferred to Biodyne nylon membranes (Pierce), and then cross-linked on a Stratagene cross-linker. Protein gel shifts were visualized with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescent detection. For antibody supershift assay, 5 μg of anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reactions and incubated for 45 min at room temperature before gel loading. Nucleotide sequence of biotin-labeled AP-1 was 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGA-3′. The AP-1 recognition sequence is underlined. HA Increases the ROS Level in Melanoma Cells and Cell Motility via the Action of CD44—We first examined whether HA promoted cell motility via the action of CD44. Inhibition of CD44 exerted negative effects on HA-promoted chemoinvasion (Fig. 1A) and wound migration (Fig. 1B). HA-CD44 interaction plays a significant role in HA-promoted cell motility (21Bartolazzi A. Peach R. Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Synthetic pep-1 that binds to and inhibits the function of HA significantly suppressed HA-promoted cell motility (Fig. 1, C and D). ROS mediated fibroblast migration by increasing phosphorylation of Cortactin (22Sangrar W. Gao Y. Scott M. Truesdell P. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6140-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, ROS mediated growth factor-induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (23Schroder K. Helmcke I. Palfi K. Krause K.H. Busse R. Brandes R.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1736-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HA Enhances Cell Motility by Increasing the Level of ROS—Because treatment of cells with HA enhances cell motility, we proposed that HA would affect intracellular ROS level. To determine the effect on ROS, melanoma cells treated with various concentrations of HA were incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Hyaluronidase (30 units/ml) was added along with HA to determine specificity of HA. Hyaluronidase reversed the effect of HA on ROS production (Fig. 2A, upper panel) and chemoinvasion (Fig. 2B). The high molecular weight form of HA (1 MDa), but not the low molecular weight form, increased the level of ROS (Fig. 2A, lower panel). HA increased the level of ROS in melanoma cells in a CD44-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). To determine whether HA increased the level of peroxynitrite, cells treated with HA were incubated with DHR123. HA increased the level of peroxynitrite via the action of CD44. SL-MT, a peroxynitrite scavenger, decreased the level of ROS in melanoma cells treated with HA (data not shown). These results suggest that HA-promoted cell motility is accompanied by an increased level of ROS. ROS have been shown previously to play an important role in cell motility (24Moldovan L. Mythreye L. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Satterwhite L.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of ROS on HA-promoted cell motility was examined. The antioxidant NAC (100 μm) prevented HA from enhancing invasion (Fig. 2D) and wound migration (Fig. 2E). SL-MT, a scavenger of peroxynitrite, also prevented HA in cells from enhancing chemoinvasion and wound migration. These results indicate that ROS are necessary for HA-promoted cell motility. HA Activates Rac1 via the Action of CD44—The role of Rac1 in the generation of ROS has been previously reported (25Cheng G. Diebold B.A. Hughes Y. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17718-17726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). GST pulldown assay was performed to examine whether HA affected Rac1 activity. HA was found to activate Rac1, in a time-dependent (Fig. 3A) and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). However, HA did not affect RhoA activity (data not shown). Effects of various molecular weight forms of HA on Rac1 activity were examined. The high molecular weight forms of HA (100 kDa and 1 MDa), but not the low molecular weight form of HA (6 kDa), increased Rac1 activity (Fig. 3C). Monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody prevented HA from increasing Rac1 activity and the induction of p47Phox and p67Phox (Fig. 3D). NADPHoxidase complex is composed of three cytosolic proteins (p40Phox, p47Phox, and p67Phox), the catalytic subunit gp91Phox, and p22Phox. Rac1 increases the production of ROS through the activation of NADPH oxidase (26Frey R.S. Gao X. Javaid K. Siddiqui S.S. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281"
https://openalex.org/W2087692517,"The pathophysiology underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle is incompletely characterized. To further delineate this we investigated the interaction between insulin signaling, mitochondrial regulation, and function in C2C12 myotubes and in skeletal muscle. In myotubes elevated insulin and glucose disrupt insulin signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. The insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione pioglitazone restores these perturbations in parallel with induction of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC-1alpha. Overexpression of PGC-1alpha rescues insulin signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics, and its silencing concordantly disrupts insulin signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In primary skeletal myoblasts pioglitazone also up-regulates PGC-1alpha expression and restores the insulin-resistant mitochondrial bioenergetic profile. In parallel, pioglitazone up-regulates PGC-1alpha in db/db mouse skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the small interfering RNA knockdown of the insulin receptor in C2C12 myotubes down-regulates PGC-1alpha and attenuates mitochondrial bioenergetics. Concordantly, mitochondrial bioenergetics are blunted in insulin receptor knock-out mouse-derived skeletal myoblasts. Taken together these data demonstrate that elevated glucose and insulin impairs and pioglitazone restores skeletal myotube insulin signaling, mitochondrial regulation, and bioenergetics. Pioglitazone functions in part via the induction of PGC-1alpha. Moreover, PGC-1alpha is identified as a bidirectional regulatory link integrating insulin-signaling and mitochondrial homeostasis in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2100137641,"Human albumin is thought to hydrolyze esters because multiple equivalents of product are formed for each equivalent of albumin. Esterase activity with <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate has been attributed to turnover at tyrosine 411. However, <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate creates multiple, stable, acetylated adducts, a property contrary to turnover. Our goal was to identify residues that become acetylated by <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate and determine the relationship between stable adduct formation and turnover. Fatty acid-free human albumin was treated with 0.5 mm <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate for 5 min to 2 weeks, or with 10 mm <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate for 48 h to 2 weeks. Aliquots were digested with pepsin, trypsin, or GluC and analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify labeled residues. Only Tyr-411 was acetylated within the first 5 min of reaction with 0.5 mm <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate. After 0.5–6 h there was partial acetylation of 16–17 residues including Asp-1, Lys-4, Lys-12, Tyr-411, Lys-413, and Lys-414. Treatment with 10 mm <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate resulted in acetylation of 59 lysines, 10 serines, 8 threonines, 4 tyrosines, and Asp-1. When Tyr-411 was blocked with diisopropylfluorophosphate or chlorpyrifos oxon, albumin had normal esterase activity with β-naphthyl acetate as visualized on a nondenaturing gel. However, after 82 residues had been acetylated, esterase activity was almost completely inhibited. The half-life for deacetylation of Tyr-411 at pH 8.0, 22 °C was 61 ± 4 h. Acetylated lysines formed adducts that were even more stable. In conclusion, the pseudo-esterase activity of albumin is the result of irreversible acetylation of 82 residues and is not the result of turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2071768899,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a multicausal disease characterized by motor neuron degeneration in the spinal cord and brain. Cell therapy may be a promising new treatment for this devastating disorder. We recently showed that a single low dose (10(6) cells) of mononuclear human umbilical cord blood (MNC hUCB) cells administered intravenously to G93A mice delayed symptom progression and modestly prolonged lifespan. The aim of this pre-clinical translation study is to optimize the dose of MNC hUCB cells to retard disease progression in G93A mice. Three different doses of MNC hUCB cells, 10x10(6), 25x10(6) and 50x10(6), were administered intravenously into pre-symptomatic G93A mice. Motor function tests and various assays to determine cell effects were performed on these mice.Our results showed that a cell dose of 25x10(6) cells significantly increased lifespan of mice by 20-25% and delayed disease progression by 15%. The most beneficial effect on decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain and spinal cord was found in this group of mice. Human Th2 cytokines were found in plasma of mice receiving 25x10(6) cells, although prevalent human Th1 cytokines were indicated in mice with 50x10(6) cells. High response of splenic cells to mitogen (PHA) was indicated in mice receiving 25x10(6) (mainly) and 10x10(6) cells. Significantly increased lymphocytes and decreased neutrophils in the peripheral blood were found only in animals receiving 25x10(6) cells. Stable reduction in microglia density in both cervical and lumbar spinal cords was also noted in mice administered with 25x10(6) cells.These results demonstrate that treatment for ALS with an appropriate dose of MNC hUCB cells may provide a neuroprotective effect for motor neurons through active involvement of these cells in modulating the host immune inflammatory system response."
https://openalex.org/W1966522800,"Redox regulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) has been described, but the molecular mechanism underlying such regulation has remained unclear. We recently showed that a novel disulfide reductase, TRP14, inhibits tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced NF-κB activation, and we identified the dynein light chain LC8, which interacts with the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, as a potential substrate of TRP14. We now show the molecular mechanism by which NF-κB activation is redox-dependently regulated through LC8. LC8 inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in HeLa cells by interacting with IκBα and thereby preventing its phosphorylation by IκB kinase (IKK), without affecting the activity of IKK itself. TNFα induced the production of reactive oxygen species, which oxidized LC8 to a homodimer linked by the reversible formation of a disulfide bond between the Cys2 residues of each subunit and thereby resulted in its dissociation from IκBα. Butylated hydroxyanisol, an antioxidant, and diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, attenuated the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by TNFα stimulation. In addition LC8 inhibited NF-κB activation by other stimuli including interleukin-1β and lipopolysaccharide, both of which generated reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, TRP14 catalyzed reduction of oxidized LC8. Together, our results indicate that LC8 binds IκBα in a redox-dependent manner and thereby prevents its phosphorylation by IKK. TRP14 contributes to this inhibitory activity by maintaining LC8 in a reduced state.

Dyneins are large multi-component complexes that function as microtubule-based molecular motors both in the cytoplasm and in flagella (1King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dyneins participate in a variety of intracellular motile processes including mitosis and vesicular transport, whereas axonemal dyneins provide motive force for the beating of cilia and flagella. The 8-kDa dynein light chain (LC8, also known as DLC8 or DLC1) was originally identified in flagellar dynein of Chlamydomonas (2King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and was subsequently found to be a component of cytoplasmic dynein motor (3King S.M. Barbarese E.

LC8 is widely expressed and highly conserved among species, with the Chlamydomonas and human proteins sharing 93% sequence identity (2King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol.

Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It also serves essential cellular functions. For instance, in Drosophila, a partial loss-of-function mutation in LC8 results in pleiotropic morphogenetic defects in bristle and wing development, female sterility, and disruption of sensory axon projections (5Dick T. Ray K. Salz H.K. Chia W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1966-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Phillis R. Statton D. Caruccio P. Murphey R.K. Development. 1996; 122: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a null mutation results in massive cell death via the apoptotic pathway and consequent embryonic death. In addition to being an essential component of the dynein motor complex, LC8 binds to a large number of proteins with diverse biological functions (7Fan J. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For example, LC8 associates with and inhibits the activity of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, giving rise to its alternative designation as PIN (protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase) (8Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It also binds to IκBα (9Crepieux P. Kwon H. Leclerc N. Spencer W. Richard S. Lin R. Hiscott J. Mol.

The transcription factor NF-κB is a key regulator of immune and inflammatory responses and exists as a homo- or heterodimer composed of members of the Rel/NF-κB family of proteins, including RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p105/p50), and NF-κB2 (p100/p52) (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). The most common form of NF-κB in mammalian cells is the heterodimer composed of RelA (p65) and p50 (16Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with the inhibitor protein IκB. However, in response to a variety of stimuli, including TNFα, interleukin (IL)-1β, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IκBα is phosphorylated at residues Ser32 and Ser36 by IKK and then ubiquitinated at residues Lys21 and Lys22, resulting in its degradation by the 26 S proteasome (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). The degradation of IκBα exposes the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB, resulting in its translocation to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of various target genes that control the immune system, cell growth, and inflammation (17Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3427) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that ROS such as H2O2 activate NF-κB (18Gloire G. Legrand-Poels S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The observations that potent NF-κB activators such as TNFα, IL-1β, and LPS trigger the production of ROS (19Kim Y.S.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these observations remain poorly understood, however, and the contribution of redox regulation to NF-κB activation remains unclear because of some conflicting reports (26Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 27Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We recently showed that a novel disulfide reductase, TRP14, inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by suppressing the phosphorylation of IκBα, and we identified LC8 as a potential substrate of TRP14 (28Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The proteins β-arrestin and κB-Ras inhibit NF-κB by interacting with IκBα and IκBβ, respectively (29Witherow D.S. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8603-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 407: 527-534Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), indicating that IκB-binding proteins are potentially important regulators of NF-κB function. We have therefore investigated whether LC8 might serve as a molecular intermediary that links the disulfide reductase activity of TRP14 to NF-κB regulation. We now show that LC8 inhibits IκBα phosphorylation by IKK through its redox-dependent interaction with IκBα and that TRP14 regulates this inhibitory activity by maintaining LC8 in a reduced state. Reagents and Antibodies—LPS, butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), NADPH, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were obtained from Sigma; 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and 5-(and-6-)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA), acetyl ester were from Molecular Probes; MG132 was from Calbiochem; glutathione-Sepharose and nickel-chelating Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences; and TNFα and IL-1β were from R & D Systems. Normal rabbit IgG was from Caltag Laboratories; mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to LC8 were from BD Biosciences and Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, respectively; rabbit antibodies to phosphorylated (p-) IκBα, to p-IKKα/β, and to IKKβ were from Cell Signaling Technology; a monoclonal antibody to p65 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to IκBα and to IKKγ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; a monoclonal antibody to β-actin was from Abcam; rabbit polyclonal antibody to Mn2+-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was from Upstate Biotechnology; a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope was from Sigma; and a rat antibody to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was from Roche Applied Science. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit or mouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences Bioscience, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated monoclonal IgG was from Molecular Probes. Cloning and Mutagenesis of Human LC8 cDNA—A mammalian expression vector for LC8, pFLAG-LC8, was described previously (28Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cysteine mutants of LC8 (C2S, C24S, and C56A, in which Cys2, Cys24, and Cys56 are individually replaced by serine or alanine) were generated with the use of a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and complementary primers containing a 1-bp mismatch that converts the codon for cysteine to one for serine or alanine. To express HA-LC8 or LC8-FLAG proteins, cDNAs for wild-type LC8 or cysteine mutants of LC8 were cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pCGN or into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pFLAG-CMV5.1, respectively. For expression of LC8 in bacteria, the human LC8 gene was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET15b or pET17b. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET17b-LC8 was cultured at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture at a final concentration of 0.4 mm when the optical density at 600 nm had reached 0.5. After incubation for an additional 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -70 °C until use. The frozen cells were suspended in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) and were disrupted by sonication. After the removal of debris by centrifugation, the remaining soluble fraction was applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min to a DEAE-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The flow-through fraction was collected and then applied to a gel filtration column (G3000SW; Tosoh Bioscience) that had been equilibrated with a solution containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 0.1 m NaCl. The fractions containing LC8 were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0). For the bacterial expression of IκBα, a DNA fragment encoding human IκBα was amplified by PCR from HeLa cell cDNA and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET14b. His6-tagged IκBα was purified from lysates of the transformed E. coli cells by affinity chromatography on nickel-chelating Sepharose. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The phosphorylation of IκBα (1 μg) was performed for 30 min at 30 °C with an IKK immune complex in a final volume of 40 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm glycerophosphate, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. IκBα and LC8 were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before the addition of the IKK complex. The IKK complex was isolated by immunoprecipitation with antibody to IKKγ and protein A-Sepharose from HeLa cells that had been exposed to TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 10 min. The kinase reaction mixtures were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gradient gel, and the radioactivity associated with IκBα band was quantified with the use of a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics). NF-κB Reporter Assay—NF-κB activity was measured with the use of a dual luciferase reporter assay system. The cells were transfected for 24 h with 0.25 μg of pNF-κB-Luc (NF-κB reporter plasmid; Stratagene), 0.25 μg of pRL-SV40 (internal control), and either pFLAG-CMV2 or pFLAG-LC8. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with pFLAG-CMV2. A dual luciferase assay was subsequently performed with a kit (Promega). The activity of firefly luciferase was normalized by that of the Renilla enzyme and was then expressed as fold increase relative to the normalized value for cells transfected with pFLAG-CMV2. Depletion of LC8 by RNA Interference—A small interfering RNA (siRNA) corresponding to nucleotides 315–333 (relative to the translation initiation site) of human LC8 cDNA (5′-GGACTGCAGCCTAAATTCC-3′) was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (32Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and was introduced into HeLa cells with the use of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described (28Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Real Time PCR Analysis—Cells that had been stimulated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 1 h were harvested, and total RNA was isolated1 with the use of the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified by measurement of absorbance at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed with 2 μg of total RNA and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) for 1 h at 42 °C followed by 10 min at 70 °C, and the resulting cDNAs were subjected to real time PCR analysis with primers (sense and antisense, respectively) for human IκBα (5′-GCTGAAGAAGGAGCGGCTACT-3′ and 5′-TCGTACTCCTCGTCTTTCATGGAC-3′), human IL-8 (5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGT-3′ and 5′-TTACATAATTTCTGTGTTGGC-3′), human cyclooxygenase-2 (5′-CCTTCCTCCTGTGCCTGATG-3′ and 5′-ACAATCTCATTTGAATCAGGAAGCT-3′), and human β-actin (5′-ATGAGCTGCGTGTGGCTC-3′ and 5′-GGCGTACAGGGATAGCAC-3′). PCRs were performed with an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system and SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Determination of Redox Status of LC8—HeLa cells in six-well plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and exposed directly to 10% trichloroacetic acid to prevent further oxidation. The precipitates were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and with acetone and were then suspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5% SDS, 1 mm AEBSF, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml)) containing 20 mm 4-acetamino-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (AMS) or 40 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C, after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 5× nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. AMS and N-ethylmaleimide were used to mask free thiol groups. LC8 Interacts with IκBα and Thereby Inhibits Its Phosphorylation by IKK—Although LC8 was previously shown to interact physically with the regulatory domain of IκBα (9Crepieux P. Kwon H. Leclerc N. Spencer W. Richard S. Lin R. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 7375-7385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the physiological function of this association has remained unknown. We first confirmed the interaction between LC8 and IκBα in HeLa cells by immunoprecipitation with antibody to IκBα. Not only transiently expressed FLAG-LC8 but also endogenous LC8 was immunoprecipitated together with IκBα (Fig. 1A). To examine whether LC8 inhibits IκBα phosphorylation by IKK, we assayed the kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated IKK complex with recombinant IκBα as the substrate in the presence of LC8. LC8 indeed inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα by the IKK complex (Fig. 1B). LC8 Expression Inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB Activation— Given that LC8 inhibited IKK-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα in vitro, we next investigated the effect of forced expression of LC8 on the NF-κB signaling pathway in HeLa cells. Expression of FLAG-LC8 inhibited NF-κB activation by TNFα in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A) as well as attenuated the TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of RelA (p65) (Fig. 2B). To determine which step of the NF-κB signaling pathway is influenced by LC8, we transfected cells with an expression vector for LC8 together with those for IKKβ or p65. LC8 inhibited the increase in NF-κB activity induced by IKKβ overexpression but not that attributable to overproduction of p65 (Fig. 2C), indicating that LC8 inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway at a step between IKK activation and p65 nuclear translocation. However, the IKK complexes immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with the LC8 expression vector or the corresponding empty vector showed no difference in kinase activity measured in vitro with recombinant IκBα as the substrate (Fig. 2D). These results thus suggested that the binding of LC8 to IκBα inhibits its phosphorylation by IKK, without perturbing the activity of IKK itself, in TNFα-treated cells. Depletion of LC8 Promotes TNFα-induced NF-κB Activation— To investigate the role of endogenous LC8 in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, we depleted HeLa cells of LC8 by RNA interference and then monitored the expression of endogenous MnSOD, which is induced in response to NF-κB activation (33Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C.C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The amount of LC8 was reduced by >90% after transfection of cells for 60 h with an siRNA specific for LC8 mRNA, compared with that apparent in cells transfected with a control RNA. Such depletion of LC8 resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in the abundance of MnSOD in unstimulated cells and a 1.8-fold increase in TNFα-stimulated cells (Fig. 3A). We also determined the effect of LC8 depletion on the transcriptional induction of the NF-κB target genes for IκBα, cyclooxygenase-2, and IL-8 by reverse transcription and real time PCR analysis. Depletion of LC8 markedly increased the amounts of the target gene mRNAs under both basal and TNFα-stimulated conditions (Fig. 3B). In addition, depletion of LC8 promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 stimulated by TNFα (Fig. 3C). These data indicated that depletion of LC8 augments TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. In response to activation signals such as TNFα, IκBα is phosphorylated by IKK and subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We therefore examined the effect of LC8 depletion on IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in HeLa cells stimulated with TNFα. Transfection of cells with LC8 siRNA substantially increased the extent of serine phosphorylation of IκBα compared with that apparent in cells transfected with a control RNA, and this effect was accompanied by an increase in the rate of IκBα degradation (Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, depletion of LC8 had little effect on the phosphorylation status of IKK. These results suggested that LC8 blocks IκBα phosphorylation by IKK but does not inhibit the activity of IKK itself, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2D. LC8 Inhibits NF-κB Activation by Other Stimuli That Activate IKK—Our results suggested that LC8 inhibits NF-κB activation by interacting with IκBα and thereby preventing its phosphorylation by IKK. Given that IL-1β and LPS also induce IκBα phosphorylation by IKK during activation of NF-κB (15Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 34Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), we examined whether LC8 inhibits NF-κB activation by these stimuli. The NF-κB reporter assay showed that forced expression of LC8 inhibited NK-κB activation induced by IL-1β or LPS (Fig. 4A). We also examined the effects of endogenous LC8 on NF-κB activation by LPS or IL-1β. Depletion of LC8 by RNA interference increased MnSOD expression in unstimulated or LPS-stimulated HeLa cells (Fig. 4B), as well as in unstimulated or IL-1β-stimulated HEK293 cells (Fig. 4C). These results thus suggested that LC8 blocks IκBα phosphorylation by IKK in the canonical NF-κB activation pathway. LC8 Forms a Reversible Intermolecular Disulfide Bond between Cys2 Residues on Oxidation—LC8 was identified as a potential substrate for the novel disulfide reductase TRP14 in a substrate-trapping experiment on the basis of its formation of a mixed disulfide linkage with TRP14 (28Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that LC8 likely forms a disulfide bond on oxidation. LC8 exists as a dimer under physiological conditions (35Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the human protein contains three cysteine residues (Cys2, Cys24, and Cys56). To determine whether LC8 forms a disulfide bond on exposure of cells to H2O2, we analyzed its redox status by nonreducing SDS-PAGE after modification of free thiol groups with AMS. Alkylation of thiol groups with AMS increases the molecular mass of the host protein by 490 Da/thiol, resulting in a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE that allows determination of the number of oxidized cysteine residues (36Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). AMS modification of LC8 in unstimulated HeLa cells gave rise to two LC8 bands with markedly retarded electrophoretic mobility in nonreducing SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 5A); the lower of these two bands appeared to correspond to a fully reduced form of LC8 (LC8-AMS3), whereas the upper band seemed to represent an intermolecular disulfide-linked form (AMS2-LC8-S-S-LC8-AMS2). The intensity of the upper band was increased by exposure of the cells to H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Under reducing conditions, the upper band was shifted to a position below the lower band (LC8-AMS3) that appeared to correspond to AMS2-LC8-SH (Fig. 5A). These results indicated that oxidation of LC8 results in the reversible formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. We next investigated which of the three cysteine residues (Cys2, Cys24, or Cys56) of LC8 contribute to formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond. We substituted each cysteine residue with either serine or alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and then analyzed the oxidation status of the cysteine mutants in cells exposed to H2O2. Given that LC8 forms an intermolecular disulfide bond, we monitored the levels of disulfide-linked dimer by nonreducing SDS-PAGE after masking of free sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide to prevent random disulfide bond formation. The C24S and C56A mutants formed the intermolecular disulfide bond, as did wild-type LC8, whereas the C2S mutant did not (Fig. 5B), suggesting that two Cys2 residues form the disulfide linkage on oxidation of LC8 to the homodimer. It was possible that the environment surrounding the Cys2 residue of recombinant LC8 was affected by the NH2-terminal HA tag, which may have led to artifactual results. To exclude this possibility, we examined the oxidation status of COOH-terminally tagged LC8 (LC8-FLAG). Substitution of Cys2 with serine also abolished intermolecular disulfide bond formation by LC8-FLAG (Fig. 5C). Interaction between LC8 and IκBα Is Redox-dependent—In addition to LC8 being identified as a potential substrate of TRP14, this disulfide reductase was shown to inhibit the TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB (28Jeong W.

https://openalex.org/W2041034019,"Forkhead transcription factor Foxc2 is an essential regulator of the cardiovascular system in development and disease. However, the cellular and molecular functions of Foxc2 in vascular endothelial cells are still not fully understood. Here, through gene expression profiling in endothelial cells, we identified molecules associated with cell-extracellular matrix interactions, integrin β3 (Itgb3), integrin β5 (Itgb5), and fibronectin, as downstream targets of Foxc2. We found that Itgb3 expression is directly regulated by Foxc2 through multiple Forkhead-binding elements within two high homology regions in the Itgb3 promoter. Because Itgb3 is known to regulate angiogenesis, we further tested whether Foxc2 is directly involved in angiogenesis by regulating Itgb3 expression by in vitro experiments. Overexpression of Foxc2 significantly enhanced endothelial cell migration and adhesion, whereas this effect was strongly inhibited by Itgb3 neutralization antibody. In accordance with these results, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells isolated from Foxc2 heterozygous mutant mice showed a marked reduction in Itgb3 expression and cell migration. Finally, ex vivo aortic ring assay to test the sprouting and microvessel formation revealed enhanced microvessel outgrowth by Foxc2 overexpression. Conversely, microvessel outgrowth from aortas of Foxc2 heterozygous mutant mice was reduced. Taken together, these results suggest that Foxc2 directly induces Itgb3 expression and regulates angiogenesis by Itgb3-mediated endothelial cell adhesion and migration.

Pathological and physiological angiogenesis is a complex event involving endothelial cell proliferation and migration and vascular tube formation. In this process, the penetration of new endothelial cells occurs in avascular zones by sprouting from existing vascular vessels (1Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar). Dynamic conformation changes in extracellular matrix adhesion are an essential part of sprouting angiogenesis because the extracellular matrix provides a mechanical substrate in the cellular environment and regulates pathophysiological signals to neighboring cells. The role of integrins has been extensively studied in a variety of molecules participating in interactions between vascular endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix (2Serini G. Valdembri D. Bussolino F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Davis G.E. Senger D.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Integrins represent a large family of heterodimeric adhesion receptors that interact with extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and vitronectin. At present, there are 16α- and 8β-subunits identified, thereby forming 24 different integrins. Although accumulating evidence shows that αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins play a pivotal role in the formation of blood vessels (2Serini G. Valdembri D. Bussolino F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), Itgb3 and Itgb5 are dispensable for embryonic angiogenesis (4Rupp P.A. Little C.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, given that Itgb3 and Itgb5 are highly expressed in vascular vessels in pathological angiogenesis, blockade of these integrins with specific antagonists inhibits angiogenesis in cancer as well as arthritis and ischemic retinopathy (2Serini G.

Therefore, as a therapeutic approach to prevent pathological angiogenesis and tumor growth, Abegrin, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets αvβ3 integrin, is being tested in the phase II clinical trial for anti-tumor therapy of melanoma patients (7Mulgrew K.

The Foxc2 gene encodes a protein belonging to the Forkhead/Fox transcription factor family that shares an evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding domain. Our laboratory and others have shown that Foxc2 is an essential regulator of vascular/lymphatic vessel formation in cardiovascular development and disease.

However, the precise function of Foxc2 in the process of angiogenesis remains largely unknown. The goal of this study is therefore to elucidate the mechanisms by which Foxc2 functions in vascular endothelial cells. Here, we present the first evidence that Itgb3 is a novel downstream target of Foxc2 and that Foxc2 regulates angiogenesis by contributing primarily to endothelial cell migration and adhesion.

Generation and Infection of Recombinant Adenovirus for Foxc2—To generate an adenovirus expression vector containing Foxc2, the complete coding sequence of mouse Foxc2 with XbaI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends was first generated using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers including XbaI sites (5′-TATCTAGAGGACGCATGCAGGCG-3′ and 5′-CTCTAGACTCAGTATTTGGTGCAGTGG-3′). The XbaI sites and the Kozak sequence upstream of the start codon for efficient translation are underlined and double-underlined, respectively. The initiation and stop codons are shown in boldface. The PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) and then sequenced for confirmation. The Foxc2 XbaI fragment was cloned into the XbaI site of the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. To generate the adenovirus expression vector for Foxc2 (Ad-Foxc2) by homologous recombination, the resultant plasmid linearized with PmeI was cotransformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with the adenoviral backbone pAdEasy-1 vector containing green fluorescent protein to monitor the efficiency of transfection and infection. Adenovirus vectors (Ad-control and Ad-Foxc2) linearized with PacI were transfected into 293T cells to produce adenoviruses. Following three rounds of amplification in 293T cells, the adenoviruses were purified and titered based on the efficiency of infection by counting the number of green fluorescent protein-expressing cells as described previously (19He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Infection of MEECs with the adenoviruses was performed as described previously (17Goumans M.-J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Identification of Putative Fox-binding Elements (FBEs)—The alignment of mouse and human genomic sequences containing up to 30 kb upstream of the transcription start site of Itgb3 was visualized using mVISTA (genome.lbl.gov/vista/index.shtml). Among highly conserved regions (>50% identity), FBEs were subsequently selected according to the consensus sequence WAARYAAAYW (where W = Ala or Thr, R = Ala or Gly, and Y = Cys or Thr). Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Isolation of total RNA from endothelial cells and cDNA synthesis were performed using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) and iScript (Bio-Rad), respectively. Real-time PCRs were carried out using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and iCycler (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The PCR primers used are shown in supplemental Table 1. The data were normalized by the expression levels of the ppi housekeeping gene. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Dissociated PMVECs or MEECs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD61 (Itgb3) antibody (eBioscience) for 30 min on ice. 7-Aminoactinomycin D (Invitrogen) was also used to identify and remove a nonviable cell population. Cells were processed for cytometric analyses by LSR II (BD Biosciences) or for sorting by FACSAria (BD Biosciences) at the Vanderbilt University Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Isolation of Endothelial Cells Stably Overexpressing Foxc2—MEECs were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well on 24-well tissue culture plates. The next day, these cells were transfected with 400 ng of the Foxc2 expression vector or pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) as a mock control using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagents (Invitrogen). After 3 days of transfection, the cells were continuously treated with Geneticin (5 mg/ml; Invitrogen) to collect a pool of Geneticin-resistant cells. The expression levels of Foxc2 were subsequently confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). The PCR primers for Foxc2 are shown in supplemental Table 1. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was assessed by the incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into cellular DNA. MEECs were plated on gelatin-coated Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalgene) at a density of 3.5 × 103 cells/chamber. Attached cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-reduced medium (0.5%) with a pulse of BrdUrd (25 mm) for the last 3 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde immediately after the pulse and incubated with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, the cells were incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). To visualize all cell nuclei, the slides were also stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Three random non-overlapping fields of view (total magnification ×200) were photographed in duplicate. The percentage of the uptake of BrdUrd into the cells was calculated based on the ratio of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-positive and BrdUrd-positive cells to 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-positive and BrdUrd-negative cells. The experiment was repeated three times. Construction of Luciferase Reporters—For construction of distal HHR-Itgb3-LUC, proximal Itgb3-LUC, and –793Itgb3-LUC, PCR fragments were amplified using a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome clone (RP24–94A3; BACPAC Resource Center) as template DNA. PCR-based mutagenesis of the FBEs in 1Mut-LUC (TCTATTT to TCTAGGT), 2Mut-LUC (AAAATAAA to AAGGTGGA), and 3Mut-LUC (AAAATAAA to AAGGTGGA) was performed using the distal HHR-Itgb3-LUC reporter as template DNA. All fragments were subsequently purified and ligated into the KpnI and NheI sites of the pGL3-basic vector or pGL3-promoter vector (Promega), followed by sequence confirmation. The primers used for plasmid construction are shown in supplemental Table 1. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—MEECs were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For luciferase assays, the pRL-CMV reporter plasmid (Promega) containing Renilla luciferase as an internal control was cotransfected with the firefly luciferase reporter constructs described above. All transfections were carried out in triplicate on gelatin-coated 24-well plates. The transfected cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cultured MEECs were washed with PBS and treated with formaldehyde to cross-link protein to DNA. Cellular lysates were obtained by scraping, followed by pulse ultrasonication to shear cellular DNA. After centrifugation, supernatants containing sheared chromatin were incubated with anti-Foxc2 antibody or control IgG (Abcam), followed by addition of protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. After elution, immune complexes were subsequently treated with proteinase K at 55 °C for 1.5 h and extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR. The PCR primers used are shown in supplemental Table 1. Adhesion Assay—Confluent MEECs stably transfected with the mock or Foxc2 expression vector were detached and preincubated with antibody against Itgb3 at 5 mg/ml or with control IgG for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 × 104 cells were plated on 96-well cell culture plates precoated with 10 μg/ml vitronectin for 1 h at 37 °C, blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The attached cells were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet aqueous solution in 20% methanol for 10 min. After washing with water, the stained cells were dissolved with 1% SDS. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a microplate reader. Wound Closure Assay—Endothelial cell migration was determined by wound closure assay. MEECs were grown to confluence on gelatin-coated 6-well plates in growth culture medium. Monolayer cells were mechanically wounded by scratching with the tip of a sterile plastic 10-ml pipette. After washing with PBS, the cells were cultured in serum-reduced medium (0.5%) for 24 h. The cells were treated with or without 10 ng/ml mouse recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (R&D Systems) in the presence or absence of 5 mg/ml R-phycoerythrin-conjugated hamster anti-mouse β3 integrin monoclonal antibody (clone 2C9.G2; Armenian hamster IgG1κ; BD Biosciences) or IgG isotype control (clone A19-3; BD Biosciences). Residual wound areas were measured at 0 and 24 h by comparing phase-contrast micrographs of three fields of view (total magnification ×40) along the originally scraped areas in triplicate. The recovered areas were calculated using ImageJ software. To visualize the cell migration patterns after 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Transwell Migration Assay—Transwells with 8-mm pores (Costar) were precoated with collagen I (20 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The filters were subsequently blocked with 3% BSA in PBS to inhibit nonspecific migration. The lower wells of the chamber were filled with serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA in the presence or absence of VEGF at 25 ng/ml. PMVECs from Foxc2+/– or control wild-type mouse suspensions were prepared from subconfluent cultures in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA. A total of 5 × 104 cells were added to the upper chamber and then incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Non-migrating cells on top of the filter were wiped out by a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Migrating cells were stained with 1% crystal violet and counted under a microscope. Aortic Ring Assay—C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were killed, and thoracic aortas were excised and immediately transferred to a culture dish with cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The periaortic fibroadipose tissue was carefully removed, and aortic tubes were sagittally cut in two equal pieces to make two equivalent half-tubes. In the experiment shown in Fig. 7A, one of the half-tubes was immediately exposed to Ad-Foxc2 and the other to Ad-control each at 5 × 109 plaque-forming units in 0.1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 1.5-ml centrifugation tubes at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. (This process was skipped for the experiment shown in Fig. 7B.) Infected tubes were then each cut into cross-sectional pieces of 0.5 mm in length using a razorblade. Pieces of aorta were placed on 48-well culture plates and overlaid with 150 ml of fibrinogen (Sigma) at 3 mg/ml. Polymerization was performed by the addition of 15 ml of thrombin (Sigma) at 1 unit/ml for 30 min, followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of EBM-2 (Lonza). The culture of aortic rings and analysis of microvessel outgrowth were as described previously (20Kamiyama M. Pozzi A. Yang L. DeBusk L.M. Breyer R.M. Lin P.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Foxc2 Directly Regulates Integrin β3 Expression in Endothelial Cells—To identify genes regulated by Foxc2 in endothelial cells, we performed gene expression profiling using immortalized MEECs by infection of recombinant adenovirus for Foxc2. On the basis of the 39,000 oligoprobe sets of Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) we used, overexpression of Foxc2 in MEECs up-regulated 448 probe sets and down-regulated 156 probe sets. The details of the microarray results will be published elsewhere. 3H. Hayashi and T. Kume, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, we found that the expression of Itgb3 and Itgb5, known as components of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin heterodimers, and fibronectin (FN), a ligand for αvβ3 integrin, was significantly up-regulated. By real-time RT-PCR, we validated the induction of these genes by Foxc2 (Fig. 1A). We next confirmed that Itgb3 protein was indeed up-regulated in endothelial cells that overexpress Foxc2 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Consistently, the surface levels of Itgb3 expression were increased by Foxc2 as evaluated by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Foxc2 did not regulate the expression of other integrins, including αv integrin (Itgav) (Fig. 1D). We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of Foxc2 could induce pro-angiogenic factors in endothelial cells because αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins as well as FN were all up-regulated on certain tumor vasculature (2Serini G. Valdembri D. Bussolino F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Mahabeleshwar G.H. Feng W. Phillips D.R. Byzova T.V. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Hynes R.O. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Among these molecules, αvβ3 integrin is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for pathological angiogenesis. Because the molecular mechanisms for Itgb3 gene expression in angiogenesis are not fully understood, we further analyzed Foxc2-mediated Itgb3 gene expression in endothelial cells. A recent study showed that another Fox transcription factor, Foxf1, activates the mouse Itgb3 promoter by directly binding to the tandem repeats of FBEs located at region–871 to –815 of the Itgb3 locus in lung mesenchymal cells and induces mesenchymal cell migration (22Malin D. Kim I.M. Boetticher E. Kalin T.V. Ramakrishna S. Meliton L. Ustiyan V. Zhu X. Kalinichenko V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2486-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Notably, the reported FBEs are not found in the proximal HHR of the human Itgb3 promoter, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3A. Because we found that overexpression of Foxc2 induced Itgb3 mRNA expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (data not shown), we searched for additional FBEs farther upstream (up to 30 kb) of the Itgb3 locus (Fig. 2). In fact, we found a cluster of three FBEs located in the distal HHR between –11.1 and –10.8 kb upstream of Itgb3 (Figs. 2 and 3C). This finding led us hypothesize that the distal HHR is also responsible for Foxc2-induced Itgb3 expression.FIGURE 3Foxc2 regulates the proximal and distal promoters of Itgb3 in endothelial cells. A, schematic diagram of luciferase constructs for the proximal Itgb3 promoter (proximal HHR-Itgb3-LUC). Shown above are the mouse and human sequences for comparison. Note that the reported tandem repeats of the FBEs (highlighted) are located only in the mouse Itgb3 locus. B, Foxc2 activates the proximal Itgb3 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. MEECs were transfected with the Foxc2 expression vector together with either proximal HHR-Itgb3-LUC or its deletion construct, –793Itgb3-LUC. The -fold increase in normalized luciferase activity is shown. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t tests. ****, p < 0.001 versus the control. N.S., non-significant.

Distal HHR-Itgb3-LUC (+P) and distal HHR-Itgb3-LUC (–P) indicate the presence and absence of the SV40 promoter in the constructs, respectively. Shown above are the mouse and human sequences for comparison. D, Foxc2 activates the distal Itgb3 promoter through two of the three FBEs. Luciferase assays were performed after transfection of MEECs with distal HHR-Itgb3-LUC or a series of mutant reporters (1Mut-LUC, 2Mut-LUC, 3Mut-LUC, and 1,2,3Mut-LUC) along with the Foxc2 expression vector. The -fold increase in normalized luciferase activity is shown. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. (n = 6) from two independent experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus cells cotransfected with Foxc2 and pGL3-basic. E, Foxc2 binds to the FBEs in the distal or proximal HHRs in chromatin structure of endothelial cells. MEECs were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-Foxc2 antibody (Ab) or control IgG. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers specific to the proximal or distal HHR of mouse Itgb3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the direct involvement of Foxc2 in the induction of Itgb3 expression, we next investigated whether Foxc2 could activate the Itgb3 promoter by regulating the FBEs in the distal and proximal HHRs of the mouse Itgb3 promoter. For analysis of the proximal HHR, we constructed luciferase reporters using the pGL3-basic vector that does not contain a basic promoter (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, for analysis of the distal HHR, we generated luciferase reporters using the pGL3-basic vector or the pGL3-promoter vector (Fig. 3C). The pGL3-promoter vector carries the SV40 promoter sequence and is designed to analyze enhancer sequences upstream of a gene of interest. In Fig. 3B, Foxc2 significantly activated the proximal HHR in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the deletion construct lacking the FBEs showed no induction of luciferase activity by Foxc2. These data suggest that similar to Foxf1, Foxc2 can activate the mouse Itgb3 proximal promoter. More important, Foxc2 was also able to activate the distal HHR through the FBEs except for the most upstream one (Fig. 3D). It should also be noted that essentially similar results were obtained in experiments with luciferase constructs in the presence or absence of the SV40 promoter. Next, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to test whether Foxc2 could directly bind to the FBEs in the distal or proximal HHRs in chromatin structure of endothelial cells. We found that Foxc2 specifically bound to both HHRs in vivo (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these findings indicate that Foxc2 directly induces Itgb3 expression through the multiple FBEs on the Itgb3 distal and proximal HHRs in endothelial cells. Foxc2 Regulates Itgb3-mediated Endothelial Cell Migration and Adhesion, but Not Proliferation—Angiogenesis is a multi-step process that includes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion. Considering the direct induction of Itgb3 expression by Foxc2, we sought to determine whether Foxc2 regulates the angiogenic process in vitro. Using MEECs stably overexpressing Foxc2, the rate of BrdUrd incorporation in endothelial cells was determined in serum-reduced medium (0.5%) for 24 h. We observed no significant difference in the number of BrdUrd-positive cells between mock- and Foxc2-transfected MEECs (Fig. 4). In addition, although VEGF augmented cell division, Foxc2 overexpression along with VEGF did not show further increase in proliferation compared with the control cells treated with VEGF. These findings indicate that Foxc2 itself does not have the ability to stimulate the proliferation of endothelial cells. We next analyzed the effect of Foxc2 on endothelial cell adhesion that is regulated by integrins during angiogenesis (23Lamalice L. Le Boeuf F. Huot J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 782-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Adhesion assays were performed using 96-well culture plates precoated by vitronectin. As shown in Fig. 5A, Foxc2 significantly increased adhesiveness compared with the control cells. Notably, consistent with our finding that Foxc2 directly regulated Itgb3 expression, Foxc2-enhanced cell adhesion was impaired by anti-Itgb3 blocking antibody. Finally, we performed wound closure assays to test whether Foxc2 is involved in endothelial cell migration. In agreement with the effect of Foxc2 on endothelial cell adhesion, wound closure assays further revealed that Foxc2 dramatically enhanced endothelial cell migration (Fig. 5, B and C). Of note, although Foxc2 did not induce endothelial cell proliferation under the same serum-reduced conditions (Fig. 4), the rate of Foxc2-enhanced wound closure was almost equivalent to that of VEGF treatment in the control cells.

https://openalex.org/W2003195641,"Sulfiredoxin (Srx) catalyzes a novel enzymatic reaction, the reduction of protein cysteine sulfinic acid, Cys-SO(2)(-). This reaction is unique to the typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx) and plays a role in peroxide-mediated signaling by regulating the activity of Prxs. Two mechanistic schemes have been proposed that differ regarding the first step of the reaction. This step involves either the direct transfer of the gamma-phosphate of ATP to the Prx molecule or through Srx acting as a phosphorylated intermediary. In an effort to clarify this step of the Srx reaction, we have determined the 1.8A resolution crystal structure of Srx in complex with ATP and Mg(2+). This structure reveals the role of the Mg(2+) ion to position the gamma-phosphate toward solvent, thus preventing an in-line attack by the catalytic residue Cys-99 of Srx. A model of the quaternary complex is consistent with this proposal. Furthermore, phosphorylation studies on several site-directed mutants of Srx and Prx, including the Prx-Asp mimic of the Prx-SO(2)(-) species, support a mechanism where phosphorylation of Prx-SO(2)(-) is the first chemical step."
https://openalex.org/W2065413719,"Background Several candidate genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 including the HLA locus, TNF, LTA and AGER could be associated with late diabetic complications. The aim of our study was therefore to explore whether polymorphisms (TNF -308 G→A, LTA T60N C→A and AGER -374 T→A) in these genes alone or together (as haplotypes) increased the risk for diabetic complications. Methodology/Principal Findings The studied polymorphisms were genotyped in 742 type 1 and 2957 type 2 diabetic patients as well as in 206 non-diabetic control subjects. The Haploview program was used to analyze putative linkage disequilibrium between studied polymorphisms. The TNF, LTA and AGER polymorphisms were associated with the HLA-DQB1 risk genotypes. The AGER -374 A allele was more common in type 1 diabetic patients with than without diabetic nephropathy (31.2 vs. 28.4%, p = 0.007). In a logistic regression analysis, the LTA but not the AGER polymorphism was associated with diabetic nephropathy (OR 2.55[1.11–5.86], p = 0.03). The AGER -374 A allele was associated with increased risk of sight threatening retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients (1.65[1.11–2.45], p = 0.01) and also with increased risk for macrovascular disease in type 1 diabetic patients (OR 2.05[1.19–3.54], p = 0.01), but with decreased risk for macrovascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients (OR 0.66[0.49–0.90], p = 0.009). The TNF A allele was associated with increased risk for macrovascular complications in type 2 (OR 1.53 [1.04–2.25], p = 0.03, but not in type 1 diabetic patients. Conclusions/Significance The association between diabetic complications and LTA, TNF and AGER polymorphisms is complex, with partly different alleles conferring susceptibility in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. We can not exclude the possibility that the genes are part of a large haplotype block that also includes HLA-DQB1 risk genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1986063274,"Francisella tularensis is a gram-negative coccobacillus that causes the febrile illness tularemia. Subspecies that are pathogenic for humans include those comprising the type A (subspecies tularensis) or type B (subspecies holarctica) biovars. An attenuated live vaccine strain (LVS) developed from a type B isolate has previously been used to vaccinate at-risk individuals, but offers limited protection against high dose (>1000 CFUs) challenge with type A strains delivered by the respiratory route. Due to differences between type A and type B F. tularensis strains at the genetic level, it has been speculated that utilization of an attenuated type A strain as a live vaccine might offer better protection against homologous respiratory challenge compared with LVS. Here, we report the construction and characterization of an unmarked Delta purMCD mutant in the highly virulent type A strain Schu S4.Growth of Schu S4 Delta purMCD was severely attenuated in primary human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and in the A549 human lung epithelial cell line. The Schu S4 Delta purMCD mutant was also highly attenuated in mice when delivered via either the intranasal or intradermal infection route. Mice vaccinated intranasally with Schu S4 Delta purMCD were well protected against high dose intradermal challenge with virulent type A or type B strains of F. tularensis. However, intranasal vaccination with Schu S4 Delta purMCD induced tissue damage in the lungs, and conferred only limited protection against high dose Schu S4 challenge delivered by the same route. The level of protection observed was similar to that conferred following vaccination with wild-type LVS or the analogous LVS Delta purMCD mutant.Collectively, these results argue that development of the next generation live attenuated vaccine for Francisella should be based on use of the less pathogenic type B biovar rather than the more reactogenic type A biovar."
https://openalex.org/W2046245532,"The efficacy of synaptic transmission depends on the availability of ionotropic and metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors at the plasma membrane, but the contribution of the endocytic and recycling pathways in the regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptors remains controversial. To understand the mechanisms that regulate the abundance of GABA(B) receptors, we have studied their turnover combining surface biotin labeling and a microscopic immunoendocytosis assay in hippocampal and cortical neurons. We report that internalization of GABA(B) receptors is agonist-independent. We also demonstrate that receptors endocytose in the cell body and dendrites but not in axons. Additionally, we show that GABA(B) receptors endocytose as heterodimers via clathrin- and dynamin-1-dependent mechanisms and that they recycle to the plasma membrane after endocytosis. More importantly, we show that glutamate decreases the levels of cell surface receptors in a manner dependent on an intact proteasome pathway. These observations indicate that glutamate and not GABA controls the abundance of surface GABA(B) receptors in central neurons, consistent with their enrichment at glutamatergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1977436020,"Formins drive actin filament assembly for diverse cellular processes including motility, establishing polarity, and cell division. To investigate the mechanism of contractile ring assembly in animal cells, we directly compared the actin assembly properties of formins required for cytokinesis in the nematode worm early embryo (CYK-1) and fission yeast (Cdc12p). Like Cdc12p and most other formins, CYK-1 nucleates actin filament assembly and remains processively associated with the elongating barbed end while facilitating the addition of profilin-actin above the theoretical diffusion-limited rate. However, specific properties differ significantly between Cdc12p and CYK-1. Cdc12p efficiently nucleates filaments that in the presence of profilin elongate at approximately the same rate as control filaments without formin (approximately 10.0 subunits/s). CYK-1 is an inefficient nucleator but allows filaments to elongate profilin-actin 6-fold faster than Cdc12p (approximately 60 subunits/s). Both Cdc12p and CYK-1 bind to pre-assembled actin filaments with low nanomolar affinity, but CYK-1 dissociates 2 orders of magnitude more quickly. However, CYK-1 rapidly re-associates with free barbed ends. Cdc12p allows barbed ends to elongate in the presence of excess capping protein, whereas capping protein inhibits CYK-1-mediated actin assembly. Therefore, these evolutionarily diverse formins can drive contractile ring assembly by a generally similar mechanism, but cells with unique dimensions and physical parameters might require proteins with carefully tuned actin assembly properties."

We discovered a close homologue in Aspergillus nidulans, a fungus thought to have no methylation and no genome defense system comparable to RIP or MIP.We report the cloning and characterization of the DNA methyltransferase homologue A (dmtA) gene from Aspergillus nidulans. We found that the dmtA locus encodes both a sense (dmtA) and an anti-sense transcript (tmdA). Both transcripts are expressed in vegetative, conidial and sexual tissues. We determined that dmtA, but not tmdA, is required for early sexual development and formation of viable ascospores. We also tested if DNA methylation accumulated in any of the dmtA/tmdA mutants we constructed, and found that in both asexual and sexual tissues, these mutants, just like wild-type strains, appear devoid of DNA methylation.Our results demonstrate that a DMT homologue closely related to proteins implicated in RIP and MIP has an essential developmental function in a fungus that appears to lack both DNA methylation and RIP or MIP. It remains formally possible that DmtA is a bona fide DMT, responsible for trace, undetected DNA methylation that is restricted to a few cells or transient but our work supports the idea that the DMT domain present in the RID/Masc1/DmtA family has a previously undescribed function."
https://openalex.org/W2061148413,"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are key signal transduction molecules, which respond to various external stimuli. The MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are known to be negative regulators of MAPKs in eukaryotes. We screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated calmodulin (CaM), and isolated AtMKP1 as a CaM-binding protein. Recently, tobacco NtMKP1 and rice OsMKP1, two orthologs of Arabidopsis AtMKP1, were reported to bind CaM via a single putative CaM binding domain (CaMBD). However, little is known about the regulation of phosphatase activity of plant MKP1s by CaM binding. In this study, we identified two Ca(2+)-dependent CaMBDs within AtMKP1. Specific binding of CaM to two different CaMBDs was verified using a gel mobility shift assay, a competition assay with a Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent enzyme, and a split-ubiquitin assay. The peptides for two CaMBDs, CaMBDI and CaMBDII, bound CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, and the binding affinity of CaMBDII was found to be higher than that of CaMBDI. CaM overlay assays using mutated CaMBDs showed that four amino acids, Trp(453) and Leu(456) in CaMBDI and Trp(678) and Ile(684) in CaMBDII, play a pivotal role in CaM binding. Moreover, the phosphatase activity of AtMKP1 was increased by CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Our results suggest that two important signaling pathways, Ca(2+) signaling and the MAPK signaling cascade, are connected in plants via the regulation of AtMKP1 activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that the biochemical activity of MKP1 in plants is regulated by CaM."
https://openalex.org/W1971431411,"In previous studies, we have characterized a new hormonal pathway involving a mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43) acting as a mitochondrial transcription factor and consequently stimulating mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial biogenesis. We have established the involvement of this T3 pathway in the regulation of in vitro myoblast differentiation. We have generated mice overexpressing p43 under control of the human alpha-skeletal actin promoter. In agreement with the previous characterization of this promoter, northern-blot and western-blot experiments confirmed that after birth p43 was specifically overexpressed in skeletal muscle. As expected from in vitro studies, in 2-month old mice, p43 overexpression increased mitochondrial genes expression and mitochondrial biogenesis as attested by the increase of mitochondrial mass and mt-DNA copy number. In addition, transgenic mice had a body temperature 0.8 degrees C higher than control ones and displayed lower plasma triiodothyronine levels. Skeletal muscles of transgenic mice were redder than wild-type animals suggesting an increased oxidative metabolism. In line with this observation, in gastrocnemius, we recorded a strong increase in cytochrome oxidase activity and in mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we observed that p43 drives the formation of oxidative fibers: in soleus muscle, where MyHC IIa fibers were partly replaced by type I fibers; in gastrocnemius muscle, we found an increase in MyHC IIa and IIx expression associated with a reduction in the number of glycolytic fibers type IIb. In addition, we found that PGC-1alpha and PPARdelta, two major regulators of muscle phenotype were up regulated in p43 transgenic mice suggesting that these proteins could be downstream targets of mitochondrial activity. These data indicate that the direct mitochondrial T3 pathway is deeply involved in the acquisition of contractile and metabolic features of muscle fibers in particular by regulating PGC-1alpha and PPARdelta."

Both the integrin α and β chains participate in regulating the integrin extracellular ligand binding capacity, while the β chain alone appears to link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton.

All constructs were verified by automated sequencing. The mutant β3 cDNA construct was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that had been pretransfected with human αIIb integrin cDNA using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Merelbeke, Belgium). The cDNA constructs encoding mutant talin fragment J were transiently transfected into CHO cells stably expressing recombinant wild-type αIIbβ3 (1Moes M. Rodius S. Coleman S.J. Monkley S.J.

All CHO transfectants were cultured under standard tissue culture conditions in IMDM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Flow Cytometry—Anti-αIIbβ3 antibody Pl2-73 binding to transfected CHO cells was measured on an Epics XL flow cytometer (Coulter Corp, Hialeah, FL) following R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG labeling of the cells (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cell Adhesion Assay—Washed CHO cell transfectants (3 × 104) were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μm of the αvβ3 inhibitor RO65-5233/001 to block αvβ3 receptor function and added to fibrinogen-coated wells (20 μg/ml). Cell adhesion was allowed to occur at 37 °C for 2 h, and cell spreading was monitored by digital imaging of the cells in the wells without prior washing of the plates or discharge of non-adherent cells. Quantitation of spread cells versus non-spread round cells was performed according to the cell morphology. For each time point, 200 cells were counted, and the data reported as mean percent (± S.D.) of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Immunofluorescence Staining—For intracellular fluorescence staining, CHO cell transfectants adherent on fibrinogen were fixed for 15 min at 4 °C with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. Immunofluorescent staining was performed with antibodies to integrin β3 (P37), talin rod (TD77), or talin rod IBS2 (anti-IBS2 IgG). Cells were then incubated for 45 min with species-specific secondary antibodies linked to FITC. Polymerized actin was stained with TRITC-phalloidin. Slides were mounted in Mowiol 40-88/DABCO (Sigma) and analyzed with a Leica-DMRB fluorescence microscope using a ×63 or a ×100 oil immersion objective. Microphotographs were taken using a Leica DC 300F digital camera and the Leica IM1000 1.20 software. cDNA Constructs for Bacterial Protein Expression and Purification—The pGEX-4T-2 plasmids with the cDNA constructs encoding either GST-talin G (amino acids 1984-2344), or the GST-tagged β3 cytoplasmic tail constructs β3wt (amino acids 716-762), β3Δ744, β3Δ752, β3Δ754, β3Y747A, β3Y747F, β3Y759A, β3Y759F, β3S752P, β3S752A, β3Y747A/Y759F, and β3Y747F/Y759F have been previously described (21Tremuth L.

The following single and double amino acid substitutions K2085D, K2089D, and K2085D/K2089D were subsequently introduced into the cDNA encoding talin V3-I2 by site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA fragment encoding Vh (amino-acids 1-258) was amplified by PCR from full-length human vinculin cDNA and subcloned into the bacterial pET-15b expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate Vh-HisTag. All cloned cDNA fragments were verified by automated sequencing. Expression of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The bacterial pellet was lysed as previously described (24Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Talapatra A. Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

For talin G, removal of the GST tag was performed by thrombin digestion for 1 h at room temperature using 10 units of thrombin/mg of protein (Amersham Biosciences). Thrombin was neutralized with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the fragment was dialyzed against PBS. Removal of GST from talin rod helices 50-51 was performed on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads using PreScission™ Protease (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GST-β3wt and GST-β3Y747A proteins used in NMR experiments were uniformly labeled with 15N by growing E. coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), and induced and purified as described above. Expression of Vh-HisTag in E. coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant protein was affinity-purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of a Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-talin IBS2 Antibody—For the production of an anti-talin IBS2 polyclonal antibody, rabbits were immunized with the recombinant 7-kDa talin rod protein (helices 50-51) according to standard methods (AGRO-BIO s.a.s, La Ferté St. Aubin, France). Serum IgG from immunized rabbits was isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialyzed against PBS, and stored at 14 mg/ml at 4 °C. Western Blot—CHO cells were detached, washed twice in PBS, and lysed 30 min on ice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), 1× protease inhibitor mixture (PIC). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C in 1% SDS. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples were denatured in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot was performed according to standard procedures. Antibodies C20, C3a, P37, and anti-IBS2 IgG were used as primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse, donkey anti-goat, or donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:2500) as secondary antibodies. Antibody binding was visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Talin Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Platelet lysate (25 μg of protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg of rabbit anti-IBS2 IgG or non-immune rabbit IgG in 100 μl of PBS. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added for 4 h at 4 °C, then washed with PBS prior to boiling in the presence of SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The eluted material was submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antitalin rod TD77 antibody (1:100) as primary antibody. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Measurements were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument. Goat anti-GST antibodies were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biacore). For kinetic analysis, two channels were pretreated for 5 min at 2 μl/min with 400 nm recombinant GST (control channel) or GST-tagged proteins in HBS-P buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.005% NP20) provided by Biacore. Subsequently, purified recombinant talin G, Vh-HisTag, synthetic β3 wt, or β3 E726Q/E733Q peptides, monoclonal C3a, polyclonal anti-IBS2 or nonspecific rabbit or mouse antibodies at concentrations ranging from 20 μm to 6.6 nm in HBS-P, were allowed to react with the two channels at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 3 min, followed by a dissociation phase of 3 min. In blocking experiments, rabbit anti-IBS2 IgG was allowed to react with talin V3-I2 at a concentration of 14 μg/ml before injection of the β3 peptide, while the C3a antibody was allowed to react with GST-β3 at a concentration of 1 μg/ml before injection of talin G. After each run, the channels were completely regenerated with 10 mm HCl. The sensorgrams were analyzed with Biaeval 3.1 software (Biacore). Sensorgrams of the control channel were subtracted from the sensorgrams on the experimental channel and analyzed using nonlinear regression statistics to fit a simple Langmuir 1:1 binding model, taking into account the drifting base line, which is caused by the differential dissociation rate of GST alone and GST-tagged proteins from the anti-GST antibodies. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples of 15N-labeled GST-β3 or of GST-β3 Y747A mutant were prepared in a buffer of phosphate 50 mm; NaCl 100 mm;EDTA 1 mm; dithiothreitol 1 mm, pH 6.6 at a final concentration of 400 μm. A standard HSQC spectrum (with 2048 × 256 points in the t1, t2 dimensions) was recorded at 293K on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe head. The resulting HSQC spectra were transformed with 2k × 1k complex points, after multiplication with a p/4 and p/2 squared sine bell function, respectively. In the spectra, only the flexible parts corresponding to the integrin tails are visible (25Pierce M.M. Baxa U. Steven A.C. Bax A. Wickner R.B.

To further characterize this IBS2-β3 interaction, we have generated an anti-IBS2 polyclonal antibody (Ab) raised in rabbits against a recombinant 7-kDa GST-tagged talin rod fragment, corresponding to the α-helices 50 and 51 (residues 2071-2135). The purity of the recombinant talin rod fragment used as immunogen is shown in Fig. 1A. When the polyclonal Ab was tested in Western blot it reacted with the recombinant 39-kDa talin rod fragment G (helices 47-57), as well as full-length talin or the proteolytically cleaved 190-kDa talin rod fragment from SDS-denatured platelet lysate (Fig. 1B). In addition, this Ab also reacted with native platelet talin as shown by immunoprecipitation experiments using Triton X-100 platelet lysate (Fig. 1C). When tested in indirect immunofluorescence assays using CHO αIIbβ3 cells adherent on fibrinogen (Fig. 1D), the anti-IBS2 Ab reacted with endogenous hamster talin and preferentially labeled lamellipodia, where its staining overlapped with anti-talin rod or anti-β3 integrin labeling. In contrast, the anti-IBS2 Ab labeling was strongly reduced in mature FAs and was hardly seen at the tips of actin stress fibers, suggesting that in FA the talin IBS2 site is not accessible to the Ab, while it is freely exposed in lamellipodia. To test whether this Ab was able to block the talin rod IBS2-β3 cytoplasmic tail interaction, we performed SPR analysis, using a recombinant GST-tagged 54-kDa talin rod fragment encompassing helices 43-50. This fragment, called GST-talin V3-I2 and containing the vinculin binding site 3 (VBS3) as well as the integrin binding site 2 (IBS2), was designed to allow simultaneous binding studies of two distinct talin ligands, integrin β3 and vinculin head (Vh). Fig. 2A shows the SDS-PAGE gel of the purified proteins used for SPR analysis. GST-talin V3-I2 or GST alone (used as a negative control) was captured on the sensor chip on immobilized anti-GST antibodies. The recombinant 31-kDa Vh protein or the 7-kDa β3 peptide was then injected as analytes. The sensorgrams are shown in Fig. 2, B and C. Interaction of increasing concentrations of Vh protein with talin fragment V3-I2 yielded a KD of 6.96 × 10-9 m, a result close to the KD of 39 × 10-9 m previously determined for the VBS3-Vh interaction by a pull-down assay (26Bass M.D. Patel B.

J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), providing evidence that the immobilized talin fragment V3-I2 was functional for vinculin head binding. When the β3 peptide was tested (Fig. 2C), a direct interaction between the β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail and talin V3-I2 was also observed that yielded a KD of 3.45 × 10-8 m, an affinity about 5 times lower than that observed for Vh binding. Interestingly, when the two peptides were injected simultaneously, they both interacted with talin V3-I2, providing evidence that the vinculin and integrin binding sites are both functional and are not mutually exclusive (data not shown). To test the effect of the anti-IBS2 antibody on the talin V3-I2-β3 peptide interaction, we first measured its binding affinity for GST-talin V3-I2 (KD of 1.54 × 10-8 m) as compared with nonspecific rabbit IgG for which no binding could be observed (Fig. 2D). We next tested the ability of the anti-IBS2 Ab to inhibit this interaction (Fig. 2E). The tracing of the binding of the β3 peptide to talin V3-I2 in the absence (upper trace) or in the presence of rabbit anti-IBS2 IgG (lower trace) clearly demonstrates that the anti-IBS2 Ab strongly inhibited the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of β3 and talin IBS2, by blocking the talin IBS2 binding site. It is noteworthy that the anti-IBS2 Ab had no inhibitory effect on the interaction between talin fragment V3-I2 and the Vh protein, underlining the specificity of the blocking effect of the antibody (supplemental Fig. S1A). Identification of Talin IBS2 Residues Involved in the Interaction with the β3 Cytoplasmic Tail—We have previously shown that alanine mutation of two highly conserved residues L2094A/I2095A within IBS2, which disrupted the α-helical structure of IBS2, was sufficient to inhibit the IBS2-integrin interaction (1Moes M.

However, in contrast to the VBS sites that each correspond to hydrophobic residues exposed on one side of an amphipathic α-helix of the talin rod domain (17Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L.

The sequence alignment of human talin helix 50 with the equivalent talin sequence of other species ranging from mouse to zebrafish is shown in Fig. 3. Five charged and conserved residues can be identified within the α-helix 50 sequence corresponding to Lys-2085, Asp-2086, Lys-2089, Asp-2093, and Lys-2099 (Fig. 3A). However, only residues Lys-2085 and Lys-2089 are positioned on the hydrophilic face of helix 50 (Fig. 3B) opposite to the hydrophobic face corresponding to the potential vinculin binding site (27Gingras A.R.

In addition, we have previously shown by site-directed mutagenesis that residue Lys-2099, located at the C-terminal end of helix 50, is not involved in this interaction (1Moes M. Rodius S.

Mutation of Residues Lys-2085 and Lys-2089 of Talin Rod Helix 50 Inhibits the Talin IBS2-β3 Integrin Interaction—To test our hypothesis, we used a charge reversal mutation approach as previously described for the identification of the HIP1R actin binding site (28Brett T.J.

The three following mutant proteins: talin V3-I2 K2085D, K2089D, and K2085D/K2089D were then tested for β3 binding (Fig. 4B) using SPR analysis. Interestingly, both the single and the double Lys/Asp mutations strongly decreased the binding affinity, with KD of 7.33 × 10-5 m for talin V3-I2 K2085D, 6.06 × 10-5 m for talin V3-I2 K2089D, and 8.44 × 10-5 m for talin V3-I2 K2085D/K2089D; affinities about 103 times lower than that measured for β3 binding to wild-type talin V3-I2.

https://openalex.org/W2032356946,"Recently, there has been upsurge of interest in the neural mechanisms of time perception. A central question is whether the representation of time is distributed over brain regions as a function of stimulus modality, task and length of the duration used or whether it is centralized in a single specific and supramodal network. The answers seem to be converging on the former, and many areas not primarily considered as temporal processing areas remain to be investigated in the temporal domain. Here we asked whether the superior temporal gyrus, an auditory modality specific area, is involved in processing of auditory timing. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over left and right superior temporal gyri while participants performed either a temporal or a frequency discrimination task of single tones. A significant decrease in performance accuracy was observed after stimulation of the right superior temporal gyrus, in addition to an increase in response uncertainty as measured by the Just Noticeable Difference. The results are specific to auditory temporal processing and performance on the frequency task was not affected. Our results further support the idea of distributed temporal processing and speak in favor of the existence of modality specific temporal regions in the human brain."

In the present study, DNA targets of SmcR, a Vibrio vulnificus LuxR homologue, were selected from a random pool of DNA fragments by using a cycle selection procedure consisting of in vitro DNA-SmcR interaction, purification of SmcR-DNA complexes, and PCR amplification of SmcR-bound DNA. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned and analyzed separately by electrophoretic mobility shift assay to verify the specific binding of SmcR to the DNA. The DNA sequences bound by SmcR were determined by DNase I footprinting, and alignment of the resulting 29 sequences revealed a 22-bp consensus SmcR-binding sequence, 5′-TTATTGATWWRWTWNTNAATAA-3′ (where W represents A or T, R is G or A, and N is any nucleotide), with an 8-bp (TTATTGAT) inverted repeat. The consensus sequence revealed greater efficiency for the binding of SmcR than the SmcR-binding sequence previously identified within PvvpE. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the 9th and 10th bases from the center are the most essential for SmcR binding. A genome-wide search using the consensus sequence predicted that at least 121 genes are under the control of SmcR, and 10 of these newly identified SmcR regulon members were verified as being regulated by SmcR in V. vulnificus as well as in vitro.

Bacterial pathogenicity is multifactorial and a complex phenomenon that involves the products of many genes, collectively called virulence factors (1Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Expression of many of these virulence factors is coordinately controlled by a common global regulatory system in response to environmental signals. This coordinate regulation facilitates cooperation of the virulence factors and is crucial for the overall success of the infectious microorganisms during pathogenesis (2Miller J.F. Mekalanos J.J. Falkow S. Science. 1989; 243: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Many bacteria monitor their cell population densities through the exchange of diffusible signal molecules (autoinducer (AI) 4The abbreviations used are:EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayHMMhidden Markov modelRTreal timeWCworking consensus sequence. ) that accumulate extracellularly (for recent reviews, see Refs. 3Fuqua C.

Rice S.A. Kjelleberg S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of the completed V. vulnificus genome sequence reveals that V. vulnificus possesses homologues of the genes required for sensing and responding to autoinducers, such as LuxO and LuxT (15Roh J.B. Lee M.A. Lee H.J. Kim S.M. Cho Y. Kim Y.J. Seok Y.J. Park S.J. Lee K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34775-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the similarities between the components of quorum-sensing systems in V. vulnificus and in V. harveyi, it seemed logical to consider that SmcR is a quorum-sensing regulator of V. vulnificus. Recent work demonstrated that SmcR regulates virulence genes and adaptive phenotypes (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the important role of quorum sensing in pathogenesis of Vibrio spp., a major problem to be addressed is that binding sequences of LuxR homologues have not been predicted and that genome-wide identification of target genes is still limited. Until now, only a few studies on the direct binding of LuxR homologues to DNA in vitro have been reported (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16706-16716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, consensus sequences for binding have not yet been identified. This lack of information makes it difficult to identify what genes are controlled by the proteins as well as to understand how the promoters of the target genes are modulated by the proteins. Transcriptome analyses have been used to identify genes regulated by LuxR homologues and the quorum-sensing system (7Waters C.M. Bassler B.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2754-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Zhu J. Miller M.B. Vance R.E. Dziejman M. Bassler B.L. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Micribiol. 2004; 53: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, these approaches search for genes regulated under defined in vitro conditions and therefore may not identify genes expressed only in specific environmental conditions that pathogenic bacteria may encounter within a host. Accordingly, here we extend our efforts to determine a consensus sequence for binding of SmcR, a LuxR homologue whose function is the best characterized in vitro. For this purpose, DNA targets that contain SmcR binding sites were selected from a pool of V. vulnificus genomic DNA fragments, and the binding sites were sequenced. Alignment of the sequences revealed a 22-bp consensus sequence with an 8-bp inverted repeat, and site-directed mutational analyses demonstrated that the 9th and 10th bases from the center of the repeats are the most important. In addition, we attempted to identify genes that are regulated by direct interaction of SmcR at the promoter. A hidden Markov model (HMM), a prediction algorithm based on a sequence profile, was used to screen the V. vulnificus genome, and the search resulted in the identification of at least 121 genes as members of the SmcR regulon. SmcR binding to the newly identified genes and their regulation by SmcR were experimentally examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) analyses. Selection of DNA Fragments Bound by SmcR—The DNA fragment library was prepared by partially digesting genomic DNA of V. vulnificus ATCC 29307 with Sau3AI and by recovering the 200–500-bp DNA fragments from a preparative agarose gel. The DNA fragments containing SmcR-binding motifs were selected from the library by using a cycle selection process, as described by Ochsner and Vasil (23Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4409-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Briefly, a linker carrying the Sau3AI protruding end (GATC) was developed by annealing and phosphorylation of a pair of complementary oligonucleotides, Sau3AI Linker-1 and Sau3AI Linker-2 (Table 1), and ligated to the Sau3AI-digested DNA. For binding of SmcR to DNA, 2 μg of the resulting DNA fragments were mixed with 200 nm His-SmcR purified as described previously (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol.

The DNA-SmcR complexes were isolated by using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and the DNAs were released from SmcR using a DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) (Fig. 1A). The released DNA were amplified using the linker-specific primer, Sau3AI linker-2, by PCR and used for the next cycle. The DNAs obtained after two cycles of selection for SmcR binding were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideOligonucleotide sequence, 5′-3aRegions of oligonucleotide(s) not complementary to corresponding templates are underlined.LocationbShown are the oligonucleotide positions, where +1 is the transcription start site of vvpE.Use(s)Linker and PCR oligonucleotides Sau3AI Linker-1GATCGAGTGACTCTTGACCTCGACTAGTGCLinker construction; amplification of SmcR-target DNA Sau3AI Linker-2GCACTAGTCGAGGTCAAGAGTCACTCLinker construction; amplification of SmcR target DNAPCR oligonucleotides T7GAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGpGEM-T easy vectorDNase I footprinting or EMSA SP6CATACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGpGEM-T easy vectorDNase I footprinting or EMSA VVPE021AGAATGGCGATTTTCATAG-300 to -282EMSA VVPE022GAATCCATCTCACTGCGA-118 to -101EMSA VVPE501GTACTGCAGGTTTGGCTAATGAGTTTTAAG-510 to -490Amplification of vvpE upstream VVPE502TATGGATCCGACGTTGATTGAGTTTCATTATCG+69 to +92Amplification of vvpE upstreamMutagenic oligonucleotides An and BncNumbers in An and Bn primers represent the positions of point mutation from the center of the working consensus sequence.

Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and DNase I Footprinting—Inserted DNA of the individual clones was amplified by a PCR using 32P-labeled T7 and unlabeled SP6 as the primers (Table 1) and used as a probe DNA for EMSA. The binding of SmcR to the labeled DNA and electrophoretic analysis of the DNA-SmcR complexes have already been described (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol.

The DNA that was confirmed as a target DNA of SmcR by EMSA was subsequently subjected to a DNase I footprinting assay according to the procedures previously described by Jeong et al. (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After precipitation with ethanol, the digested DNA products were resolved on a sequencing gel alongside sequencing ladders of individual clones generated using SP6 or T7 as the primer. The gels were visualized and quantified using a phosphor image analyzer (BAS1500; Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and the Image Gauge (version 3.12) program. The SmcR-binding sequences identified by the DNase I footprinting were used to determine a consensus sequence. Development and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Working Consensus Sequence—A working consensus sequence was developed by substituting bases of the 22-bp PvvpE SmcR-binding sequence with the bases conserved in corresponding positions of the consensus SmcR-binding sequence using the linker scanning mutation method (Fig. 3) (25Lee J.H.

For this, the 5′-amplicon, a 329-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the upstream region of PvvpE was generated using two primers, VVPE501 and AWC (Table 1). AWC, an antisense primer, contained the working consensus sequence (Table 1). Similarly, a 301-bp 3′ amplicon was amplified using primers BWC and VVPE502. BWC, a sense primer, contained a sequence complementary to the AWC primer. Second stage PCR was performed using VVPE501 and VVPE502 as a pair of primers and a mixture of two amplicons as the template to result in the 602-bp PvvpE upstream region with the 22-bp working consensus sequence (UP-vvpEWC) (Fig. 3A). The working consensus sequence was subsequently mutated by a similar experimental procedure, except using the UP-vvpEWC as a template DNA and a pair of A and B primers: APAL and BPAL (for development of dyad symmetric sequence), AIR-L and BIR-L (for replacement of the left repeat sequence), AIR-R and BIR-R (for replacement of the right repeat sequence), or An and Bn (for point mutations at a position n) (see Table 1). The 602-bp PCR products were inserted into pGEM-T easy vector, thereby creating 11 constructs with different SmcR-binding sequences, as confirmed by DNA sequencing (Fig. 3B). The 200-bp DNA (from –301 to –101 relative to the vvpE transcription start site) containing either the working consensus or the mutant SmcR binding sequences was generated by PCR amplification of the resulting constructs with a combination of the 32P-labeled and unlabeled primers VVPE021 and VVPE022 (Table 1) and then used as a probe DNA for EMSA. Bioinformatic Prediction of the SmcR Regulon—To discover SmcR-binding sites across the V. vulnificus CMCP6 genome, which was retrieved from GenBank™ (AE016795; AE016796), the HMM approach was applied. Among experimentally obtained SmcR-binding sites, the sequences completely annealed to the genome were extracted under a BLASTn search. Using HMMER, version 2.3.2 (available on the World Wide Web), an HMM profile representing the extracted sequences was constructed and subsequently was searched against the forward and reverse complementary sequences of the genome. The level of E value cut-off was determined from the E values of the extracted sequences. Among total genomic hits, the sequences with E values less than the cut-off were chosen as the candidates of SmcR-binding sites. If the first position of a candidate on the genome is located within the regulatory region spanning from the translational start site to upstream of 500 bp of any gene on the genome, we extracted the locus tag of the gene. Using the data base BioCyc (27Karp P.D. Ouzounis C.A. Moore-Kochlacs C. Goldovsky L. Kaipa P. Ahren D. Tsoka S. Darzentas N. Kunin V. Lopez-Bigas N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), genes or operons corresponding to each locus tag were predicted as potential members of the SmcR regulon. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Quantitative RT-PCR—The chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using formaldehyde cross-linking as described by Rhee et al. (28Rhee J.E. Kim K.S. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7870-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cross-linked chromatin in the wild type and smcR mutant HS031 cells (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was fragmented by sonication to result in sheared chromatins with an average length of 500 bp. One-half of the clarified supernatant was saved as the total input sheared chromatin (positive control) prior to the reaction with the anti-SmcR antibody (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the sheared chromatin (100 μl) from the other half of the supernatant was reacted with 10 μl of the anti-SmcR antibody overnight at 4 °C, and the resulting chromatin-antibody complex was specifically precipitated by adding 45 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were washed, and the sheared chromatins were eluted using the methods mentioned elsewhere (28Rhee J.E. Kim K.S. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7870-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cross-linkings were reversed by incubating the sheared chromatins with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 at 65 °C for 6 h, and DNAs were purified and analyzed by a PCR using a pair of the primers specific to the promoter region of the SmcR regulons, as listed in supplemental Table 2. For quantitative RT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized with the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Real time PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed with a pair of primers (supplemental Table 2) using the Chromo 4 real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad), as described previously (29Jeong H.G. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3768-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Lee B.C. Lee J.H. Kim M.W. Kim B.S. Oh M.H. Kim K.S. Kim T.S. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Relative expression levels of the SmcR regulons were calculated by using the 16 S rRNA expression level as the internal reference for normalization (29Jeong H.G. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3768-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Lee B.C. Lee J.H. Kim M.W. Kim B.S. Oh M.H. Kim K.S. Kim T.S. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Selection of DNA with SmcR-binding Sequences—DNA fragments carrying a motif for SmcR binding were isolated from a random population of V. vulnificus genomic fragments by a cycle selection process (Fig. 1A). A repeat of consecutive cycles of DNA-SmcR complex formation, isolation of the complexes, release of the DNA, and PCR amplification of the DNA enriched the DNA fragments with affinity to SmcR. Since the diversity of the DNA fragment population was also decreased by increasing repeats of the selection cycles (data not shown), the number of cycles of enrichment was limited to two. The enriched DNA fragments were cloned, and 66 DNA fragments were selected after confirming binding of SmcR to each fragment by EMSA. The nucleotide sequencing of these selected DNA fragments revealed that some fragments contained identical sequences, and finally 35 different DNA fragments were identified as DNA that contains SmcR-binding sites. EMSAs were performed in the presence of 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor, to determine if the binding of SmcR to the target DNA was specific (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1). Identification of SmcR-binding Sites Using DNase I Footprinting—To determine the sequences for SmcR binding, DNase I footprinting experiments were performed using individual DNA fragments that were gel-shifted by SmcR (Fig. 1B). Of the 35 DNA fragments, only 29 resulted in a DNase I footprint (see supplemental Fig. 1). The DNase I footprints revealed clear protection patterns by SmcR, which are similar to the protection pattern previously observed in DNase I protection analyses of SmcR in the upstream region of vvpE (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DNA sequences of the 29 protected regions were determined (Fig. 2A) and analyzed using a sequence logo generator, WebLogo (31Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8326) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Alignment of the sequences for SmcR binding revealed the frequency of distribution of nucleotides at positions and demonstrated a 22-bp consensus sequence, TTATTGATWWRWTWNTNAATAA (where W represents A or T, R is A or G, and N is any nucleotide) (Fig. 2C). A residue at a position represents when it is present in more than 50% of the population, and two residues when together represent more than 70% of the population. The most conserved residues in the 22-bp consensus sequence were in positions –10 (T), –9 (A), and –7 (T) from the center of the sequence (Fig. 2C). The consensus sequence consists of an 8-bp inverted repeat (IR), and the left half (IR-L) of the repeats is better conserved than the right half (IR-R), resulting in an imperfect dyad symmetry (Fig. 2C). The Consensus SmcR-binding Sequence Increases Binding Affinity to SmcR—The sequence centered at –196.5 upstream of the transcription start site of PvvpE was the only SmcR binding site identified until this study (Fig. 3B) (16Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of the SmcR consensus sequence we identified was compared with that of the PvvpE SmcR-binding site using EMSA. For this comparison, a working consensus sequence (WC; Fig. 3B), substituting 4 bases in positions 2, 5, 7, and 9 from the center of the 22-bp PvvpE SmcR-binding sequence with the bases conserved in corresponding positions of the consensus sequence, was developed and introduced into the region –207 to –186 from the transcription start site of the PvvpE. Thereby, the working consensus sequence still carries the bases found in the PvvpE SmcR-binding sequence unless they are conserved in the consensus sequence. In an EMSA, the addition of SmcR at a concentration of 20 nm resulted in a shift of the 200-bp DNA fragment (from –300 to –101, upstream of vvpE) containing the PvvpE SmcR-binding sequence to a single band with a slower mobility (Fig. 4A). Based on the concentration of SmcR that was required to retard 50% of the labeled probe, it was estimated that the dissociation binding constant (Kd) for SmcR was ∼80 nm (Fig. 4D). In a second EMSA, SmcR was added to the same 200-bp DNA fragment but containing the working consensus sequence (Fig. 3B) rather than the PvvpE SmcR-binding sequence. SmcR also displayed specific binding to the DNA with the working consensus sequence (Fig. 4B), and it was estimated that the Kd for SmcR was ∼15 nm, which represents a 5-fold increase in binding affinity compared with that of PvvpE (Fig. 4B). SmcR binding efficiency to the dyad symmetric sequence (WCPAL; Fig. 3B) that was generated by replacing less conserved IR-R sequence with the sequence of IR-L was also compared by EMSA (Fig. 4C). The Kd for the dyad symmetric sequence was slightly lower than the Kd for the working consensus sequence, indicating that SmcR binds to the dyad symmetric sequence with higher affinity. The affinity of SmcR to the DNA therefore increases as the binding sequences contain more bases conserved in the consensus sequence. Mutational Analysis of the Consensus SmcR-binding Sequence—To evaluate the significance of the individual bases in the consensus SmcR-binding sequence, the working consensus sequence was altered two ways. In one, 10 bp including each half of the inverted repeat (TTATTGATAA or TTGTGAATAA) were replaced with 10 bp including a KpnI site (CAGGTACCTC). In the other, conserved bases in each position were individually substituted with bases that appeared in the corresponding position with the least frequency (Fig. 3B). The relative affinities of SmcR to the mutant sequences were determined by EMSA using the labeled 200-bp DNA of the vvpE upstream region containing either the working consensus sequence as a positive control or the mutant sequences (Fig. 5). Based on the intensity of the shifted band, the binding affinities of SmcR to the mutant sequences constructed by altering half of the inverted repeats (WCIR-L or WCIR-R; Fig. 3B) were decreased; the levels were less than 10% of that with the working consensus sequence (Fig. 5). This indicates that both halves of the inverted repeats are necessary for SmcR to bind with complete efficiency. Mutations in any bases conserved in the left half of the inverted repeat decreased the binding affinity to levels below 80% of that to the working consensus sequence. However, mutations of individual bases positioned at –9 and –10 from the center of the sequence were the most detrimental (Fig. 5). The effects of mutations in the bases conserved in the right half were also similar to those observed with mutations in the left half (data not shown). Overall, these results indicated that although all bases in the inverted repeats are important, the 9th and 10th bases from the center of the consensus sequence are the most impor"

We also solved the crystal structure of quinone reductase 2 in complexes with dopamine and adrenochrome, two compounds that are structurally related to catecholamine quinones. Detailed structural analyses delineate the mechanism of quinone reductase 2 specificity toward catechol quinones in comparison with quinone reductase 1; a side-chain rotational difference between quinone reductase 1 and quinone reductase 2 of a single residue, phenylalanine 106, determines the specificity of enzymatic activities. These results infer functional differences between two homologous enzymes and indicate that quinone reductase 2 could play important roles in the regulation of catecholamine oxidation processes that may be involved in the etiology of Parkinson disease.

Cytosolic quinone reductases consist of two enzymes termed quinone reductase 1 (also referred to as QR1, 2The abbreviations used are:QR2quinone reductase 2QR1quinone reductase 1PDParkinson diseaseNRHN-ribosyldihydronicotinamide. 2The abbreviations used are:QR2quinone reductase 2QR1quinone reductase 1PDParkinson diseaseNRHN-ribosyldihydronicotinamide. NQO1, DT-diaphorase) and quinone reductase 2 (also referred to as QR2, NQO2) which catalyze the two-electron reduction of quinones without the formation of reactive intermediates (1Chen S. Wu K. Knox R. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). They play important roles against oxidative stress imposed by quinones. Quinone reductase 2 was first described in 1961 (2Liao S. Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1961; 4: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although its biological function has eluded scientists for decades until recently (3Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P.

Med. 2000; 29: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In particular, conclusive evidence points to QR1 having a protective function for cells against the toxicity of electrophiles and reactive forms of oxygen. In addition, its induction protects cells against carcinogenesis. Therefore, QR1 is acknowledged as belonging to the group of enzymes classified as phase 2 detoxification enzymes. quinone reductase 2 quinone reductase 1 Parkinson disease N-ribosyldihydronicotinamide. quinone reductase 2 quinone reductase 1 Parkinson disease N-ribosyldihydronicotinamide. There are two major classes of quinones: 1,4-quinones (para-quinones or p-quinones, see Fig. 1) and 1,2-quinones (ortho-quinones, catechol quinones or o-quinones). Both classes of quinones can be derived from oxidation of xenobiotics as well as endogenous molecules. 1,4-Quinones include vitamin K analogues, such as VK3 (menadione), whereas catechol quinones include the oxidation products of catecholamines, amino acid tyrosine as well as estradiols (7Smythies J. Galzigna L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Cavalieri E.L. Rogan E.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1028: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although QR2 and QR1 have high sequence and structural similarities, they possess significantly different catalytic actions (9Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both QR1 and QR2 can catalyze the two-electron reduction of p-quinones such as menadione (vitamin K3), only QR1 uses NADH and NADPH as electron donors. Instead, QR2 can use N-ribosyldihydronicotinamide (NRH) or a variety of NRH analogues as electron donors in the reduction of quinones in vitro (see Fig. 1) (10Knox R.J. Jenkins T.C. Hobbs S.M. Chen S. Melton R.G. Burke P.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4179-4186PubMed Google Scholar). While NADH and NADPH are electron donors for a variety of enzymes in various reactions and their biological metabolism and concentrations are very well characterized, very little is known about NRH and its related analogues. Thus, it is still not clear whether NRH is the biological electron donor for QR2, and the true biological functions of QR2 require further investigation despite the significant progresses made (4Long Jr., D.J. Iskander K. Gaikwad A. Arin M. Roop D.R. Knox R. Barrios R. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol.

In addition to differences in the preference of electron donors for catalysis, QR1 and QR2 have very different inhibitors. The well characterized inhibitors for QR1, such as dicumarol and Cibacron blue, do not significantly inhibit QR2 activity (3Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), whereas many natural polyphenols with chemopreventive properties (14Kang Y.H. Pezzuto J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 380-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as well as some polyphenol analogs are strong inhibitors of QR2 activity (2Liao S. Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Another significant difference between the functions of QR1 and QR2 is that, even though animals with gene disruption of either protein exhibit similar phenotypes, they exhibit opposite properties with regard to menadione toxicity. Animals with QR2 gene disruption exhibit increased resistance to p-quinone toxicity, whereas animals with QR1 gene disruption show increased sensitivity to p-quinone toxicity (4Long Jr., D.J. Iskander K. Gaikwad A. Arin M. Roop D.R. Knox R. Barrios R. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46131-46139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar differences are observed in cell lines when menadione is used as well (16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This is an intriguing paradox, as both proteins exhibit similar catalytic properties toward menadione reduction in vitro. Epidemiological studies also demonstrate significant biological differences between these enzymes. Genetic polymorphisms of the QR1 gene, resulting in the loss or reduction of QR1 function, are associated with increased susceptibility to a variety of cancers, chemical toxicity, and drug toxicity (17Bergamaschi E. De Palma G. Mozzoni P. Vanni S. Vettori M.V. Broeckaert F. Bernard A. Mutti A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Clairmont A. Sies H.

In contrast, genetic polymorphisms of the QR2 gene are associated with various neurological disorders, such as Parkinson disease (24Wang W. Le W.D. Pan T. Stringer J.L. Jaiswal A.K. J. Gerontol.

Tissue Antigens. 2003; 62: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and methamphetamine psychosis (29Ohgake S. Hashimoto K. Shimizu E. Koizumi H. Okamura N. Koike K. Matsuzawa D. Sekine Y.

Two of these studies indicated that homozygous deletion of the 29-bp sequence in the promoter region of the QR2 gene resulted in significantly reduced QR2 mRNA levels in patients (26Harada S. Tachikawa H. Kawanishi Y. Psychiatr. Genet. 2003; 13: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Okubo T. Harada S. Higuchi S. Matsushita S. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 27: 68-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other genetic polymorphism resulting in the significant reduction of messenger RNA levels of QR2 is also associated with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in schizophrenia patients (28Ostrousky O. Meged S. Loewenthal R. Valevski A. Weizman A. Carp H. Gazit E. Tissue Antigens. 2003; 62: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, further investigation is warranted, as an in vitro transcription assay of the deletion of the 29-bp sequence in the promoter region of the QR2 gene showed the opposite effect (30Wang W. Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and another study conducted in the United States failed to support the association of QR2 genetic polymorphism with PD (31Okada S. Farin F.M. Stapleton P. Viernes H. Quigley S.D. Powers K.M. Smith-Weller T. Franklin G.M. Longstreth W.T. Swanson P.D. Checkoway H. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all these conditions are associated with neurological disorders, which led to our hypothesis that one aspect of QR2 function could be the detoxification of oxidative metabolites of neurotransmitters, specifically catechol quinones. To test this hypothesis we conducted enzymatic and structural studies to compare specificity differences between QR1 and QR2. Protein Methods—Purification of QR2 was reported previously (16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The protocol of QR1 purification was similar to that of rat QR1 (32Chen H.H. Ma J.X. Forrest G.L. Deng P.S. Martino P.A. Lee T.D. Chen S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Specifically, coding regions of human QR1 cDNA was cloned into pET23d expression vector (Novagen). Escherichia coli (Bl21) harboring the construct was cultured in LB media and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Homogenous recombinant QR1 protein was purified sequentially by Cibacron blue affinity and ion exchange (Mono Q, GE Healthcare) column chromatographic methods. The QR2 and dopamine complex crystals were obtained by cocrystallization of QR2 (20 mg/ml) and 2 mm dopamine (1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). QR2-adrenochrome complex crystals were obtained by soaking QR2 crystals with 1 mm adrenochrome for 2 h in crystal freezing solution (1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 30% glycerol) (16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Crystallographic Analysis—Crystals were frozen in solid propane in the presence of 30% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected at beamline 19BM (Argonne National Laboratory) and processed with HKL2000 (33Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Crystals belonged to the space group P212121. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement methods with CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Dopamine and adrenochrome sites were identified after Fourier-difference transformation. The crystallographic analysis statistics are shown in supplemental Table 1. The final models have 95.8% residues in the most favored region, 4% in the additional allowed region and a proline residue outside the allowed region. The coordinates and structure factors were deposited at the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data base under the accession codes 2QMY and 2QMZ. Enzyme Assays—The enzyme activity of QR2 in comparison with QR1 was determined spectrophotometrically at room temperature in pH 7.6 buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, 1 μm FAD, 0.3% Tween 20) with adrenochrome as substrate. Freshly prepared adrenochrome solution in 5 mm HCl solution was used. The co-substrates used were N-methyldihydronicotinamide (NMN), SUB10R (1-(carbamoyl)dihydronicotinamide), or NADH. Because the reduced product of adrenochrome is extremely unstable and is oxidized back to adrenochrome when the assay is conducted in the presence of oxygen (35Baez S. Segura-Aguilar J. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 56: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we measured the consumption of the electron-donors NMN, SUB10R, and NADH by monitoring the reductions of UV absorbance at 360, 350, and 340 nm, respectively. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 20–30 ng of QR2 or QR1, and catalysis was monitored with a Unicam UV-visible spectrophotometer for 15 min. For the saturation curve of adrenochrome toward QR2, the reduction of SUB10R (200 μm) was measured in triplicate after 4 min with different concentrations of adrenochrome. In all assays the UV absorbance of each sample containing all the chemicals in the absence of enzyme was regarded as the background. This is especially important as reduced nicotinamide analogs can reduce adrenochrome at moderate rates (36Zafar K.S. Siegel D. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Identification of QR2 as a Novel Catechol Quinone Reductase—QR2 is a member of the FAD-dependent oxidoreductases. It is a flavoprotein that shares extensive amino acid identity (50%) with QR1 (9Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). QR1 has been extensively studied and has a well established role in detoxification as a member of phase II detoxification enzymes and consequently plays an important role in carcinogenesis (38Ross D. Siegel D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 115-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). QR1 and QR2 possess near identical three-dimensional structures that extend to their catalytic active sites (supplemental Fig. 1) (9Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Both enzymes can efficiently catalyze the reduction of menadione (p-quinone). However, they differ in the preference of electron donors. QR1 uses the universal electron donor NADH, whereas QR2 uses reduced nicotinamide analogues with small 1-substitution groups. Its in vivo electron donor has not been characterized and has been assumed to be reduced N-ribosylnicotinamide or N-methylnicotinamide. However, one common property of these enzymes is important in that both catalyze a two-electron reduction of quinones without the formation of reactive intermediates (38Ross D. Siegel D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 115-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We previously identified QR2 in a search for the cellular binding protein for resveratrol and showed that resveratrol was a potent inhibitor of QR2 activity with a dissociation constant of 35 nm (16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because of an association of a QR2 genetic polymorphism with neurological disorders, we hypothesized that QR2 might catalyze the reduction of catechol quinones, the oxidation products of catecholamines that include the important neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. This had neither been tested nor consideration given to the possibility that QR2 might be a catechol quinone reductase. Catechol quinones are extremely unstable, making enzymatic studies technically difficult to conduct. However, the commercially available adrenochrome, the oxidation product of epinephrine (Fig. 1 for structures), is a cyclized catechol quinone that is homologous to catecholamine quinones. The quinone moiety of adrenochrome can be reduced to the dihydroxyl form. However, the reduced form is spontaneously re-oxidized back to adrenochrome in the presence of oxygen (39Baez S. Segura-Aguilar J. Widersten M. Johansson A.S. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In the process, electron donors are consumed, providing a basis for a sensitive assay that allows rigorous kinetic analyses. Therefore, we analyzed the enzymatic activities of both QR1 and QR2 toward adrenochrome as a representative catechol quinone. We also used a number of known QR2 electron donors to conduct the reduction of adrenochrome (see Fig. 1 for structures of electron donors used). As shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and D, we demonstrate that QR2 is extraordinarily efficient in the reduction of adrenochrome with a Km value of 34 μm and a catalytic efficiency near diffusion control limits (kcat/Km = 108 m–1s–1) when QR2 electron donors such as 1-methyldihydronicotinamide or SUB10R are used. When NADH was used as the electron donor, QR2 possessed no activity for the reduction of adrenochrome (Fig. 2C). In contrast, QR1 showed no catalytic activity toward adrenochrome with any of the electron donors (Fig. 2). Fig. 2B is complicated by the fact that 1-methyldihydronicotinamide is not stable at pH below 8.0 (3Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These findings argue for different cellular functions of these enzymes despite their structural similarities. The difference in electron donor is also significant, as it separates QR2 from NADH that is involved in the general cellular redox state. Structures of QR2 in Complexes with Dopamine and Adrenochrome—To elucidate a structural basis for the activity differences between QR1 and QR2, we crystallized QR2 in complexes with dopamine and adrenochrome. QR2-dopamine crystals were obtained by co-crystallization of QR2 in the presence of 2 mm dopamine. QR2-adrenochrome complex crystals were obtained by soaking QR2 crystals with 1 mm adrenochrome in the QR2 crystallization solution. Both compounds structurally resemble catecholamine quinones, and both molecules are similar in structure to dopamine quinone (Fig. 1). The three-dimensional structures were solved by molecular replacement methods and refined to 2.1 Å for the QR2-dopamine complex and 2.5 Å for the QR2-adrenochrome complex with CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1 for refinement statistics and Fig. 3, A and B, for electron density maps for both ligands). Both dopamine and adrenochrome bind to QR2 active sites, which are formed at the dimer interface (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Both molecules show well defined electron densities in their respective complexes and have average B-factors of 35 and 44 Å2 for dopamine and adrenochrome, respectively. The aromatic planes of dopamine and adrenochrome are parallel to the plane of the isoalloxazine ring of co-factor FAD molecules (Fig. 3, C and D). On the other side of the aromatic rings are hydrophobic residues, which include Phe-178, Phe-126, and Ile-128. The hydrophobic nature of the active sites of both QR1 and QR2 are well defined in the literature (9Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 40Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The relatively narrow nature of the QR2 active sites require planar substrates and inhibitors (9Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which would preclude aliphatic (1,2)-diketones as substrates. The aromatic nature of QR2 active site (Trp-105, Phe-106, Phe-178, and Phe-126) also implies a preference for molecules with multiple conjugated double bonds, which would add additional π -electron interactions; catecholamine quinones belong to this class. Both dopamine and adrenochrome form conserved strong hydrogen bonds through a water molecule with the main-chain carbonyl of Gly-174, and the hydrogen-bond lengths are all less that 3 Å. Even though dopamine displays two possible conformations at the active sites (Fig. 3C), the positions of the two hydroxyls (phenols) do not change. One of the two phenol groups forms a strong hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl of Gly-174 through a water molecule (Fig. 3C). The water molecule is further held by the formation of another hydrogen bond with co-factor FAD molecule, rendering the water molecule in the QR2-dopamine complex well ordered with a B-factor of 26 Å2. Therefore, a network of hydrogen bonds among dopamine, co-factor FAD, the water molecule, and the carbonyl of Gly-174 help to orient the substrates at the active sites. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond formed between dopamine and the carbonyl group of Gly-174 through a water molecule implies that the same hydrogen bond can be formed between dopamine quinone and Gly-174 even though the ketone oxygen on quinones lacks hydrogen donors, as water molecule can act as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The adrenochrome occupies a position very similar to dopamine (Fig. 3D), with one of the two ketone oxygens in adrenochrome forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Gly-174 through a water molecule. The two ketone oxygen groups in adrenochrome are positioned in a manner similar to the two hydroxyls in dopamine at the QR2 active sites. In comparison with the QR2-menadione complex structure, both dopamine (yellow) and adrenochrome (red) occupy similar positions at the QR2 active site as menadione (green) (Fig. 4B), another QR2 substrate. For catalysis to occur, one of the ketone oxygens has to be positioned on top of the hydride donor, N5 of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (40Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), even though alternative mechanism was also proposed with other substrates (41Faig M. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Chen S. Winski S. Ross D. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the QR2-dopamine complex, the distance between one of the hydroxyl oxygen is 3.5 Å from N5 of FAD molecule (Fig. 4A), whereas in QR2-adrenochrome complex, one of the ketone oxygen is 3.4 Å from N5 of FAD. In the QR2-menadione complex, one of the ketone oxygens in menadione is also 3.5 Å away from N5 of FAD molecule. All three molecules occupy similar positions at the QR2 active sites (dopamine in yellow, adrenochrome in red, and menadione in green). All these data are consistent with the catalytic mechanism proposed by Li et al. (40Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Comparatively, QR2 may prefer catecholamine quinones as substrates, as there is a potential ionic interaction between the protonated amino groups in catecholamine quinones with the negatively charged carboxylate side chain of Glu-193 in QR2 (Fig. 4A) even though the distance between these two groups in the structure we solved is greater than optimum for the interaction. However, in our crystallization conditions we used high concentrations of ammonium sulfate (1.5–2 m) that could potentially disrupt the existing interactions under low ionic strength conditions. Interestingly, the carbonyl group of Gly-174 also plays a critical role in the binding of resveratrol to QR2 (16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), contributing to the differentiation of QR1 and QR2 polyphenol inhibitors. In comparison with the QR2 inhibitor resveratrol (16Buryanovskyy L. Fu Y. Boyd M. Ma Y. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the substrates take up about half of the active site cavity, whereas the inhibitor occupies the entire active site (Fig. 4, C and D). An arrow indicates the exposed carbonyl oxygen from Gly-174, which forms hydrogen bonds with both substrates and inhibitors. To determine the substrate specificity differences between QR1 (Protein Data Bank code 1h69) and QR2, we aligned the three-dimensional structures of QR1 with QR2 to optimize the overlap of the cofactor FADs from both proteins. Most of the active site residues are conserved between the two enzymes, which would explain their similar activities toward the reduction of menadione (12Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Faig M. Amzel L.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, for the reduction of catechol quinones, the critical interaction in the QR2-adrenochrome and QR2-dopamine complex is the hydrogen bond between the substrates and the carbonyl of Gly-174 through a water molecule. This hydrogen bond maintains the substrate in an optimum position for its neighboring ketone group (in catechol quinones) to accept the transfer of a hydride from reduced FAD (Fig. 4A). In"

Given the recently recognized ability of GrB to cleave extracellular matrix proteins, we examined the effect of GrB on the pro-hemostatic molecule von Willebrand factor (VWF). GrB delays ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation and inhibits platelet adhesion and spreading on immobilized VWF under static conditions. It efficiently cleaves VWF at two sites within the A1–3 domains that are essential for the VWF-platelet interaction. Like the VWF regulatory proteinase ADAMTS-13, GrB-mediated cleavage is dependent upon VWF conformation. In vitro, GrB cannot cleave the VWF conformer found in solution, but cleavage is induced when VWF is artificially unfolded or presented as a matrix. GrB cleaves VWF with comparable efficiency to ADAMTS-13 and rapidly processes ultra-large VWF multimers released from activated endothelial cells under physiological shear. GrB also cleaves the matrix form of fibrinogen at several sites. These studies suggest extracellular GrB may help control localized coagulation during inflammation.

GrB is found in all regions of the atherosclerotic plaque in advanced atherosclerosis, where it appears to be produced by foam cells and macrophages (6Choy J.C. McDonald P.C. Suarez A.C. Hung V.H.

This matrix degrading activity of GrB disrupts cell adhesion, which in turn can induce cell death in susceptible cells (10Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J.

Most of the GrB cleavage sites in matrix proteins have not been determined; however, one cleavage site in vitronectin has been identified as the integrin-binding motif, RGD, which explains the ability of GrB to modulate cell adhesion and adhesion-dependent processes such as cell spreading and migration (10Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol.

Mouse GrA de-sensitizes platelets to thrombin-induced aggregation (12Suidan H.S. Clemetson K.J. Brown-Luedi M. Niclou S.P. Clemetson J.M. Tschopp J. Monard D. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); however, the effect of GrB on coagulation is unknown. Here we show that GrB cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) at two sites important for platelet interactions, and not only inhibits VWF-mediated platelet aggregation and spreading on surface-bound VWF but also blocks platelet tethering and adhesion to ultra-large VWF multimers under shear flow conditions. Importantly, GrB does not cleave soluble VWF under static conditions, and in this respect mimics the physiological VWF regulator ADAMTS-13. GrB is therefore the first example of a serine protease that regulates the platelet-adhesive function of VWF in a strictly conformation-dependent manner, suggesting a unique role for extracellular GrB in controlling localized coagulation during inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human VWF was prepared from human Factor VIII concentrate (13Andrews R.K.

GPIbα was assessed by flow cytometry using anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibodies WM23 and AK2, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Binding of VWF was also assessed by mixing untreated and GrB-treated platelets with Alexa488-conjugated VWF (gift of Dr. Sue Cranmer, Monash University) in the presence or absence of botrocetin (10 μg/ml).VWF Cleavage Assays—Wells of a 24-well tray were coated with 500 ng of VWF in 200 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and then treated with GrB or GrBS183A in 200 μl of TBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were removed, and matrix was solubilized in 40 μl of reducing Matrix Lysis buffer (21Bonnefoy A. Legrand C. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). VWF cleavage in solution was performed with the indicated concentration of VWF and GrB in either TBS or 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. In one experiment urea was also included. To stop the reaction reducing Laemmli sample buffer was added. For comparison of GrB with ADAMTS-13, purified VWF was incubated with ADAMTS-13 or GrB in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 37 °C. 150 μl were transferred onto a hydrophilic filter membrane (VSWP, 25 mm diameter; Millipore, Bedford, MA) floating on 50 ml of dialysis buffer (1.5 m urea; 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and incubated at 37 °C. At 3, 5, and 16 h, 10-μl aliquots were mixed with 1 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, pH 7.4, and then analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. For fibrinogen cleavage, 2 μg of fibrinogen in TBS or 5 μg of fibrinogen coated onto wells was incubated with GrB for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and either transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-VWF antibodies or stained using Rapid Ag Stain (ICN Biomedicals) or Coomassie Blue. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:4000 and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For determination of GrB cleavage sites, samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Monash Biomedical Proteomics Facility (Monash University).Cleavage of UL-VWF strings was measured as described (22Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were perfused over histamine-stimulated HUVECs at a shear stress of 2.5 dynes/cm2 for 3 min. The number of platelet-decorated UL-VWF strings was counted in 10 continuous view fields (×200). GrB was added either to the perfusion buffer alone or was included during HUVEC stimulation.RESULTSGrB Delays Ristocetin-induced Platelet Aggregation—VWF initiates platelet adhesion in arterioles or diseased/narrowed vessels via interaction with the platelet membrane protein GPIbα (23Andrews R.K. Gardiner E.E. Shen Y. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Canobbio I. Balduini C. Torti M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1329-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vitro, VWF-mediated platelet aggregation can be triggered by the antibiotic ristocetin, which binds plasma VWF, inducing a conformation recognized by GPIbα (14Berndt M.C. Du X.P. Booth W.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Initially we examined whether GrB influences platelet aggregation in PRP, using ristocetin as the aggregation stimulus. Using protease concentrations consistent with previous investigations of leukocyte protease-platelet interactions (12Suidan H.S. Clemetson K.J. Brown-Luedi M. Niclou S.P. Clemetson J.M. Tschopp J. Monard D. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Sambrano G.R. Huang W. Faruqi T. Mahrus S. Craik C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6819-6823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we assessed platelet aggregation in PRP from eight donors after a 30-min pretreatment in the presence or absence of GrB. GrB significantly delayed platelet aggregation in 4/8 donors (Fig. 1 shows examples of two positive and one negative donor). We noted that the aggregation curves in untreated samples in response to ristocetin varied from donor to donor, as did the response to GrB. For example, in donor 1 PRP, GrB significantly delayed the initiation of aggregation, whereas in donor 2 PRP, which produced a more biphasic aggregation response, it showed a greater delay in the second phase of aggregation. This phase is thought to represent the release of platelet granules and activation of integrin-mediated binding to plasma VWF and fibrinogen (see Refs. 26Escolar G. Monteagudo J. Villamor N.

Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No effect of GrA was noted on platelets from two donors, indicating a specific effect of GrB.GrB Inhibits Platelet Adhesion and Spreading on Immobilized VWF—The inhibition of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation by GrB suggested that it acts either on VWF or on GPIbα. We assessed the effect of GrB on binding of washed platelets to immobilized VWF. Here coverslips coated with VWF mimic its conformation in the sub-endothelial matrix; thus unstimulated platelets bind via GPIbα, which induces the activation of integrin αIIbβ3 to mediate stable adhesion and spreading (28Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Untreated washed platelets adhere and spread well on the VWF matrix, as visualized by actin staining (Fig. 2A). By contrast, if GrB was added to the platelet suspension prior to plating, platelet adhesion and spreading were reduced by 70–80% (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that GrB disrupts GPIbα or integrin αIIbβ3 interactions with VWF. This activity of GrB is specific to VWF, as GrB had no effect on platelet adhesion and spreading on immobilized collagen (data not shown). By contrast, GrA had little effect on platelet interactions with immobilized VWF under identical conditions, with only a slight reduction in spreading at 60 min noted (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that a specific site is targeted by GrB, which is not susceptible to adventitious proteolysis.FIGURE 2GrB disrupts platelet adhesion and spreading on immobilized VWF. A, equal numbers of washed platelets were plated onto coverslips coated with VWF, in the presence or absence of 100 nm GrB or GrA, and allowed to adhere for 25 or 60 min. Platelets were subsequently stained for actin. Images are confocal single optical sections and are representative of three independent experiments. Graphs represent the average percentage of adherent and spread platelets when 100 nm GrB or GrA was added to platelets prior to plating. B, results from a representative experiment.

The extracellular domain of GPIbα, glycocalicin (18Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Kabral A. Zola H. Fournier D. Castaldi P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 29Clemetson K.J. Naim H.Y. Luscher E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was incubated with several concentrations of GrB for 45 min and assessed for cleavage by immunoblotting. GrB did not cleave glycocalicin (Fig. 3A). Full-length GPIbα on the platelet surface was not altered by pretreatment with GrB, as assessed by binding of the GPIbα-specific antibody AK2 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we showed that botrocetin-dependent Alexa488-VWF binding to platelets is also unaffected by pretreatment of the platelets with GrB, confirming that GPIbα remains intact and functional (Fig. 3B). These results show that GrB does not cleave the platelet VWF receptor and suggest that it must affect the VWF matrix itself. To confirm this, the VWF on coverslips was pretreated with GrB prior to applying platelets, which significantly inhibited both adhesion and spreading (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3GrB targets the VWF matrix to inhibit platelet adhesion and spreading. A, GrB does not cleave glycocalicin. 200 ng of glycocalicin was incubated with the indicated concentration of GrB for 45 min at 37 °C. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-glycocalicin antibody. B, GrB does not cleave platelet-associated GPIbα. 107/ml washed platelets in Tyrode’s buffer were treated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1.6 μm GrB. EDTA was added to 10 mm, and then platelets were collected and resuspended in fresh Tyrode’s buffer. Left-hand panels, platelets were mixed with either 1 mg/ml nonimmune mouse IgG (empty histograms) or the anti-GPIbα antibody AK2 (filled histograms) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Right-hand panels, platelets were mixed with either VWF-Alexa (empty histograms) or VWF-Alexa and 10 μg/ml botrocetin (filled histograms). Data are representative of two independent experiments performed with platelets from different donors. C, GrB acts on a VWF matrix.

Because GrB cleavage of vitronectin and fibronectin is conformationally dependent (10Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23549-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and VWF adopts different conformations depending on its location and quaternary state, we coated VWF onto plastic to mimic its form in the platelet adhesion assays (immobilized VWF). Under these conditions GrB cleaved VWF at several sites (Fig. 4A, center and right panels), and no cleavage was detected using the GrB active site mutant.FIGURE 4GrB cleaves VWF in a conformation-dependent manner. A, cleavage was assessed when VWF was in solution or coated onto plastic. 10% gels: 100 ng of VWF in Tris/NaCl (solution) or 500 ng of VWF coated onto plastic (matrix) was incubated with 50 or 100 nm GrB or 100 nm GrBS183A for 1 h at 37 °C. 7.5% gel: time course of cleavage of matrix-bound VWF. Wells coated with 500 ng of VWF were treated with 100 nm GrB for the indicated times or with 100 nm GrBS183A for 120 min. Samples were resolved by reducing 10 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mouse anti-VWF antibody. B, 200 ng of VWF was incubated in either Tris/NaCl or Tris/urea with 100 nm GrB for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were resolved on 7.5% gels and either immunoblotted with mouse anti-VWF antibody or silver-stained. C, 200 ng of VWF was incubated in Tris/NaCl and 100 nm GrB for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were resolved as for B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GrB Cleaves VWF Conformers Susceptible to ADAMTS-13—In vivo, the plasma metalloproteinase ADAMTS-13 regulates VWF by cleaving large multimers into less hemostatically active forms (30Dong J.F.

ADAMTS-13 will only cleave a conformer of VWF that has exposed a specific cleavage site in the A2 domain (30Dong J.F. J. Thromb.

In vitro, this ADAMTS-13 susceptible VWF conformation can be induced by partially unfolding VWF in urea or guanidine-HCl (32Furlan M. Robles R. Lamie B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by removal of salt (32Furlan M. Robles R. Lamie B.

Urea in physiological concentrations of salt did not permit cleavage by GrB (Fig. 4B); however, the removal of salt facilitated complete cleavage of VWF without requiring urea (Fig. 4C). Adding back salt progressively inhibited GrB-mediated VWF cleavage (Fig. 4C). This resembles the effect of salt on ADAMTS-13 cleavage in vitro (32Furlan M. Robles R. Lamie B.

Ristocetin binding also renders VWF susceptible to ADAMTS-13 cleavage (35De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S. Lombardi R. Merati G. Romitelli F. Di Stasio E. Mannucci P.M. J. Biol.

However, ristocetin did not increase GrB cleavage in the presence or absence of salt (data not shown).Overall, five cleavage GrB products were apparent by silver staining or by immunoblotting with the anti-VWF monoclonal antibody (6G1) (Fig. 5). Four products ranging from 65 to ∼150 kDa were detected. The 65- and 90-kDa products were reminiscent of the products generated by GrB treatment of immobilized VWF (Fig. 4A). The antibody did not detect one larger product (>175 kDa) evident by silver staining, suggesting that this species has had the epitope removed.FIGURE 5Identification of the GrB cleavage sites in VWF. A, 3 μg of VWF was incubated with or without 250 nm GrB in 5 mm Tris for 2 h. Reactions were resolved on a 7.5% gel and stained with Coomassie Blue.

The sequence of product 1 showed that GrB cleaves after Asp709, within the sequence 706LPPD↓MAQV713. This site is in the VWF A1 domain, just C-terminal to the disulfide loop (Fig. 5C). Product 2 indicated cleavage after Glu910, within the sequence 907CSGE↓GLQI914. The Glu910 residue is the first residue of the A3 domain and is 65 residues downstream of the ADAMTS-13 cleavage site in the A2 domain (Fig. 5C). Products 3 and 4 contained the N terminus of mature VWF, and they probably represent the other portion of VWF generated by cleavage at sites 2 and 1, respectively. Time course assays showed that site 2 (Glu910) is cleaved more efficiently under these conditions (Fig. 5B).GrB Cleaves VWF with Comparable Efficiency to ADAMTS-13—We next directly compared GrB-mediated and ADAMTS-13 cleavage of VWF under standard ADAMTS-13 assay conditions (Fig. 6A). GrB cleaved VWF with similar efficiency to ADAMTS-13, and no degradation of VWF was noted in the absence of either protease (data not shown). Only two major VWF products are generated by GrB under these conditions. By comparison with products 2 and 3 in Fig. 5, it appears cleavage only occurs at GrB site 2 (Glu910), which is closer to the ADAMTS-13 cleavage site, and was the major site cleaved in the GrB time course assay (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 6Comparison of GrB- and ADAMTS-13-mediated cleavage of VWF. A, VWF from normal cryoprecipitates (10 μg/ml) was incubated with ADAMTS-13 (20 nm) or GrB (50 nm) in Tris/NaCl and then dialyzed against 1.5 m urea, 5 mm Tris as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cleavage of VWF was assessed after 3, 5, or 16 h.

Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD) was a potential alternative for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. A comparison of the efficacy and safety of these three drug combinations was necessary to make evidence based drug treatment policies.Five hundred and thirty-four, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal children were randomised in blocks of 15 to the AS+AQ, AL or AS+CD groups. Administration of study drugs was supervised by project staff and the children were followed up at r home on days 1,2,3,7,14 and 28 post treatment. Parasitological and clinical failures and adverse events were compared between the study groups.In a per-protocol analysis, the parasitological and clinical failure rate at day 28 post treatment (PCF28) was lower in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or AS+CD groups (corrected for re-infections: 6.6% vs 13.8% and 13.8% respectively, p = 0.08; uncorrected: 14.6% vs 27.6% and 28.1% respectively, p = 0.005). In the intention to treat analysis, the rate of early treatment failure was high in all three groups (AS+AQ 13.3%; AL 15.2%; and AS+CD 9.3%, p = 0.2) primarily due to vomiting. However, the PCF28 corrected for re-infection was lower, though not significantly, in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or the AS+CD groups (AS+AQ 18.3%; AL 24.2%; AS+CD 20.8%, p = 0.4) The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups.AS+AQ is an appropriate first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Ghana and possibly in the neighbouring countries in West Africa. The effectiveness of AL in routine programme conditions needs to be studied further in West Africa.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00119145."

Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), sumoylation also enhanced the transcriptional activity of some substrates (17Wang J. Feng X.H. Schwartz R.J.

Consequently, SUMO modulates a variety of cellular processes under both physiological and pathological states via regulating the functions of its targets (21Nguyen H.V. Chen J.L. Zhong J. Kim K.J.

The SUMO conjugation pathway is similar to that of ubiquitination in the way that both processes require catalytic enzymes to accomplish the covalent linkages. However, they also differ in several significant ways, one of which is the functional consequence after conjugation. In general, polyubiquitination directed its targets toward proteasome-associated degradation, but SUMO modification rarely fragmented its targets; instead, SUMO modulated its targets' functions via changes in nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (24Lin X.

Bioinformatics unveiled a potential SUMO acceptor site in Nkx2.5, another critical factor for early heart formation. Nkx2.5 was targeted by SUMO-1 on lysine 51, and mutation to an arginine (K51R) reduced its DNA binding. SUMO linkage to Nkx2.5 enhanced transcriptional activity through multiple mechanisms, including the formation of a stable complex containing Nkx2.5 and SRF, another SUMO target (27Matsuzaki K.

Plasmid Constructions—The cardiac α-actin promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct (Ca-actin-Luc) and Nkx2.5 expression vector were described previously (9Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PIAS proteins, the PIAS1 RING domain mutant, and PIAS1 serial deletions were recently described (20Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X.

Nkx2.5 mutant K51R was generated by a two-step PCR protocol using one pair of primers overlapping the conversion site and a second pair covering each end of cDNA. The PCR fragment that contained K51R was subcloned into PCGN at XbaI and BamHI sites. Nkx2.5 serial deletion mutants were generated by PCR using corresponding oligonucleotides covering the desired segments of cDNA, which were thereafter subcloned into pcDNA4B-V5/His vector with EcoRV and HindIII. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Encoding vectors for hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin (MT123) and His6-tagged ubiquitin (MT107) were generously provided by Dr. Dirk Bohmann (Rochester, NY) (29Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Antibodies—All antibodies used in the present study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—CV1, HeLa, or COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Reporter transactivation assays were performed in 12-well plates, whereas transient transfections for Western blotting were carried out in 6-cm plates, using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the protocol described by the manufacturer. Reporter constructs (200 ng) and expression vectors were transfected into CV1 cells in the Opti-MEM I medium, balanced with empty expression vector to maintain the total amount of DNA constant per well. CV1 cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and then luciferase activity assays were executed with Monolight™3010 (Amersham Biosciences). Promoter activity was expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity induced by the presence of specific factor(s) to the control group with only the presence of empty vector. Data shown were expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least two independent assays, each carried out in duplicate. In Vivo Sumoylation and Ubiquitination Assays and Ni2+-NTA Chromatography—Wild type Nkx2.5 or K51R mutant was transfected into HeLa cells with FLAG-tagged SUMO-1 wild type (WT) or its mutant FLAG-SUMO-1-ΔGG. To determine whether PIAS1 potentiated the sumoylation of Nkx2.5 in vivo, the transfection assays were also done in the presence of PIAS1 or its RING finger mutant expression vectors. The whole procedure for protein blotting and visualization was detailed previously (17Wang J. Feng X.H. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49091-49098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ni2+-NTA chromatography was used to confirm the SUMO conjugates as described (20Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ni2+-NTA pull-downs for ubiquitination assays were performed by either transfecting His6-tagged Nkx2.5 WT or K51R in the presence or absence of ubiquitin expression vector or transfecting Nkx2.5 WT or K51R with or without His6-epitoped ubiquitin, as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. To determine if exogenous Nkx2.5 was modified by endogenous SUMOs, Ni2+-NTA was performed on COS-7 transfected with His6-tagged Nkx2.5, and protein blots were tested with anti-Nkx2.5 antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assays—Plasmid-based expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Nkx2.5 and FLAG-tagged PIAS1 were co-transfected into HeLa cells. Cell lysates were collected 48 h post-transfection, and Nkx2.5 antibody was used to precipitate Nkx2.5. The precipitate was washed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and PIAS1 was revealed by FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma). To visualize Nkx2.5, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-Nkx2.5 antibody. The GST pull-down assay was detailed previously (20Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Two different doses of whole cell proteins (10 and 30 μg, respectively) purified from HeLa cells transfected with encoding vectors for either Nkx2.5 WT or K51R mutant were used in binding assays performed at room temperature, as described in detail (17Wang J. Feng X.H. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49091-49098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Binding buffer consisted of 120 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50,000 cpm of double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides. In supershift assay, the protein was incubated for 30 min in the presence of specific Nkx2.5 antibody. Hot probes were end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified through chromatography columns purchased from Bio-Rad. The bindings were revealed by autoradiography. The two oligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays were as follows: consensus Nkx2.1 binding sequence, 5′-TCGGGATCGCCCAGTCAAGTGC-3′; Nkx2.5 binding sequence localized in cardiac α-actin promoter, 5′-CGACCTGCCATTCATGGCCGCG-3′. All of these sequences and their functions with Nkx2.5 were described previously (7Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Complex formation was determined by gel filtration performed on the high pressure liquid chromatography equipped with a Superdex 200 10/300GL column. The column was equilibrated with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Molecular weight markers (MW-GF-200; Sigma) generated a calibration curve obtained with the method provided by the manufacturer. Cell extracts (100 μl; 5 mg/ml) were loaded onto the column in buffer A at 0.75 ml/min. The fraction collector was set at 1 ml/fraction after 7.0 ml had eluted out. Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. SUMO-1 Targeted Nkx2.5 via Modification of Lysine 51—We asked if sumoylation influenced Nkx2.5 activity by first evaluating the cardiac α-actin promoter (Caactin-Luc) activity (7Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) in a co-transfection experiment with the increasing doses of SUMO-1 encoded expression vector alone or together with Nkx2.5 expression vector. While expressed, SUMO-1 or Nkx2.5 alone had no significant effect on the tested promoter (Fig. 1A); together, SUMO-1 potentiated Nkx2.5 activity in a dose-dependent fashion to a maximal activation of ∼150-fold. To determine if Nkx2.5 was a SUMO-1 target, protein blots were performed on extracts from HeLa cells transfected with Nkx2.5 in the presence or absence of SUMO-1 WT or SUMO-1-ΔGG, a defective SUMO mutant. Although SUMO-1 WT and SUMO-1-ΔGG were expressed to the same extent (Fig. 1B, bottom), an additional slower migrating band was observed only in the presence of Nkx2.5 and SUMO-1 and not in the presence of Nkx2.5 alone or Nkx2.5 with SUMO-1-ΔGG (top). Ni2+-NTA pull-down assays confirmed that the upper band was SUMO-1-conjugated Nkx2.5, since it reacted with both anti-Nkx2.5 antibody and anti-FLAG antibody against FLAG-SUMO-1 (Fig. 1C, top and bottom, respectively). Next, Ni2+-NTA chromatography further confirmed that the exogenous His6-tagged Nkx2.5 was modified by endogenous SUMO proteins (Fig. 1D). SUMO modification usually occurs on the consensus sequence ΨKXE (where Ψ represents a bulky hydrophobic amino acid, and X represents any residue), and one potential targeting sequence was identified: lysine 51, localized within the Nkx2.5 activation domain (AD) and conserved (Fig. 2A). Conversion of lysine 51 to arginine abrogated Nkx2.5 sumoylation (Fig. 2B, compare lane 3 with lane 5), indicative of lysine 51 as the principal SUMO-1 conjugation site. In co-transfection assays, the Nkx2.5 mutant K51R blunted reporter Ca-actin-Luc activity by 90% (Fig. 2C) in the presence of SUMO-1 as compared with that by Nkx2.5 WT and SUMO-1. These data indicated strong enhancement of Nkx2.5 transcriptional activity via SUMO-1 conjugation to lysine 51. PIAS1 Stimulated SUMO-1 Conjugation to Nkx2.5—One of the SUMO E3 ligases, PIAS1, was shown to be effective in linking SUMO-1 to the cardiac muscle-enriched transcription factors GATA4 and myocardin (17Wang J. Feng X.H. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49091-49098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test whether PIAS1 could also act as an E3 ligase in SUMO-1 modification of Nkx2.5, assays were carried out on HeLa cell lysates containing Nkx2.5 and SUMO-1 in the presence of PIAS1 WT or the defective RING domain mutant, as shown in Fig. 3A. PIAS1 caused the appearance of several retarded migratory bands, which were absent in the presence of the RING domain mutant. To confirm that the multiple slower migratory bands introduced by the presence of PIAS1 were SUMO-1-conjugated Nkx2.5, Ni2+-NTA pull-down followed by PAGE and protein blotting was carried out on cellular extracts purified from HeLa cells transfected with His6-Nkx2.5 alone or in the presence of FLAG-SUMO-1 or with FLAG-SUMO-1 together with PIAS1 as indicated in Fig. 3B. PIAS1 caused multiple protein bands to appear as shown by luminescent assays reactive with both the Nkx2.5 (top) and FLAG antibodies (bottom), respectively. Thus, these PIAS1-introduced retarded migratory bands were identified as SUMO-1 conjugates. In keeping with these observations, the transactivation assays showed ∼58-fold activation achieved by Nkx2.5/SUMO-1 or Nkx2.5/SUMO-1/RING mut, and the addition of wild type PIAS1 to SUMO-1/Nkx2.5 further activated the promoter by over 90-fold, although PIAS1 alone did not have a significant impact on Nkx2.5 activity. To investigate whether PIAS1 promoted the linkage of SUMO-1 to the primary SUMO site lysine 51, as shown in GATA4 sumoylation (17Wang J. Feng X.H. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49091-49098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or to a secondary SUMO site, like in myocardin modification (20Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), sumoylation assays were conducted on cell lysates containing K51R mutant/SUMO-1/PIAS1, as indicated in Fig. 3D. Mutant K51R displayed the minimal SUMO-1 modification in the presence of SUMO-1/PIAS1 (compare lane 4 with lane 5). Taken together, these data supported the identification of lysine 51 as the primary SUMO attachment site on Nkx2.5. Direct Physical Interaction between Nkx2.5 and PIAS1—Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a physical association between Nkx2.5 and PIAS1 (Fig. 4A). Interactive domain(s) of Nkx2.5 was mapped. As shown in Fig. 4B, the Nkx2.5 lysine 51 mutant did not affect its physical association with PIAS1, whereas deletion mutants containing amino acids (aa) 1–120 or 1–203 completely abolished its interaction with PIAS1. The Nkx2.5 C-terminal fragment 121–318 aa retained co-association with PIAS1. Neither Nkx2.5 nor any of its mutants were trapped by GST alone (data not shown). Likewise, the interactive domain(s) of 35S-labeled PIAS1 WT and its mutants was mapped by pull-down assays with Nkx2.5 (Fig. 4C). The PIAS1 RING mutant retained association with Nkx2.5. PIAS1 deletion mutants 481-CT, 301–480 aa, 1–120 aa, and 120–300 aa blocked the co-association with GST-Nkx2.5, but PIAS1 fragments 1–480 aa, 1–300 aa, and 1–316 aa retained it. Thus, the N-terminal 1–300 aa of PIAS1 contributed to its physical interaction with Nkx2.5. SUMO Modification Regulated Nkx2.5 Function via Multiple Mechanisms—The SUMO molecule may alter its targets' functions via a variety of mechanisms, such as changes in nuclear occupancy, DNA bindings, and protein stability, etc. The K51R mutant did not exhibit any abnormal subcellular localization (data not shown); however, although both Nkx2.5 WT and K51R were comparably expressed (Fig. 5A, left small panel), an electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that conversion of the lysine residue at position 51 to arginine reduced Nkx2.5 DNA binding activity on the Nkx2.5 binding elements identified in the cardiac α-actin promoter and consensus Nkx2.5 binding sequence (7Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 30Chen C.Y. Croissant J. Majesky M. Topouzis S. McQuinn T. Frankovsky M.J. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The addition of Nkx2.5 antibody either blocked or shifted the DNA binding (compare lane 1 or 2 with lane 3, in the left and middle panels), confirming the binding specificity. To explore whether sumoylation of Nkx2.5 antagonized ubiquitination of Nkx2.5, pull-down assays were performed with Ni2+-NTA, followed by Western blotting on extracts from HeLa cells transfected with His6-epitoped Nkx2.5 WT or K51R in the absence or presence of ubiquitin expression vector. As shown in Fig. 5B (left), a clear single band was visualized in the presence of Nkx2.5 WT alone or together with ubiquitin expression vector (compare lanes 1 and 2); however, ladders were observed in the presence of K51R alone or together with encoding vector for ubiquitin, indicating that the K51R mutant was targeted by ubiquitin. To further corroborate this, Ni2+-NTA pull-down followed by Western blotting was carried out on HeLa cells transfected with encoding vector for Nkx2.5 WT or K51R alone in the presence or absence of His6-tagged ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 5B (right), the high molecular weight band/smear was observed only in the presence of both K51R mutant and His6-ubiquitin and not in the other groups. Thus, we concluded that the substitution of lysine 51 by arginine turned Nkx2.5 into a polyubiquitination target. Reporter transactivation assays revealed that K51R exhibited much lower transcriptional activity than wild type Nkx2.5 (Fig. 5C). These data supported the critical involvement of the SUMO conjugation site in regulating Nkx2.5 transcriptional activity. One way to modulate Nkx2.5 activity is through homodimerization, which enhanced Nkx2.5 transcriptional activity (31Kasahara H. Usheva A. Ueyama T. Aoki H. Horikoshi N. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4570-4580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether SUMO-1-conjugated Nkx2.5 formed dimers with Nkx2.5, SUMO-1-conjugated Nkx2.5, produced by Nkx2.5/SUMO-1/PIAS1 in whole cell lysates, was precipitated with either GST or GST-Nkx2.5 immobilized to GST beads. GST-Nkx2.5 retained both free and SUMO-1-conjugated Nkx2.5, whereas GST alone failed to sequester either of them (Fig. 6A). To examine if SUMO modification may remodel formation of the Nkx2.5-containing complex, conventional size exclusion chromatography was conducted on whole cell lysates transfected with encoding vectors for wild type Nkx2.5 or K51R alone or in combination with SUMO-1 or SUMO-1/PIAS1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6B, Nkx2.5 alone appeared in a complex with a size ranging between 702 and 1093 kDa. However, in the presence of SUMO-1, Nkx2.5 also appeared in a complex with a size ranging between 77 and 119 kDa (lane 7). In the presence of SUMO-1/PIAS1, SUMO-1-conjugated as well as unconjugated Nkx2.5 showed up in several complexes with a size ranging from 49 to 186 kDa (lanes 6, 7, 8, and 9), which were not observed in the combination of K51R/SUMO-1/PIAS1. These observations suggested that SUMO-1 modification may modulate Nkx2.5 function via altering Nkx2.5 interaction with itself and/or with its associated proteins. Surprisingly, K51R maintained the capacity to physically associate with wild type Nkx2.5 (Fig. 6C, top). Increasing doses of K51R competitively blocked homodimerization of wild type Nkx2.5 by forming heterodimers (Fig. 6C, bottom panels). The results from reporter activity assays indicated that K51R did not dramatically synergize with wild type Nkx2.5 (Fig. 6D). These data indicated that SUMO-1 modification remodeled Nkx2.5-containing complex formation and that K51R did not function the same way as wild type Nkx2.5. PIAS Family Members Exhibited both Substrate and SUMO Specificity—The PIAS family is composed of at least five members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASy, PIASxα, and PIASxβ. These members may share some redundant functions but may also perform unique particular roles independent of each other (32Santti H. Mikkonen L. Anand A. Hirvonen-Santti S. Toppari J. Panhuysen M. Vauti F. Perera M. Corte G. Wurst W. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 34: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Wong K.A. Kim R. Christofk H. Gao J. Lawson G. Wu H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5577-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To examine which PIAS enhanced Nkx2.5 sumoylation by SUMO-1, in vivo sumoylation assays were complemented in cell lysates from HeLa cells transfected with plasmid-based expression vectors encoding wild type Nkx2.5 alone or in combination with SUMO-1 and PIAS isoforms, as indicated in Fig. 7A. Although all PIAS isoforms were comparably expressed (middle), clearly, the presence of PIAS3 was unable to promote SUMO-1 conjugation to Nkx2.5 (compare lane 2 with lane 7); all other PIAS proteins (PIAS1, -xα, -xβ, or -y) facilitated SUMO-1 linkage to Nkx2.5 (compare lane 2 with lanes 3–6). The SUMO family contains three functional members, among which highly identical SUMO-2/3 are generally weaker modifiers than SUMO-1. Indeed, SUMO-2/3 was also able to modify Nkx2.5 but to a much lesser extent in comparison with SUMO-1 (Fig. 7B). Surprisingly, only PIASxα and -xβ, and not the other PIAS proteins, catalyzed SUMO-2 attachment to Nkx2.5 (Fig. 7C), supporting the ideas that PIAS proteins promoted linking specificity for both SUMO proteins and their substrates and that SUMO family members were preferentially linked to substrates. SUMO-1 Potentiated Synergy between Nkx2.5 and Its Co-factor SRF—Nkx2.5 may act alone but may also synergize in combination with its co-factors, such as SRF, which was also reported to be SUMO-targeted on lysine 147 (27Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Tojo M. Honda Y. Uchimura Y. Saitoh H. Yasuda H. Nagahiro S. Saya H. Nakao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To test if SUMO-1 exerted any effect on the functional interaction between Nkx2.5 and SRF, transactivation assays were performed on Ca-actin-Luc in the presence of SUMO-1 with the combination of wild type Nkx2.5/SRF, as shown in Fig. 8A. Although a synergy was observed between Nkx2.5 and SRF, SUMO-1 further stimulated the activity of the reporter to ∼"
https://openalex.org/W2052440244,"Rap1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and is localized on pancreatic zymogen granules. The current study was designed to determine whether GTP-Rap1 is involved in the regulation of amylase secretion. Rap1A/B and the two Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Epac1 and CalDAG-GEF III, were identified in mouse pancreatic acini. A fraction of both Rap1 and Epac1 colocalized with amylase in zymogen granules, but only Rap1 was integral to the zymogen granule membranes. Stimulation with cholecystokinin (CCK), carbachol, and vasoactive intestinal peptide all induced Rap1 activation, as did calcium ionophore A23187, phorbol ester, forskolin, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, and the Epac-specific cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 abolished carbachol- but not forskolin-induced Rap1 activation. Co-stimulation with carbachol and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP led to an additive effect on Rap1 activation, whereas a synergistic effect was seen on amylase release. Although the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 abolished forskolin-stimulated CREB phosphorylation, it did not modify forskolin-induced GTP-Rap1 levels, excluding PKA participation. Overexpression of Rap1 GTPase-activating protein, which blocked Rap1 activation, reduced the effect of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, and vasoactive intestinal peptide on amylase release by 60% and reduced CCK- as well as carbachol-stimulated pancreatic amylase release by 40%. These findings indicate that GTP-Rap1 is required for pancreatic amylase release. Rap1 activation not only mediates the cAMP-evoked response via Epac1 but is also involved in CCK- and carbachol-induced amylase release, with their action most likely mediated by CalDAG-GEF III. Rap1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and is localized on pancreatic zymogen granules.

Co-stimulation with carbachol and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP led to an additive effect on Rap1 activation, whereas a synergistic effect was seen on amylase release. Although the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 abolished forskolin-stimulated CREB phosphorylation, it did not modify forskolin-induced GTP-Rap1 levels, excluding PKA participation. Overexpression of Rap1 GTPase-activating protein, which blocked Rap1 activation, reduced the effect of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, and vasoactive intestinal peptide on amylase release by 60% and reduced CCK- as well as carbachol-stimulated pancreatic amylase release by 40%. These findings indicate that GTP-Rap1 is required for pancreatic amylase release. Rap1 activation not only mediates the cAMP-evoked response via Epac1 but is also involved in CCK- and carbachol-induced amylase release, with their action most likely mediated by CalDAG-GEF III. Rap1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and is known to be involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation (1Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of Rap1 exist, Rap1A and Rap1B, which are 95% identical at the amino acid sequence and appear to mediate similar actions (1Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Like other members of this superfamily of proteins, Rap1 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound form.

Evidence indicates that different endogenous Rap1GEFs exert physiological functions in various cells. For example, in neuronal PC12D cells, CalDAG-GEF I is involved in Ca2+- and DAG-induced Rap1 activation, resulting in the activation of ERK1/2 (9Guo F. Kumahara E. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25568-25581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, CalDAG-GEF I is important for signal integration as well as granule secretion in platelets (10Crittenden J.R. Bergmeier W. Zhang Y. Piffath C.L. Liang Y. Wagner D.D. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 982-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Epac1 participates in the formation of endothelial cell tight junctions (11Kooistra M.R.H Corada M. Dejana E.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4966-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), whereas both Epac1 and Epac2 facilitate cAMP-induced exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells through an increase in Ca2+ release mediated by ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels (12Kang G.

Using cAMP analogs which activate Epac but not PKA, they showed effects of cAMP on carbachol-stimulated amylase secretion and zymogen activation. However, the downstream target of Epac was not identified. A number of small GTP-binding proteins have been identified on the external surface of zymogen granules, and some, particularly Rab3D and Rab27B, have been implicated in the regulation of pancreatic exocytosis (15Göke B.

Although Rap1 is also present on zymogen granules, as shown by both mass spectrometry and immunocytochemistry (20Chen X. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Simon E.S. Tomanicek-Volk S.L. Nelson B.B.

Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 306-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), there have been no studies on Rap1-dependent signaling and function in pancreatic acinar cells. Previous studies suggest that Rap1 may play a regulatory role in exocrine as well as endocrine cells. In parotid acinar cells, Rap1 is not only located on secretory granule membranes (21D'Silva N.J. Jacobson K.L. Ott S.M. Watson E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1667-C1673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but may also be involved in regulation of cAMP-stimulated amylase secretion (22Shimomura H. Imai A. Nashida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 431: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In a human endocrine BON cell line, Rap1 participates in neurotensin release (8Li J. O'Connor K.L. Cheng X. Mei F.C. Uchida T. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, Shibasaki et al. (23Shibasaki T. Takahashi H. Miki T. Sunaga Y. Matsumura K. Yamanaka M. Zhang C. Tamamoto A. Satoh T. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since Rap1 is located on zymogen granules and Epac is a likely cAMP mediator in pancreatic acinar cells, the aim of the present study was to determine whether Rap1 activation is involved in the regulation of pancreatic amylase secretion. The present results show for the first time that Rap1 is required not only for cAMP-evoked response via Epac1 but also for cholecystokinin (CCK) and carbachol-stimulated amylase secretion, most likely mediated by CalDAG-GEF III. Thus, Rap1 plays an essential role as a common effector protein for secretion. Materials—Collagenase was purchased from Crescent Chemical Company (Islandia, NY), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) were from Sigma, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen. The following inhibitors and stimuli were used. Sulfated CCK octapeptide was from Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ); vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was from American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA); A23187 and GF-109203X were from Calbiochem; carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), forskolin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP), dithiothreitol, EGTA, H-89, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and U-73122 were from Sigma; 8-(p-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP) was from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was from Pierce; and aprotinin and leupeptin were from Roche Applied Science. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Polyclonal antibodies against the following proteins were used. Phospho-Ser133-CREB was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); CREB-2, Rap1, Epac2, Rap1GAP, and RhoA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); Epac1 and Epac2 were from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and amylase was from U. S. Biological (Swampscott, MA). Preparation of Isolated Pancreatic Acini—Acini were prepared by methods previously described (17Chen X. Edwards J.A. Logsdon C.D. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18002-18009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Chen X. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50053-50060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, pancreata were excised from fed adult male ICR mice weighing 22–27 g. Acini were isolated by collagenase digestion, followed by mechanical shearing and then filtered through 150-μm Nitex mesh, purified by sedimentation through 4% BSA in buffer, and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 0.1 mg/ml STI. Expression of Rap1, Epac, and CalDAG-GEF in Mouse Pancreatic Acini—The expression of Rap1A, Rap1B, Epac1, Epac2, CalDAG-GEF I, and CalDAG-GEF III in mouse pancreatic acini was assessed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The following primers were used: mouse Rap1A, 5′-ATGCTGGAGATCCTGGACAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTTTGCCAACTACCCGTTC-3′ (antisense); mouse Rap1B, 5′-ACTCCATCACAGCACAGTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGTCGCATTTATTGCCAACC-3′ (antisense); mouse Epac1, 5′-GTTGTCGACCCACAGGAAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGAACAGGGCAGAGACAGA-3′ (antisense); mouse Epac2, 5′-ATTAATGGACGCCTGTTTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTCCTCAGGAACAAATCCA-3′ (antisense); mouse CalDAG-GEF I, 5′-CCAAGATGAGGCAGCTTTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTAGGCTTGGCAACTGAGG-3′ (antisense); mouse CalDAG-GEF III, 5′-GAACACTGTGCGGGATTTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTTGCTGCTTTGTCATGGA-3′ (antisense) (Invitrogen). The primers were designed with Invitrogen Oligoperfect Designer based on gene sequences obtained from the GenBank™ NCBI Sequence Viewer (available on the World Wide Web). Subcellular Localization of Rap1 and Epac1—Subcellular fractionation of mouse pancreas was carried out by differential centrifugation, as initially described by Jamieson and Palade (24Jamieson J.D. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34: 597-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Pancreas was homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose medium supplemented with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF at 4 °C using a Teflon-glass homogenizer. After a 10-min spin at 300 × g to remove cell debris, crude particulate fraction enriched in zymogen granules was obtained by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, whereas microsomal as well as cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Zymogen granule purification was carried out using Percoll gradients (20Chen X. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Simon E.S. Tomanicek-Volk S.L. Nelson B.B. Hurley M.C. Ernst S.A. Willams J.A. Andrews P.C. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 306-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Zymogen granule membranes were isolated by osmotically lysing granules in 150 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 27 μg/ml nigericin for 15 min at 37 °C and then collecting the membranes by centrifugation at 38,000 rpm in a Ti 70.1 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by washing with 250 mm KBr. Immunolocalization of Rap1 and Epac1—Freshly isolated pancreatic acini were stimulated with either 10 μm carbachol or 10 nm VIP for 10 min at 37 °C. Then acini were sedimented in test tubes and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, rinsed with PBS, cryoprotected, and frozen with isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections (5-μm thick) were mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fischer) and processed for immunofluorescence localization as previously described (17Chen X. Edwards J.A. Logsdon C.D. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18002-18009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-Epac1 (diluted 1:200), polyclonal rabbit anti-Rap1 (1:200), or polyclonal sheep anti-human salivary amylase (1:100 to 1:200) for 2 h at room temperature. Then they were washed three times with PBS. The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) or fluorescein-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (1:200) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) for another 1 h and washed with PBS. Prolong Gold with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole was added to mounting medium to counterstain nuclei. Digitized images were collected with an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal microscope as a Z-series (0.5-μm steps). A single image from the Z-stack was then chosen based on the most informative and sharpest fluorescence and processed using Photoshop CS software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). Pull-down Assay for the Determination of both Rap1 and RhoA Activation—Activation of Rap1 was measured using the glutathione S-transferase-RalGDS-Rap1-binding domain (RBD) as a pull-down reagent, which selectively binds the active GTP-bound form of Rap1 (25Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). RalGDS-RBD was expressed in Escherichia coli by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C and purified from bacterial lysates with glutathione-Sepharose. Acini were prepared for the assay as indicated above. Immediately, after incubation with agonist for the specified time, acini were washed once with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and then cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride was added. Acini were rapidly sonicated and cleared at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants (1500–2000 μg of protein) were quickly transferred into tubes with glutathione S-transferase-Ral-GDS-RBD (80 μg), followed by a 2-h rotation at 4 °C. Samples were washed and subjected to Western blotting for immunodetection of GTP-Rap1 as described below. Fifteen μg from each pancreatic acini lysate was used to immunodetect total Rap1. RhoA activation was determined as previously described (26Bi Y. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C22-C32Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The pull-down assay was carried out in a similar manner to Rap1 using Rhotekin-RBD-agarose beads (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA). cAMP-response Element-binding Protein (CREB) Phosphorylation—After acini were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C, they were washed once using ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mm sodium fluoride and lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol), sonicated, and clarified at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Samples (10 μg from pancreatic acini lysates) were subjected to Western blotting for immunodetection of phospho-CREB and CREB-2 as described below. Western Blotting—Immunodetection of proteins was carried out using SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% BSA dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Corresponding rabbit polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA, and the membrane was incubated with the antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by treatment with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000 in 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, peroxidase activity was visualized using the SuperSignal West Femto sensitivity substrate kit (Pierce). Amylase Secretion Studies—Freshly digested or overnight cultured acini were stimulated with CCK, carbachol, 8-Br-cAMP, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, or VIP in 1-ml aliquots in plastic blood dilution vials for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was assayed for amylase activity with Phadebas reagents (Magle Life Sciences, Lund, Sweden). Results were expressed as a percentage of initial acinar amylase content. 45Ca2+ Efflux—Cellular 45Ca2+ mobilization in isolated pancreatic acini was measured using a previously described procedure (27Williams J.A. Korc M. Dormer R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 4: E517-E524Google Scholar). Acini were suspended in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB) (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mg/ml d-glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml STI) and preincubated with 2 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 (New England Nuclear) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then labeled acini were washed twice with nonradioactive KHB, suspended in fresh KHB, and incubated with or without different secretagogues for specified times at 37 °C. 45Ca2+ remaining was calculated by difference between total 45Ca2+ and 45Ca2+ released from the acini into the extracellular medium. Intracellular cAMP Content— cAMP generation was determined as previously described (28Sabbatini M.E. Villagra A. Davio C.A. Vatta M.S. Fernández B.E. Bianciotti L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 285: G929-G937Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Acini were preincubated for 30 min in KHB and then for 3 min in fresh KHB containing 1 mm IBMX. Acini were stimulated with different secretagogues for 12 min. cAMP was extracted in ethanol and measured using a cAMP colorimetric enzyme immunoassay kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Results were expressed as pmol/mg of protein. Adenoviral Infection—To investigate the role of Rap1 activation in amylase release, we blocked the activation of endogenous Rap1 by expressing the Rap1-specific GTPase-activating protein, Rap1-GAP, in isolated pancreatic acini. Rap1GAP promotes the conversion of active GTP-bound Rap1 to the inactive GDP-bound form while having no effect on the activation of other GTPases (29Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus engineered for expression of Rap1GAP-green fluorescence protein (30Wittchen E.S. Worthylake R.A. Kelly P. Casey P.J. Qilliam L.A. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Patrick J. Casey (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The virus was amplified and purified using Adeno-X™ virus purification kits (BD Biosciences), and adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase was used as a control. Acini were infected with either β-galactosidase or Rap1GAP adenovirus (107 pfu/ml) during overnight culture at low density in 100-mm Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.01% STI, and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The overexpression of Rap1GAP-green fluorescence protein in isolated pancreatic acini was analyzed by immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting using polyclonal Rap1GAP antibody as described above. Infection efficiencies were routinely over 90%, as reported previously (18Chen X. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50053-50060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Infected acini were then used for studies of Rap1 or RhoA activation, amylase secretion, 45Ca2+ mobilization, or cAMP generation. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.E. of 3–6 separate experiments. The statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance following by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both Rap1A and Rap1B Are Expressed in Pancreatic Acini— In our previous study, we showed that Rap1 protein is present on rat zymogen granules (20Chen X. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Simon E.S.

Using RT-PCR, we have now found that both Rap1A and Rap1B mRNAs are expressed not only in the whole mouse pancreas but also in isolated pancreatic acini (data not shown). However, since the Rap1 antibody does not distinguish between the isoforms, we will refer to the protein as Rap1. CCK and Other Secretagogues Induce a Rapid Increase in Rap1 Activation—We studied whether CCK, carbachol, and VIP activate Rap1 in pancreatic acini using a Rap1 pull-down assay. CCK provoked a rapid increase in Rap1 activation with the maximum effect between 2 and 10 min, after which GTP-Rap1 levels declined but remained elevated at 30 min (Fig. 1A). A similar time course was observed following stimulation with carbachol and VIP (data not shown). To allow more samples to be collected simultaneously, Rap1 activation was thereafter studied after a 10-min stimulation. CCK, carbachol, and VIP stimulation all led to a concentration-dependent increase with comparable maximal increases seen at 300 pm CCK, 10 μm carbachol, and 10 nm VIP (Fig. 1, B–D). VIP-stimulated Rap1 activation showed a lower response at the highest concentration. These results indicate that the most relevant secretagogues for mouse pancreatic acini all activate Rap1. Ca2+, DAG, and cAMP Induce an Increase in Active Rap1 Levels— Both CCK and carbachol activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), which generates the intracellular second messengers DAG and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), whereas IP3 stimulates the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum required for pancreatic amylase release (31Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Johnson L.R.

On the other hand, VIP increases intracellular cAMP levels in pancreatic acini (32Burnham D.B. McChesney D.J. Thurston K.C. Williams J.A. J. Physiol. 1984; 349: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since several intracellular signals are able to induce Rap1 activation (1Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-1"
https://openalex.org/W2147108444,"Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are pluripotent and thereby a potential candidate for cell replacement therapy for central nervous system degenerative disorders and traumatic injury. However, the mechanism of their differentiation and effect on neural tissues has not been fully elucidated. This study evaluates the effect of BMSCs on neural cell growth and survival in a retinal ganglion cell (RGCs) model by assessing the effect of changes in the expression of a BMSC-secreted protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as a putative mechanistic agent acting on RGCs.The effect of co-culturing BMSCs and RGCs in vitro was evaluated by measuring the following parameters: neurite outgrowth, RGC survival, BMSC neural-like differentiation, and the effect of TSP-1 on both cell lines under basal secretion conditions and when TSP-1 expression was inhibited. Our data show that BMSCs improved RGC survival and neurite outgrowth. Synaptophysin, MAP-2, and TGF-beta expression are up-regulated in RGCs co-cultured with BMSCs. Interestingly, the BMSCs progressively displayed neural-like morphology over the seven-day study period. Restriction display polymerase chain reaction (RD-PCR) was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes in BMSCs cultured alone or co-cultured with RGCs. TSP-1, a multifactorial extracellular matrix protein, is critically important in the formation of neural connections during development, so its function in our co-culture model was investigated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. When TSP-1 expression was decreased with siRNA silencing, BMSCs had no impact on RGC survival, but reduced neurite outgrowth and decreased expression of synaptophysin, MAP-2 and TGF-beta in RGCs. Furthermore, the number of BMSCs with neural-like characteristics was significantly decreased by more than two-fold using siRNA silencing.Our data suggest that the TSP-1 signaling pathway might have an important role in neural-like differentiation in BMSCs and neurite outgrowth in RGCs. This study provides new insights into the potential reparative mechanisms of neural cell repair."
https://openalex.org/W2139389751,"The human relaxin family comprises seven peptide hormones with various biological functions mediated through interactions with G-protein-coupled receptors. Interestingly, among the hitherto characterized receptors there is no absolute selectivity toward their primary ligand. The most striking example of this is the relaxin family ancestor, relaxin-3, which is an agonist for three of the four currently known relaxin receptors: GPCR135, GPCR142, and LGR7. Relaxin-3 and its endogenous receptor GPCR135 are both expressed predominantly in the brain and have been linked to regulation of stress and feeding. However, to fully understand the role of relaxin-3 in neurological signaling, the development of selective GPCR135 agonists and antagonists for in vivo studies is crucial. Recent reports have demonstrated that such selective ligands can be achieved by making chimeric peptides comprising the relaxin-3 B-chain combined with the INSL5 A-chain. To obtain structural insights into the consequences of combining A- and B-chains from different relaxins we have determined the NMR solution structure of a human relaxin-3/INSL5 chimeric peptide. The structure reveals that the INSL5 A-chain adopts a conformation similar to the relaxin-3 A-chain, and thus has the ability to structurally support a native-like conformation of the relaxin-3 B-chain. These findings suggest that the decrease in activity at the LGR7 receptor seen for this peptide is a result of the removal of a secondary LGR7 binding site present in the relaxin-3 A-chain, rather than conformational changes in the primary B-chain receptor binding site."

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Rotation catalysis of F1-ATP synthase was first suggested by P. D. Boyer in his “binding-change mechanism” concept (3Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), and was strengthened by the x-ray crystal structure of mitochondrial F1 (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). Direct observation of the γ rotation in single F1 particles revealed the orientation of the central γ subunit in relation to the ambient three β subunits, which are taking different individual conformations at a given time during catalysis (1Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). The rotation was found to proceed in 120° steps, each driven by the consumption of one ATP molecule (5Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The individual steps could be further divided into 80° and 40° substeps that are related to ATP binding/ADP release and phosphate release, respectively (6Adachi K. Oiwa K. Nishizaka T. Furuike S.

The tentoxin-binding site is located at the contact surface between an α and a β subunit close to the N-terminal β-barrel structure on the α3β3 hexagon. The crystal structure of spinach chloroplast F1 complexed with tentoxin showed that the catalytic site on the αβ pair with bound toxin is in a closed conformation (11Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, it was deduced that tentoxin inhibits the activity of the enzyme by blocking the conformational shifts at the catalytic sites. However, which of the catalytic processes is affected could not be determined in detail so far. The stimulatory effect of tentoxin is even less understood on the molecular level, although it is accepted that binding of a second or maybe third toxin molecule induces the stimulation (9Mochimaru M. Sakurai H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Moal G. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previous single molecule experiments using genetically engineered F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF1) suggest that the high stimulatory concentrations of the toxin correlate with a reduced inhibition of the enzyme by ADP (12Pavlova P. Shimabukuro K. Hisabori T. Groth G. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9685-9688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, the mutant TF1 showed only a partial relief from tentoxin inhibition even at high toxin concentrations (13Groth G. Hisabori T. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20117-20119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To clarify both the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of tentoxin on the single molecule level, we adopted the F1 of the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (14Konno H. Murakami-Fuse T. Fujii F. Koyama F. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Pack C.G. Kinjo M. Hisabori T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4596-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is inhibited at 5–10 μm tentoxin and substantially stimulated above 100 μm (see Fig. 1). The magnitude of inhibition and stimulation agrees well with data obtained for spinach chloroplast F1 (15Tucker W.C. Du Z. Hein R. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7542-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but showed a higher Ki (0.8 ± 0.5 μm) as reported for other cyanobacterial F1 complexes (16Ohta Y. Yoshioka T. Mochimaru M. Hisabori T. Sakurai H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 523-529Google Scholar). The observed difference in the inhibition constant might be attributed to a Ser-Ala substitution in the tentoxin-binding site of the cyanobacterial enzymes, so that the hydrogen bonding with β D83 weakens the tentoxin-enzyme interaction (8Avni A. Anderson J.D. Holland N. Rochaix J.D. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Edelman M. Science. 1992; 257: 1245-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By using the cyanobacterial F1 subcomplex, we studied the inhibition and stimulation modes of F1 by tentoxin at the single molecule level and successfully clarified the molecular steps involved in both processes. Inhibiting concentrations of tentoxin affect the ADP release step at the catalytic sites, whereas rotation of the γ subunit was smooth in stimulated F1 particles because of a reduced ADP inhibition state, but nevertheless showed a slightly decreased rotating speed compared with the noninhibited enzyme. Thus the phytotoxin tentoxin is certainly a valuable tool to study catalytic steps within the reaction pathway of the molecular F1 motor. Materials—Biotin-PEAC5-maleimide was purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Tentoxin, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADH were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Expression Plasmid—Expression plasmid for the α3β3γ complex of T. elongates BP-1 was constructed as described (14Konno H. Murakami-Fuse T. Fujii F. Koyama F. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Pack C.G. Kinjo M. Hisabori T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4596-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For selective labeling of the γ subunit, suitable for single molecule experiments, all natural cysteine residues were substituted by serine using the Mega-primer method (17Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Two additional cysteines were introduced in position 125 and 222. Substitution of A125C was done using the following mutation primer, 5′-GGGATAGTCACGGCGCTGGAAATATTGGCATGCCTTGCGACCC-3′, and Val-222 was changed to Cys by applying mutation primer 5′-CATTTGGAAGTCAACCGCGAGAAAACCTCGACGCTGCCCGCTCTGC-3′. The plasmid was named pTR19FWR and was used for the expression of α3β3γCys125/222. Protein Preparation—Expression, purification, and labeling of α3β3γCys125/222 with biotin-PEAC5-maleimide were done as described before (14Konno H. Murakami-Fuse T. Fujii F. Koyama F. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Pack C.G. Kinjo M. Hisabori T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4596-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and confirmed by PAGE in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS (SDS-PAGE) and following immunoblot analysis (supplemental Fig. S5). ATPase Activity Measurement—ATPase activity was monitored in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (18Stiggall D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55 (319-321): 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 mm NADH. The assay was carried out at 25 °C. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined by monitoring the decrease in NADH absorption at 340 nm after addition of purified α3β3γCys125/222 using a spectrophotometer V-550 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). When the substrate ATPγS (5 mm) was used or in measurements in the presence of ADP (5 mm), the activity was monitored as the liberation of phosphate determined by a colorimetric method (19Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of the enzyme with tentoxin was performed for 30 min in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 with the indicated toxin concentrations. Rotation Assay—Rotation assays were done as described (14Konno H. Murakami-Fuse T. Fujii F. Koyama F. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Pack C.G. Kinjo M. Hisabori T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4596-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with minor adjustments. Biotinylated complexes (10 μl) in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin were infused into a flow chamber and were incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The flow chamber was then washed with 50 μl of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl to remove unattached complexes. Streptavidin-coated beads (100, 210, or 340 nm diameter) in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin were infused into the flow chamber and were incubated for 15 min. Rotation was initiated by addition of 80 μl of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.25 or 20 μm ATP, 100 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) after washing the flow chamber with 50 μl of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, and 100 mm KCl. In experiments with tentoxin, the indicated concentration of the toxin was included in the assay buffer. Rotation of the duplex beads attached on the γ subunit was monitored with a conventional optical microscope type IX 71 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 100× objective lens. Images were recorded with a digital video recorder. For fast recording we used a dark-field microscope (IX 71, Olympus) equipped with a mercury lamp and a high speed camera (Hi-DcamII, NAC Image Technology, Tokyo) at 2,000 frames/s. Recorded images were analyzed by custom software as described (20Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Low Concentrations of Tentoxin Inhibit the ADP Release Step—For our single molecule experiments, we attached streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (diameter ∼210 nm) via the biotinylated γ subunit to the α3β3γ complex and observed the ATP-driven rotation of the γ subunit at 250 nm ATP using a phase contrast microscope. Rotation was stepwise, and three stop positions could be clearly distinguished (Fig. 2A and supplemental movies 1 and 3). These positions were separated by 120° and correspond to the positions where the enzyme waits for the substrate ATP (20Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 21Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Nishizaka T. Oiwa K. Noji H. Kimura S. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The influence of tentoxin on the rotation pattern was studied in buffer exchange experiments. A rotating particle was then observed twice for an interval of 5 min before and after tentoxin addition to examine the influence of the toxin. Exchange of the buffer solution on its own did not alter the rotation pattern (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, rotation of γ became asymmetric, and one dwell time in a complete 360° turn became substantially delayed (Fig. 2A and supplemental movies 2 and 4) when inhibitory concentrations of tentoxin (10 μm) were supplied. This is in contrast to rotation experiments performed with the engineered TF1, which related tentoxin inhibition to a complete stop of the γ rotation (12Pavlova P. Shimabukuro K. Hisabori T. Groth G. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9685-9688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Rotation of the cyanobacterial enzyme continued after infusion of inhibitory concentrations of tentoxin, but the rotation speed significantly decreased (31.8 ± 7.9% compared with the enzyme without tentoxin). Bulk ATPase activity measurements showed almost the same decrease in activity (32.6 ± 2.6%) at this tentoxin concentration. To answer the question whether a fast dissociation and rebinding of the inhibitor could be in charge of the partial inactivation, we determined the kinetic properties for the first tentoxin-binding site in bulk ATPase activity measurements (supplemental Fig. S2). At 10 μm tentoxin, the time constant for binding was 52 s, whereas the time constant for dissociation was 714 s. The resulting kinetic constants were kon = 1.9 × 103 m-1 s-1 and koff = 1.4 × 10-3 s-1. The kon was 1 order of magnitude slower compared with those of the spinach CF1, whereas koff was faster than that for CF1 (10Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Moal G. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, binding was fast enough to proceed during rotation experiments, and dissociation was too slow to explain the suppressed rotation. Moreover, 9 of 14 particles stopped at the same mostly inhibited site, and four changed their position once during the observation interval (300 s). One particle showed two equal inhibited positions and was not included for further analysis. The three resting positions observed during tentoxin inhibition matched well with the ATP waiting positions assigned before buffer exchange (Fig. 2, A, insets, and B). For calculation of angle differences, data of 13 independent particle observations were merged and aligned at the most inhibited position. No significant change or shift was detected for all three positions as follows: -1.6 ± 10.7° at 0° (set arbitrarily for the most inhibited position), -0.6 ± 12.8° at 120°, and 0.5 ± 11.3° at 240° (Fig. 2B). In the most recent model of F1 rotation (6Adachi K. Oiwa K. Nishizaka T. Furuike S. Noji H. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Cell. 2007; 130: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), ATP binding and ADP release are the events that take place at these positions. Our precise determination of the resting positions eliminated the possibility that other catalytic processes such as ATP hydrolysis or phosphate release are affected by tentoxin. Bulk phase activity measurements of F1 using the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS, were performed to confirm this conclusion. Under these conditions ATPγS hydrolysis was the rate-limiting step, and no inhibitory (108.3 ± 23.3% activity) or stimulatory (111.1 ± 15.0%) effect of tentoxin could be detected when 10 μm tentoxin for inhibition or 1 mm for stimulation were supplied. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the rotation speed of γ between dwell periods at 20 μm ATP showed that torque generation is not affected by tentoxin (supplemental Fig. S3). To further specify which catalytic process is affected by the toxin, we determined the Km value for ATP in the presence of different toxin concentrations. In accordance with reports on spinach F1 (23Dahse I. Pezennec S. Girault G. Berger G. Andre F. Liebermann B. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 143: 615-620Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the inhibitor acts noncompetitively with respect to ATP, and the Km value for ATP did not change in response to the tentoxin concentrations (Km values for our enzyme were 115.2 ± 35.1 μm ATP without tentoxin; 97.3 ± 14.6 μm ATP at 2 μm and 92.3 ± 4.3 μm ATP at 10 μm toxin; see supplemental Fig. S4). This suggests that not ATP binding but another event such as ADP release is affected by the toxin. This interpretation is supported by the results of Hu et al. (24Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that tentoxin inhibits the release of ADP after binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. Thereafter, the dwell times at all three positions obtained with and without tentoxin were determined (Fig. 2C). The distribution of pause length always followed a single exponential decay with time constants similar to the ATP binding rate of TF1 (25Sakaki N. Shimo-Kon R. Adachi K. Itoh H. Furuike S. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2047-2056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The dwell time distribution at the mostly inhibited position (0°), however, gave a more accurate fit with a double exponential equation. The first time constant (0.27 s) was similar to that of the other resting positions or those of the noninhibited enzyme, whereas the second constant (1.36 s) was significantly slower and clearly attributed to tentoxin. This strengthened our idea that tentoxin affects an independent event like ADP release but not the ATP-binding event. This newly identified event was not reported by dwell time analysis of single molecule experiments so far. The two independent events located at 0° that were observed in our single molecule experiments do not fit the recent mechanistic model proposed by Mao and Weber (26Mao H.Z. Weber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18478-18483Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which attributes the ADP release step to the 40° substep. However, our data comply with a recent rotation model of Adachi et al. (6Adachi K. Oiwa K. Nishizaka T. Furuike S. Noji H. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Cell. 2007; 130: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Irrespective of their fit to a mechanistic model, the data demonstrate that tentoxin can be a useful tool to analyze specific steps during the rotation and to gain further insight into the basic mechanistic operation mode of F1-ATPases. High Concentrations of Tentoxin Relieve the ADP Inhibition—Next, we studied the stimulation of the F1 complex by tentoxin. To this end, rotation experiments were carried out at 20 μm ATP because the time required for the binding of the second or maybe the third toxin molecule depends on the catalytic state of the enzyme (10Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Moal G. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and stimulation was not observed at concentrations below 5 μm ATP (not shown). At 20 μm ATPase activity was stimulated to 140–190%. According to the kon ∼1 × 107 m-1 s-1 determined by the dwell time analysis in Fig. 2C before tentoxin infusion, the substrate binding at this ATP concentration takes about 5 ms. To visualize the stepwise ATP-driven rotation, we used a combination of smaller beads (100 nm diameter) and a high speed camera (time resolution 2,000 frames/s). The rotation speed at 1 mm tentoxin increased compared with those of the inhibited enzyme, but achieved only 60–70% of the speed obtained with the noninhibited enzyme (without toxin) (Fig. 3A). Most remarkably the rotation of stimulated F1 was smooth, and no clear long pauses could be detected. The three resting positions observed with the high speed camera did not shift (3.2 ± 12.7°) after tentoxin infusion (Fig. 3B). During long observation periods, we sometimes found a transition to a slower speed with a single distinct resting position (not shown). For the spinach enzyme, binding and dissociation of stimulatory tentoxin molecule(s) to the binding site(s) take only a few seconds in the presence of ATP (10Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Moal G. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We therefore assume that the observed transition was because of release and rebinding of stimulatory tentoxin molecules. Because the stimulated F1 showed smooth rotation, we could not distinguish differences among the three resting positions (Fig. 3B). Hence, all observed dwell times were merged and fitted with an exponential equation (Fig. 3C). The dwell time distribution without tentoxin followed a single exponential decay with a time constant of 12.9 ms. Because we could detect three distinct resting positions separated by 120° and catalytic dwell periods (the process of ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic site) are still faster than the ATP-binding event, we assign these pauses as ATP waiting dwell periods. As in tentoxin inhibition, the dwell time distribution changed after toxin infusion and followed a double exponential decay. The first time constant (11.9 ms) was similar to the constant before buffer exchange (12.9 ms), whereas the second (19.8 ms) was slightly slower (Fig. 3C). Taken together, high concentrations of tentoxin seem to partially relieve the inhibition event after substrate binding. However, it is still unclear how the binding of a second or third tentoxin molecule may alter the conformation or relief of the inhibition as a high resolution structure of a stimulatory F1-tentoxin complex was not resolved so far. In contrast to the reduced rotation speed of stimulated F1 complexes, the bulk ATPase activity is significantly higher than that without tentoxin (Fig. 1). Rotation experiments with a tentoxin-sensitive TF1 mutant (12Pavlova P. Shimabukuro K. Hisabori T. Groth G. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9685-9688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) demonstrated that high toxin concentrations reduce the probability of long rotation pauses (>20 s), which were attributed to ADP inhibition. ADP inhibition is a common feature of F1-ATPases (27Jault J.M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16280-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and occurs when the hydrolysis product ADP remains in one catalytic nucleotide-binding site and arrests the γ subunit 80° distinct from the ATP waiting position (30Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During the long observation experiments in the absence of tentoxin, we could confirm this inhibition for the cyanobacterial enzyme (Fig. 3D, left panel, and see Fig. 7B of Ref. 14Konno H. Murakami-Fuse T. Fujii F. Koyama F. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Pack C.G. Kinjo M. Hisabori T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4596-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On average, the complex stayed in such pauses for 52% of the observation time. The situation dramatically changed upon infusion of high tentoxin concentrations. After buffer exchange rotation speed was reduced (Fig. 3A), but the enzyme rotated continuously and stayed in the ADP inhibition pauses less than 1% (Fig. 3D, right panel, and E). This effect counteracted the reduced rotation speed of tentoxin-stimulated complexes and resulted in a higher net activity calculated as total revolutions per observation time (Fig. 3E). Also the magnitude of the stimulation on the single molecule level was very similar (∼160%) compared with bulk ATPase activity measurements. We verified the correlation of tentoxin stimulation and reduced ADP inhibition in ATPase activity measurements. It is known that the magnitude of ADP inhibition is enhanced by external ADP (30Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and azide (31Bowler M.W. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8646-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 32Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas phosphate (33Mitome N. Ono S. Suzuki T. Shimabukuro K. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the nonionic detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide (27Jault J.M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) diminish the inhibition. Therefore, the stimulatory effect of high tentoxin concentrations should be pronounced at high ADP inhibition, whereas the stimulation should be suppressed when ADP inhibition is diminished. Measurements of the ATPase activity with or without 1 mm tentoxin confirmed this assumption. Under these conditions, ATPase activity was stimulated to 174 ± 7%, whereas addition of ADP (5 mm) and azide (95 μm) increased the stimulatory effect of tentoxin to 289 ± 16 and 249 ± 7%, respectively. On the other hand, no stimulation was observed when 50 mm phosphate was added (97 ± 7%). Molecular Processes of Inhibition and Stimulation Caused by Tentoxin—Although it is well accepted that a single tentoxin molecule can completely inhibit the CF1-ATPase activity, there is still a debate on the number of the tentoxin molecules involved in the reactivation process. In this study, we visualized the effects of different tentoxin concentrations on the activity of the F1-ATPase and confirmed that binding of a single tentoxin molecule is sufficient for complete inhibition of the enzyme (Fig. 2). Based on our single molecule studies, we propose a model of inhibition and stimulation of F1 complexes by tentoxin (Fig. 4). We showed that tentoxin inhibition induced an asymmetric rotation by extending only one dwell time in the complete 360° turn (Fig. 2A). The corresponding event takes place directly after ATP binding and stops the reaction pathway before the 80° substep proceeds, which was observed as long pauses in Fig. 2A (τ = 1.36 s). Thus we could clarify the ADP release step at 0° during rotation of the γ subunit. This means that a single tentoxin molecule bound to one binding site acts like a clamp as shown in Fig. 4A and inhibits the transition of the related β subunit from a closed to an open conformation as suggested by the crystal structure of the spinach chloroplast F1 complexed with tentoxin (11Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This particular feature could be useful to mark a native enzyme at one position within a complete 360° turn. A similar feature was recently reported using a TF1 complex carrying a mutation at the catalytic sites (34Ariga T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, tentoxin would enable us to gain more easily further insights into the catalytic properties of each catalytic site separately using a native enzyme. In addition, the inhibitory effect is partially relieved by binding of stimulatory tentoxin molecules breaking the asymmetry of rotation and restoring the rotation speed to some extent. The molecular structure of the reactivated enzyme and the conformational shifts related to the stimulation process need to be clarified by further structural studies on a tentoxin-stimulated chloroplast F1. Yet our single molecular analysis has resolved that the activity of the stimulated enzyme is boosted because of the strong reduction of ADP inhibition. To quantify the liberation of ADP inhibition, we monitored the bulk ATPase activity with and without azide at different tentoxin concentrations (Fig. 4B). The difference in the apparent Kd value for tentoxin stimulation obtained from Fig. 1 (565 μm) and that from Fig. 4B (36.3 μm) is because of the difference in the experimental conditions; the assay reported in Fig. 1 is the observation of the direct stimulatory effect of tentoxin, whereas the plots in Fig. 4B are calculated indirectly from the ratio of the activity in the presence and in the absence of azide to evaluate the contribution of ADP inhibition for the stimulation process. Without tentoxin, the enzyme activity was severely reduced to less than 20% in the presence of azide. With increasing concentrations of tentoxin, the activity was less affected and dropped only to 45% at 1 mm. Noteworthy, the azide effect at 10 μm tentoxin (inhibition condition) was similar to the enzyme without toxin. This implies that the reduced ADP inhibition is an exquisite feature of the stimulated enzyme caused by the binding of a second or third toxin molecule (Fig. 4C). In addition, this tentoxin effect, which is directed against the ADP inhibition, can easily explain the observed differences in the stimulation level of the tentoxin-sensitive ATPases (i.e. CF1, the mutant TF1, and the F1 complex from T. elongatus) at high concentrations of the toxin. The purified CF1 from spinach chloroplasts contains one to two tightly bound ADP molecules (35Shoshan V. Shavit N. Chipman D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 504: 108-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Carlier M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3446-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Hisabori T. Mochizuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and its activity is normally very low because of the ADP inhibition at steady state conditions. The activity of the enzyme can be stimulated more than 10-fold by the addition of high concentrations of the toxin (7Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F. Durbin R.D. Bhatnagar P. Rich D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast, purified TF1 does not contain any bound nucleotides (38Ohta S. Tsubo M. Oshima T. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. J. Biochem.

Given that PfUIS3 is essential for establishment of liver stage infection by P. falciparum, our data provide a new target for abrogating parasite development within liver cells before typical symptoms of malaria can manifest. Plasmodium parasites are causative agents of malaria, which affects >500 million people and claims ∼2 million lives annually (1Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Rapid development of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant vectors necessitates discovery of novel drug and vaccine targets. Malaria infection is initiated in a human host when an infected Anopheles mosquito injects invasive sporozoites via the skin during a blood meal. Differential transcriptome profiling has identified ∼25 Plasmodium genes that are specifically up-regulated in invasive sporozoites (2Kaiser K. Matuschewski K. Camargo N. Ross J. Kappe S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Two such genes, called UIS3 and UIS4, are critical for the establishment of blood stage infection in Plasmodium parasites (3Mueller A.K. Labaied M. Kappe S.H. Matuschewski K. Nature. 2005; 433: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). UIS3-deficient parasites can start the transformation process in the liver; however, they show severe defects during transformation into trophozoites. Parasites lacking the gene for UIS3 are also unable to develop into mature liver schizonts and therefore abort malaria infection within the liver itself (3Mueller A.K. Labaied M. Kappe S.H. Matuschewski K. Nature. 2005; 433: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Crucially, immunization with UIS3-deficient sporozoites imparts complete protection against malaria in the rodent malaria model (3Mueller A.K. Labaied M. Kappe S.H. Matuschewski K. Nature. 2005; 433: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar).

The latter is a membranous network that surrounds the intracellular parasite, and it differs substantially from other membranous compartments like endosomes or phagolysosomes (5Lingelbach K. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1467-1475PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the fatty acids and lipids in the parasite PVM arise from the host cell, thus highlighting the fact that fatty acid/lipid import is crucial for parasite growth (5Lingelbach K. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1467-1475PubMed Google Scholar). The PVM is further modified by insertion of parasite-encoded proteins (including UIS3 and UIS4), which together may regulate various transport activities between parasite and the host cytoplasm (4Mikolajczak S.A. Jacobs-Lorena V. MacKellar D.C. Camargo N. Kappe S.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). UIS3 appears to play a central role in fatty acid/lipid import during phases of rapid parasite growth (4Mikolajczak S.A. Jacobs-Lorena V. MacKellar D.C. Camargo N. Kappe S.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The severe developmental defects evident in UIS3-deficient malaria parasites provide a rationale for dissecting the biochemical and structural attributes of UIS3. Abrogation of parasite growth and developmental arrest during the liver stages of malaria infection, by design of unique anti-malarials that target the pathologically silent liver stages of the malaria life cycle, deserves renewed attention. parasitophorous vacuolar membrane phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acid-binding protein liver FABP glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay mass spectrometry. Studies using the yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation experiments have recently suggested that Plasmodium yoelii UIS3 protein is capable of binding to the mouse liver fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP) (4Mikolajczak S.A. Jacobs-Lorena V. MacKellar D.C. Camargo N. Kappe S.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of mouse LFABP severely impaired development of rodent malaria parasites (4Mikolajczak S.A. Jacobs-Lorena V. MacKellar D.C. Camargo N. Kappe S.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data argue that delivery of fatty acid/lipid cargo from LFABP to UIS3 protein may be an important pathway for fatty acid/lipid import into the parasite. Members of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family typically show affinity for both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (6Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The LFABP differs from other members of FABP family in regards to its ligand binding stoichiometry (it can bind two independent chains of fatty acids) and in its ability to bind a spectrum of hydrophobic ligands (7Ockner R.K. Manning J.A. Poppenhausen R.B. Ho W.K. Science. 1972; 177: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 8Storch J. Mol.

Intracellular FABPs are composed of 10 stranded anti-parallel β-barrels with two short anti-parallel α-helices positioned over one end of the β-barrel (10Falomir-Lockhart L.J. Laborde L. Kahn P.C. Storch J. Corsico B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13979-13989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of rat LFABP reveals the same conserved FABP fold but with structural differences that dramatically alter ligand specificities (6Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rat LFABP possesses two ligand-binding sites in different environments in terms of fatty acid burial within the protein (6Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Crucially, the carboxylate group of second oleate in LFABP appears to be fully solvent-accessible (6Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The liver FABPs are also capable of interacting with lysophospholipids in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. The obligate nature of UIS3 gene for sporozoite development and interaction of UIS3 with LFABP together suggest parasite reliance on fatty acid/lipid acquisition from host hepatocytes (4Mikolajczak S.A. Jacobs-Lorena V. MacKellar D.C. Camargo N. Kappe S.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The rapidly growing population of liver stage parasites probably requires excessive amounts of lipids for membrane biogenesis, and UIS3-LFABP cross-talk may provide such conduits. We present here a detailed structure-function dissection of the PfUIS3130-229-phosphatidylethanolamine complex and provide evidence for direct interaction of PfUIS3130-229 with phospholipid vesicles and with human LFABP. These studies lay a foundation for the development of specific inhibitors that may block development of the parasite in infected host liver before pathological symptoms of malaria infection appear. Molecular Cloning, Expression, and Purification of PfUIS3—The UIS3 gene from Plasmodium falciparum (GenBank™ accession number XM_001349714; PlasmoDB number PF13_0012) was PCR-amplified from a sporozoite cDNA library. The amplified fragment (residues 83-229) was cloned between BamHI and SalI restriction sites in pGEX4T1 vector and the protein expressed in fusion with GST. For production of selenium-methionine-labeled protein, Escherhichia coli B834 (DE3) cells were freshly transformed, and a single colony was grown in 10 ml of minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose, 50 μgml-1 carbenicillin, and all amino acids including selenomethionine (except Met and Cys) (11Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). After 24 h of growth, this seed culture was used to inoculate a 1-liter culture that was grown for 20 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was grown for 12 h post-induction. The resulting bacterial pellet from this 1-liter culture was suspended in 40 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with lysozyme (100 μgml-1) and protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The cleared supernatant was passed through glutathione-Sepharose beads, which were then washed with PBS to remove impurities. PfUIS3-GST fusion protein was directly subjected to thrombin cleavage at 20 °C for 8 h on the beads. Cleaved PfUIS3 protein was subsequently collected as flow through, and the thrombin in solution was inactivated by benzamidine treatment (final concentration, 2 mm). Eluted PfUIS3 was concentrated using a 5-kDa Centricon (Viva Biosciences) after gel filtration chromatography. The purified protein was buffer-exchanged in crystallization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3), and crystallization experiments were set. For cross-linking experiments, a total of 5 μg of PfUIS3 was incubated with 0.1% of glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped using Laemmli buffer. The samples were boiled and loaded on SDS-PAGE and visualized using Coomassie staining. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Selenium-labeled PfUIS3130-229 crystals were obtained at 20 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 1 μl each of PfUIS3130-229 (10 mg ml-1) and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 12% polyethylene glycol 20,000, 0.01 m dithiothreitol (mother liquor). A single needle-shaped crystal was flash frozen under a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K using mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MARCCD detector at the BM14 beam line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. A selenium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set to 2.5 Å resolution was collected, and diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 suite program (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). All of the 18 expected selenium sites were found, both by AutoSol in Phenix and by SHELXD. PfUIS3130-229 crystals are monoclinic and belong to space group P21 (Table 1). The structure was determined using PHENIX (13Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. Mc-Coy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar) with selenium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set. Initial model was built by PHENIX, and this model was subsequently rebuilt using COOT (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23387) Google Scholar). Model refinement was performed using REFMAC (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) without imposing NCS restraints. This was done so that conformations of the six molecules in the asymmetric unit could be determined independently (Table 1). During the course of model refinement, difference maps showed distinctly Y-shaped electron density (above 2 σ) near Gln164 and Glu168. PE molecules were docked into the density, and the complex was refined with REFMAC (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The organic layer was washed with water and dried under nitrogen. Phospholipid extracts were then resuspended in chloroform:methanol (2:1) mixture. Electron spray ionization analysis was then done in negative polarity mode, which was calibrated externally. Preparation of Phospholipid Liposome Vesicles—Liposomes were prepared by a sonication method (16Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar) using commercially available lipids. In brief, 1:1.2 molar ratios of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol were used for liposome preparation. The lipid mixture was added to a 50-ml round-bottomed flask and dissolved in diethyl ether, and the system was kept under a stream of nitrogen gas. One-third of the total volume equivalent PBS was added to the above, and the mixture was sonicated briefly to obtain a clear suspension. Subsequently, the organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotatory evaporator. An excess of PBS was added at this stage, and the system was again kept under reduced pressure for 15-20 min so as to remove any traces of organic solvent. The suspension thus obtained was sonicated for 15-20 min on ice, and the resulting clear suspension was filtered through a 0.2-μm Acrodisc syringe filter (PALL Life Sciences) for maintaining homogeneity. These liposomes were characterized by dynamic light scattering and stored at 4 °C. Circular Dichroism and Dynamic Light Scattering Experiments—For CD analysis of PfUIS3130-229-liposomes interactions, the protein was first dialyzed against 5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Na2HPO4, and 5 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Far UV spectra (190-240 nm) of PfUIS3130-229 (0.1 mg/ml) were recorded at 20 °C in a 1-mm-path length cell with a JASCO-810 spectrophotometer. Scanning speed of 50 nm/min was used, and the instrument was continuously purged with nitrogen to prevent ozone accumulation. The spectra were measured 5-fold and averaged, and the base line was corrected by subtraction of blank buffer. For studying the effect of liposome addition on the overall structure of PfUIS3130-229, the liposomes were titrated, and CD spectra were recorded. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), proteinase K, and lysozyme were used as controls. Similarly, freshly prepared liposomes were used for dynamic light scattering analysis using a Photocor-Complex machine at a scattering angle of 90°. Linear correlation function was generated with a sample time of 30 s. Size distribution of liposomes was studied by titrating liposomes with PfUIS3130-229. Increasing amounts of PfUIS3130-229 protein were added to the liposomes and incubated at 20 °C for 10-15 min. The samples were then analyzed for mean hydrodynamic radius through light scattering. BSA and proteinase K were used as control proteins. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human LFABP—Codon-optimized LFABP (GeneArt) was cloned in PET28a modified vector by using KpnI and NcoI restriction sites and then transformed in E. coli B834 host cells. The clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and then one was used for inoculation of 10 ml of LB containing ampicillin antibiotic at 37 °C until it reached the log phase. This starter was used as seed culture for inoculation of 1 liter of LB with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used for induction of culture at an optical density of 0.6, and the culture was grown at 37 °C for 5 h. Protein was affinity purified using a nickel-chelating column (Pharmacia) and also by gel filtration using a S75 column (Pharmacia). PfUIS3-LFABP Binding Studies—PfUIS3-LFABP interaction was studied using purified proteins and plate-based ELISAs. 150 ng of purified PfUIS3 was coated on wells of a 96-well microtiter plate in bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C in quadruplicates. The protein gelatin (Sigma) was used as a negative control. After incubation, the plates were washed with PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with 3% PBS-gelatin (200 μl/well) for 2 h at 37 °C. After blocking, 100 μl of different amounts of His-tagged LFABP (concentrations ranging from 50 to 400 ng) in PBS was used for binding with the plate bound PfUIS3. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, extensive washings were done, and the reactions were incubated with 1:4000 dilution of anti-His horseradish peroxidase antibody (Sigma) in 3% gelatin for 1 h at 37 °C. After three more PBST washes, a color reaction was developed using orthophenylenediamine (Sigma) and H2O2 in citrate-phosphate buffer. The optical density was measured at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Probes). An average of four experiments was plotted after deducting background signal from the negative control (Gelatin). Standard deviations were less than 10% in all the cases. PfUIS3 Production and Oligomeric State—UIS3 gene encoding for residues spanning the PfUIS3 soluble domain (83-229) (without the signal sequence, cytoplasmic tail, and the membrane anchor) was expressed in a bacterial overexpression system. Purified PfUIS3 (residues 83-229) was dimeric in solution as shown by protein cross-linking experiments and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). Dimeric PfUIS3 (residues 83-229) failed to crystallize despite extensive screening; however, a monomeric form (residues 130-229) of PfUIS3 crystallized rapidly. Analysis of the PfUIS3 dimer-monomer transition using gel filtration chromatography and SDS-PAGE suggested that dimeric PfUIS3 underwent proteolysis and reduced to a stable, soluble domain spanning residues 130-229 (Fig. 1a). This suggests that residues within residues 83-129 of PfUIS3 are likely to be involved in dimerization of PfUIS3. From here on, this soluble domain will be referred to as PfUIS3130-229. Overall Structure of PfUIS3130-229—We determined the crystal structure of soluble PfUIS3130-229 by collecting single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data from selenium-labeled protein. Initial electron density map calculation and model refinement were done at 2.5 Å resolution. PfUIS3130-229 crystals contain six molecules/asymmetric unit, and the volume per asymmetric unit is VM 3.41 Å3 Da-1, which is equivalent to a solvent content of 64%. The refined structure for PfUIS3130-229-PE complex has Rwork and Rfree values of 22 and 27%, respectively (Table 1). The refined model has excellent stereochemistry and contains 135 water molecules and six PE molecules. Data processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The superposition of Cα atoms of the six monomers (A to F) of PfUIS3130-229 in the asymmetric unit gives an root mean square deviation of ∼0.5 Å. There is no noncrystallographic point group symmetry found between the six PfUIS3130-229 protomers. Interestingly, the protomer arrangements reveal two independent helical motifs (-A-C-F-A-C-F- and -B-D-E-B-D-E-) along the crystallographic b-axis. The thickness of the helix is ∼67 Å with inner and outer diameters of ∼43 and ∼110 Å, respectively. PfUIS3130-229 monomers AB, CD, EE′, and FF′ are related by ∼180° (E′ and F′ are symmetry equivalent molecules). There are two different sets of intermolecular interactions: (a) between A and B, C and D, E and E′, and F and F′ and (b) between B and E and D and F. PfUIS3 has dimensions of ∼44 × 29 × 23 Å and adopts a globular fold of four α-helices that pack against each other tightly. Residues from 130-148 form a random coil (C1) at the N terminus, and this is followed by an α-helix (H1, residues 149-169). A tight turn T1 (170-171) separates α-helix H2 (172-178) from α-helix H1. Another turn T2 (179-181) connects α-helix H2 with α-helix H3 (182-196). Finally, turn T3 (197-201) connects α-helix H3 to terminal α-helix H4 (202-227) (Fig. 2). PfUIS3130-229 fold is highly reminiscent of the ubiquitous helix-turn-helix motifs, and sequence comparison of UIS3 homologs from various plasmodial species suggests a high level of conservation (Fig. 3). The PfUIS3 surface has a spatially distinct opposite charge character. A broad negatively charged patch is evident on one face of PfUIS3130-229, which contains many charged residues, particularly Glu228, Glu227, Asp176, and Asp173 (Fig. 4a). Distal to this acidic cluster is a channel of basic residues: Lys150, Arg151, Arg196, Lys165, and Lys131 (Fig. 4b).FIGURE 3Sequence alignment of PfUIS3 with homologs from malaria parasites. pfa, Plasmodium falciparum; pvi, Plasmodium vivax; pkn, Plasmodium knowlesi; pch, Plasmodium chabaudi; pyo, Plasmodium yoelii; pbe, Plasmodium berghei.

The shape of the extra surface electron density (contoured at 2.0 and 1.0 σ levels for Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc, respectively; Fig. 5a) immediately suggested a potential lipid/fatty acid interaction. An in-depth analysis of this extra density, including docking of fatty acids and lipids, suggested that only lipids such as PE and phosphatidylcholine satisfactorily docked into the distinctly Y-shaped electron density (Fig. 5a). The presence of bound ligands was tested by tandem MS analysis of purified crystallization grade PfUIS3130-229. The phospholipid range in time-of-flight MS analysis was between 680 and 780 daltons. The shown tandem MS analysis of 716 daltons at collision energy 40 eV for 5 min shows expected fragments of PE. These data indicated the presence of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine at a molecular size of 716 daltons (Fig. 5b) bound to PfUIS3130-229. This is consistent with the fact that phosphatidylethanolamine is an abundant lipid of E. coli and constitutes ∼75% of membrane lipids (17Morein S. Andersson A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Given that PfUIS3 was overexpressed in E. coli, it is therefore likely that PE was naturally bound during UIS3 overproduction within the bacterial cell, as has been found in many previous studies of fatty acid-binding proteins. Confirmation of ligand identity by mass spectrometry allowed us to model PE molecules into the extra density on the surface of PfUIS3130-229. Structure of PE (Protein Data Bank entry 1lqv) shows a remarkable fit in the Y-shaped density and makes close contacts with side chains emanating from PfUIS3130-229 (Figs. 5a and 6). We were able to model PE phosphate head groups for each of the six monomers of PfUIS3130-229 in the asymmetric unit. The excellent quality of difference and 2Fo - Fc maps allowed us to model three complete and three partial chains of PE. The models were refined using crystallographic data to 2.5 Å resolution, and Rfree was monitored throughout the course of model building and refinement of the PfUIS3130-229-PE complex described here.FIGURE 6Surface representation and hydrogen bonding interactions in PfUIS3130-229-PE complex. a, hydrophobic portion of PfUIS3130-229 and bound PE molecule are colored light blue and yellow, respectively. b, view of PE on the surface of PfUIS3130-229showing close atomic interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2079028932,"The Tweety proteins comprise a family of chloride ion channels with three members identified in humans (TTYH1-3) and orthologues in fly and murine species. In humans, increased TTYH2 expression is associated with cancer progression, whereas fly Tweety is associated with developmental processes. Structurally, Tweety proteins are characterized by five membrane-spanning domains and N-glycan modifications important for trafficking to the plasma membrane, where these proteins are oriented with the amino terminus located extracellularly and the carboxyl terminus cytoplasmically. In addition to N-glycosylation, ubiquitination mediated by the HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 is a post-translation modification important in regulating membrane proteins. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the ability of each of TTYH1-3 to interact with Nedd4-2 and to be ubiquitinated and regulated by this ligase. Our data indicate that Nedd4-2 binds to two family members, TTYH2 and TTYH3, which contain consensus PY ((L/P)PXY) binding sites for HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligases, but not to TTYH1, which lacks this motif. Consistently, Nedd4-2 ubiquitinates both TTYH2 and TTYH3. Importantly, we have shown that endogenous TTYH2 and Nedd4-2 are binding partners and demonstrated that the TTYH2 PY motif is essential for these interactions. We have also shown that Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination of TTYH2 is a critical regulator of cell surface and total cellular levels of this protein. These data, indicating that Nedd4-2 differentially interacts with and regulates TTYH1-3, will be important for understanding mechanisms controlling Tweety proteins in physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2005055445,"Engagement of the IgE receptor (FcϵRI) on mast cells leads to the release of preformed and newly formed mediators as well as of cytokines. The signaling pathways responsible for these responses involve tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins. We previously reported the phosphorylation on tyrosine of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) after FcϵRI aggregation. Here, PLSCR1 expression was knocked down in the RBL-2H3 mast cell line using short hairpin RNA. Knocking down PLSCR1 expression resulted in significantly impaired degranulation responses after FcϵRI aggregation and release of vascular endothelial growth factor, whereas release of MCP-1 was minimally affected. The release of neither leukotriene C4 nor prostaglandin D2 was altered by knocking down of PLSCR1. Analysis of FcϵRI-dependent signaling pathways revealed that whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK and Akt was unaffected, tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT was significantly reduced in PLSCR1 knocked down cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 and consequently the mobilization of calcium were also significantly reduced in these cells. In nonactivated mast cells, PLSCR1 was found in part in lipid rafts where it was further recruited after cell activation and was constitutively associated with Lyn and Syk but not with LAT or Fyn. Altogether, these data identify PLSCR1 as a novel amplifier of FcϵRI signaling that acts selectively on the Lyn-initiated LAT/phospholipase Cγ1/calcium axis, resulting in potentiation of a selected set of mast cell responses.

The pathways leading from FcϵRI aggregation to cellular responses have been extensively studied and depend on tyrosine phosphorylations (5Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc.

Upon aggregation of the receptor it phosphorylates both the β and the γ chains of FcϵRI on tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif that is found in their intracellular domains (8Paolini R. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This results in the recruitment of additional Lyn molecules and of the tyrosine kinase Syk to the phosphorylated receptors and in the activation of Syk (9Benhamou M. Ryba N.J. Kihara H. Nishikata H.

Activation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 recruited to phosphorylated LAT leads to the release in the cytosol of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and of diacylglycerols. IP3 releases calcium from the intracellular stores with a subsequent influx of calcium from the extracellular milieu, thus participating in the calcium signal that is required for mast cell activation and, together with diacylglycerol, activates various protein kinase C. Fyn is also constitutively associated with FcϵRI and is activated after receptor aggregation (16Parravicini V. Gadina M. Kovarova M. Odom S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Furumoto Y. Saitoh S. Samelson L.E.

Therefore, both the Lyn and the Fyn pathways participate in regulating the calcium signal in FcϵRI-dependent mast cell activation. Production of LT and PG depends on the production of their common precursor arachidonic acid following cleavage of membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 is activated downstream of the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (22Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar) that depends on both the Lyn-initiated and the Fyn-initiated pathways (4Kraft S. Kinet J.P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Similarly, both pathways participate in the activation of transcription factors leading to the synthesis of cytokines. Recently, we reported the phosphorylation on tyrosine of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) after FcϵRI aggregation (23Pastorelli C. Veiga J. Charles N. Voignier E. Moussu H. Monteiro R.C.

PLSCR1 has been initially proposed as the protein responsible for the rapid redistribution of phospholipids between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane after cell activation or apoptosis, leading to the disruption of their asymetric distribution (24Zhou Q.

To date however, contradictory results have been reported, and this issue is still unresolved (25Zhou Q. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Wiedmer T. Zhao J. Li L. Zhou Q. Hevener A. Olefsky J.M. Curtiss L.K. Sims P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13296-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additional roles have been described for PLSCR1. Although PLSCR1 contains a consensus transmembrane domain, it requires palmitoylation to be stabilized at the plasma membrane (27Wiedmer T. Zhao J. Nanjundan M. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the absence of palmitoylation, it is found in the nucleus where it can bind DNA and activate the transcription of the IP3 receptor 1 gene (28Ben-Efraim I. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Gerace L. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Zhou Q. Ben-Efraim I. Bigcas J.L. Junqueira D. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35062-35068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When palmitoylated it participates in the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (30Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by amplifying the activation of the tyrosine kinase Src (31Nanjundan M. Sun J. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37413-37418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 following FcϵRI aggregation strongly suggested the involvement of this protein in FcϵRI-dependent mast cell activation. Yet this role was still elusive (32Smrz D. Lebduska P. Dráberová L. Korb J. Dráber P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10904-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To address this question, we used an RNA silencing approach. We show that a mast cell line with a knocked down PLSCR1 expression had significantly impaired degranulation and VEGF release after FcϵRI engagement that was preceded by a decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and PLCγ1 and a decreased calcium mobilization. Antibodies and Reagents—Monoclonal anti-rat PLSCR1 antibodies 129.2 and 17.3 and anti-FcϵRIβ monoclonal antibody 30.9 have been already described (23Pastorelli C. Veiga J. Charles N. Voignier E.

Blank U. Monteiro R.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was used as a culture supernatant of the 4G10 hybridoma or as horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The anti-DNP monoclonal IgE DNP48 was a kind gift from Dr. R. P. Siraganian (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Mouse anti-LAT monoclonal IgG was a generous gift from Dr. P. Dráber (Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Czech Republic). Anti-Fyn polyclonal IgG is a kind gift from Dr. S. Latour (INSERM U768, Necker Hospital, Paris, France). Other reagents were from the following sources: anti-Lyn polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA); Alexa Fluor 647 streptavidin, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen); anti-IP3R1 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA); anti-phospho-ERK (Tyr202/Tyr204), -Akt (Ser473), -PLCγ1 (Tyr783), and -LAT (Tyr191 and Tyr132), and anti-total-ERK, -Akt, -PLCγ1 polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Tech, Danvers, MA); anti-PLCγ1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotech Inc, Lake Placid, NY); horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, Fura 2-AM, Triton X-100, SDS, bovine serum albumin (BSA), DNP-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA), proteases and phosphatases inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, NaF, and Na3VO4), and polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and other culture reagents as well as goat serum (Invitrogen); puromycin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA); and Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Cells and Cell Lines—The rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 and human embryonic kidney cells HEK 293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and with penicillin and streptomycin. siRNA, shRNA Design, and Stable Expression—Three siRNA were selected that were specific for rat PLSCR1. These corresponded to the following sequences: siRNA1, 5′-GUG-GCU-UUC-CUG-UCC-AAC-A-3′; siRNA2, 5′-GGC-AGG-ACG-UUC-UAA-AGG-U-3′; and siRNA3, 5′-CCU-UGA-GGA-UCC-UGG-AUA-A-3′; control siRNA (scrambled siRNA3) was 5′-UGC-UAG-UGA-CCU-GCC-AUA-A-3′;. The siRNA duplexes were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells by electroporation. Two days later, the cells were lysed. The presence of PLSCR1 in the lysates was examined by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody 17.3 that recognizes both PLSCR1 and a 28-kDa protein (p28). This protein served as a control both for loading and for silencing specificity during the screening test. The sequence of the most efficient siRNA (and of the control siRNA) were then selected to design a shRNA. The mammalian expression vector pSuper.retro.puro (Oligo-Engine, Seattle, WA) was used for expression of these shRNA in RBL-2H3 cells. The sequences were inserted between the HindIII and BglII sites of the vector, and after amplification the cloned sequences were confirmed. To generate retrovirus-containing supernatants, the packaging cell line HEK 293 was plated at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm plate 48 h prior to transfection of the recombinant vectors with Lipofectamine. A green fluorescent protein expression system was used to control for transfection efficiency by flow cytometry. The culture medium was changed 24 h after transfection, and 48 h later the retrovirus-containing supernatant was collected, supplemented with polybrene (8 μg/ml), and added to RBL-2H3 cell cultures. The infected cells were resuspended 48 h later in fresh medium containing puromycin at 1 μg/ml for selection. Silencing of PLSCR1 expression was confirmed by Western blotting and confocal microscopy. For functional analyses, puromycin was omitted at least 72 h before experiments without detectable alleviation of PLSCR1 silencing. Cell Stimulation and Measurement of β-Hexosaminidase Release—One or 1.5 × 106 RBL-2H3 cells were incubated overnight in the presence of a 1:100 dilution DNP48 anti-DNP IgE ascitic fluid. After two washes in Tyrode's solution (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA), the cells were stimulated at 37 °C with DNP-HSA. Release of the granule marker β-hexosaminidase was measured in the supernatants as described (36Benhamou M. Ninio E. Salem P. Hieblot C. Bessou G. Pitton C. Liu F.T. Mencia-Huerta J.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1385-1392PubMed Google Scholar). Prostaglandin and Leukotriene Measurements—Supernatants from cells stimulated in Tyrode's buffer containing fatty acid-free BSA were centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 5 min and used for the determination of LTC4 and PGD2 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. VEGF and MCP-1 Release—Supernatants of cells stimulated in culture medium were centrifuged to eliminate cell debris. Secreted VEGF was measured using ELISA DuoSet kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). MCP-1 was measured with the rat MCP-1 ELISA development kit from Peprotech (Paris, France). Calcium Imaging—5 × 105 IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells were plated on coverslips and loaded with 1 μl of pluronic acid F-127 (InVitrogen) and 1 μm Fura 2-AM at 37 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a combination of a scanning monochromator and a CCD camera operated by TILLvisION software (Till Imago, TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). The camera was mounted to an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 40× oil objective (Nikon). The cells were exposed to alternating excitation light pulses of 340- and 380-nm wavelengths of 120 μs each. Fluorescence values of the collected emission images were corrected for background fluorescence before starting data collection. The results are compiled from three experiments, and per experiment up to 5–6 cells were analyzed simultaneously. The fluorescence intensity ratio was calculated by the ratio of the fluorescence values at 340- and 380-nm excitation. Fluorescence signals were plotted as (F/F0) - 1 with F as fluorescence during the experimentation and F0 as the initial level of fluorescence (37Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The areas under the curve were calculated as arbitrary units. Confocal Microscopy—2.5 × 105 RBL-2H3 cells were plated on coverslips inside 24-well plates. After each step, the cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells were fixed in PBS, 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated with 50 nm of NH4Cl in PBS (to reduce aldehyde groups) at room temperature. After a 1-h saturation in A1 buffer (0.25% BSA, 0.025% saponin, and 10% of goat serum in PBS), the cells were incubated with biotinylated 129.2 antibody (20 μg/ml) in A1 buffer for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with streptavidin coupled to AlexaFluor 647 (1:400 dilution) for 45 min in 0.25% BSA, 0.00125% saponin, 10% goat serum in PBS. Slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium and analyzed by confocal microscopy with a Zeiss LSM-5 confocal scanning laser microscope, equipped with argon and helium-neon lasers, using a plan-aprochromat 63× objective (numerical aperture, 1.40; oil immersion) and a crop ×2, at room temperature. Red fluorescence was observed with a 560-nm long pass emission filter under 543-nm laser illumination. Images were collected every 0.4 μm along the z-axis. Imaging was obtained using LSM imaging software. FACS Analysis—The cells were washed twice in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.01% NaN3 (PBA) at 4 °C. After a 30-min incubation with 100 μg/ml rabbit IgG in PBA, 5 × 105 cells were further incubated with or without 10 μg/ml IgE at 4 °C for 1 h. After two washes in PBA, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with goat anti-mouse IgE antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. After two final washes in PBA, the cell-associated fluorescence was analyzed with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) flow cytometer. Metabolic Labeling with [3H]Palmitate—One million RBL-2H3 cells were incubated overnight with 200 μCi/ml of [3H]palmitate (45 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in a fatty-acid free medium containing fetal calf serum dialyzed against PBS. The cells were then washed two times in PBS prior to lysis as described below. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—One or 10 × 106 cells were lysed in 200 μl or 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, and anti-proteases: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged to obtain the soluble fraction. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay from Bio-Rad. For immunoprecipitation, rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal anti-PLCγ1 or anti-FcϵRIβ chain monoclonal antibody 30.9 was incubated with Protein A/G-agarose beads (VWR, Paris, France) and with 200 μl of cell lysates on a rotating wheel for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the bound material was eluted by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. For coimmunoprecipitation, Sepharose 4B beads coupled with anti-PLSCR1 mAb 129.2 or with a control antibody were used. Western Blotting—Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were then blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 4% BSA. The blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After several washes in TBST, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs were used for a 1-h incubation at room temperature. The blots were washed, and labeling was visualized using the super signal West Pico chemoluminescence kit from Pierce followed by exposure to X-Omat Kodak films. For immunoprecipitated PLCγ1 samples, after first probing for tyrosine phosphorylation, the membranes were stripped by two 10-min incubations in 2% SDS and two 10-min incubations in 0.2 n NaOH followed by three washes in TTBS. The membranes were then reprobed with antibodies directed against PLCγ1 for loading control. For quantifications, control and PLSCR1 knocked down samples of individual experiments were resolved in the same gel and blotted on the same membrane. The bands were analyzed with the National Institutes of Health ImageJ software and were quantified relative to the PLCγ1 or to the p28 band analyzed in the corresponding lane. For analysis of individual experiments, normalization was done by setting arbitrarily the value thus obtained for the unstimulated control as “1.” For statistical analysis, a different procedure was followed. Each individual value obtained for control cells in a given experiment was arbitrarily set as “100,” and the value obtained for the corresponding point in knocked down cells in the same experiment was normalized according to it, i.e. as the percentage of the value obtained with control cells for the corresponding experimental point. This procedure allowed elimination of the intrinsic variations in “absolute” values between experiments resulting from the ImageJ analysis procedure and to analyze the paired differences between control and PLSCR1 knocked down cells. Student's t test was then used with the values thus calculated. Isolation of Lipid Raft Microdomains by Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Lipid rafts were isolated from freshly harvested cells. The procedure was adapted from that of Pombo et al. (38Pombo I. Rivera J. Blank U. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Eight million RBL-2H3 cells were plated on 15-cm dishes, and 24 h later the cells were sensitized with a 1:102 dilution of the DNP-48 monoclonal IgE ascitic fluid for an overnight incubation. The cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml DNP-HSA in Tyrode's buffer for 30 min and washed two times in ice-cold PBS followed by two washes in ice-cold TNV buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The cells were solubilized in 1 ml of ice-cold TNV containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1000 units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin and harvested by scraping. The lysate was transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and subjected to 15 strokes. The homogenate was mixed in an Ultra-clear TM centrifuge tube (Beckman) with an equal volume of 85% sucrose. This mixture was successively overlaid with 5 ml of 30% sucrose and 2 ml of 5% sucrose, neither of which contained Triton X-100. The tubes were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g without break at 4 °C, in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor for 16 h. Sequential pooled fractions 1–3 (1713 μl), 4–6 (2499 μl), 7–9 (2499 μl), and 10–12 (3000 μl) were harvested from the top of the gradient. An opaque band at the interface between the 5 and 30% layers was routinely harvested in fractions 4–6 and contained the lipid rafts. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Knocking Down of PLSCR1 Expression—The function of PLSCR1 in mast cell activation through the FcϵRI remained unclear, although its involvement was strongly suggested by its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues after FcϵRI aggregation (23Pastorelli C. Veiga J. Charles N. Voignier E. Moussu H. Monteiro R.C. Benhamou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20407-20412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we chose a siRNA approach. Three siRNA were tested for their ability to decrease PLSCR1 expression. For this screening we chose an immunoblotting procedure to follow protein expression. The siRNA2 was the most potent for silencing PLSCR1 expression (supplemental Fig. S1), whereas the other siRNA were somewhat less efficient. The sequences corresponding to siRNA2 and siRNA3 were selected to design shRNA. These sequences and a control shRNA corresponding to the scrambled sequence of siRNA3 were inserted into an expression vector that was transduced into cells with a retroviral system to allow for a stable and selectable decrease in PLSCR1 expression. By immunoblotting (Fig. 1A) the decrease in PLSCR1 expression reached over 99% in PLSCR1 shRNA-infected cells as compared with control shRNA-infected cells or to noninfected cells. This was confirmed by confocal analysis (Fig. 1B). By contrast, expression of FcϵRI was unaffected in these cells (Fig. 1C).

https://openalex.org/W2049993905,"Hypoxia induces oxidative damage in skeletal muscle. Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is the skeletal muscle enriched uncoupling protein and has previously been shown to confer resistance against oxidative stress. We show that hypoxia robustly up-regulates skeletal muscle UCP3 and that the absence of UCP3 in primary skeletal myocytes exacerbates hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species generation. In this context, we reasoned that the investigation of the regulation of UCP3 may identify novel hypoxia-responsive regulatory pathways that modulate intrinsic anti-oxidant defenses. By screening a transcription factor array of 704 full-length cDNAs in murine C2C12 myoblasts following cotransfection of a murine UCP3 promoter-luciferase construct and myoD we identified numerous candidate regulatory factors that up-regulate UCP3. Active transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) was identified, and as this transcription factor is a known component of a multiprotein hypoxia-induced regulatory complex, we explored its role in hypoxia-mediated UCP3 up-regulation. Site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identify a 10-bp region required for ATF-1 induction of UCP3 promoter activity. Hypoxia promotes the phosphorylation of ATF-1, and the knockdown of ATF-1 by shRNA prevents hypoxia-mediated up-regulation of UCP3. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAP kinase prevents both hypoxia-mediated ATF-1 phosphorylation and UCP3 up-regulation. PKA signaling does not modulate hypoxia-induced UCP3 up-regulation and neither does HIF-1alpha activation by cobalt chloride. In conclusion, ATF-1, via p38 MAP kinase activation, functions as a novel regulatory pathway driving UCP3 expression. These data reinforce the role of ATF-1 as a hypoxia-responsive trans-activator and identifies a novel regulatory program that may modulate cellular responses to oxygen-deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2165004541,"In this study, eight different HIV-1 integrase proteins containing mutations observed in strand transfer inhibitor-resistant viruses were expressed, purified, and used for detailed enzymatic analyses. All the variants examined were impaired for strand transfer activity compared with the wild type enzyme, with relative catalytic efficiencies (kp/Km) ranging from 0.6 to 50% of wild type. The origin of the reduced strand transfer efficiencies of the variant enzymes was predominantly because of poorer catalytic turnover (kp) values. However, smaller second-order effects were caused by up to 4-fold increases in Km values for target DNA utilization in some of the variants. All the variants were less efficient than the wild type enzyme in assembling on the viral long terminal repeat, as each variant required more protein than wild type to attain maximal activity. In addition, the variant integrases displayed up to 8-fold reductions in their catalytic efficiencies for 3′-processing. The Q148R variant was the most defective enzyme. The molecular basis for resistance of these enzymes was shown to be due to lower affinity binding of the strand transfer inhibitor to the integrase complex, a consequence of faster dissociation rates. In the case of the Q148R variant, the origin of reduced compound affinity lies in alterations to the active site that reduce the binding of a catalytically essential magnesium ion.

We have also examined combinations of these changes (T66I/E92Q, T66I/N155H, and V75I/M154I). Compared with the wild type (WT) enzyme, all variant enzymes were impaired with respect to assembly and multimerization into active complexes and their subsequent in vitro strand transfer abilities. Reduced susceptibility to one STI, STI 1, (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31186-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was shown to be a result of decreased affinity of the inhibitor for the integrase enzymes containing the selected mutations. In addition, isogenic viruses harboring these resistance mutations showed defects in integration in cells. Compounds—STI 1 was described previously (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y.

STI 2 is a diketo acid prepared at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Purification of HIV-1 Integrase Proteins—Wild type and variant integrase enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for biochemical analyses. The variant enzymes used in this study were T66I, V75I, E92Q, Q148R, N155H, T66I/E92Q, T66I/N155H, and V75I/M154I, reflective of their amino acid substitutions compared with the WT NL4-3 enzyme. Variant enzymes were constructed through site-specific mutagenesis of the NL4-3 wild type integrase enzyme using the QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, City). The complete sequence of the integrase enzyme was obtained to confirm the construction of each variant enzyme. HIV-1 integrases were purified as reported previously (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31186-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purities were greater than 95%, as indicated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 3′-Processing Activity of HIV Integrase—Radiolabeled double-stranded HIV LTR substrate 5′-pACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA[32P]GT and 3′-GAAAATCAGTCACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA was synthesized by a fill-in reaction of 5′-pACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA and 3′-GAAAATCAGTCACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA using Klenow DNA polymerase and [32P]dGTP and dTTP. Unlabeled carrier DNA substrate was also generated by a fill-in reaction with Klenow using unlabeled dGTP and dTTP. Initial cleavage assays were performed by titrating integrase concentrations from 100 to 800 nm, to determine the proper concentration and time course for kinetic studies. The cleavage reactions were performed by preincubating integrase variants (100–400 nm) with 5–320 nm [32P]DNA at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min. This preincubation step was performed because variable extents of reaction were observed (especially at short time periods), as noted in a previous kinetics analysis (24Smolov M. Gottikh M. Tashlitskii V. Korolev S. Demidyuk I. Brochon J.C. Mouscadet J.F. Deprez E. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 7.5 mm and incubated at 37 °C over 30 min for wild type integrase and 30–90 min for variant integrases. An equal volume of formamide stop solution (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was added, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 90 s and quick-chilled in ice water before loading onto 20% acrylamide/urea gels. After electrophoresis, gels were exposed to phosphorescent screens (GE Healthcare) and scanned in a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Under the reaction conditions used, minimal strand transfer occurred (less than 5% of the cleaved substrate). Scans were quantitated for substrate and the –2 nucleotide cleavage product with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) and exported to Microsoft Excel for calculation of reaction rates. Curve fitting was performed with GraphPad Prism version 4.03 to generate Km and maximal velocity values (Vmax). Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) for Determination of Kinetics of Strand Transfer and Binding of Radiolabeled Inhibitor—An SPA format was used to measure the strand transfer kinetics of the integrase proteins. The details of the assay have been reported previously (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31186-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, viral LTR DNA is attached, via a biotin linker, to streptavidin-coated SPA PVT beads, after which the enzyme is added to form active complexes. For kinetic studies, 33P-labeled target DNA was added, which gets integrated into the LTR DNA. The amount of integrase enzymes used to prepare each of the different complexes was determined by titrating variant enzymes onto the SPA/DNA beads and noting the minimal concentration of enzyme required to produce the maximal amount of product (saturation), using 0.92 nm 33P-labeled target DNA. An amount equal to 1.1 times this concentration was used for subsequent kinetic studies. For binding studies [3H]STI 1, rather than target DNA, was added. The extent of radioligand binding was measured on a topcount instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and affinity constants toward the wild type and variant integrase enzymes were calculated as described previously (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31186-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For compound sensitivity studies, variant enzyme concentrations were adjusted so that total product was approximately the same as that derived from using WT enzyme. The extent of integration is measured though SPA analysis, and the degree of inhibition is determined compared with non-compound containing controls. For STI 1 binding kinetics, data points were acquired every 30 s and the data fit to a one-site binding model (GraphPad Prism 4.01). Determination of kcat, kp, and Km from Strand Transfer Kinetics—Reactions were carried out in 96-well white microtiter dishes (catalog number 3600, Corning Glass) containing 40 μl of complexes. Reactions were initiated by rapid addition, with shaking, of 10 μl of 33P-labeled target DNA (final concentration 0.23–29.4 nm) in SPA buffer using dilutions of 33P-labeled target DNA (original specific activity between 0.8 to 1.9 × 106/cpm per μl at a concentration of 600 nm) mixed with unlabeled DNA to achieve the final concentrations. Incubations proceeded for various times at 24 °C and were stopped by addition of 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mm EDTA. Products were allowed to sit at 24 °C for at least 1 h prior to centrifugation at 2000 rpm or overnight without centrifugation. The reaction products were quantitated using a Topcount scintillation counter, and the counts/min readout were used to calculate molar concentrations of product. Kinetic curves (product versus time) were prepared, and the data in the linear range were used to calculate slopes for given concentrations of 33P-labeled target DNA. Slopes versus target concentrations were used to calculate Vmax and Km values by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism, version 4.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The kcat values (kcat = Vmax/integrase]) were calculated from Vmax and ¼ the concentration of integrases used to prepare the complexes (i.e. integrase was treated as a tetramer) (6Cherepanov P.

The kp values (Vmax/Eactive]) were calculated from the actual concentration of active complexes (Eactive values), which were determined experimentally. Eactive is defined as the maximal amount of product that could be formed under conditions of saturating amounts of target DNA and represents the conversion of all active complexes to product complexes, assuming a single turnover of enzyme (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol.

All data points in individual experiments were obtained in duplicate, and the kinetic constants from three independent experiments were averaged, and standard deviations were calculated. Inhibitor Sensitivity Studies—Variant and WT integrases were evaluated for STI 1 sensitivities using the SPA assay (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31186-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with minor modifications as follows. The amount of integrase used to prepare the complexes was adjusted so that approximately equal amounts of products were formed after 2 h at 37 °C; integrase complexes were not diluted with ⅓ volume of 25% DMSO prior to use (30 μl of undiluted complexes were used rather than 40 μl of diluted complexes); 5-fold serial dilutions of STI 1 (in 25% v/v DMSO/H2O) were added to integrase complexes. The inhibitor-enzyme complexes were formed by incubating the complexes at 37 °C for 10 min prior to initiating strand transfer reactions by adding 1 × 106 cpm 33P-labeled target DNA in SPA buffer (the target DNA was added at room temperature). The plates were then returned to 37 °C. After 2 h, strand transfer reactions were stopped by adding 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mm EDTA. Plates were allowed to settle for at least 2 h and then read on a Topcount instrument. PCR Analysis of Integrated and 2-LTR Viral DNA—In the DNA analysis experiments, MT-2 cells were infected with recombinant replicating viruses through spinoculation (28O'Doherty U. Swiggard W.J. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in a volume of virus corresponding to a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 TCID50/cell, and media were added to a final volume of 2 ml. The cells and virus were centrifuged at 1200 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended at 1 × 105 cells/ml. At different time points post-infection, 1 × 105 cells were removed and lysed at 65 °C in 100 μl of buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) containing 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteinase K was subsequently inactivated by heating the samples to 95 °C for 15 min, and the various forms of total, circular, and integrated viral DNA were quantified, as described below (29O'Doherty U. Swiggard W.J. Jeyakumar D. McGain D. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10942-10950Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). First, the total copy number of all the forms of HIV DNA (integrated, linear and circular) was determined using the primer/probe set (forward primer, 5′-TGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGT, reverse primer, 5′-GAGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGAGC, and probe, 5′-FAM-CAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGA-TAMRA). These primers are able to amplify a fragment present within each LTR region. NL4-3 proviral DNA of known concentration was serially diluted over a million-fold to generate a standard curve for determining the total HIV DNA copy number. Second, the amount of integrated HIV DNA was quantitated by first pre-amplifying (in a PCR) isolated genomic DNA with one primer homologous to genomic Alu sequences and a second primer homologous to an HIV Gag sequence (forward primer, GCCTCCCAAAGTGCTGGGATTACAG, and reverse primer, GCTCTCGCACCCATCTCTCTCC). Next, the Alu-Gag products were re-amplified using a real time PCR on a Taqman instrument using LTR primers (forward, GCCTCAATAAAGCTTGCCTTGA, reverse, TCCACACTGACTAAAAGGGTCTGA, and probe, 5′-FAM-GCGAGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACTCTGGTAACTAGCTCGC-BHQ-3′). These primers amplify a fragment within the LTR region. Amplified Alu-Gag amplicons were converted to DNA copy numbers by reference to a standard curve generated on the same plate using the same primers acting on serial dilutions of NL4-3 proviral DNA of known concentrations. The fractional amounts of Alu-Gag copy numbers were then obtained by dividing them by the total DNA copy numbers. The fractional ratios were then normalized to the maximal ratio = 100, to enable comparison between samples. The 2-LTR circular DNA was quantitated as described elsewhere (30Butler S.L. Johnson E.P. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3739-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, to generate the standard DNA for 2-LTR analysis, a 324-bp PCR product representing the junction of the 2-LTR circles was cloned. Standard curves for the amount of 2-LTR circles present in the virus infections were prepared based upon this DNA construct. The copy number for the circular DNA present in the proteinase K-digested cell lysates was then determined by a real time PCR amplification (forward primer, 5′-AACTAGGGAACCCACTGCTTAAG, reverse primer, 5′-TCCACAGATCAAGGATATCTTGTC, and probe, 5′-FAM-ACACTACTTGAAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTT-TAMRA). Copy numbers were then normalized using the standard curve. To compare the relative extents of integration by STI-resistant variant viruses, the relative amounts of integrated HIV DNA were first plotted as a function of time for samples harvested between 0 and 36 h post-infection. Next, the area under the curve was calculated for each variant, and the areas were normalized as a percent of WT control. The multiplicity of infection in these experiments was 0.1. In addition, 5 μm ritonavir and amprenavir were added after infection, so the assumption in the calculation is that the extent of replication represents ∼1 replication cycle. HIV Assays—MT-2 cells and 293T cells were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and propagated in MT-2 cells. MT-2 cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.55, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. The 293T cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.55, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. The proviral DNA clone of NL4-3 was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Recombinant NL-Rluc virus, in which a section of the nef gene from NL4-3 was replaced with the Renilla luciferase gene, was used as a reference virus (31Blair, W., and Spicer, T. P. (January 16, 2003) U.S. Patent Application 2003001378 A1Google Scholar). Briefly, the NL-RLuc virus was prepared by co-transfection of two plasmids, pNLRLuc, containing the NL-RLuc DNA, and pVSVenv, a plasmid containing the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope gene expressed via an LTR promoter (32Bartz S.R. Rogel M.E. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were performed at a 1:3 ratio of pNLRLuc to pVSVenv in 293T cells using Lipofectamine PLUS from Invitrogen, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The pseudotype virus was titered in MT-2 cells using luciferase enzyme activity as a marker. Luciferase was quantitated using the dual luciferase kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Antiviral activities of STI 1 toward the recombinant viruses were quantified by measuring luciferase activity in cells infected with NLRluc recombinants in the presence of the inhibitor. STIs 1 and 2 (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31186-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were prepared by the Medicinal Chemistry group at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Inhibition of Strand Transfer Activity by the Integrase Variants Correlates with STI 1 Binding—[3H]STI 1 (23Dicker I.B. Samanta H.K. Li Z. Hong Y. Tian Y. Banville J. Remillard R.R. Walker M.A. Langley D.R. Krystal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31186-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used in binding assays with the eight variant enzymes (Fig. 1, A and B). The data were fit to a simple one-site binding model. As summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 7, the variant enzymes generally had binding affinities for [3H]STI 1 which correlated with their IC50 values for inhibition of integrase activity by nonradiolabeled STI 1. For instance, the Kd for V75I is 68 ± 13 nm, whereas the IC50 for STI 1 against the enzyme is 85 nm, and the Kd for N155H is 289 ± 76 nm, whereas the IC50 for STI 1 against the enzyme is 334 nm, etc. This correlation holds for 6 of the 8 enzymes examined. However, although the Kd values for E92Q and T66I were elevated versus WT (46 and 61 versus 21 nm), the magnitude of these increased Kd values was not as large as the increases in the IC50 values for inhibition of strand transfer versus WT (145 and 183 versus 20 nm, respectively). These small differences continue to be analyzed. Overall, the binding affinity of [3H]STI 1 to the most resistant integrase enzymes was also the poorest (Q148R, N155H, and the double variants). Additionally, isogenic recombinant viruses containing these resistance substitutions were also less sensitive to inhibition by STI 1 (Table 1), and these reduced sensitivities parallel the data for both inhibition of strand transfer in vitro and for the [3H]STI 1 binding affinities. Together, the data indicate that resistance of these various enzymes to inhibition by STI 1 is directly related to the binding affinities of these variant enzymes for the inhibitor. One consequence of the reduced inhibitor sensitivities by the mutants is that inhibitor concentrations that are sufficient to abolish 90% of WT activity (a concentration of STI 1 of ∼120 nm) have little effect on the in vitro integrase activity of such highly resistant enzymes as Q148R (whose in vitro IC50 for STI 1 inhibition is ∼10-fold higher (1.1 μm)).TABLE 1Inhibition of ST and of isogenic viruses by STI 1 compared with binding constants for [3H]STI 1 toward variant integrasesIntegraseSTI 1, ST IC50Relative strand transfer IC50[3H]STI 1, KdRelative Kd[3H]STI 1, koffRelative koffRelative antiviral EC50nmnmmin-1 × 10-2WT20121 ± 51.02.5 ± 0.41.01.0V75I985.068 ± 133.2 ± 0.6NDaND means not determined.ND1.4V75I/M154I1276.5102 ± 54.9 ± 0.2NDNDNDE92Q1457.446 ± 142.0 ± 0.6NDND21N155H33317289 ± 7614 ± 431 ± 11219T66I1839.361 ± 212.9 ± 123 ± 2913T66I/N155H54128272 ± 14213 ± 7NDNDNDQ148R110055849 ± 26640 ± 1335 ± 11448T66I/E92Q125064192 ± 109.1 ± 0.5NDND>61a ND means not determined.

Examination of the off rates to the resistant integrases (Table 1, 6th column) shows that decreases in binding affinity are mainly because of increases in the off rates. The off rates of [3H]STI 1 to the Q148R, N155H, and T66I enzymes increased 14-, 12-, and 9-fold, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2060432517,"Gating of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from a C(losed) to an O(pen) conformation is the initial event in the postsynaptic signaling cascade at the vertebrate nerve-muscle junction. Studies of receptor structure and function show that many residues in this large, five-subunit membrane protein contribute to the energy difference between C and O. Of special interest are amino acids located at the two transmitter binding sites and in the narrow region of the channel, where C<-->O gating motions generate a low<-->high change in the affinity for agonists and in the ionic conductance, respectively. We have measured the energy changes and relative timing of gating movements for residues that lie between these two locations, in the C-terminus of the pore-lining M2 helix of the alpha subunit ('alphaM2-cap'). This region contains a binding site for non-competitive inhibitors and a charged ring that influences the conductance of the open pore. alphaM2-cap mutations have large effects on gating but much smaller effects on agonist binding, channel conductance, channel block and desensitization. Three alphaM2-cap residues (alphaI260, alphaP265 and alphaS268) appear to move at the outset of channel-opening, about at the same time as those at the transmitter binding site. The results suggest that the alphaM2-cap changes its secondary structure to link gating motions in the extracellular domain with those in the channel that regulate ionic conductance."
https://openalex.org/W1974604735,"Studies of the biochemistry of Listeria monocytogenes virulence protein ActA have typically focused on the behavior of bacteria in complex systems or on the characterization of the protein after expression and purification. Although prior in vivo work has proposed that ActA forms dimers on the surface of L. monocytogenes, dimerization has not been demonstrated in vitro, and little consideration has been given to the surface environment where ActA performs its pivotal role in bacterial actin-based motility. We have synthesized and characterized an ActA dimer and provide evidence that the two ActA molecules do not interact with each other even when tethered together. However, we also demonstrate that artificial dimers provide superior activation of actin nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex compared with monomers and that increased activation of the Arp2/3 complex by dimers may be a general property of Arp2/3 activators. It appears that the close packing ( approximately 19 nm) of ActA molecules on the surface of L. monocytogenes is so dense that the kinetics of actin nucleation mimic that of synthetic ActA dimers. We also present observations indicating that ActA is a natively unfolded protein, largely random coil that is responsible for many of the unique physical properties of ActA including its extended structure, aberrant mobility during SDS-PAGE, and ability to resist irreversible denaturation upon heating."
https://openalex.org/W2086614777,"Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) coordinates various receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Although skeletal muscle differentiation is regulated by some growth factors, it remains elusive whether Gab1 coordinates myogenic signals. Here, we examined the molecular mechanism of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-mediated myogenic differentiation, focusing on Gab1 and its downstream signaling. Gab1 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent complex formation with protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 upon IGF-I stimulation in C2C12 myoblasts. On the other hand, Gab1 constitutively associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85. To delineate the role of Gab1 in IGF-I-dependent signaling, we examined the effect of adenovirus-mediated forced expression of wild-type Gab1 (Gab1WT), mutated Gab1 that is unable to bind SHP2 (Gab1ΔSHP2), or mutated Gab1 that is unable to bind p85 (Gab1Δp85), on the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. IGF-I-induced myogenic differentiation was enhanced in myoblasts overexpressing Gab1ΔSHP2, but inhibited in those overexpressing either Gab1WT or Gab1Δp85. Conversely, IGF-I-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation was significantly repressed in myoblasts overexpressing Gab1ΔSHP2 but enhanced in those overexpressing either Gab1WT or Gab1Δp85. Furthermore, small interference RNA-mediated Gab1 knockdown enhanced myogenic differentiation. Overexpression of catalytic-inactive SHP2 modulated IGF-I-induced myogenic differentiation and ERK1/2 activation similarly to that of Gab1ΔSHP2, suggesting that Gab1-SHP2 complex inhibits IGF-I-dependent myogenesis through ERK1/2. Consistently, the blockade of ERK1/2 pathway reversed the inhibitory effect of Gab1WT overexpression on myogenic differentiation, and constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway suppressed the enhanced myogenic differentiation by overexpression of Gab1ΔSHP2. Collectively, these data suggest that the Gab1-SHP2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway comprises an inhibitory axis for IGF-I-dependent myogenic differentiation. Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) coordinates various receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Although skeletal muscle differentiation is regulated by some growth factors, it remains elusive whether Gab1 coordinates myogenic signals.

Overexpression of catalytic-inactive SHP2 modulated IGF-I-induced myogenic differentiation and ERK1/2 activation similarly to that of Gab1ΔSHP2, suggesting that Gab1-SHP2 complex inhibits IGF-I-dependent myogenesis through ERK1/2. Consistently, the blockade of ERK1/2 pathway reversed the inhibitory effect of Gab1WT overexpression on myogenic differentiation, and constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway suppressed the enhanced myogenic differentiation by overexpression of Gab1ΔSHP2. Collectively, these data suggest that the Gab1-SHP2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway comprises an inhibitory axis for IGF-I-dependent myogenic differentiation. Skeletal muscle differentiation is a multistep process in which multipotent mesodermal cells give rise to myoblasts that subsequently withdraw from the cell cycle and differentiate into multinucleated myotubes. Most skeletal muscle cell lines from rodents proliferate in high serum conditions containing various mitogens, and post-confluent cells spontaneously differentiate after several days in low serum conditions (1Bach L.A.

Furthermore, Gab1KO mice displayed reduced and delayed migration of muscle progenitor cells into the limbs and diaphragm, resulting in the immature formation of limb muscles. These data suggest that Gab1 might have a key role in skeletal muscle development (32Sachs M. Brohmann H. Zechner D. Muller T. Hulsken J. Walther I. Schaeper U. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. J.

In addition, liver-specific Gab1 knock-out mice displayed enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity with reduced glycemia and improved glucose tolerance as a result of insufficient insulin-elicited activation of ERK1/2 (34Bard-Chapeau E.A.

However, it remains elusive whether Gab1 has a specific role in skeletal muscle differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that Gab1-SHP2 interaction exerts an inhibitory effect on IGF-I-induced myogenic differentiation via activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Anti-phospho-p44/42 ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-phospho-AKT (Thr-308), anti-ERK1/2, and anti-AKT antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.

The antibodies against the following molecules used for immunoblotting, Gab1, Gab2, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and p85 PI3K were from Millipore; PY99, SHP2, MEK1, and myogenin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) monoclonal antibody (MF20) was purchased from the Developmental Hybridoma Bank (Dr. D. A. Fischman, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from GE Health Science. U0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Serum and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Human recombinant IGF-I was kindly provided by Astellas Pharmaceuticals.Adenovirus Vector Construction—The generation of adenovirus vectors expressing human Gab1WT and Gab1ΔSHP2 (mutated on the two tyrosine residues responsible for binding with SHP2) were described previously (22Nakaoka Y. Nishida K. Fujio Y. Izumi M. Terai K. Oshima Y. Sugiyama S. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Hirano T. Kawase I. Hirota H. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we constructed the adenovirus vectors expressing Gab1Δp85, which can't bind with p85 due to the substitution of tyrosine residues 447, 472, and 589 of human Gab1, corresponding to the YXXM motifs, to phenylalanines by PCR-based mutagenesis described previously (35Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1546-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Substitution of these tyrosine residues by phenylalanine renders the molecule incapable of binding with p85. We also constructed adenovirus vectors expressing wild-type SHP2 (SHP2WT) and phosphatase-inactive SHP2 (SHP2C/S) using the plasmid vectors described previously (15Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M.

For adenovirus production, the sequence encoding Gab1Δp85, SHP2WT, or SHP2C/S was subcloned into the shuttle plasmid pACCMVpLpA. Recombinant adenoviruses were then obtained according to the homologous recombination system described elsewhere (36Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B.

The construction of adenovirus vector expressing human Gab2ΔSHP2, which can't bind with SHP2, is described in the supplemental data.Cell Culture, Stimulation, and Adenoviral Infection—C2C12 murine myoblast cells were maintained as subconfluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 0.58 g/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Before stimulation, cells were serum-starved overnight. Stimulations were performed using 80 ng/ml IGF-I for 10 min, unless otherwise indicated. For adenoviral infection of C2C12 myoblasts, subconfluent cells were cultured in DMEM with 20% FBS at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 24 h. In the dual infection of adenovirus vectors, C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM with 20% FBS with each virus at a multiplicity of infection of 30. Then, the myoblasts were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with or without IGF-I for the experiments examining ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. Infection efficiency, determined by lacZ gene expression in cultured myoblasts, is consistently >90% with this method. Adenovirus vector expressing β-galactosidase (β-gal) was used as a control. For the induction of myogenic differentiation, cultured medium was switched from DMEM containing 20% FBS to DMEM containing 2% horse serum (HS) or 80 ng/ml IGF-I, when cell density reached confluency. The differentiation medium containing 2% HS was exchanged every other day, and that containing IGF-I was exchanged every day.Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting—Cells were scraped off in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were collected form confluent 6-cm dishes and precleared by 15,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min. For immunoprecipitation, the cleared lysates of 500 μl containing 1 mg of protein, were rotationally incubated with 1 μl of anti-Gab1 antiserum, or 1.2 μg of SHP2 antibody, or 5 μl of p85 antibody, or 10 μl of IRS-1 antibody and with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer without protease inhibitor mixture, and boiled in standard electrophoresis sample buffer. All the proteins immunoprecipitated were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using a standard procedure. Blots were developed using ECL system (GE Healthcare). For direct immunoblotting analyses, the crude cell lysates were collected from 3.5-cm dishes and subjected to 15,000 × g centrifugation. The precleared lysates containing 30 μg of protein were loaded in each lane for immunoblotting.Immunocytochemistry—Cells cultured on 3.5-cm collagen type I-coated plastic dishes (Iwaki Asahi Glass Co.) were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated with anti-MHC antibody (MF20), followed by incubation with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were post-stained with Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. siRNA-mediated Protein Knockdown—Stealth Select small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted to murine Gab1 (#1, MSS204497; #2, MSS204499) and siRNA duplex with irrelevant sequences (Stealth™ RNAi negative control) as a control were purchased from Invitrogen. Stealth siRNAs targeted to murine SHP2 were purchased from Invitrogen. and the detailed sequences are described in the supplemental data. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with 10 nm siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions for reverse transfection. Briefly, C2C12 myoblasts (1.5 × 105 cells per each dish) were diluted in 860 μl of DMEM containing 20% FBS and plated on 3.5-cm collagen type I-coated plastic dishes. To each dish, 140 μl of RNAi duplex-Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX complex diluted in Opti-MEM I medium was added. After incubation for 72 h, the cells were used for the experiments.Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences among multiple groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc comparison tested with Scheffe's method. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSGab1 Undergoes Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Subsequently Associates with SHP2 upon IGF-I Stimulation in C2C12 Myoblasts—We examined the effect of IGF-I on tyrosine-phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules in C2C12 myoblasts. IGF-I indeed induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and subsequent association of Gab1 with SHP2 in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1A, left panel). Furthermore, SHP2 was also tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Gab1 after stimulation with IGF-I (Fig. 1A, right panel). On the other hand, Gab1 constitutively associated with p85 both before and after IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 1A, left panel). In the IGF-I-dependent signaling pathway, IRS-1 has been reported to be a major binding partner of p85 and essential for IGF-I-dependent PI3K-AKT signaling in skeletal muscle cells (38Sarbassov D.D. Peterson C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistently, IRS-1 underwent strong tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation with IGF-I in C2C12 myoblasts. In clear contrast to Gab1, IRS-1 associated with p85 in a manner dependent on IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 1B). In addition, we could not detect the complex formation of IRS-1 with SHP2 either before or after stimulation with IGF-I (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that IGF-I induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, leading to complex formation of Gab1 with SHP2 in C2C12 myoblasts.IGF-I-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Gab1 and Association of Gab1 with SH2 Domain-containing Molecules in the C2C12 Myoblasts Infected with Adenovirus Vectors—IGFs have been reported to stimulate both proliferation and differentiation of cultured skeletal muscle cells (3Coolican S.A.

Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of IGF-I on the proliferation of myoblasts has been reported to be attributed mainly to ERK1/2 pathway (3Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In the present study, we tried to reveal the role of Gab1 in IGF-I-dependent differentiation from myoblasts into myotubes. To discern the role of Gab1-SHP2 interaction from that of Gab1-p85 interaction in IGF-I-dependent differentiation, we used recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying β-gal (control), Gab1WT, or Gab1ΔSHP2 as described previously (22Nakaoka Y. Nishida K. Fujio Y. Izumi M. Terai K. Oshima Y. Sugiyama S. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Hirano T. Kawase I. Hirota H. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and created an adenovirus vector overexpressing Gab1Δp85. We examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 upon stimulation with IGF-I in myoblasts overexpressing β-gal, Gab1WT, Gab1ΔSHP2, or Gab1Δp85. As shown in Fig. 2A, tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and the amount of co-immunoprecipitated SHP2 with Gab1 were increased after stimulation with IGF-I in control myoblasts expressing β-gal. On the other hand, tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 in the myoblasts overexpressing Gab1WT, Gab1ΔSHP2, or Gab1Δp85 increased much more at baseline compared with in those overexpressing β-gal. In these cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 decreased after stimulation with IGF-I. The IGF-I-induced association of Gab1 with SHP2 increased in the C2C12 myoblasts overexpressing Gab1WT, or Gab1Δp85 compared with those overexpressing β-gal, but was almost abrogated in those overexpressing Gab1ΔSHP2 (Fig. 2A). The co-immunoprecipitation of Gab1 with p85 was increased in cells expressing Gab1WT or Gab1ΔSHP2 compared with those expressing β-gal, but was almost abrogated in those expressing Gab1Δp85 at the baseline. The association of Gab1 with p85 decreased in response to IGF-I in the cells overexpressing Gab1WT or Gab1ΔSHP2 (Fig. 2A). We observed much more dissociation of p85 from Gab1 in myoblasts overexpressing Gab1WT compared with those overexpressing Gab1ΔSHP2, which might be attributed to the increased activation of SHP2. Presumably, SHP2 dephosphorylates the tyrosine residues for p85 binding site of Gab1 consistent with the previous report on EGF-dependent signaling (39Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G.

These data demonstrate that overexpression of Gab1ΔSHP2 or Gab1Δp85 sufficiently suppresses the association of Gab1 with SHP2 or p85, respectively.FIGURE 2Overexpression of Gab1ΔSHP2 or Gab1Δp85 specifically perturbs the IGF-I-dependent molecular association of Gab1 with SHP2 or p85, respectively. C2C12 myoblasts were infected with adenovirus vectors expressing β-gal, Gab1WT, Gab1ΔSHP2, or Gab1Δp85. Serum-starved C2C12 cells were stimulated with vehicle (-) or IGF-I for 10 min, and cell lysates of 500 μl were collected from 6-cm dishes. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Gab1 serum (A) or with anti-IRS-1 antibody (B), followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99). A, blots were reprobed with anti-Gab1, anti-p85, and anti-SHP2 antibodies. B, blots were reprobed with anti-IRS-1, anti-p85, and anti-SHP2 antibodies. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2051180813,"Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1) and T cell factor (TCF-1) are downstream effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway and are involved in the regulation of T cell development in the thymus. LEF-1 and TCF-1 are also expressed in mature peripheral primary T cells, but their expression is down-regulated following T cell activation. Although the decisive roles of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in the early stages of T cell development are well documented, the functions of these factors in mature peripheral T cells are largely unknown. Recently, LEF-1 was shown to suppress Th2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), -5, and -13 expression from the developing Th2 cells that overexpress LEF-1 through retrovirus gene transduction. In this study, we further investigated the expression and functions of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in peripheral CD4+ T cells and revealed that LEF-1 is dominantly expressed in Th1 but not in Th2 cells. We identified a high affinity LEF-1-binding site in the negative regulatory element of the IL-4 promoter. Knockdown LEF-1 expression by LEF-1-specific small interfering RNA resulted in an increase in the IL-4 mRNA expression. This study further confirms a negative regulatory role of LEF-1 in mature peripheral T cells. Furthermore, we found that IL-4 stimulation possesses a negative effect on the expressions of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in primary T cells, suggesting a positive feedback effect of IL-4 on IL4 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2052668598,"CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) can recognize and kill target cells expressing only a few cognate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-peptide complexes. This high sensitivity requires efficient scanning of a vast number of highly diverse MHC I-peptide complexes by the T cell receptor in the contact site of transient conjugates formed mainly by nonspecific interactions of ICAM-1 and LFA-1. Tracking of single H-2K(d) molecules loaded with fluorescent peptides on target cells and nascent conjugates with CTL showed dynamic transitions between states of free diffusion and immobility. The immobilizations were explained by association of MHC I-peptide complexes with ICAM-1 and strongly increased their local concentration in cell adhesion sites and hence their scanning by T cell receptor. In nascent immunological synapses cognate complexes became immobile, whereas noncognate ones diffused out again. Interfering with this mobility modulation-based concentration and sorting of MHC I-peptide complexes strongly impaired the sensitivity of antigen recognition by CTL, demonstrating that it constitutes a new basic aspect of antigen presentation by MHC I molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2082607059,"Chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori is the strongest known risk factor for peptic ulceration and distal gastric cancer, and adherence of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cells is critical for induction of inflammation. One H. pylori constituent that increases disease risk is the cag pathogenicity island, which encodes a secretion system that translocates bacterial effector molecules into host cells. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a cellular receptor for H. pylori and a mediator of the inflammatory response to this pathogen. H. pylori induces DAF expression in human gastric epithelial cells; therefore, we sought to define the mechanism by which H. pylori up-regulates DAF and to extend these findings into a murine model of H. pylori-induced injury. Co-culture of MKN28 gastric epithelial cells with the wild-type H. pylori cag(+) strain J166 induced transcriptional expression of DAF, which was attenuated by disruption of a structural component of the cag secretion system (cagE). H. pylori-induced expression of DAF was dependent upon activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but not NF-kappaB. Hypergastrinemic INS-GAS mice infected with wild-type H. pylori demonstrated significantly increased DAF expression in gastric epithelium versus uninfected controls or mice infected with an H. pylori cagE(-) isogenic mutant strain. These results indicate that H. pylori cag(+) strains induce up-regulation of a cognate cellular receptor in vitro and in vivo in a cag-dependent manner, representing the first evidence of regulation of an H. pylori host receptor by the cag pathogenicity island."

In the mammalian kidney, TonEBP is a central regulator of water homeostasis. Animals deficient in TonEBP suffer from life-threatening dehydration due to renal water loss. Ambient tonicity (effective osmolality) is the prominent signal for TonEBP in a bidirectional manner; TonEBP activity decreases in hypotonicity, whereas it increases in hypertonicity. Here we found that TonEBP displayed nuclear export in response to hypotonicity and nuclear import in response to hypertonicity. The nuclear export of TonEBP was not mediated by the nuclear export receptor CRM1 or discrete nuclear export signal. In contrast, a dominant nuclear localization signal (NLS) was found in a small region of 16 amino acid residues. When short peptides containing the NLS were fused to constitutively cytoplasmic proteins, the fusion proteins displayed tonicity-dependent nucleocytoplasmic trafficking like TonEBP. Thus, tonicity-dependent activation of the NLS is crucial in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of TonEBP.

TonEBP (tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein), also known as NFAT5 (nuclear factor of activated T cell 5), is a member of the Rel family of transcriptional activators (1Miyakawa H. Woo S.K.

TonEBP is most extensively characterized in the renal medulla, which is the only tissue in the body that is extremely hyperosmotic, routinely reaching over 1,000 mosmol/kg in humans and 3,000 mosomol/kg in rodents. The hyperosmolality is essential for the ability of the kidney to produce concentrated urine, a key function of the kidney for maintenance of body fluid volume and blood pressure. TonEBP is a major regulator in the renal concentration of urine via transcriptional stimulation of the aquaporine 2 water channel (7Hasler U. Jeon U.S. Kim J.A. Mordasini D Kwon H.M. Feraille E.

TonEBP is also essential in the cellular protection from the deleterious effects of hyperosmolality in the renal medulla via promoting the cellular accumulation of organic osmolytes and the expression of HSP70 (9Jeon U.S. Kim J.A. Sheen M.R. Kwon H.M. Acta Physiol. 2006; 187: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Genetically modified mice with TonEBP deficiency in the renal medulla suffer from severe atrophy of the renal medulla because of failure to adapt to the hyperosmolality and life-threatening hydropenia due to excessive renal water loss (10Lam A.K.M.

Acta Physiol. 2006; 187: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The stimulation of TonEBP is associated with enhancement in the nuclear localization (13Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C248-C253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transactivation (14Lee S.D. Colla E. Sheen M.R. Na K.Y. Kwon H.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 278: F1006-F1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying the stimulation of TonEBP has been elusive. For example, the role of phosphorylation is poorly understood, since sites of phosphorylation are not defined, and protein kinases involved are not definitively identified despite extensive studies over the years (9Jeon U.S. Kim J.A. Sheen M.R. Kwon H.M. Acta Physiol. 2006; 187: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Changes in the nucleocytoplasmic localization represent a major mode of TonEBP regulation in the kidney and the brain. TonEBP in the renal medulla shifts to the cytoplasm in response to water diuresis, whereas it shifts to the nucleus in response to antidiuresis (15Cha J.H. Woo S.K. Han K.H. Kim Y.H. Handler J.S. Kim J. Kwon H.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic shift of TonEBP is observed in the renal medullae of animals suffering from hypokalemia (16Jeon U.S. Han K-H. Park S.H. Lee S.D. Sheen M.R. Jung J.-Y. Kim W.Y. Sands J.M. Kwon H.M. Am. J.

These reports suggested that a reduction in the tonicity of the renal medullary interstitium signaled for the cytoplasmic shift of TonEBP. Similar mechanism appears to be present in the neurons. In the brain, TonEBP is exclusively localized in neurons, and the abundance of nuclear TonEBP increases in 45 min in response to systemic hypernatremia (18Loyher M.L. Mutin M. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M.

Tappaz M Neuroscience. 2006; 137: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The rapid increase in the nuclear TonEBP suggests that nuclear trafficking of preexisting TonEBP takes place in the brain.The nucleocytoplasmic localization of TonEBP has been studied in cultured cells. Earlier studies demonstrated the bidirectional nature: cytoplasmic shift in hypotonicity and nuclear shift in hypertonicity (12Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J.

In this study, however, we find no evidence for the CRM1-dependent NES in TonEBP. Instead, we find that the tonicity-dependent activation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) is critical for the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic localization of TonEBP.MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA Constructs—All constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Hemagglutinin-tagged NFATc1 expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Steffan Ho (University of California, San Diego). A cDNA encoding the c-form of human TonEBP mRNA (21Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was cloned into a mammalian expression vector pCMV-Tag2 or pCMV-Tag3 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), which allows expression of TonEBP fused with FLAG, Myc, or green fluorescent protein (GFP) epitope, respectively. Site-directed mutants were made using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). TonEBP cDNA fragments Yc1 (amino acids 1–548) and Yc2 (amino acids 1–76 fused to amino acids 406–876) were generated by PCR and cloned into pCMV-Tag3 vector. DNA fragments containing the NLS of SV40 and the NLS of TonEBP (amino acids 181–234 and 194–209) were inserted into Yc2 as shown in Fig. 8A. A trimer of GFP (3GFP) was generated by cloning two tandem copies of GFP open reading frame into the pEGFP-C2 vector. A DNA fragment encoding Myc-SV40NLS or Myc-NLS was generated by PCR and cloned into the 3GFP vector to produce 3GFP-SV40NLS or 3GFP-NLS, respectively. The NES reporter construct pRev(1.4)-GFP and its positive control construct pRev(NES)-GFP (22Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Beric Henderson (University of Sydney, Australia). TonEBP-(194–209) and its mutant (R199A/K200A) were cloned in pRev(1.4)-GFP to test their NES activity.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 2 μg of plasmid DNA in 150 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was mixed with 12 μl of Lipofectamine2000 dissolved in 150 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min. The mixture was added to a 1.5 ml of trypsinized cell suspension in antibiotic-free culture medium, mixed, seeded in a well of a 6-well cluster, and cultured for a day.Immunoblot Analysis—To prepare cell extract, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) at 4 °C. After being cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g, the extracts were separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with a 30-min incubation in 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature. The membrane was incubated for 60 min with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-TonEBP antibody (1Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-Myc antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA), or anti-GFP antibody (BD Biosciences) in the blocking solution at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated the same way with a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). An enhanced chemiluminescence assay was performed to visualize horseradish peroxidase using a commercial kit.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 5 μg of RNA was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was hybridized overnight with 32P-labeled aldose reductase (AR) (GenBank™ accession number J05474), canine SMIT (M85068), or human HSP70 cDNA (M11717). After washing under stringent conditions (65 °C in 75 mm NaCl and 7.5 mm sodium citrate with 0.1% SDS), radioactivity was visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with various conditions indicated. Cells were fixed for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde (Eastman Kodak Co.) in PBS. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 20 min. The coverslips were incubated for 60 min with a 1:400 dilution of anti-TonEBP or anti-FLAG antibody or a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-Myc or anti-hemagglutinin antibody in blocking solution at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min with a 1:1,000 dilution of Alexafluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After three washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted using the ProLong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). A Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope and Spot RT digital camera were used to observe and collect images.Separation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractions—COS7 cells cultured in a 100-mm dish were cooled on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were separated using a commercial kit (NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents; Pierce), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The fractions were immunoblotted using antibodies for Brg-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and aldose reductase (16Jeon U.S. Han K-H. Park S.H. Lee S.D. Sheen M.R. Jung J.-Y. Kim W.Y. Sands J.M. Kwon H.M. Am. J.

The cell extract (5 μg of protein; see “Immunoblot Analysis”) was incubated for 10 min with 1 μg of poly(dA·dT) in 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. After the addition of 20 fmol of 32P-labeled human TonE, the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was electrophoresed for 2.5 h on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA at 150 V. Radioactivity of the TonEBP bands was visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager.RESULTSNuclear Import and Export of TonEBP in COS7 Cells—The goal of this study was to understand molecular basis for the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of TonEBP in response to changes in ambient tonicity. We decided to use COS7 cells for this, because we found that COS7 cells, like many other cell lines, had functional TonEBP that was stimulated by ambient hypertonicity. When COS7 cells were switched to hypertonic medium, nuclear localization of TonEBP increased in 30 min, whereas the abundance of TonEBP increased gradually after 2 h (data not shown), as previously reported in Madin Darby canine kidney cells (12Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F1006-F1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C248-C253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These changes stimulated TonEBP as demonstrated by increased expression of TonEBP target genes, such as the sodium/myoinositol cotransporter, aldose reductase, and HSP70 (data not shown).In isotonic conditions, TonEBP was clearly localized in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Fig. 1A), as reported earlier (12Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F1006-F1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C248-C253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that TonEBP distribution was the same at 335 and 300 mosmol/kg (data not shown). Fig. 2A shows comparable distribution at 270 versus 335 mosmol/kg. TonEBP distribution shifted to predominantly cytoplasmic when the cells were switched to hypotonicity. The cytoplasmic shift was dose-dependent (Fig. 1A) and completed in 30 min at the ambient tonicity of 135 mosmol/kg (Fig. 1B). Since the abundance of TonEBP did not change in this time frame (Fig. 1C), the cytoplasmic shift was due to movement of TonEBP out of the nucleus (i.e. nuclear export).FIGURE 1Nuclear export of TonEBP in response to hypotonicity. A, dose dependence. COS7 cells grown on glass coverslips were switched for 30 min to hypotonic media of 210 to 135 mosmol/kg, made by deleting appropriate amounts of NaCl, or kept in isotonic medium (335 mosmol/kg), as indicated. TonEBP was visualized by immunofluorescence. B, time course. Cells were switched to hypotonic medium (135 mosmol/kg) for up to 60 min, as indicated, and TonEBP was visualized as above. C, cells grown on plastic dishes were switched to hypotonic medium for up to 120 min, as indicated, and immunoblotted (IB) for TonEBP and HSC70.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2Nuclear import of TonEBP in response to hypertonicity. A, dose response. COS7 cells had been incubated for 30 min in hypotonic medium (135 mosmol/kg) before the medium osmolality was increased up to 335 mosmol/kg, as indicated by the addition of NaCl. After 30 min, TonEBP was visualized by immunofluorescence. B, time course. Cells had been incubated for 30 min in hypotonic medium before they were switched to isotonic medium for 5, 15, or 30 min. C, cells grown on plastic dishes were treated as in B except that they were switched to isotonic medium for up to 120 min. TonEBP and HSC70 were detected by immunoblotting (IB).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The maximum cytoplasmic localization of TonEBP at 135 mosmol/kg of ambient osmolality provided an ideal start point to examine the nuclear shift of TonEBP. When the medium tonicity was raised to isotonicity, the TonEBP distribution shifted into the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The nuclear shift was completed in 30 min (Fig. 2B) without changes in the TonEBP abundance (Fig. 2C), indicating that it was due to movement into the nucleus (i.e. nuclear import). Taken together, the data in Figs. 1 and 2 define the bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic trafficking in terms of dose response and time course.NLS in TonEBP Is Monopartite and Dominant—We found that overexpressed TonEBP in fusion with GFP showed mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in isotonic conditions (Fig. 3D) much like the endogenous TonEBP (see above). The GFP-TonEBP became predominantly nuclear in response to hypertonicity, whereas it became predominantly cytoplasmic in response to hypotonicity (Fig. 3D). The same results were obtained when TonEBP was fused to FLAG (see Fig. 7) or Myc epitope (data not shown). Immunoblot analyses of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions confirmed that the transfected and overexpressed TonEBP behaved like endogenous TonEBP; ∼30% of TonEBP was in the nucleus at 135 mosmol/kg compared with ∼60% at 500 mosmol/kg (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that transfected TonEBP molecules exhibit the normal, tonicity-dependent nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Doubling of TonEBP nuclear distribution from ∼30 to ∼60% is seen as predominantly cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear in immunofluorescence analysis.FIGURE 3NLS of TonEBP is monopartite.

The cells were treated for 3 h with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) and cycloheximide (15 μg/ml). Half of the cells were then switched to hypotonic medium (135 msomol/kg; Hypo) for 1 h or kept in isotonic medium (Iso) before fixation. In those cells transfected with Rev(NES)-GFP, the green fluorescence was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm. In other cells, the green fluorescence was concentrated in the nucleoli.

COS7 cells were transfected without DNA (mock) or with expression vector for TonEBP-GFP or R199A/R200A-GFP and then incubated for 60 min in hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic medium as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear fraction (N) were obtained from each condition and loaded at a 1:1 ratio for immunoblot analysis of TonEBP (mock-transfected samples) and GFP. In each condition, Brg-1 and aldose reductase (AR) were also immunoblotted to monitor separation of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic fractions. Intensity of TonEBP or GFP signal was quantified and expressed as percentage in the nucleus: 100 × (intensity in N)/(intensity in C + intensity in N) (mean ± S.D., n = 5 or 6). In TonEBP or TonEBP-GFP, all three values are different from each other (p < 0.01, Student’s t test), whereas there are no statistical differences in R199A/K200A-GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to delineate amino acid sequence elements involved in the nuclear import, we constructed and examined numerous mutant TonEBP molecules generated by serial deletions and truncations. From these studies, we found that the amino acids 199–215 (sequence shown in Fig. 3A) were required for the nuclear localization; mutant TonEBP molecules lacking these amino acids were constitutively cytoplasmic even in hypertonic conditions (data not shown). We noticed that there were two stretches of arginines and lysines in this region, as seen in many classical NLS sequences (23Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We tested these residues by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3A). Mutations of R199A/K200A or R202A/K203A/R204A led to constitutively cytoplasmic distribution, whereas K213A/R214A/R215A did not affect the trafficking (Fig. 3, C and D). Immunoblot analyses of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions showed that less than 30% of R199A/K200A distributed in the nucleus regardless of ambient tonicity, confirming the analysis shown in Fig. 3. These data provide further characterization of previously recognized NLS (20Tong E.H.Y. Guo J.-J. Huang A.-L. Liu H. Hu C.-D. Chung S.S.M. Ko B.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by showing that 199RKSRKR204 is the core of NLS in the context of the full TonEBP molecule. The aggregation of arginines and lysines in a short span conforms to the monopartite form of classical NLS (23Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). This NLS is dominant in that its mutations almost completely abolish the nuclear localization even in hypertonic conditions.Nuclear Export of TonEBP Is Independent of CRM1 or Discrete NES—A recent report suggested that the nuclear export receptor CRM1 regulated the nuclear export of TonEBP via specific interaction with a leucine-rich NES-like motif at the N terminus (20Tong E.H.Y. Guo J.-J. Huang A.-L. Liu H. Hu C.-D. Chung S.S.M. Ko B.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since this was based on the behavior of an N-terminal truncated form of TonEBP, we reexamined this issue using two approaches. First, the role of CRM1 was examined using a specific inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB). In COS7 cells, LMB inhibited nuclear export of transfected NFATc1 in response to decreased cell calcium concentrations (Fig. 5B), as reported earlier (24Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the nuclear export of endogenous TonEBP was not affected by LMB (Fig. 5A), disputing the role of CRM1. Second, we examined the N-terminal leucinerich motif named pnes1 (pseudo-NES; 8LLSADLDL15) in the context of full-length TonEBP. For this, we made a couple of GFP-TonEBP fusion constructs where pnes1 was either deleted (TonEBP-a; this is the a-form of the TonEBP splice variant) (21Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or mutated in the critical leucine residues (mpnes1), as depicted in Fig. 6A. These constructs did not display increased nuclear localization; instead, they displayed increased cytoplasmic distribution in isotonic conditions compared with wild type TonEBP. These data do not support the view that pnes1 is a functional NES or CRM1 is involved in the nuclear export of TonEBP.FIGURE 5Nuclear export of TonEBP is insensitive to LMB. A, COS7 cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with vehicle or 10 ng/ml LMB for 30 min and then switched to hypotonic medium or kept in isotonic medium for another 30 min as indicated. TonEBP was visualized by immunofluorescence. B, COS7 cells transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged NFATc1 were seeded on glass coverslips. The cells were treated with 10 ng/ml ionomycin for 30 min in the absence or presence of LMB. They were then switched to medium without ionomycin for 30 min, follow"

The exact mechanisms responsible for preventing the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines including interferon (IFN)-γ are not fully understood, however. In this study, we examined the role of a recently described Ras GTPase effector and repressor of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade called impedes mitogenic signal propagation (Imp) in limiting the induction of T-cell cytokines. We found that stimulation of the T cell receptor complex leads to the rapid development of a physical association between Ras and Imp. Consistent with the hypothesis that Imp inhibits signal transduction, we also found that disengagement of this molecule by the RasV12G37 effector loop mutant or RNA interference markedly enhances the activation of the NFAT transcription factor and IFN-γ secretion. A strong output of IFN-γ is responsible for the distinct lymphocyte traffic pattern observed in vivo because the transgenic or retroviral expression of RasV12G37 caused T cells to accumulate preferentially in the lymph nodes and delayed their escape from the lymphoid tissue, respectively. Together, our results describe a hitherto unrecognized negative regulatory role for Imp in the production of IFN-γ in T cells and point to Ras-Imp binding as an attractive target for therapeutic interventions in conditions involving the production of this inflammatory cytokine.

The observation that a relative lack of Ras/ERK signal is associated with inability of T cells to respond to an antigen further underscores the fundamental role of this signaling pathway in T cell stimulation (15Fields P.E.

It is not surprising to find therefore that T cells and other cell types have developed inhibitors to control the magnitude and duration of the ERK signaling. Among the most prominent endogenous repressors of the Ras/ERK signaling are GTPase-activating proteins (18Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

Imp, also known as BRCA1-associated protein (BRAP2), was originally identified as a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that recognizes the nuclear localization signals of BRCA1, SV40 large T antigen, and myosin (29Li S. Ku C.-Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.-S. Chen C.-F. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that BRAP2 masks nuclear localization signal motifs causing the mislocalization of specific nuclear proteins and thus serving as a cytoplasmic retention protein (29Li S. Ku C.-Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.-S. Chen C.-F. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 30Asada M. Ohmi K. Delia D. Enosawa S. Suzuki S. Yuo A. Suzuki H. Mizutani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8236-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, White and collaborators (28Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Imp can also disrupt the Ras/ERK pathway possibly by uncoupling Raf kinase from MEK through the inactivation of a scaffolding protein of the Ras pathway called the kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR). The exact mechanism of this inhibition of KSR function is unknown, however. Importantly, Imp is regulated by activated Ras. Specifically, binding of GTP-loaded Ras to a region encompassing the ubiquitin-protease-like zinc finger (UJBP-ZnF) domain of Imp/BRAP targets this molecule for ubiquitination and possible degradation by the proteasome. In summary, activated Ras relays a signal to the Erk cascade in two ways: (i) by recruiting Raf kinase to the plasma membrane and (ii) by relieving Imp-mediated inhibition of KSR-dependent formation of the Raf-MEK complex. It is unknown whether Imp, by providing an additional layer of resistance to the Erk pathway prevents the unnecessary activation of T cells. However, the amplitude and kinetics of ERK activation have been associated with different outcomes for T cells including survival or apoptosis in “young” T cells in the thymus (31Daniels M.A. Teixeiro E. Gill J. Hausmann B. Roubaty D. Holmberg K. Werlen G. Holländer G.A. Gascoigne N.R.J. Palmer E. Nature. 2006; 444: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and the generation of helper T cell (Th1 or Th2) cytokines in mature T cells (32Jorritsma P.J. Brogdon J.L. Bottomly K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2427-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), Thus, it is not unlikely that Imp influences these processes by limiting Erk pathway activity. Consequently, we designed this study to define overall sensitivity of T cells to repressive function of Imp. Molecular Constructs—cDNAs encoding H-Ras and Ras effector loop mutants (RasV12G35, RasV12G37, and RasV12C40) were described previously (33Czyzyk J. Brogdon J.L. Badou A. Henegariu O. Preston Hurlburt P. Flavell R.A. Bottomly K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). N17Ras in pcDNA3 was a gift from K. L. Guan (University of Michigan). K-Ras, N-Ras, and wild type Imp were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from the mouse cDNA library. ImpC264A was created using oligonucleotides carrying the desired point mutation and PCR amplification with high-fidelity polymerase. A construct encoding a membrane-targeted variant of Imp was generated by introducing the sequence encoding the 19 C-terminal residues of K-Ras4B (MSKDGKKKKKKSKTKCVIM) into the C terminus of full-length Imp (designated Imp-CAAX) (34Clark J.C. Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All new constructs were cloned into pMSCV, which contains a cassette consisting of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and an internal ribosome entry site that permits the translation of two open reading frames from a single messenger RNA. In the pMIGR2 retroviral plasmid, tailless human CD2 replaces GFP. Antibodies—Anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) and C363.29B followed by goat anti-rat polyclonal antibody (MP Biomedical, Solon, OH) were used to stimulate, respectively, Jurkat human T cells and CD4 T cells, that had been isolated from B10.BR mice. Polyclonal antibodies, anti-Imp (The Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ) and anti-FLAG (Sigma), and mAbs, anti-ERK (clone D-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-ERK (clone E-4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Ras (clone Ras10; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were used in a Western blot analysis. Anti-LFA-1 (M17/4; BD Biosciences) and anti-VLA-4 (R1–2) mAbs were used in adoptive transfer experiments to measure lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes (35Lo C.G. Xu Y. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-IFN-γ, biotin-conjugated anti-human CD2, antigen-presenting cell (APC), anti-CD4, PE anti-Vβ5 TCR, and biotin anti-Vα2 TCR mAbs were used to stain CD4 T cells and analyze them using fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS); all of these antibodies were from BD Biosciences. mAbs, 11B11 (anti-IL4), and XMG1.2 (anti-IFN-γ) were used to make sure that Th1 and Th2 skewing took place during primary stimulation of CD4 T cells. Cell Culture and Activation—Jurkat human T cells and mouse CD4 T cells were maintained in RPMI1640 and Bruff culture medium, respectively. Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. Jurkat cells were activated in 96-well plates (EIA/RIA plates, Costar Corporation, Cambridge, MA) precoated overnight with OKT3 mAb at concentrations as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1d. Alternatively, Jurkat cells were incubated with 1.0 μg/ml OKT3 mAb on ice and then treated for 5 min at 37 °C with goat anti-rat secondary antibody. For stimulation with APCs, we isolated CD4 T cells from 6–8-week-old B10.BR and B10.5R mice that were transgenic for AND TCR. This TCR is specific for the moth cytochrome c peptide (VFAGLKKANERADLIAYLKQATK). CD4 T cells were grown in the presence of mitomycin C-treated T cell-depleted splenocytes. The APCs were pulsed with either 5 μg/ml pMCC or 15 μg/ml of a pMCC variant in which arginine had replaced lysine (K99R). For stimulation with phorbol esters, CD4 T cells were incubated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C. Transfections—To obtain Jurkat cells exhibiting stable repression of Imp protein, we electroporated the cells with Imp RNAi expressed from pSilcencer™ 3.1-H1 hygro (Ambion, Foster City, CA) and GFP as a marker for early selection and then subcloned them by limited dilution in the presence of hygromycin as a selection drug. Individual clones were subsequently electroporated with an NFAT-luciferase reporter and a plasmid expressing red fluorescence protein to monitor transfection efficiency. Alternatively, Jurkat T cells were electroporated with the PathDetect trans-reporting system (Elk1-GAL4 transactivator and 5xGAL4-luciferase reporter at a ratio of 1:50) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (36Czyzyk J. Leitenberg D. Taylor T. Bottomly K. Mol. Cell.

Reporters were detected using the dual-luciferase reporter assays system (Promega). To normalize the data, Renilla luciferase activity was measured in unstimulated cells. All electroporations (2 × 107 cells per cuvette) were carried out at 250 V and 960 μF on a Gene Pulser™ (Bio-Rad). Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect retroviral and lentiviral packaging cell lines, Phoenix Ecotropic cells and 293 T cells. Viral Transductions—Two types of viral infection were performed. For experiments involving the use of a retrovirus, the supernatants were obtained from cultures of Phoenix Ecotropic packaging cells transfected with Ras effector loop mutants or Imp constructs cloned into pMSCV, and applied directly to CD4 T cells. For experiments with lentivirus, 293T cells were cotransfected with pLL3.7 and packaging vectors (38Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Zhang M. Ihrig M. McManus M.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar), and collected after 60 h. The lentivirus was recovered by ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 23,000 × g and resuspension in culture medium. The viral preparations were delivered to CD4 T cells in the presence of Polybrene (final concentration: 8 μg/ml) by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 2,000 × g (37McCarty N. Paust S. Ikizawa K. Dan I. Li X. Cantor H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

The sequences targeted by RNAi 8, 9, and 11 were GTCCAACCCAGATGAACTA, GTAAAGATCACAGTAAGGA, and GACAAATAAGATGACCTCC, respectively. To generate Imp that is RNAi-resistant, the target sequence was changed from GGGAAGTCAGCCGGGGAGA to GGTAAATCGGCAGGAGAAA. The sequences of primers used to generate CD8-specific RNAi were exactly the same as those described elsewhere (38Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Zhang M. Ihrig M. McManus M.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR—CD4 T cells were isolated from B10.BR mice and sorted for a naïve population expressing CD62Lhi CD44lo. RNA was prepared using a TRIzol reagent and the reverse transcription was carried out using oligo(dT) as a primer and SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR assays were performed on a Mx3000P® platform (Stratagene) using 25 μl of a reaction mixture that contained 8 to 10 ng of cDNA, SYBR Green, dNTP, primers, and platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Cycling conditions were as follows: incubation at 95 °C for 3 min, and 40 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 27 s. A melting curve was added between 55 and 95 °C. Amplification of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene mRNA was used as an internal control to normalize the data. For Imp the forward primer was 5′-GTGGAAAGGAAGTGTACCCAG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CTCCGCAGGCAGGTGGCTGATCTG-3′. For S1P1 the forward primer was 5′-GACAACCCAGAGACCATTATG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GATCAAGTCAGAATGCTTCCCTCA-3′. For S1P4 the forward primer was 5′-CGTGTTCAACTCAGCCATTAATCC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CTGAAGCTGAGTGACCGAGAAGTC-3′. For hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase the forward primer was 5′-CCAGCAAGCTTGCAACCTTAACCA-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-ATGATCAGTCAACGGGGGAC-3′. Mice—AND TCR B10.BR, AND TCR B10.A (5R), and OT2 TCR C57BL/6 mice were used as donors of TCR transgenic CD4 T cells. B10.BR, B10.A (5R), and C57BL/6 mice were used as donors of APCs. In adoptive transfer experiments, C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 IFNγR knock-out mice were also used as recipients of RasV12G37 or GFP control CD4 T cells. All animal experiments in this work were done in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the Yale Animal Resources Center (YARC). Generation of RasV12G37 Transgenic Mice—FLAG-tagged RasV12G37 was subcloned into pBI-EGFP plasmid (Clontech) containing a bidirectional tetracycline-responsive promoter. The transgenic expression cassette was subsequently cut out using AseI and PshAI restriction enzymes, then purified, and injected into the embryos of F2(C57BL/6JxSJL/J) mice at Yale Animal Genomic Services. The transgene-positive weanling mice were identified by PCR analysis of the tail biopsies. The following primers were used to amplify a 225-bp fragment containing the 5′ sequence of FLAG-Ras: 5′-CCAGCCTCCGCGGCCCCGAATTCG-3′ and 5′-GATGACCACCTGCTTCCGGTAGG-3′, and a 296-bp fragment containing the 5′ sequence of the EGFP gene: 5′-GCTCGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAGATC-3′ and 5′-GCTTGCCGGTGGTGCAGATGAAC-3′. To identify the founders, the animals that belonged to the F1 generation of a breeding cross between 296-bp positive/225-bp positive and M2 mice (these mice express reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator), were fed a grain-based doxocycline diet (2.3 g/kg) (BioServ, Laurel, MD) for 2 weeks and then screened by FACS for the presence of EGFP-positive CD4 T cells in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Adoptive Cell Transfer Experiments—C57BL/6 or C57BL/6 IFNγR knock-out mice were injected with ∼5 × 106 CD4 T cells transduced with either RasV12G37 or an empty vector control. After 48 h, the mice were sacrificed and lymphocytes were isolated from their inguinal lymph nodes for staining with a mixture of anti-CD4 and anti-TCR mAbs (see below) and for FACS analysis. In some experiments, we blocked further entry of transferred cells by injecting the mice intraperitoneally with 100 μg of anti-LFA1 and VLA-4 mAbs (33Czyzyk J. Brogdon J.L. Badou A. Henegariu O. Preston Hurlburt P. Flavell R.A. Bottomly K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and performing analysis after 15 h, as described above. Migration Assay—Transwell chemotaxis assays were performed using 24-well plates and 3-μm pore width filters (BD Biosciences). The lower chamber of the transwell chamber contained 0.6 ml of SP diluted in chemotaxis medium (RPMI1640, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes). The cells were diluted in chemotaxis medium, and 0.1 ml (3 × 105 cells) was added to the top chamber. After 8 h at 37 °C, the cells that had migrated into the lower chamber were collected and counted in four high-power fields using a hemocytometer. The assays were performed in duplicate for each SP concentration. Intracellular Cytokine Staining and FACS Analysis—GFP-sorted CD4 T cells expressing both siRNA from the pLL3.7 lentiviral vector and Ras effector loop mutants from a pMIGR2 retroviral plasmid were stimulated with the antigen for 12 h and cultured for an additional 4 h in the presence of GolgiStop reagent (BD Biosciences) to trap cytokines in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cells were then processed with biotin-conjugated anti-human CD2 mAb followed by streptavidin-Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) for extracellular staining, and PE-labeled anti-IFN-γ mAb for intracellular staining. In adoptive transfer experiments, GFP-positive CD4 T cells were stained with APC anti-CD4, PE anti-Vβ5 TCR, and biotin anti-Vα2 TCR followed by Per-CP streptavidin. Western Blots and Immunoprecipitation—T cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). Protein samples from precleared cell lysates were fractioned under reducing conditions on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-9% polyacrylamide gel. To verify expression of Imp constructs, proteins samples were fractioned on a SDS 6–18% gradient polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked with either 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (staining with p-ERK mAb), probed with the first antibody, and incubated with the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblots were developed using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, immune complexes were recovered with protein A/G-conjugated-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and further analyzed by the immunoblot procedure exactly as described above. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—We evaluated the relationship between Imp and Ras using the yeast two-hybrid assay, H-RasV12 or H-RasV12 effector loop mutants were cloned inframe with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain within pGBKT7, and a region of Imp encompassing residues 273 to 377 was cloned in-frame with a 768–881-amino acid fragment of the GAL4 activation domain within the pGAD vector. Next, AH109- and Y187-competent yeast cells transformed with pGAD and pGBKT7 plasmids, respectively, were mated and transferred onto plates with SD minimal media containing a –leucine (Leu)/-tryptophan (Trp) dropout supplement. Positive clones were transferred onto new plates with a quadruple dropout supplement (-adenine (Ade)/-histidine(His)/-Leu/-Trp) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days until colonies appeared. Cytokine Assays—IFN-γ and IL-4 levels from cell supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Endogen, Cambridge, MA). The lower limit of sensitivity for the ELISA for IFN-γ and IL-4 was 0.6 ng/ml and 10 pg/ml, respectively. Statistical Analysis—Mann-Whitney analysis was performed to assess influence of RasV12G37 on T cell retention in the lymph nodes. The level of significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Imp Is a Potent Down-regulator of T Cells Responses—In our first attempt to examine the potential role of Imp in T cell activation, we used human Jurkat T cells that had been transfected with anti-Imp-specific RNAi. We used RNAi 7 because it had the strongest inhibitory effect on Imp (Fig. 1A). Two independent Jurkat clones (17.11 and 17.12) that had been stably transfected with this RNAi demonstrated up-regulation of the phosphorylated form of ERK following stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb, compared with control clones (8.1 and 8.3) carrying CD8a-specific RNAi (Fig. 1B). In addition, in 17.11 and 17.12 Jurkat clones the NFAT reporter demonstrated a markedly increased transcriptional response, compared with control clones (Fig. 1C). Of note, unstimulated Jurkat T cells expressing distinct levels of Imp demonstrated similar levels of p-ERK (Fig. 1B) and NFAT reporter activity (Fig. 1C, inset). We then explored the possibility that overexpression of Imp inhibits T cells from inducing a cytokine response. We found that eptopically expressed wild type Imp has a relatively weak suppressive effect in wild type Jurkat T cells (data not shown). Rapid degradation or lack of Imp in close proximity to Ksr in the overexpression system may be responsible for this insufficiency. Therefore, we generated a membrane-targeted form of full-length Imp in which a consensus C-terminal CAAX (C-cysteine, A = aliphatic amino acid, and X = any amino acid) and the sequence encoding the 19 C-terminal residue of K-Ras4B were introduced (Imp-CAAX) (34Clark J.C. Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). In addition, we generated another Imp mutant in which the first cysteine in RING-H2 was changed to alanine (C264A) (Fig. 2A). This Imp variant is thought to be resistant to degradation (28Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type Imp, the Imp-CAAX variant appeared to be more effective in repressing the IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ response in normal CD4 T cells (Fig. 2C). Similar effects were seen with overexpression of Imp-CAAX, which partially blocked NFAT reporter activity in Jurkat T cells. Interestingly, Jurkat cells (e.g. 17.11), which expressed lowered levels of Imp, were more sensitive to the repressing activity of Imp-CAAX (Fig. 2D, right panel) compared with Jurkat cells (e.g. 8.1) expressing normal levels of this molecule (Fig. 2D, left panel). Additionally, a biochemical analysis of the phosphorylated form of ERK revealed Imp-dependent down-regulation of this kinase in antigen-stimulated CD4 T cells (Fig. 2E). Thus, our observations suggest that Imp is a negative regulator of T cell activation. p21 Ras-mediated Repression of the Inhibitory Effect of Imp Is Responsible for Enhanced Cytokine Output by CD4 T Cells—According to a recent study (28Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) Imp is a novel effector of Ras. Therefore, we decided to explore the possib"

https://openalex.org/W1976178369,"The genomes of many marine invertebrates, including the purple sea urchin and the solitary ascidians Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi, show exceptionally high levels of heterozygosity, implying that these populations are highly polymorphic. Analysis of the C. savignyi genome found little evidence to support an elevated mutation rate, but rather points to a large population size contributing to the polymorphism level. In the present study, the relative genetic polymorphism levels in sampled populations of ten different ascidian species were determined using a similarity index generated by AFLP analysis. The goal was to determine the range of polymorphism within the populations of different species, and to uncover factors that may contribute to the high level of polymorphism. We observe that, surprisingly, the levels of polymorphism within these species show a negative correlation with the reported age of invasive populations, and that closely related species show substantially different levels of genetic polymorphism. These findings show exceptions to the assumptions that invasive species start with a low level of genetic polymorphism that increases over time and that closely related species have similar levels of genetic polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2086673755,"ATP synthase uses a unique rotary mechanism to couple ATP synthesis and hydrolysis to transmembrane proton translocation. The F1 subcomplex has three catalytic nucleotide binding sites, one on each β subunit, at the interface to the adjacent α subunit. In the x-ray structure of F1 (Abrahams, J. P., Leslie, A. G. W., Lutter, R., and Walker, J. E. (1994) Nature 370, 621–628), the three catalytic β/α interfaces differ in the extent of inter-subunit interactions between the C termini of the β and α subunits. At the closed βDP/αDP interface, a hydrogen-bonding network is formed between both subunits, which is absent at the more open βTP/αTP interface and at the wide open βE/αE interface. The hydrogen-bonding network reaches from βL328 (Escherichia coli numbering) and βQ441 via αQ399, βR398, and αE402 to βR394, and ends in a cation/π interaction between βR394 and αF406. Using mutational analysis in E. coli ATP synthase, the functional importance of the βDP/αDP hydrogen-bonding network is demonstrated. Its elimination results in a severely impaired enzyme but has no pronounced effect on the binding affinities of the catalytic sites.

A possible role for the hydrogen-bonding network in coupling of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and rotation will be discussed. F1F0-ATP synthase catalyzes the final step of oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation, the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. F1F0-ATP synthase consists of the membrane embedded F0 subcomplex with, in Escherichia coli, a subunit composition of ab2c10, and the peripheral F1 subcomplex, with a subunit composition of α3β3γδϵ. The energy necessary for ATP synthesis is derived from an electrochemical transmembrane proton (or, in some organisms, sodium ion) gradient. Proton flow, down the gradient, through F0 is coupled to ATP synthesis on F1 by a unique rotary mechanism. The protons flow through (half) channels at the interface of a and c subunits, which drives rotation of the ring of c subunits. The c10 ring, together with F1 subunits γ and ϵ, forms the rotor. Rotation of γ leads to conformational changes in the catalytic nucleotide binding sites on the β subunits, where ADP and Pi are bound. The conformational changes result in formation and release of ATP. Thus, ATP synthase converts electrochemical energy, the proton gradient, into mechanical energy in form of subunit rotation and back into chemical energy as ATP. In bacteria, under certain physiological conditions, the process runs in reverse. ATP is hydrolyzed to generate a transmembrane proton gradient, which the bacterium requires for such functions as nutrient import and locomotion (for reviews, see Refs. 1Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E.

F1 (or “F1-ATPase”) has three catalytic nucleotide binding sites, with pronounced differences in their nucleotide binding affinity. The catalytic nucleotide binding sites are located on the β subunits, at the interface to the adjacent α subunit. In the original x-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 (7Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), one of the three catalytic sites was filled with the ATP analog AMP-PNP, 2The abbreviation used is: AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. a second one with ADP (plus azide; see ref. 8Bowler M.W. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8646-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and the third site was empty. Hence, the β subunits are referred to βTP, βDP, and βE, and the β/α subunit pairs as βTP/αTP, βDP/αDP, and βE/αE, respectively. The three catalytic β/α interfaces differ in their degree of interaction between both subunits. The βDP/αDP interface has the most extensive contacts between β and α, the βTP/αTP interface has less, and the βE/αE interface has the least. These differences are most pronounced at the C-terminal domains of β and α. Unique to the βDP/αDP interface is an inter-subunit hydrogen-bonding network, reaching from the main-chain oxygen of βL328 3E. coli residue numbers are used unless indicated otherwise. and the side chain of βQ441 via the side chains of αQ399, βR398, and αE402 to the side chain of βR394. The guanidino group of βR394 forms a cation/π interaction with the phenyl ring of αF406 (Fig. 1, left-hand panel). At the βTP/αTP interface, the α-helix carrying residues αQ399, αE402, and αF406 is rotated and has moved away from β by 3–4 Å, preventing all these interactions (Fig. 1, right-hand panel). At the βE/αE interface, the C-terminal domains of two subunits are even further apart. The amino acids that make up the hydrogen-bonding network are conserved between bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase and the enzyme from E. coli. In the report presented here, we investigate the functional importance of this hydrogen-bonding network at the βDP/αDP interface of E. coli ATP synthase by perturbing it to varying degrees by site-directed mutagenesis. Single conservative amino acid substitutions were used to change charges and/or geometry of individual hydrogen bonds, single alanine substitutions removed one, two, or three possible hydrogen bonds, and a triple alanine mutant, βR394A/βR398A/βQ441A, prevented formation of all hydrogen bonds except one, as well as formation of the cation/π interaction. Analysis of the mutants demonstrated the functional importance of the hydrogen-bonding network. A possible role for the network in energy coupling will be discussed. E. coli Strains and Plasmids—The source of wild-type F1 was strain SWM1 (9Rao R. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5569-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the source of βY331W mutant F1 was strain pSWM4/JP17 (10Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The template for mutagenesis was plasmid pSN6 (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); thus, all new mutants would carry in addition the βY331W mutation, to allow fluorescence-based nucleotide binding measurements. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed in such a way that, in addition to the desired mutation, a restriction site would be eliminated or generated, to facilitate screening: Plasmids containing the desired mutation were transformed into strain DK8 (12Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Membranes and Enzymes and Functional Analysis of Mutant Strains and Enzymes—Growth yields of E. coli strains in limiting glucose and growth on succinate plates were measured as described previously (13Senior A.E. Langman L. Cox G.B. Gibson F. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). E. coli membranes were prepared as described (14Senior A.E. Latchney L.R. Ferguson A.M. Wise J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). F1 was isolated as described previously (15Weber J. Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 132-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NADH- and ATP-driven proton pumping in membranes was measured using acridine orange fluorescence quenching (16Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of F1 in membrane preparations was estimated via Western blots, using an anti-β antibody (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden) or an anti-α/anti-β antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Bill Brusilow, Wayne State University). The staining intensity was quantified using a Photodyne imaging system and the program Image J (National Institutes of Health). ATPase activities were measured in 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, 10 mm ATP, 4 mm MgSO4, pH 8.0, at 23 °C. Released phosphate was determined as described (17Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—A general outline of nucleotide binding experiments using βTrp331 fluorescence has been described previously (15Weber J. Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 132-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on a spectrofluorometer type Fluorolog 3 (HORIBA Jovin Yvon, Edison, NJ), at 23 °C. The buffer was 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, 2.5 mm MgSO4, pH 8.0. F1 concentration was 30–60 nm. ATP and ADP were added as indicated. To determine MgADP binding in the presence of scandium fluoride, the enzyme was incubated with 0.3 mm ScCl3, 10 mm NaF, 2.5 mm MgSO4, plus the indicated concentration of ADP (19Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9583-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To correct for dilution and inner filter effects, parallel titrations with wild-type F1 were performed. Kd values were determined from the titration curves as described previously (15Weber J. Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 132-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Modeling—Homology modeling, including energy minimization refinement, was performed using the program PRIME (Schroedinger Inc.). Templates were Protein Data Bank entries 1BMF and 1H8E, the structures of bovine mitochondrial F1 with two (7Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) and three (20Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) catalytic sites occupied, respectively. Due to program restrictions regarding the number of amino acids, the N-terminal domains of the α and β subunits were removed. Assaying the Mutants: An Overview—With the exception of residue βL328, which participates in the βDP/αDP hydrogen-bonding network via its main-chain carbonyl oxygen, the function of the other residues involved in the network was studied by mutational analysis. In addition, residue αF406, which forms a cation/π interaction with one of the terminal residues of the network, βR394, was included in the analysis. The results of the mutagenesis experiments are summarized in Table 1. To characterize the functional effect of each mutation on oxidative phosphorylation in vivo, we determined growth yields in 3 mm glucose and growth on plates containing succinate as the sole carbon source. After preparation of membranes from the mutant strains, we analyzed NADH- and ATP-driven proton gradient formation by measuring quenching of acridine orange fluorescence, and we measured ATPase activity. A low percentage of NADH-induced quenching is indicative of proton permeability of the membranes, which can be caused by oligomeric instability of the mutant ATP synthase complex; of the mutations tested here, only the αQ399C mutant showed a pronounced reduction in NADH-induced acridine orange quenching. The degree of quenching by ATP depends on the balance between ATP-driven proton pumping and proton permeability of the membranes. To determine if variations in enzymatic activities were direct functional consequences of the respective mutation or due to changes in the amount of enzyme on the membrane, we quantified the amount of F1 present in the membrane preparations by Western blots. For most mutants, the amount of F1 was within ±25% of that observed for the parental strain pSN6/DK8. Exceptions were the βQ441A mutant, which had ∼2/3 of the F1 content of the control, the βQ441C mutant, which contained ∼50% more F1 than the control, and the αQ399A mutant, where no F1 was found on the membrane.TABLE 1Functional properties of strains and membranes containing mutations perturbing the βDP/αDP hydrogen-bonding network Growth yield in limiting (3 mm) glucose and growth on succinate plates were determined as in (13Senior A.E. Langman L. Cox G.B. Gibson F. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Growth yield data were measured via the turbidity (A590) and are expressed as percentage of the value for the positive control. Quenching of acridine orange fluorescence by NADH and ATP was measured as in (16Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The determination of the amount of F1 on the membranes is based on the quantitative evaluation of western blots by densitometric analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). ATPase activities were determined in 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, 10 mm ATP, 4 mm MgSO4, pH 8.0, at 23 °C. The relative ATPase activity in the last column is expressed as percentage of the activity of the positive control, corrected for the different amounts of F1 on the membrane. Strain pSN6/DK8 served as positive control; it expresses ATP synthase containing a βY331W mutation. βY331W mutant ATP synthase is a normal, active enzyme (10Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F.

All assays were run at least in triplicate, except for the determination of the amount of F1 on the membrane which was done at least in duplicate Open table in a new tab The results of the experiments listed in Table 1 show that the hydrogen-bonding network plays an important role in the function of the enzyme. Many of the mutants showed impaired activity. In most cases, the effect of the mutations on ATP synthesis and hydrolysis was comparable. Although, in general, conservative substitutions had less influence on the enzymatic function less than an alanine replacement, in some cases these differences were smaller than expected. In the following, the results of the mutagenesis experiments will be analyzed in detail. Mutation of βQ441—The side chain of residue βQ441 can form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of residue αQ399. The mutagenesis results suggest that this hydrogen bond can still be formed when the side chain of βQ441 is shortened by one methylene group to asparagine, because the βQ441N mutant has close-to-normal functional properties. Even the βQ441C mutant seems to have preserved some hydrogen-bonding capabilities. Abolishing the possibility for hydrogen bond formation in the βQ441A mutant impairs the enzyme significantly. Mutation of αQ399—The side chain of residue αQ399 has a central position in the βDP/αDP hydrogen-bonding network. It can form bonds to the side chains of βQ441 and βR398 as well as to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of βL328. Like for βQ441, the results of the functional assays suggest that shortening the side chain of αQ399 in the αQ399N mutant leaves the functionally important hydrogen bonds largely unperturbed. Modeling (not shown) of the αQ399N mutation suggested that the hydrogen bonds to the side chains of βQ441 and βR398 might be preserved; in addition, a new hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of βY444 seemed possible. Eliminating all potential hydrogen bonds in which the side chain of αQ399 is involved, in the αQ399A mutant, appears to prevent assembly of the enzyme. Visual inspection of the βDP/αDP interaction site indicates that the αQ399C mutant should be capable to form at least one intersubunit hydrogen bond, most likely to βQ441. However, this residual hydrogen-bonding capability does not seem enough to overcome the loss of the other hydrogen bonds; the αQ399C mutant is very strongly impaired. Mutation of βR398—The guanidino group of βR398 can form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of αQ399 and αE402, plus an intra-subunit hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of βQ441. These hydrogen bonds seem of less importance for the functionality of the enzyme. Even a complete removal in the βR398A mutant gives an enzyme with considerable activity. Mutation of αE402—The carboxylate group of αE402 can form hydrogen bonds with the guanidino functions of βR398 and βR394. Loss of the negative charge in the αE402Q mutant has only a minor effect on enzymatic function. Shortening the side chain by removal of one methylene group in the αE402D mutant reduces the activity by about a half, possibly by preventing formation of one of the hydrogen bonds. Loss of both hydrogen bonds in the αE402A mutant leaves an enzyme with overall <20% residual activity. Mutation of βR394—The guanidino group of βR394 can form a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of αE402, plus a cation/π interaction with the phenyl ring of αF406. In addition, formation of intra-subunit hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl function of βY367 and the carboxylate group of βE440 seems likely. Complete removal of the hydrogen-bonding capability in the βR394A mutant reduces the activity severely. Interestingly, in the more conservative mutants, βR394K and βR394Q, a similar decrease in activity was observed. A possible explanation is that the lysine and glutamine side chains preferentially form intra-subunit hydrogen bonds, which are not required for the activity of the enzyme, but fail to provide the functionally important interactions with the α subunit. Mutation of αF406—The phenyl ring of αF406 can make a cation/π interaction with the guanidino group of βR394. Elimination of this interaction, in the αF406A mutant, results in a significant impairment of the enzyme. Earlier studies 4S. Nadanaciva, J. Weber, and A. E. Senior, unpublished data. had shown that the phenyl ring can be replaced by an indole ring system, in the αF406W mutant, without loss of activity. The αF406C mutant shows considerably higher activity the αF406A mutant, which might suggest that the cation/π interaction between the side chains of αF406 and βR394 has been substituted by a hydrogen bond between the sulfhydryl group of the Cys and the guanidino group of the Arg, with partial preservation of functionality. The βR394A/βR398A/βQ441A Triple Mutant—In an attempt to remove the βDP/αDP hydrogen-bonding network as completely as possible, without preventing assembly of the enzyme, we constructed a βR394A/βR398A/βQ441A triple mutant. (It is actually a quadruple mutant as the plasmid used to generate the mutations described here contained the βY331W mutation, to allow fluorescence-based nucleotide binding measurements. As described earlier (10Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the βY331W mutation gives a normal, fully functional enzyme.) The βR394A/βR398A/βQ441A mutations would eliminate all possible hydrogen bonds plus the cation/π interaction, with the exception of one hydrogen bond between αQ399 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of βL328. As expected, the data in Table 1 did not give any indication of assembly problems. This is also supported by the fact that we were successful in preparing F1 from this strain (see below). As can be seen from Table 1, the βR394A/βR398A/βQ441A triple mutant has ∼10% residual activity. F1 was prepared from the strain containing the βR394A/βR398A/βQ441A triple mutation by the standard procedure (15Weber J. Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 132-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The elution profile of the gel chromatography column used as the last purification step indicated that the isolated F1 subcomplex had normal size and shape. SDS-PAGE of the final product revealed a normal subunit composition (data not shown). The isolated F1 exhibited ATPase activity of ∼10% of that of the parental βY331W enzyme (0.56 unit/mg for βR394A/βR3"
