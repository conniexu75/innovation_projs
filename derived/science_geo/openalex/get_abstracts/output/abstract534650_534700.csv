https://openalex.org/W1638444713,"We are using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to study neuropsychiatric disorders associated with 22q11.2 microdeletions (del), the most common known schizophrenia (SZ)-associated genetic factor. Several genes in the region have been implicated; a promising candidate is DGCR8, which codes for a protein involved in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. We carried out miRNA expression profiling (miRNA-seq) on neurons generated from iPSCs derived from controls and SZ patients with 22q11.2 del. Using thresholds of p<0.01 for nominal significance and 1.5-fold differences in expression, 45 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected (13 lower in SZ and 32 higher). Of these, 6 were significantly down-regulated in patients after correcting for genome wide significance (FDR<0.05), including 4 miRNAs that map to the 22q11.2 del region. In addition, a nominally significant increase in the expression of several miRNAs was found in the 22q11.2 neurons that were previously found to be differentially expressed in autopsy samples and peripheral blood in SZ and autism spectrum disorders (e.g., miR-34, miR-4449, miR-146b-3p, and miR-23a-5p). Pathway and function analysis of predicted mRNA targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs showed enrichment for genes involved in neurological disease and psychological disorders for both up and down regulated miRNAs. Our findings suggest that: i. neurons with 22q11.2 del recapitulate the miRNA expression patterns expected of 22q11.2 haploinsufficiency, ii. differentially expressed miRNAs previously identified using autopsy samples and peripheral cells, both of which have significant methodological problems, are indeed disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders and likely have an underlying genetic basis."
https://openalex.org/W1567904427,"Nucleosome unwrapping dynamics provide transient access to the complexes involved in DNA transcription, repair, and replication, whereas regulation of nucleosome unwrapping modulates occupancy of these complexes. Histone H3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 41 (H3Y41ph) and threonine 45 (H3T45ph). H3Y41ph is implicated in regulating transcription, whereas H3T45ph is involved in DNA replication and apoptosis. These modifications are located in the DNA-histone interface near where the DNA exits the nucleosome, and are thus poised to disrupt DNA-histone interactions. However, the impact of histone phosphorylation on nucleosome unwrapping and accessibility is unknown. We find that the phosphorylation mimics H3Y41E and H3T45E, and the chemically correct modification, H3Y41ph, significantly increase nucleosome unwrapping. This enhances DNA accessibility to protein binding by 3-fold. H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac) is also located in the same DNA-histone interface and increases DNA unwrapping. H3K56ac is implicated in transcription regulation, suggesting that H3Y41ph and H3K56ac could function together. We find that the combination of H3Y41ph with H3K56ac increases DNA accessibility by over an order of magnitude. These results suggest that phosphorylation within the nucleosome DNA entry-exit region increases access to DNA binding complexes and that the combination of phosphorylation with acetylation has the potential to significantly influence DNA accessibility to transcription regulatory complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2157827269,"Quasi-experimental methods increasingly are used to evaluate the impacts of conservation interventions by generating credible estimates of counterfactual baselines. These methods generally require large samples for statistical comparisons, presenting a challenge for evaluating innovative policies implemented within a few pioneering jurisdictions. Single jurisdictions often are studied using comparative methods, which rely on analysts’ selection of best case comparisons. The synthetic control method (SCM) offers one systematic and transparent way to select cases for comparison, from a sizeable pool, by focusing upon similarity in outcomes before the intervention. We explain SCM, then apply it to one local initiative to limit deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The municipality of Paragominas launched a multi-pronged local initiative in 2008 to maintain low deforestation while restoring economic production. This was a response to having been placed, due to high deforestation, on a federal “blacklist” that increased enforcement of forest regulations and restricted access to credit and output markets. The local initiative included mapping and monitoring of rural land plus promotion of economic alternatives compatible with low deforestation. The key motivation for the program may have been to reduce the costs of blacklisting. However its stated purpose was to limit deforestation, and thus we apply SCM to estimate what deforestation would have been in a (counterfactual) scenario of no local initiative. We obtain a plausible estimate, in that deforestation patterns before the intervention were similar in Paragominas and the synthetic control, which suggests that after several years, the initiative did lower deforestation (significantly below the synthetic control in 2012). This demonstrates that SCM can yield helpful land-use counterfactuals for single units, with opportunities to integrate local and expert knowledge and to test innovations and permutations on policies that are implemented in just a few locations."
https://openalex.org/W925209273,"Patients with metastatic or recurrent and refractory sarcomas have a dismal prognosis. Therefore, new targeted therapies are urgently needed. This study was designed to evaluate chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) or tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) molecules for their therapeutic potential against sarcomas. Here, we report that IGF1R (15/15) and ROR1 (11/15) were highly expressed in sarcoma cell lines including Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, alveolar or embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells derived from eight healthy donors using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system were cytotoxic against sarcoma cells and produced high levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-13 in an antigen-specific manner. IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells generated from three sarcoma patients released significant amounts of IFN-γ in response to sarcoma stimulation. The adoptive transfer of IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells derived from a sarcoma patient significantly reduced tumor growth in pre-established, systemically disseminated and localized osteosarcoma xenograft models in NSG mice. Infusion of IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells also prolonged animal survival in a localized sarcoma model using NOD/scid mice. Our data indicate that both IGF1R and ROR1 can be effectively targeted by SB modified CAR T cells and that such CAR T cells may be useful in the treatment of high risk sarcoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W891941391,"As the chemical environment of semen can have a profound effect on sperm quality, we examined the effect of pH on the motility, viability and capacitation of human sperm. The sperm in this study was collected from healthy males to avoid interference from other factors. The spermatozoa cultured in sperm nutrition solution at pH 5.2, 6.2, 7.2 and 8.2 were analyzed for sperm total motility, progressive motility (PR), hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) rate, and sperm penetration. Our results showed that these parameters were similar in pH 7.2 and 8.2 sperm nutrition solutions, but decreased in pH 5.2 and 6.2 solutions. The HOS rate exhibited positive correlation with the sperm total motility and PR. In addition, the sperm Na+/K+-ATPase activity at different pHs was measured, and the enzyme activity was significantly lower in pH 5.2 and 6.2 media, comparing with that in pH 8.2 and pH 7.2 solutions. Using flow cytometry (FCM) and laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) analysis, the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations of sperm cultured in sperm capacitation solution at pH 5.2, 6.2, 7.2 and 8.2 were determined. Compared with that at pH 7.2, the mean fluorescence intensity of sperm in pH 5.2 and 6.2 media decreased significantly, while that of pH 8.2 group showed no difference. Our results suggested that the declined Na+/K+-ATPase activity at acidic pHs result in decreased sperm movement and capacitation, which could be one of the mechanisms of male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W1541966643,"The Macaronesian laurel forests (MLF) are dominated by trees with a laurophyll habit comparable to evergreen humid forests which were scattered across Europe and the Mediterranean in the Paleogene and Neogene. Therefore, MLF are traditionally regarded as an old, 'Tertiary relict' vegetation type. Here we address the question if key taxa of the MLF are relictual. We evaluated the relict hypothesis consulting fossil data and analyses based on molecular phylogenies of 18 representative species. For molecular dating we used the program BEAST, for ancestral trait reconstructions BayesTraits and Lagrange to infer ancestral areas. Our molecular dating showed that the origins of four species date back to the Upper Miocene while 14 originated in the Plio-Pleistocene. This coincides with the decline of fossil laurophyllous elements in Europe since the middle Miocene. Ancestral trait and area reconstructions indicate that MLF evolved partly from pre-adapted taxa from the Mediterranean, Macaronesia and the tropics. According to the fossil record laurophyllous taxa existed in Macaronesia since the Plio- and Pleistocene. MLF are composed of species with a heterogeneous origin. The taxa dated to the Pleistocene are likely not 'Tertiary relicts'. Some species may be interpreted as relictual. In this case, the establishment of most species in the Plio-Pleistocene suggests that there was a massive species turnover before this time. Alternatively, MLF were largely newly assembled through global recruitment rather than surviving as relicts of a once more widespread vegetation. This process may have possibly been triggered by the intensification of the trade winds at the end of the Pliocene as indicated by proxy data."
https://openalex.org/W1916209382,"The chromosome passenger complex (CPC) is a master regulator of mitosis. Inner centromere protein (INCENP) acts as a scaffold regulating CPC localization and activity. During early mitosis, the N-terminal region of INCENP forms a three-helix bundle with Survivin and Borealin, directing the CPC to the inner centromere where it plays essential roles in chromosome alignment and the spindle assembly checkpoint. The C-terminal IN box region of INCENP is responsible for binding and activating Aurora B kinase. The central region of INCENP has been proposed to comprise a coiled coil domain acting as a spacer between the N- and C-terminal domains that is involved in microtubule binding and regulation of the spindle checkpoint. Here we show that the central region (213 residues) of chicken INCENP is not a coiled coil but a ∼32-nm-long single α-helix (SAH) domain. The N-terminal half of this domain directly binds to microtubules in vitro. By analogy with previous studies of myosin 10, our data suggest that the INCENP SAH might stretch up to ∼80 nm under physiological forces. Thus, the INCENP SAH could act as a flexible “dog leash,” allowing Aurora B to phosphorylate dynamic substrates localized in the outer kinetochore while at the same time being stably anchored to the heterochromatin of the inner centromere. Furthermore, by achieving this flexibility via an SAH domain, the CPC avoids a need for dimerization (required for coiled coil formation), which would greatly complicate regulation of the proximity-induced trans-phosphorylation that is critical for Aurora B activation.

This region of INCENP also contributes to CPC localization by binding to HP1 and to microtubules. The IN box, a conserved motif near the C terminus of INCENP, is responsible for binding and activating Aurora B kinase (3Adams R.R. Wheatley S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Carmena M.

The central portion of INCENP is predicted to form a coiled coil spacer between the localization and activation modules (3Adams R.R. Wheatley S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Carmena M.

This tethering of Aurora B is critical for the regulation of chromosome alignment and the correction of kinetochore attachment errors. Spindle tension causes the elastic chromatin of the inner centromere to stretch, allowing sister kinetochores to move away from the inner centromere where INCENP is concentrated during prometaphase and metaphase. As first proposed for budding yeast and later confirmed in mammalian cells, this centromere stretch moves kinetochore targets of Aurora B away from regions of high kinase concentration and decreases their phosphorylation, thereby stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule interactions (10Tanaka T.U.

In misattached chromosomes, which do not exhibit comparable centromere stretch, Aurora B remains in closer proximity to the outer kinetochore. This allows the kinase to phosphorylate key kinetochore components, causing them to release microtubules (13Cheeseman I.M. Chappie J.S. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Desai A.

This correction mechanism is now well accepted, but what is less clear is how exactly INCENP achieves the dynamic flexibility to allow Aurora B to extend into the outer kinetochore and to track with kinetochore components at the dynamic microtubule interface. For example, because the Ndc80 and Ska complexes are composed of relatively rigid helical bundles (16Ciferri C. De Luca J. Monzani S. Ferrari K.J. Ristic D. Wyman C. Stark H. Kilmartin J. Salmon E.D.

Here we show that the central region of INCENP is not a coiled coil but instead is a single α-helix (SAH) domain similar to that found in myosin 10 and many other proteins (18Knight P.J.

The N-terminal portion of this SAH is capable of binding directly to microtubules. Furthermore, SAH domains are highly extensible, and by analogy with the myosin SAH domain (20Wolny M. Batchelor M.

These data support the suggestion that the INCENP coil functions as a dog leash that allows Aurora B to “wander” across a substantial target area to reach its substrates (9Santaguida S. Musacchio A.

HeLa Kyoto cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Whole cell lysates were prepared, and the equivalent of 0.5–1 × 106 cells was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed following standard procedures. Donkey anti-mouse or -rabbit IRdye 800CW was used for analysis using a LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey quantitative fluorescence imager. All fixation, permeabilization, and immunostaining were performed at room temperature as described previously (31Platani M. Santarella-Mellwig R. Posch M. Walczak R. Swedlow J.R. Mattaj I.W.

Cells attached on polylysine-coated coverslips were fixed in a 3.7% formaldehyde, PBS solution for 10 min and permeabilized in PBS, 0.15% Triton X-100 for 4 min. Cells were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature prior to antibody incubations.

All affinity-purified donkey secondary antibodies (labeled with either FITC, Alexa Fluor 488, TRITC, Alexa Fluor 594, or Cy5) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. RNAi experiments were performed using annealed siRNA oligos (Qiagen) diluted in serum-free Opti-MEM and transfected using HiPerFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml, and diluted siRNA was added to cells so that the final concentration of siRNA was 40 nm. Plasmids encoding either GFP-TrAP-GgINCENPWT SAH, GFP-TrAP-GgINCENPDouble SAH, or GFP-TrAP-GgINCENPN-half SAH were transfected for 24 h prior to fixation. Coverslips were fixed at 30–34 h. INCENP siRNA oligo was 5′-AGATCAACCCAGATAACTA-3′ (35Carmena M. Pinson X. Platani M. Salloum Z. Xu Z. Clark A. Macisaac F. Ogawa H. Eggert U. Glover D.M. Archambault V. Earnshaw W.C.

For control transfections, non-silencing random scrambled siRNA oligos were used at the same concentration. Quantifications of H3Ser28ph, H3Ser10ph, and DSN1ph were carried out as follows. Deconvolved images were imported into OMERO (36Swedlow J.R. Goldberg I.G. Eliceiri K.W. OME ConsortiumBioimage informatics for experimental biology.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2009; 38: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and segmentation of centromere foci (anti-centromere antibodies, Cy5, reference channel) or chromatin (DAPI, 435 reference channel) performed using Otsu segmentation implemented in Matlab. Masks stored in OMERO were then used to calculate background-corrected intensities, which were output into a comma-separated value file for plotting in Excel. Growth curves were generated by seeding cells at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml at 39 °C (unless otherwise stated). Cell counting was performed every 24 h for a total of 96 h. To avoid overgrowth, cells were diluted to 2 × 105 cells/ml every 24 h. The cell number at each time point was multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor to get a true count. Tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was used for the generation of polymerized microtubules according to the manufacturer's instructions. Taxol-stabilized microtubules (18 μm tubulin dimer) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 1 μm protein in a 50-μl reaction volume in BRB80 buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) with 100 mm NaCl and 4 mm DTT in the presence of 20 μm Taxol. The reaction was then layered onto a 250-μl glycerol cushion buffer (BRB80 buffer, 50% glycerol, 4 mm DTT) and ultracentrifuged for 10 min at 434,400 × g in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor at 25 °C. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein quantification was performed with NIH ImageJ. Normalized binding data were obtained by dividing the values of the pellet fraction by the sum of pellet and supernatant. The middle region of INCENP links the N-terminal centromere/microtubule-targeting domains with the C-terminal Aurora B regulatory domain. This middle region, GgINCENP503–715, has been predicted to form a coiled coil structure that is required for microtubule binding and microtubule-induced activation of Aurora B (24Tseng B.S. Tan L.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequent detailed analysis of the INCENP sequence revealed numerous charged residues at positions of the heptad repeat that would disrupt coiled coil formation. We predicted that GgINCENP503–715 is not a coiled coil but might instead form a stable SAH domain (Fig. 1A) (19Peckham M. Knight P.J. When a predicted coiled coil is really a single α-helix, in myosins and other proteins.Soft Matter. 2009; 5: 2493-2503Google Scholar, 38Peckham M. Coiled coils and SAH domains in cytoskeletal molecular motors.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2011; 39: 1142-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SAH domains are characterized by a highly helical secondary structure, non-cooperative thermal unfolding, and the ability of the peptide to completely refold after thermal denaturation. In addition, SAH domains remain helical up to fairly high salt concentrations (18Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y. Wang F. Kalverda A.P. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Sellers J.R. Peckham M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34702-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we prepared recombinant proteins containing the full-length SAH (INCENP503–715), the N-terminal SAH (INCENP503–597), and the C-terminal SAH (INCENP598–715). The exact position of the break in the sequence was based on analysis of potential ionic interactions between charged amino acid residues so that it did not disturb any of these potential bonds. We then performed CD measurements to investigate the secondary structure of these protein fragments over a range of temperature and salt conditions and looked at their ability to form monomers or dimers by measuring their molecular weight by mass spectrometry. CD spectra revealed that all three proteins were highly helical at 10 °C at 0.1 m NaCl (Fig. 1, B–D). According to this analysis, INCENP503–715 was 85% helical, whereas INCENP503–597 and INCENP598–715 were ∼90 and 88% helical, respectively. All three constructs melted non-cooperatively as expected for SAH domains (Fig. 1E) and refolded after cooling to at least 90% of their initial helical content measured at 10 °C (Fig. 1, B–D). All three constructs remained highly helical up to 2 m NaCl, and then helical content decreased to ∼60% at 4 m NaCl (Fig. 1F), demonstrating the salt-resistant nature expected of an SAH domain (18Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y. Wang F. Kalverda A.P. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Sellers J.R. Peckham M. The predicted coiled-coil domain of myosin 10 forms a novel elongated domain that lengthens the head.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34702-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The helical nature of INCENP503–597 was slightly more resistant to increasing salt concentrations compared with INCENP503–715 and INCENP598–715. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that all of the studied constructs are monomeric with molecular masses of 12, 15.2, and 26.9 kDa for INCENP503–597, INCENP598–715, and INCENP503–715, respectively (data not shown). All of the above strongly suggest that the middle region of INCENP is an SAH domain and not a coiled coil as proposed previously. Consequently, intact INCENP is likely a monomer and not a dimer, which has implications for its mech"
https://openalex.org/W1817551500,"We previously showed that ADAM17 mediates high glucose-induced matrix production by kidney mesangial cells. ADAM17 expression is increased in diabetic kidneys, suggesting that its up-regulation may augment high glucose profibrotic responses. We thus studied the effects of high glucose on ADAM17 gene regulation. Primary rat mesangial cells were treated with high glucose (30 mm) or mannitol as osmotic control. High glucose dose-dependently increased ADAM17 promoter activity, transcript, and protein levels. This correlated with augmented ADAM17 activity after 24 h versus 1 h of high glucose. We tested involvement of transcription factors shown in other settings to regulate ADAM17 transcription. Promoter activation was not affected by NF-κB or Sp1 inhibitors, but was blocked by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) inhibition or down-regulation. This also prevented ADAM17 transcript and protein increases. HIF-1α activation by high glucose was shown by its increased nuclear translocation and activation of the HIF-responsive hypoxia-response element (HRE)-luciferase reporter construct. Assessment of ADAM17 promoter deletion constructs coupled with mutation analysis and ChIP studies identified HIF-1α binding to its consensus element at −607 as critical for the high glucose response. Finally, inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream PI3K/Akt, or ADAM17 itself, prevented high glucose-induced HIF-1α activation and ADAM17 up-regulation. Thus, high glucose induces ADAM17 transcriptional up-regulation in mesangial cells, which is associated with augmentation of its activity. This is mediated by HIF-1α and requires EGFR/ADAM17 signaling, demonstrating the potentiation by ADAM17 of its own up-regulation. ADAM17 inhibition thus provides a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

The kidney is a major site of diabetic microvascular complications, with diabetic nephropathy being the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Glomerular sclerosis, characterized by excess accumulation of extracellular matrix, is the pathologic hallmark of diabetic nephropathy and significantly contributes to declining renal function (1Mason R.M.

We previously showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is transactivated by HG in MC and mediates the profibrotic response of these cells (4Wu D. Peng F. Zhang B. Ingram A.J. Gao B.

In studies to elucidate how the EGFR is activated by HG, we discovered an important role for the metalloprotease ADAM17, the activation of which releases the EGFR ligand HB-EGF. Inhibition of either ADAM17 or HB-EGF prevented glucose-induced up-regulation of the profibrotic cytokine TGFβ1 (6Uttarwar L. Peng F. Wu D. Kumar S. Gao B. Ingram A.J. Krepinsky J.C.

In vivo, short-term treatment of diabetic mice with an inhibitor of metalloproteases, including ADAM17, attenuated glomerular matrix accumulation (7Ford B.M. Eid A.A. Göőz M. Barnes J.L. Gorin Y.C.

Renal Physiol. 2013; 305: F323-F332Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies suggest an important role for ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. However, targeting ADAM17 clinically is complicated by the lack of specificity of currently available inhibitors and/or their toxicity, which precludes their long-term use (8Murumkar P.R. DasGupta S. Chandani S.R. Giridhar R. Yadav M.R. Novel TACE inhibitors in drug discovery: a review of patented compounds.Expert. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2010; 20: 31-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, increased ADAM17 protein expression has been observed in kidneys of both diabetic humans and animal models (9Melenhorst W.B. Visser L. Timmer A. van den Heuvel M.C.

ADAM17 expression may be increased at several levels, including augmented processing from the precursor form to active enzyme, prolonged half-life of the mature enzyme, and increased transcription. The transcriptional response has been seen in response to hypoxia, cytokines, and growth factors, but was also shown to be cell-specific in response to a given stimulus (11Adrain C. Zettl M.

Whether HG increases ADAM17 expression and transcription are unknown and are addressed by our studies. Furthermore, because systemic overexpression of ADAM17 did not enhance shedding activity (15Yoda M. Kimura T. Tohmonda T. Morioka H. Matsumoto M. Okada Y. Toyama Y. Horiuchi K. Systemic overexpression of TNFα-converting enzyme does not lead to enhanced shedding activity in vivo.PLoS One. 2013; 8e54412Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether increases in ADAM17 expression in response to HG correlate with augmented activity. In contrast to ADAM17 activation, comparatively little attention has been given to identifying the mechanism of ADAM17 gene regulation. Both hypoxia and TNFα were shown to induce ADAM17 transcription through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (13Charbonneau M. Harper K. Grondin F. Pelmus M. McDonald P.P. Dubois C.M.

HIF-1β is constitutively expressed, whereas the expression level of HIF-1α is regulated. HIF-1α is continuously synthesized, and under normoxic conditions undergoes hydroxylation and proteasome-mediated degradation. This process is inhibited by hypoxia (16Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. Hypoxia-inducible factor and its biomedical relevance.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), but may also occur under normoxic conditions. Indeed, glucose was shown to activate HIF-1 in MC and in kidneys of diabetic mice (17Isoe T. Makino Y. Mizumoto K. Sakagami H. Fujita Y. Honjo J. Takiyama Y. Itoh H. Haneda M.

We thus also sought to determine whether HIF-1α might be involved in ADAM17 regulation by glucose. In the current study, we demonstrate the transcriptional up-regulation of ADAM17 by HG, mediated by HIF-1. Importantly, ADAM17 up-regulation is associated with greater ADAM17 activation, suggesting a potentiation of its effects on matrix production. This opens a new avenue for targeting ADAM17 synthesis as a potential therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Sprague-Dawley primary rat MC (passages 6–15) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Medium contained 5.6 mmol/liter glucose. Either 24.4 mmol/liter glucose or 24.4 mmol/liter mannitol (final concentration 30 mmol/liter) was added for high glucose or osmotic control, respectively. MC were made quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h prior to treatment.

Cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C, 14,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet cell debris. Supernatant (50 μg) was separated on SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting performed. Antibodies were goat polyclonal ADAM17 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal tubulin (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma), rabbit HIF-1α (1:1000, Sigma), and polyclonal phospho-EGFR Tyr-1068 (1:1000, Sigma). For nuclear lysates, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet containing the nucleus was resuspended in buffer and sonicated. Nuclear protein loading was assessed by immunoblotting for lamin B (goat polyclonal, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MC plated to 85% confluence were transfected with 0.5 μg of various luciferase constructs and 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-gal (Clontech) using Lipofectamine (Qiagen). Luciferase constructs used were the ADAM17 promoter (−2304 to −1), its various deletion constructs, and H4mut in which the hypoxia-response element (HRE) sequence at position −607 is mutated as described previously (13Charbonneau M.

The H1mut was generated by replacing the HRE motif 5′-CAAGTGTG-3′ at position −2279 by 5′-CAAGGCTG-3′ (the mutated base pairs are underlined) in the full-length promoter and confirmed by sequencing. HRE-luciferase, which contains three tandem HRE sites, was obtained from Addgene (plasmid 26731). MC were serum-deprived overnight 24 h after transfection and then exposed to glucose for 24 h. Lysis was achieved with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) using one freeze-thaw cycle, and luciferase and β-gal activities were measured on clarified lysate using specific kits (Promega) with a Berthold luminometer and a plate reader (420 nm), respectively. β-gal activity was used to adjust for transfection efficiency. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). Reverse transcription was performed using standard methods, and cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using a SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems). Amplification using specific primers for ADAM17 with 18S as an internal control was measured continuously using an ABI 7500 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). -Fold change over control was calculated using the ΔΔCt method. After treatment, protein was extracted from MC lysed in activity assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, 10 mm ZnCl2). ADAM17 activity was measured in duplicate for each sample using 20 μg of protein and the TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) substrate IV (Calbiochem). Cleavage of this substrate was measured in a fluorometer at 420 nm. Rat HIF-1α siGENOME siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. HB-EGF and ADAM17 Silencer Select siRNA and control non-targeting siRNA were purchased from Applied Biosystems. MC were transfected with 200 nm HIF-1α or 100 nm ADAM17 or HB-EGF using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) at 60% confluence. After 48 h, cells were serum-deprived for 24 h, and cell response to HG assessed. Protein expression was used to assess the efficacy of down-regulation by RNAi. After treatment, MC were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, washed, and scraped into cold PBS with protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl,1.5 mm MgCl2,0.2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors), incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged. The pellet (nucleus) was resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors) and sonicated 5 × 10 s, and Triton buffer was added (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). An aliquot was reserved as the input, and the remainder was divided to immunoprecipitate with control goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or goat HIF-1α (R&D Systems) antibodies followed by incubation with protein G beads. Samples were washed three times in Triton buffer, SDS buffer was added (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 10 mm DTT, 2 μl of proteinase K (40 mg/ml)), and then samples were vortexed and incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-linking. DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction and resuspended in distilled H2O. PCR was performed using the following primers to amplify the HRE site at −607: 5′-CAGTCCCCTGAGCATTTTCAGTGACAA (forward) and 5′-CGTGATTAAAGTCCCCTTCAGCGTC (reverse), at 55 °C annealing temperature for 36 cycles. MC were washed in PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 1% BSA/3% donkey serum, and incubated with mouse HIF-1 (1:50, R&D Systems). After incubation with secondary antibody (donkey Alexa Fluor 488), mounting medium was applied, and the slide was imaged. Type 1 diabetic male Akita mice (C57Bl/6) and their wild-type counterparts were housed under standard conditions with free access to regular chow and water. Procedures were approved by the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM) Animal Care Committee and conformed to Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. Mice were euthanized at 20 weeks of age, and kidneys were harvested. HIF-1α was assessed by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed sections. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was used. ADAM17 was assessed on cortical sections stored in OCT by immunofluorescent staining as described (21Shi Y. Lo C.S. Padda R. Abdo S. Chenier I. Filep J.G. Ingelfinger J.R. Zhang S.L. Chan J.S.

Sci. (Lond.). 2015; 128: 649-66310.1042/CS20140329Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Primary antisera used were mouse HIF-1α (1:20, R&D Systems) and rabbit polyclonal ADAM17 (1:100, Enzo Life Sciences). Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 22 for Windows using one-way analysis of variance, with Tukey's honest significant difference for post hoc analysis for experiments with more than two groups. A p value < 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered significant. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The number of experimental repetitions is denoted by n. Increased mesangial expression of ADAM17 has been noted in human diabetic nephropathy (9Melenhorst W.B. Visser L. Timmer A. van den Heuvel M.C. Stegeman C.A. van Goor H. ADAM17 upregulation in human renal disease: a role in modulating TGF-α availability?.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F781-F790Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We thus wanted to determine whether HG can increase ADAM17 expression in primary MC. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, 24–48 h of HG, but not 24 h of the osmotic control mannitol, increased ADAM17 protein levels. To assess whether glucose regulates ADAM17 at the transcriptional level, we tested its effects on the ADAM17 promoter using a promoter-luciferase construct. Fig. 1C shows increased luciferase activation by HG. ADAM17 transcript levels are correspondingly increased, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). We next tested the effects of increasing concentrations of glucose on ADAM17 regulation. Fig. 1, E and F, show the dose-dependent effects of HG on ADAM17 protein and promoter activation, respectively, with significant up-regulation seen at higher concentrations of glucose. To verify that elevated ADAM17 levels were meaningful, we tested ADAM17 activity in cell lysates. Fig. 1G shows significantly increased ADAM17 activity after 24 h of HG as compared with shorter-term (1-h) incubation. Fig. 1H demonstrates the dose-dependent effects of HG (1 h) on ADAM17 activation. Thus, HG regulates ADAM17 both through activation of the enzyme, seen with early HG responses, as well as through gene and protein up-regulation, seen with longer-term HG exposure (24 h). Furthermore, longer-term ADAM17 up-regulation is also associated with greater ADAM17 activation, suggesting a potentiation of its effects on matrix production. The ADAM17 promoter contains multiple Sp1 and HIF-1 binding sites, but no consensus TATA box or AP1 sites. HIF-1 mediated hypoxia-induced ADAM17 up-regulation, in some cases with Sp1 (13Charbonneau M. Harper K. Grondin F. Pelmus M. McDonald P.P. Dubois C.M.

Using inhibitors of NF-κB (SC-514) and Sp1 (mithramycin A), we excluded a role for these transcription factors in glucose-induced ADAM17 promoter activation in MC (Fig. 2A). However, the HIF-1α inhibitor 400083 potently reduced both basal and glucose-induced ADAM17 promoter activity (Fig. 2B). HIF-1 activity is regulated by altering its expression levels (16Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. Hypoxia-inducible factor and its biomedical relevance.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To confirm increased HIF-1 activation by HG in our culture conditions, MC were treated for 24–48 h, and the presence of HIF-1α in nuclear extracts was assessed. Fig. 2C shows increased HIF-1 at both time points. This corresponded to increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity as assessed by activation of a reporter luciferase construct containing tandem HREs (Fig. 2D). As a control, mannitol had no effect on HIF-1 activation. We next verified that HIF-1 inhibition also suppresses HG-induced ADAM17 transcript and protein up-regulation (Fig. 2, E and F). Furthermore, down-regulation of HIF-1α using siRNA prevented glucose-induced ADAM17 promoter luciferase activation and protein up-regulation (Fig. 2, G and H). Successful HIF-1α down-regulation by siRNA is shown in Fig. 2H. We next confirmed the functional role of HIF-1α in enhanced ADAM17 activation associated with its up-regulation with longer-term HG exposure. Fig. 2I shows that HIF-1α inhibition does not prevent ADAM17 activation in response to 1 h of HG, but does prevent the increased ADAM17 activity seen after 24 h of HG. To determine whether increased HIF-1α and ADAM17 are also observed in vivo, we performed imaging on kidneys from Akita mice. These mice harbor a spontaneous mutation in the insulin 2 gene, leading to low insulin levels and the development of type 1 diabetes with significant hyperglycemia by 3 weeks of age. Kidneys from 20-week-old mice were assessed. Fig. 3A shows a clear increase in HIF-1α expression in diabetic glomeruli (arrows) as well as in some tubules (asterisks). ADAM17 expression is also significantly increased in diabetic glomeruli as compared with glomeruli in control kidneys (Fig. 3B; glomeruli are identified by arrows). As described and illustrated by Charbonneau et al. (13Charbonneau M. Harper K. Grondin F. Pelmus M. McDonald P.P. Dubois C.M. Hypoxia-inducible factor mediates hypoxic and tumor necrosis factor α-induced increases in tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme/ADAM17 expression by synovial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33714-33724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the ADAM17 promoter contains six putative HIF-1-responsive sites, four of which have the HIF-1 binding sequence and two of which have the HIF-1 binding sequence in association with a HIF-1 ancillary sequence. To determine which site(s) regulate the glucose response in MC, we tested a series of ADAM17 promoter deletion constructs that successively isolate each of the putative HRE sites (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows a significant reduction in the glucose response with the −1567 and −410 constructs as compared with the full-length −2304 construct. These constructs correspond to deletion of the H1 and H4 sites, respectively, at positions −2279 and −607. To determine whether loss of the HRE in these constructs was responsible for the attenuated glucose response, the H1 and H4 sites were mutated in the full-length construct and their response to HG was tested. As seen in Fig. 4, C and D, only mutation of H4 abrogated glucose-induced promoter activation. HIF-1α binding at this site was confirmed using ChIP (Fig. 4E). This was prevented by the HIF-1α inhibitor 400083. These data support an important role for HIF-1α in mediating HG-induced ADAM17 up-regulation in MC through its binding to the H4 site.

AR signaling is the principal target for prostate cancer treatment, but current androgen-deprivation therapies cannot completely abolish AR signaling because of the heterogeneity of prostate cancers. Therefore, unraveling the mechanism of AR reactivation in androgen-depleted conditions can identify effective prostate cancer therapeutic targets. Increasing evidence indicates that AR activity is mediated by the interplay of modifying/demodifying enzymatic co-regulators. To better understand the mechanism of AR transcriptional activity regulation, we used antibodies against AR for affinity purification and identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 7, USP7 as a novel AR co-regulator in prostate cancer cells. We showed that USP7 associates with AR in an androgen-dependent manner and mediates AR deubiquitination. Sequential ChIP assays indicated that USP7 forms a complex with AR on androgen-responsive elements of target genes upon stimulation with the androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Further investigation indicated that USP7 is necessary to facilitate androgen-activated AR binding to chromatin. Transcriptome profile analysis of USP7-knockdown LNCaP cells also revealed the essential role of USP7 in the expression of a subset of androgen-responsive genes.

https://openalex.org/W1930830039,"The electrogenic Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) mediates bidirectional Ca movements that are highly sensitive to changes of Na gradients in many cells. NCX1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure and a number of cardiac arrhythmias. We measured NCX1 palmitoylation using resin-assisted capture, the subcellular location of yellow fluorescent protein-NCX1 fusion proteins, and NCX1 currents using whole-cell voltage clamping. Rat NCX1 is substantially palmitoylated in all tissues examined. Cysteine 739 in the NCX1 large intracellular loop is necessary and sufficient for NCX1 palmitoylation. Palmitoylation of NCX1 occurs in the Golgi and anchors the NCX1 large regulatory intracellular loop to membranes. Surprisingly, palmitoylation does not influence trafficking or localization of NCX1 to surface membranes, nor does it strongly affect the normal forward or reverse transport modes of NCX1. However, exchangers that cannot be palmitoylated do not inactivate normally (leading to substantial activity in conditions when wild-type exchangers are inactive) and do not promote cargo-dependent endocytosis that internalizes 50% of the cell surface following strong G-protein activation or large Ca transients. The palmitoylated cysteine in NCX1 is found in all vertebrate and some invertebrate NCX homologs. Thus, NCX palmitoylation ubiquitously modulates Ca homeostasis and membrane domain function in cells that express NCX proteins.—Reilly, L., Howie, J., Wypijewski, K., Ashford, M. L. J., Hilgemann, D.

https://openalex.org/W1520430035,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are fundamental signal transduction modules in plants, controlling cell division, development, hormone signaling, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. Although MAPKs have been investigated in several plant species, a comprehensive analysis of the MAPK gene family has hitherto not been performed in Brassica rapa. In this study, we identified 32 MAPKs in the B. rapa genome by conducting BLASTP and syntenic block analyses, and screening for the essential signature motif (TDY or TEY) of plant MAPK proteins. Of the 32 BraMAPK genes retrieved from the Brassica Database, 13 exhibited exon splicing errors, excessive splicing of the 5' sequence, excessive retention of the 5' sequence, and sequencing errors of the 3' end. Phylogenetic trees of the 32 corrected MAPKs from B. rapa and of MAPKs from other plants generated by the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods suggested that BraMAPKs could be divided into four groups (groups A, B, C, and D). Gene number expansion was observed for BraMAPK genes in groups A and D, which may have been caused by the tandem duplication and genome triplication of the ancestral genome of the Brassica progenitor. Except for five members of the BraMAPK10 subfamily, the identified BraMAPKs were expressed in most of the tissues examined, including callus, root, stem, leaf, flower, and silique. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that at least six and five BraMAPKs were induced or repressed by various abiotic stresses and hormone treatments, respectively, suggesting their potential roles in the abiotic stress response and various hormone signal transduction pathways in B. rapa. This study provides valuable insight into the putative physiological and biochemical functions of MAPK genes in B. rapa."
https://openalex.org/W2122069948,"During tumor progression, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which influences metastatic success. Mutation-dependent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in gain of mesenchymal phenotype and loss of differentiation in several solid tumors; however, similar mutations are rare in most EOC histotypes. Nevertheless, evidence for activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in EOC has been reported, and immunohistochemical analysis of human EOC tumors demonstrates nuclear staining in all histotypes. This study addresses the hypothesis that the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), prevalent in the EOC microenvironment, functions to regulate EMT in EOC. Our results demonstrate that LPA induces loss of junctional β-catenin, stimulates clustering of β1 integrins, and enhances the conformationally active population of surface β1 integrins. Furthermore, LPA treatment initiates nuclear translocation of β-catenin and transcriptional activation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes resulting in gain of mesenchymal marker expression. Together these data suggest that LPA initiates EMT in ovarian tumors through β1-integrin-dependent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, providing a novel mechanism for mutation-independent activation of this pathway in EOC progression."
https://openalex.org/W922142870,"Global climate is changing due to increasing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Forest managers need growth and yield models that can be used to predict future forest dynamics during the transition period of present-day forests under a changing climatic regime. In this study, we developed a forest growth and yield model that can be used to predict individual-tree growth under current and projected future climatic conditions. The model was constructed by integrating historical tree growth records with predictions from an ecological process-based model using neural networks. The new model predicts basal area (BA) and volume growth for individual trees in pure or mixed species forests. For model development, tree-growth data under current climatic conditions were obtained using over 3000 permanent sample plots from the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Data to reflect tree growth under a changing climatic regime were projected with JABOWA-3 (an ecological process-based model). Model validation with designated data produced model efficiencies of 0.82 and 0.89 in predicting individual-tree BA and volume growth. Model efficiency is a relative index of model performance, where 1 indicates an ideal fit, while values lower than zero means the predictions are no better than the average of the observations. Overall mean prediction error (BIAS) of basal area and volume growth predictions was nominal (i.e., for BA: -0.0177 cm(2) 5-year(-1) and volume: 0.0008 m(3) 5-year(-1)). Model variability described by root mean squared error (RMSE) in basal area prediction was 40.53 cm(2) 5-year(-1) and 0.0393 m(3) 5-year(-1) in volume prediction. The new modelling approach has potential to reduce uncertainties in growth and yield predictions under different climate change scenarios. This novel approach provides an avenue for forest managers to generate required information for the management of forests in transitional periods of climate change. Artificial intelligence technology has substantial potential in forest modelling."

Here, measured kinetics of cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion demonstrated quantitatively that treatment with activating, anti-E-cadherin antibodies or the dephosphorylation of a cytoplasmic binding partner, p120ctn, increased the homophilic binding affinity of E-cadherin. Results obtained with Colo 205 cells, which express inactive E-cadherin and do not aggregate, demonstrated that four treatments, which induced Colo 205 aggregation and p120ctn dephosphorylation, triggered quantitatively similar increases in E-cadherin affinity.

The anti-tumor efficacy of EpCAM aptamer-siEpCAM chimera (EpApt-siEp) was evaluated by qPCR, northern and Western blotting in WERI-Rb1- RB cell line, primary RB tumor cells and in MCF7- breast cancer cell line. Anti-tumor activity of EpApt-siEp was studied in vivo using epithelial cancer (MCF7) mice xenograft model. The mechanism and pathways involved in the anti-tumor activity was further studied using protein arrays and qPCR. EpApt-siEp chimera was processed in vitro by dicer enzyme. Treatment of the WERI-Rb1 and MCF7 cells with EpApt-siEp revealed statistically significant down regulation of EpCAM expression (P<0.005) and concomitant reduction in cellular proliferation. In primary RB cells cultured from RB tumors, EpApt-siEp silenced EpCAM, significantly inhibited (P<0.01) cell proliferation and induced cytotoxicity. Knockdown of EpICD expressed in RB primary tumors led to repression of pluripotency markers, SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and CD133. In vivo studies showed complete tumor growth regression without any toxicity in animals (P<0.001) and tumor tissues showed significant downregulation (P<0.05) of EpCAM, MRP1, ABCG2, stathmin, survivin and upregulation of ATM (P<0.05) leading to apoptosis by intrinsic pathway with minor alteration in cytokines.

https://openalex.org/W889084464,"Purpose To examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a large British cohort study. Methods The EPIC Norfolk Eye study is nested in a larger prospective cohort study. Data on cardiovascular risk factors were collected at baseline (1993-1997) and follow up (2006-2011) via clinical examination, validated lifestyle questionnaires and serum blood samples. AMD was ascertained using standardised grading of fundus photographs at the follow up. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between baseline and follow up risk factors with AMD. Results 5,344 pairs (62.0% of total 8623) of fundus photographs were of sufficient quality for grading of AMD in participants with mean age of 67.4 years old (range 44-91) at diagnosis. There were 28 cases of late AMD (0.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.3-0.8%) and 645 cases of early AMD (12.1%, 95%CI=11.2-13.0.%). In multivariable analysis, older people with higher levels of baseline high density lipoprotein- cholesterol (HDL-C ) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were more likely to have any signs of AMD, after adjusting for sex, education, smoking, and systolic blood pressure. In cross sectional analysis, only older age and higher HDL were significantly associated with AMD. Conclusions We have found that older age and higher levels of CRP and HDL-C were associated with increased odds of AMD in this population in the longitudinal analysis, but older age and HDL-C, not CRP was significantly associated with AMD in the cross sectional analysis. The prevalence of AMD in this cohort was low compared to other cohorts in Europe, the US and Australia, and probably reflects the some selection biases in follow up participation as well as the low rate of smoking among our healthy participants."
https://openalex.org/W1517711090,"The inability to match rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with the anti-cytokine agent most efficacious for them is a major hindrance to patients’ speedy recovery and to the clinical use of anti-cytokine therapy. Identifying predictive biomarkers that can assist in matching RA patients with more suitable anti-cytokine treatment was our aim in this report. The sample consisted of 138 RA patients (naïve and non-naïve) who were administered tocilizumab or etanercept for a minimum of 16 weeks as a prescribed RA treatment. Pretreatment serum samples were obtained from patients and clinical measures of their disease activity were evaluated at baseline and 16 weeks after treatment commenced. Using patients’ pretreatment serum, we measured 31 cytokines/chemokines/soluble receptors and used multiple linear regression analysis to identify biomarkers that correlated with patients’ symptom levels (DAS28-CRP score) at week 16 and multiple logistic analyses for biomarkers that correlated with patients’ final outcome. The results revealed that sgp130, logIL-6, logIL-8, logEotaxin, logIP-10, logVEGF, logsTNFR-I and logsTNFR-II pretreatment serum levels were predictive of the week 16 DAS28-CRP score in naïve tocilizumab patients while sgp130, logGM-CSF and logIP-10 were predictive in non-naïve patients. Additionally, we found logIL-9, logVEGF and logTNF-α to be less reliable at predicting the week 16 DAS28-CRP score in naïve etanercept patients. Multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression analyses identified biomarkers that were predictive of remission/non-remission in tocilizumab and etanercept therapy. Although less reliable than those for tocilizumab, we identified a few possible biomarkers for etanercept therapy. The biomarkers for these two therapies differ suggesting that their efficacy will vary for individual patients. We discovered biomarkers in RA pretreatment serum that predicted their week 16 DAS28-CRP score and clinical outcome to tocilizumab therapy. Most of these biomarkers, especially sgp130, are involved in RA pathogenesis and IL-6 signal transduction, which further suggests that they are highly reliable.UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial UMIN000016298."

Little was known whether care provided to individuals with multiple chronic conditions in a P4P program were cost-effective. This study investigated cost effectiveness of a diabetes P4P program for caring patients with diabetes alone (DM alone) and diabetes with comorbid hypertension and hyperlipidemia (DMHH) from a single payer perspective in Taiwan. Analyzing data using population-based longitudinal databases, we compared costs and effectiveness between P4P and non-P4P diabetes patient groups in two cohorts. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match comparable control groups for intervention groups. Outcomes included life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), program intervention costs, cost-savings and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). QALYs for P4P patients and non-P4P patients were 2.80 and 2.71 for the DM alone cohort and 2.74 and 2.66 for the DMHH patient cohort. The average incremental intervention costs per QALYs was TWD$167,251 in the DM alone cohort and TWD$145,474 in the DMHH cohort. The average incremental all-cause medical costs saved by the P4P program per QALYs were TWD$434,815 in DM alone cohort and TWD$506,199 in the DMHH cohort. The findings indicated that the P4P program for both cohorts were cost-effective and the resulting return on investment (ROI) was 2.60:1 in the DM alone cohort and 3.48:1 in the DMHH cohort. We conclude that the diabetes P4P program in both cohorts enabled the long-term cost-effective use of resources and cost-savings, especially for patients with multiple comorbid conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1900349984,"Human prion diseases can have acquired, sporadic, or genetic origins, each of which results in the conversion of prion protein (PrP) to transmissible, pathological forms. The genetic prion disease Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome can arise from point mutations of prolines 102 or 105. However, the structural effects of these two prolines, and mutations thereof, on PrP misfolding are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that individual mutations of Pro-102 or Pro-105 to noncyclic aliphatic residues such as the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker-linked leucines can promote the in vitro formation of PrP amyloid with extended protease-resistant cores reminiscent of infectious prions. This effect was enhanced by additional charge-neutralizing mutations of four nearby lysine residues comprising the so-called central lysine cluster. Substitution of these proline and lysine residues accelerated PrP conversion such that spontaneous amyloid formation was no longer slower than scrapie-seeded amyloid formation. Thus, Pro-102 and Pro-105, as well as the lysines in the central lysine cluster, impede amyloid formation by PrP, implicating these residues as key structural modulators in the conversion of PrP to disease-associated types of amyloid."
https://openalex.org/W918374988,"Introduction In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), an estimated 74.7 million individuals are hypertensive. Reducing the growing burden of hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa will require a variety of strategies one of which is identifying the extent to which actions originating at the health systems level improves optimal management and control. Methods and Results We conducted a narrative synthesis of available papers examining health systems factors influencing optimal hypertension in SSA. Eligible studies included those that analyzed the impact of health systems on hypertension awareness, treatment, control and medication adherence. Twenty-five articles met the inclusion criteria and the narrative synthesis identified the following themes: 1) how physical resources influence mechanisms supportive of optimal hypertension control; 2) the role of human resources with enabling and/or inhibiting hypertension control goals; 3) the availability and/or use of intellectual resources; 4) how health systems financing facilitate and/or compromise access to products necessary for optimal hypertension control. Conclusion The findings highlight the need for further research on the health systems factors that influence management and control of hypertension in the region."
https://openalex.org/W1536855961,"Abnormal extracranial venous drainage modality has been considered an etiology of transient global amnesia (TGA). Evidence suggests that the transmission of the intrathoracic/intraabdominal pressure during a Valsalva maneuver (VM) is mainly through the vertebral venous system, and patency of internal jugular vein (IJV) is essential for venous drainage and pressure releasing. We hypothesize that obstruction of IJV venous drainage is a contributing factor in TGA pathogenesis. A magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol was used in 45 TGA patients and 45 age- and sex-matched controls to assess the morphologies of IJV, brachiocephalic vein (BCV) and asymmetry of transverse sinus (TS). The IJV was divided into the upper- and middle-IJV segments. Compared to the controls, TGA patients had significantly higher rates of moderate and severe compression/stenosis at the bilateral upper-IJV segment (left: 37.8% vs. 17.8%, P = 0.0393; right: 57.8% vs.15.6%, P<0.0012), in left BCV (60% vs. 8.9%, P<0.0004), and in TS hypoplasia (53.3%% vs. 31.1%, P = 0.0405). The prevalence of at least one site of venous compression/stenosis in IJV or BCV was significantly higher in patients than in controls (91.1% vs. 33.3%, P<0.0004). The diameter of the left TS in MRV, but not in T1 contrast imaging, was significantly smaller in TGA patients than in controls (0.31 ± 0.21 vs. 0.41 ± 0.19, P = 0.0290), which was compatible with downstream venous stenosis/obstruction. TGA patients have a higher prevalence of compression/stenosis of the bilateral IJV and the left BCV and TS hypoplasia, which is new evidence that supports the role of extracranial veins in TGA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1611129798,"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare genetic cardiac arrhythmia that can lead to sudden cardiac death in patients with a structurally normal heart. Genetic variations in SCN5A can be identified in approximately 20-25% of BrS cases. The aim of our work was to determine the spectrum and prevalence of genetic variations in a Spanish cohort diagnosed with BrS.We directly sequenced fourteen genes reported to be associated with BrS in 55 unrelated patients clinically diagnosed. Our genetic screening allowed the identification of 61 genetic variants. Of them, 20 potentially pathogenic variations were found in 18 of the 55 patients (32.7% of the patients, 83.3% males). Nineteen of them were located in SCN5A, and had either been previously reported as pathogenic variations or had a potentially pathogenic effect. Regarding the sequencing of the minority genes, we discovered a potentially pathogenic variation in SCN2B that was described to alter sodium current, and one nonsense variant of unknown significance in RANGRF. In addition, we also identified 40 single nucleotide variations which were either synonymous variants (four of them had not been reported yet) or common genetic variants. We next performed MLPA analysis of SCN5A for the 37 patients without an identified genetic variation, and no major rearrangements were detected. Additionally, we show that being at the 30-50 years range or exhibiting symptoms are factors for an increased potentially pathogenic variation discovery yield.In summary, the present study is the first comprehensive genetic evaluation of 14 BrS-susceptibility genes and MLPA of SCN5A in a Spanish BrS cohort. The mean pathogenic variation discovery yield is higher than that described for other European BrS cohorts (32.7% vs 20-25%, respectively), and is even higher for patients in the 30-50 years age range."
https://openalex.org/W1599027852,"Human mesotrypsin is highly homologous to other mammalian trypsins, and yet it is functionally unique in possessing resistance to inhibition by canonical serine protease inhibitors and in cleaving these inhibitors as preferred substrates. Arg-193 and Ser-39 have been identified as contributors to the inhibitor resistance and cleavage capability of mesotrypsin, but it is not known whether these residues fully account for the unusual properties of mesotrypsin. Here, we use human cationic trypsin as a template for engineering a gain of catalytic function, assessing mutants containing mesotrypsin-like mutations for resistance to inhibition by bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and amyloid precursor protein Kunitz protease inhibitor (APPI), and for the ability to hydrolyze these inhibitors as substrates. We find that Arg-193 and Ser-39 are sufficient to confer mesotrypsin-like resistance to inhibition; however, compared with mesotrypsin, the trypsin-Y39S/G193R double mutant remains 10-fold slower at hydrolyzing BPTI and 2.5-fold slower at hydrolyzing APPI. We identify two additional residues in mesotrypsin, Lys-74 and Asp-97, which in concert with Arg-193 and Ser-39 confer the full catalytic capability of mesotrypsin for proteolysis of BPTI and APPI. Novel crystal structures of trypsin mutants in complex with BPTI suggest that these four residues function cooperatively to favor conformational dynamics that assist in dissociation of cleaved inhibitors. Our results reveal that efficient inhibitor cleavage is a complex capability to which at least four spatially separated residues of mesotrypsin contribute. These findings suggest that inhibitor cleavage represents a functional adaptation of mesotrypsin that may have evolved in response to positive selection pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1750491904,"Antigen presentation is a critical step bridging innate immune recognition and specific immune memory. In mammals, the process is orchestrated by dendritic cells (DCs) in the lymphatic system, which initiate clonal proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes. However, fish lack a classical lymphatic system and there are currently no cellular markers for DCs in fish, thus antigen-presentation in fish is poorly understood. Recently, antigen-presenting cells similar in structure and function to mammalian DCs were identified in various fish, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). The present study aimed to identify a potential molecular marker for DCs in fish and therefore targeted DC-SCRIPT, a well-conserved zinc finger protein that is preferentially expressed in all sub-types of human DCs. Putative dendritic cells were obtained in culture by maturation of spleen and pronephros-derived monocytes. DC-SCRIPT was identified in barramundi by homology using RACE PCR and genome walking. Specific expression of DC-SCRIPT was detected in barramundi cells by Stellaris mRNA FISH, in combination with MHCII expression when exposed to bacterial derived peptidoglycan, suggesting the presence of DCs in L. calcarifer. Moreover, morphological identification was achieved by light microscopy of cytospins prepared from these cultures. The cultured cells were morphologically similar to mammalian and trout DCs. Migration assays determined that these cells have the ability to move towards pathogens and pathogen associated molecular patterns, with a preference for peptidoglycans over lipopolysaccharides. The cells were also strongly phagocytic, engulfing bacteria and rapidly breaking them down. Barramundi DCs induced significant proliferation of responder populations of T-lymphocytes, supporting their role as antigen presenting cells. DC-SCRIPT expression in head kidney was higher 6 and 24 h following intraperitoneal challenge with peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide and declined after 3 days relative to PBS-injected controls. Relative expression was also lower in the spleen at 3 days post challenge but increased again at 7 days. As DC-SCRIPT is a constitutively expressed nuclear receptor, independent of immune activation, this may indicate initial migration of immature DCs from head kidney and spleen to the injection site, followed by return to the spleen for maturation and antigen presentation. DC-SCRIPT may be a valuable tool in the investigation of antigen presentation in fish and facilitate optimisation of vaccines and adjuvants for aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W1770756340,"The Hac1 transcription factor in yeast up-regulates a collection of genes that control protein homeostasis. Base-pairing interactions between sequences in the intron and the 5′-untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the HAC1 mRNA represses Hac1 protein production under basal conditions, whereas cytoplasmic splicing of the intron by the Ire1 kinase-endonuclease, activated under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, relieves the inhibition and enables Hac1 synthesis. Using a random mutational screen as well as site-directed mutagenesis, we identify point mutations within the 5′ UTR-intron interaction site that derepress translation of the unspliced HAC1 mRNA. We also show that insertion of an in-frame AUG start codon upstream of the interaction site releases the translational block, demonstrating that an elongating ribosome can disrupt the interaction. Moreover, overexpression of translation initiation factor eIF4A, a helicase, enhances production of Hac1 from an mRNA containing an upstream AUG start codon at the beginning of the base-paired region. These results suggest that the major block of translation occurs at the initiation stage. Supporting this interpretation, the point mutations that enhanced Hac1 production resulted in an increased percentage of the HAC1 mRNA associating with polysomes versus free ribosomal subunits. Thus, our results provide evidence that the 5′ UTR-intron interaction represses translation initiation on the unspliced HAC1 mRNA.

Thus, our results provide evidence that the 5′ UTR-intron interaction represses translation initiation on the unspliced HAC1 mRNA. In eukaryotic cells mRNA translation begins with the ordered assembly of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet), and initiation factors at the 5′-end of an mRNA (1Hinnebusch A.G.

Typically, the first AUG codon encountered by the scanning PIC is selected as the translation start site in part due to base-pairing interactions between the anticodon loop of the Met-tRNAiMet and the AUG codon. After selection of the start codon, initiation factors dissociate from the PIC, and the 60S ribosomal subunit joins yielding an 80S ribosomal complex (2Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation: new insights and challenges.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4a011544 Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).

In addition to alterations in the activity of initiation factors, translation is also controlled by cis-acting mRNA elements (3Kozak M. Regulation of translation via mRNA structure in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Gene. 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). For example, binding of the translation factor eIF4E to the 5′-m7G (7-methylguanosine)-cap and the poly(A)-binding protein PABP to the 3′-poly(A) tail facilitates ribosome recruitment to an mRNA (4Tarun Jr., S.Z.

In addition, nucleotide sequence context (the Kozak consensus motif) flanking an AUG or non-canonical start codon impacts the efficiency with which a scanning ribosome selects a translation start site (3Kozak M. Regulation of translation via mRNA structure in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Gene. 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Moreover, secondary structure in the 5′ UTR can interfere with PIC binding or scanning and thereby block translation (3Kozak M.

Translation of mRNAs with more secondary structure shows a greater requirement for the RNA helicase eIF4A (1Hinnebusch A.G. The scanning mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 779-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Additionally, out-of-frame AUG start codons and upstream open reading frames (ORFs) in the 5′ leader can restrict access of the ribosome to the main ORF. A classic example is the yeast GCN4 mRNA in which short upstream ORFs potentiate translation of the main GCN4 ORF and confer heightened dependence on translation factor activity (9Hinnebusch A.G. Translational regulation of GCN4 and the general amino acid control of yeast.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In addition to these important roles of sequences in the 5′ UTR, sequence elements in the 3′ UTR can also modulate translation.

A unique strategy is observed in regulating translation of the yeast HAC1 mRNA involving the 5′ UTR and the intron (13Rüegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P.

The intron (spanning nucleotides G661 to G913, with the adenine of AUG start codon assigned as 1) is not spliced in the nucleus by the spliceosome but instead is retained in the mRNA that is exported to the cytoplasm (14Chapman R.E. Walter P. Translational attenuation mediated by an mRNA intron.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 850-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).

Walter P. tRNA ligase is required for regulated mRNA splicing in the unfolded protein response.Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), resulting in an altered ORF with a new codon starting at nucleotide G661 and a UAG stop codon at nucleotide 963 (see Fig. 1A). Finally, the 3′ UTR has been reported to positively regulate translation of the spliced HAC1 mRNA (18Anshu A. Mannan M.A. Chakraborty A. Chakrabarti S. Dey M.

Li H. Walter P. Gcn4p and novel upstream activating sequences regulate targets of the unfolded protein response.PLos Biol. 2004; 2: E246Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As the Hac1 proteins produced from both the spliced and unspliced mRNA are functional transcription factors (15Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced mRNA splicing permits synthesis of transcription factor Hac1p/Ern4p that activates the unfolded protein response.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a key element in the UPR is repression of translation of the unspliced Hac1 mRNA. Despite much progress in understanding the regulation of HAC1 mRNA translation, the molecular mechanism is not yet clear. To gain mechanistic insights into HAC1 mRNA translation, we conducted a genetic screen to identify intragenic mutations that enable a splicing-deficient and translationally inert HAC1 mRNA (i.e. HAC1-G661C) to produce a Hac1 protein capable of stimulating the ER stress response. From this screen we identified a single base mutation (i.e. G771A) in the intron that is predicted to disrupt the base-pairing interaction with the 5′ UTR (13Rüegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P. Block of HAC1 mRNA translation by long-range base pairing is released by cytoplasmic splicing upon induction of the unfolded protein response.Cell. 2001; 107: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), suggesting that disruption of the 5′ UTR-intron interaction leads to translation of the HAC1-G661C,G771A mRNA without splicing. Consistent with the notion that the 5′ UTR-intron interaction interferes with ribosomal scanning and translation initiation on the HAC1 mRNA, introduction of an upstream in-frame AUG codon before the 5′ UTR-intron base-pairing region relieved the translational block on the HAC1 mRNA. Taken together, in contrast to previously proposed models, our data reveal a unique mechanism of intron-mediated inhibition of ribosomal scanning. The ire1Δ (MATa his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met5-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 ire1::KanMX) and hac1Δ (MATa his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met5-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 hac1::KanMX) yeast strains were obtained from the yeast genome deletion collection. Strain J751 (MATa his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met5-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 ire1:NAT) was derived by replacing KanMX4 in the ire1Δ strain with the nourseothricin-resistance (NAT) marker gene. The hac1Δ ire1Δ (MATa his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met5-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 ire1:NAT hac1::KanMX) double deletion strain J772 was constructed by replacing HAC1 with KanMX4 in strain J751. Strain J1167 (MATa his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met5-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 ire1:NAT HAC1-G767C,G768C) was constructed by integration of plasmid pC4070 (linearized with AscI) into strain J751. After selection of segregants on 5-fluoroorotic acid, the replacement of the WT HAC1 allele with the HAC1-G767C,G768C intron mutant was confirmed by PCR.

When desired, DTT (5 mm) was added to the medium to induce ER stress, and cells were grown for an additional 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and first strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript-III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. The synthetic cDNA was subjected to RT-PCR and Q-PCR analyses. For RT-PCR, the synthetic cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers specific for HAC1 (forward primer 5′-CGCAATCGAACTTGGCTATCCCTACC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides +35 to +60 of the HAC1 open reading frame (ORF), and reverse primer 5′-GGGTAGACTGTTTCCCGC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides +604 to +621) or ACT1 (forward primer 5′-CTGAAAGAGAAATTGTCCGTG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides +919 to +939 of the ACT1 ORF (numbering includes the intron), and reverse primer 5′-CTTGTGGTGAACGATAGATGG 3′, corresponding to nucleotides +1408 to +1428). For analysis of HAC1 mRNA splicing, the same forward primer was used along with a reverse primer (5′-CCCACCAACAGCGATAATAACGAG-3′) that corresponded to nucleotides +1002 to +1025. PCR products were then resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. For Q-PCR, the synthetic cDNA was amplified on a real time PCR machine (Bio-Rad CFX 3.1) using primers specific for HAC1 (forward primer 5′-CGCAATCGAACTTGGCTATCCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTCTCGAGATACTGCAGATG-3′) or ACT1 (forward primer 5′-CTGAAAGAGAAATTGTCCGTG-3′ and reverse primer5′-GTGATGACTTGACCATCTGG-3′). Experiments were repeated twice, and each sample was run in triplicate. Data were analyzed using CFX 3.1 software, and the threshold (Ct) value was calculated. The Ct value represents the average value of triplicate samples, and these average values were used to calculate the CtHAC1/CtACT1 ratio. Yeast cells were grown in synthetic complete medium to A600 = 0.6. When desired, 5 mm DTT was then added to the medium to induce ER stress, and cells were incubated an additional 4 h before harvesting. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, mixed with 2 volumes of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and then broken by agitation with glass beads. Proteins were extracted with SDS Loading Buffer (2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HC1 (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), and after neutralization with 1 m Tris base, samples were boiled for 5 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised against recombinant Hac1 protein or yeast eIF2α or using anti-HA antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology or Roche Applied Science). Cells were grown to mid-log phase, treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), incubated for 5 min, and harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of Polysome Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide), pelleted, and then resuspended in 1 ml of Polysome Buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 1 mm DTT, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and 4 μl of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen). Cells were broken by vigorous mixing with glass beads at 4 °C using a vortex mixer. WCEs were clarified by centrifugation, and the equivalent of A600 = 25 units was layered on top of 7–47% (w/v) sucrose gradients made in Polysome Buffer containing 1 mm DTT and EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor tablets. Samples were sedimented at 39,000 rpm for 150 min at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Gradients were fractionated while scanning at A254. To isolate RNA, glycogen was added to the sucrose gradient fractions; the fractions were then mixed with ethanol and stored at −20 °C overnight. RNA pellets were collected by sedimentation, resuspended, and then extracted twice with phenol:chloroform. The RNA was then precipitated in ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 30 μl of Loading Buffer (21 μl of H2O, 3 μl of formaldehyde, 3 μl of 10× MOPS buffer, 3 μl of 10× RNA loading dye). Equal volumes (25 μl) were used for Northern analysis. To visualize HAC1 by Northern analysis, RNA samples were separated on a 1.2% agarose, 5% formaldehyde gel in MOPS buffer, transferred to a NyTran membrane (Whatman) overnight in 20× SSC buffer, and then UV cross-linked to the membrane in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). After prehybridization in 12 ml UltraHYB buffer (Ambion) for 2 h at 42 °C, the membrane was incubated with randomly labeled [32P]dCTP probes for HAC1 and ADH1 overnight at 42 °C while rotating. The HAC1 (primers oCB1 (5′-GTCTACGGCAGGTAGCGTCGT-3′) and oCB25 (5′-AATTCGCAATCGAACTTGGCTATCCC-3′)) and ADH1 (primers oCB105 (5′-ATGTCTATCCCAGAAAC-3′) and oCB106 (5′-ACCCAAGACTCTGTAACC-3′)) probes were generated by PCR followed by random-labeling with [32P]dCTP probes (Lofstrand). Blots were washed at 42 °C for 2 × 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer followed by 2 × 15 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer. After the final wash, the RNA was imaged and quantitated using phosphorimaging. Under conditions of ER stress, the endonuclease Ire1 cleaves the phosphodiester bonds after nucleotides G661 and G913 (Fig. 1A) to remove the intron from the HAC1 mRNA (16Sidrauski C. Walter P.

After ligation of the exons, translation of the spliced mRNA yields a Hac1 protein of 238 amino acids (13Rüegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P.

In the absence of splicing, the first in-frame stop codon (UAG) after G661 is located at nucleotide positions 691–693 (see Fig. 1A). This alternate 693-nucleotide ORF in the unspliced mRNA can be translated into a functional Hac1 protein of 230 amino acids (27Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. mRNA splicing-mediated C-terminal replacement of transcription factor Hac1p is required for efficient activation of the unfolded protein response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4660-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), known as the Hac1u isoform (“u” for uninduced; produced under non-stress conditions). However, translation of the unspliced mRNA and, thus, production of Hac1u is repressed by the intron (Fig. 1A, orange), which interacts with the 5′ UTR and somehow blocks translation of the HAC1 ORF (13Rüegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P.

Griffiths-Jones S. Conserved RNA structures in the non-canonical Hac1/Xbp1 intron.RNA Biol. 2011; 8: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To gain mechanistic insights into the intron-mediated translational repression, we screened for intragenic suppressor mutations in a splicing-deficient and translationally inert HAC1-G661C allele (see below), expecting that the second-site mutations would allow ribosomes to bypass the 5′ UTR-intron interaction and produce a Hac1 protein from the unspliced mRNA. Whereas a hac1Δ yeast strain carrying an empty vector grew as well on synthetic dextrose (SD) medium as the same strain expressing HAC1 from a low copy number plasmid (Fig. 1B, rows 1 and 2), growth on SD medium containing the ER stress inducer tunicamycin required HAC1 expression (Fig. 1B, rows 1 and 2). These results are consistent with the previous reports showing that Hac1 function is essential for the ER stress response (21Cox J.S. Walter P.

Signalling from endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus: transcription factor with a basic-leucine zipper motif is required for the unfolded protein-response pathway.Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Mutation of the first Ire1-cleavage site (i.e. G661C) impaired yeast cell growth on tunicamycin medium (Fig. 1B, row 3), suggesting that the G661C mutation reduced the HAC1 mRNA level, mRNA splicing, and/or translation. To determine whether the G661C mutation caused a reduction in HAC1 mRNA levels and/or mRNA splicing, total RNA was extracted from these cells and then used as a template to amplify the HAC1 mRNA as well as an endogenous ACT1 mRNA (housekeeping control) by RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1D, similar amounts of ACT1 mRNA were detected in each RNA sample (lanes 1–3). As expected, no HAC1 mRNA was detected in the hac1Δ strain transformed with an empty vector (Fig. 1D, lane 1), whereas similar amounts of HAC1 mRNA were detected in the strains expressing WT HAC1 (lane 2) or the HAC1-G661C mutant (lane 3). Thus, the tunicamycin-sensitive (TmS) phenotype of the strain expressing the HAC1-G661C mutant is likely not due to reduced HAC1 mRNA levels. To determine whether the G661C mutation impaired mRNA splicing, RT-PCR was performed using primers that readily distinguish the unspliced (HAC1u) and spliced (HAC1s) transcripts. Again, as expected, no HAC1 mRNA was detected in the RNA sample prepared from the hac1Δ strain carrying an empty vector (Fig. 1E, upper panel, lane 1). Consistent with the Ire1 endonuclease functioning at basal levels in unstressedcells, both HAC1u and HAC1s transcripts were amplified from cells expressing WT HAC1 (Fig. 1E, upper panel, lane 2). In cells expressing the HAC1-G661C allele, the vast majority of mRNA was unspliced (HAC1u; Fig. 1E, lane 3), consistent with the idea that the G661C mutation in the first cleavage site impaired HAC1 mRNA splicing and consequently reduced the ER stress response. The defective splicing of the HAC1-G661C mRNA is supported by previous studies showing that mutation of this guanine residue at the cleavage site impairs Ire1 cleavage of the HAC1 mRNA both in vivo and in vitro (16Sidrauski C.

https://openalex.org/W1513570178,"Although there are considerable reports of magnetic field effects (MFE) on organisms, very little is known so far about the MFE-related signal transduction pathways. Here we establish a manipulative near-zero magnetic field (NZMF) to investigate the potential signal transduction pathways involved in MFE. We show that exposure of migratory white-backed planthopper, Sogatella furcifera, to the NZMF results in delayed egg and nymphal development, increased frequency of brachypterous females, and reduced longevity of macropterous female adults. To understand the changes in gene expression underlying these phenotypes, we examined the temporal patterns of gene expression of (i) CRY1 and CRY2 as putative magnetosensors, (ii) JHAMT, FAMeT and JHEH in the juvenile hormone pathway, (iii) CYP307A1 in the ecdysone pathway, and (iv) reproduction-related Vitellogenin (Vg). The significantly altered gene expression of CRY1 and CRY2 under the NZMF suggest their developmental stage-specific patterns and potential upstream location in magnetic response. Gene expression patterns of JHAMT, JHEH and CYP307A1 were consistent with the NZMF-triggered delay in nymphal development, higher proportion of brachypterous female adults, and the shortened longevity of macropterous female adults, which show feasible links between hormone signal transduction and phenotypic MFE. By conducting manipulative NZMF experiments, our study suggests an important role of the geomagnetic field (GMF) in modulating development and physiology of insects, provides new insights into the complexity of MFE-magnetosensitivity interactions, and represents an initial but crucial step forward in understanding the molecular basis of cryptochromes and hormone signal transduction involved in MFE."
https://openalex.org/W2117024528,"The region of Balkans is often considered as an ichthyologic ""hot spot"", with a great number of species and high portion of endemics living in fresh waters in a relatively small area. The Adriatic watershed in Croatia and Herzegovina is inhabited by six spined loach species (genus Cobitis) whose extinction risk estimations were based solely on their extent of occurrence (and/or area of occupancy) and its fragmentation, and conservation proposals do not consider diversity below species level. In this investigation we employed molecular genetic methods to describe present genetic structure of the Adriatic spined loaches and reveal their demographic history. The divergence of the Adriatic lineages inside the genus Cobitis started in Miocene and lasted until Pleistocene epoch. Geological events responsible for shaping recent diversity of spined loaches in the Adriatic basin are: the Dinarid Mountains upwelling, the evolution of Dinaric Lake system, local tectonic activity, river connections during glaciations and differences in sea level. Even though all the investigated species inhabit karstic rivers located in the same geographic area and that were subject of similar geological events, the results obtained reveal great differences in their genetic diversity and structure and point out the necessity of different conservation measures to ensure their future viability. High level of genetic polymorphism is characteristic for species located more to the south. Two species comprised of more than one population have completely different intraspecific structure; populations of C. illyrica are genetically distinct and represent separate evolutionary significant units, whereas intraspecific structure of C. narentana corresponds to metapopulational pattern. Without population genetic data, evolutionary significant units could be easily misidentified. Furthermore, the obtained results affirm that population genetic measurements are able to detect differences among closely located and related species and estimate extinction risk even more accurately than currently applied IUCN criteria."

LBH589, a novel targeted agent, suppresses histone deacetylases in many tumors. This study investigated the antitumor activity of LBH589 in SK-NEP-1 and G401 cells.SK-NEP-1 and G401 cell growth was assessed by CCK-8 and in nude mice experiments. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry detected apoptosis in cell culture. Gene expressions of LBH589-treated tumor cells were analyzed using an Arraystar Human LncRNA Array. The Multi Experiment View cluster software analyzed the expression data. Differentially expressed genes from the cluster analyses were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool.LBH589 inhibited cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1 and G401 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V, TUNEL and Hochest 33342 staining analysis showed that LBH589-treated cells showed more apoptotic features compared with the control. LBH589 treatment inhibited the growth of SK-NEP-1 xenograft tumors in nude mice. Arraystar Human LncRNA Array analysis of genes and lncRNAs regulated by LBH589 identified 6653 mRNAs and 8135 lncRNAs in LBH589-treated SK-NEP-1 cells. The most enriched gene ontology terms were those involved in nucleosome assembly. KEGG pathway analysis identified cell cycle proteins, including CCNA2, CCNB2, CCND1, CCND2, CDK4, CDKN1B and HDAC2, etc. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified important upstream molecules: HIST2H3C, HIST1H4A, HIST1A, HIST1C, HIST1D, histone H1, histone H3, RPRM, HSP70 and MYC.LBH589 treatment caused apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1and G401 cells. LBH589 had a significant effect and few side effects on SK-NEP-1 xenograft tumors. Expression profiling, and GO, KEGG and IPA analyses identified new targets and a new ""network"" of genes responding to LBH589 treatment in SK-NEP-1 cells. RPRM, HSP70 and MYC may be important regulators during LBH589 treatment. Our results provide new clues to the proapoptotic mechanism of LBH589."

It is previously assumed that agents share the identical payoff matrix, but the stratification or diversity exists and exerts influences in real societies. Thus, two additional classes, elites and scoundrels, derive from and coexist with the existing class, commons. Three classes have different payoff matrices. We construct a model where agents play the prisoners' dilemma game with neighbors. It indicates that stratification and temptation jointly influence cooperation. Temptation permanently reduces cooperation; elites play a positive role in promoting cooperation while scoundrels undermine it. As the temptation getting larger and larger, elites play a more and more positive and critical role while scoundrels' negative effect becomes weaker and weaker, and it is more obvious when temptation goes beyond its threshold."
https://openalex.org/W1855653526,"Tumor-associated lymphatic vessels actively participate in tumor progression and dissemination. ADAM17, a sheddase for numerous growth factors, cytokines, receptors, and cell adhesion molecules, is believed to promote tumor development, facilitating both tumor cell proliferation and migration, as well as tumor angiogenesis. In this work we addressed the issue of whether ADAM17 may also promote tumor lymphangiogenesis. First, we found that ADAM17 is important for the migratory potential of immortalized human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). When ADAM17 was stably silenced in LEC, their proliferation was not affected, but: (i) single-cell motility, (ii) cell migration through a 3D Matrigel/collagen type I matrix, and (iii) their ability to form sprouts in a 3D matrix were significantly diminished. The differences in the cell motility between ADAM17-proficient and ADAM17-silenced cells were eliminated by inhibitors of EGFR and HER2, indicating that ADAM17-mediated shedding of growth factors accounts for LEC migratory potential. Interestingly, ADAM17 depletion affected the integrin surface expression/functionality in LEC. ADAM17-silenced cells adhered to plastic, type I collagen, and fibronectin faster than their ADAM17-proficient counterparts. The difference in adhesion to fibronectin was abolished by a cyclic RGD peptide, emphasizing the involvement of integrins in the process. Using a soluble receptor array, we identified BIG-H3 among several candidate proteins involved in the phenotypic and behavioral changes of LEC upon ADAM17 silencing. In additional assays, we confirmed the increased expression of BIG-H3, as well as TGFβ2 in ADAM17-silenced LEC. The antilymphangiogenic effects of ADAM17 silencing in lymphatic endothelial cells suggest further relevance of ADAM17 as a potential target in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1942208622,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Yih1, when overexpressed, inhibits the eIF2 alpha kinase Gcn2 by competing for Gcn1 binding. However, deletion of YIH1 has no detectable effect on Gcn2 activity, suggesting that Yih1 is not a general inhibitor of Gcn2, and has no phenotypic defect identified so far. Thus, its physiological role is largely unknown. Here, we show that Yih1 is involved in the cell cycle. Yeast lacking Yih1 displays morphological patterns and DNA content indicative of a delay in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and this phenotype is independent of Gcn1 and Gcn2. Accordingly, the levels of phosphorylated eIF2α, which show a cell cycle-dependent fluctuation, are not altered in cells devoid of Yih1. We present several lines of evidence indicating that Yih1 is in a complex with Cdc28. Yih1 pulls down endogenous Cdc28 in vivo and this interaction is enhanced when Cdc28 is active, suggesting that Yih1 modulates the function of Cdc28 in specific stages of the cell cycle. We also demonstrate, by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation, that endogenous Yih1 and Cdc28 interact with each other, confirming Yih1 as a bona fide Cdc28 binding partner. Amino acid substitutions within helix H2 of the RWD domain of Yih1 enhance Yih1-Cdc28 association. Overexpression of this mutant, but not of wild type Yih1, leads to a phenotype similar to that of YIH1 deletion, supporting the view that Yih1 is involved through Cdc28 in the regulation of the cell cycle. We further show that IMPACT, the mammalian homologue of Yih1, interacts with CDK1, the mammalian counterpart of Cdc28, indicating that the involvement with the cell cycle is conserved. Together, these data provide insights into the cellular function of Yih1/IMPACT, and provide the basis for future studies on the role of this protein in the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1954046363,"In social networks of human individuals, social relationships do not necessarily last forever as they can either fade gradually with time, resulting in “link aging,” or terminate abruptly, causing “link deletion,” as even old friendships may cease. In this paper, we study a social network formation model where we introduce several ways by which a link termination takes place. If we adopt the link aging, we get a more modular structure with more homogeneously distributed link weights within communities than when link deletion is used. By investigating distributions and relations of various network characteristics, we find that the empirical findings are better reproduced with the link deletion model. This indicates that link deletion plays a more prominent role in organizing social networks than link aging."

https://openalex.org/W929564192,"5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalyzes leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis by a mechanism that involves interactions with 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) and coactosin-like protein (CLP). 5-LO splice variants were recently identified in human myeloid and lymphoid cells, including the catalytically inactive ∆13 isoform (5-LO∆13) whose transcript lacks exon 13. 5-LO∆13 inhibits 5-LO product biosynthesis when co-expressed with active full length 5-LO (5-LO1). The objective of this study was to investigate potential mechanisms by which 5-LO∆13 interferes with 5-LO product biosynthesis in transfected HEK293 cells. When co-expressed with 5-LO1, 5-LO∆13 inhibited LT but not 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) biosynthesis. This inhibition was independent of 5-LO∆13—FLAP interactions since it occurred in cells expressing FLAP or not. In cell-free assays CLP enhances 5-LO activity through interactions with tryptophan-102 of 5-LO. In the current study, the requirement for W102 was extended to whole cells, as cells expressing the 5-LO1-W102A mutant produced little 5-LO products. W102A mutants of 5-LO∆13 inhibited 5-LO product biosynthesis as effectively as 5-LO∆13 suggesting that inhibition is independent of interactions with CLP. Confocal microscopy showed that 5-LO1 was primarily in the nucleoplasm whereas W102A mutants showed a diffuse cellular expression. Despite the retention of known nuclear localisation sequences, 5-LO∆13 was cytosolic and concentrated in ER-rich perinuclear regions where its effect on LT biosynthesis may occur. W102A mutants of 5-LO∆13 showed the same pattern. Consistent with subcellular distribution patterns, 5-LO∆13 was hyper-phosphorylated on S523 and S273 compared to 5-LO1. Together, these results reveal a role for W102 in nuclear targeting of 5-LO1 suggesting that interactions with CLP are required for nuclear localization of 5-LO1, and are an initial characterisation of the 5-LO∆13 isoform whose inhibition of LT biosynthesis appears independent of interactions with CLP and FLAP. Better knowledge of the regulation and properties of alternative 5-LO isoforms will contribute to understanding the complex regulation of LT biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1645584363,"High spatial and angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with network analysis provides a unique framework for the study of brain structure in vivo. DWI-derived brain connectivity patterns are best characterized with graph theory using an edge weight to quantify the strength of white matter connections between gray matter nodes. Here a dimensionless, scale-invariant edge weight is introduced to measure node connectivity. This edge weight metric provides reasonable and consistent values over any size scale (e.g. rodents to humans) used to quantify the strength of connection. Firstly, simulations were used to assess the effects of tractography seed point density and random errors in the estimated fiber orientations; with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), edge weight estimates improve as the seed density increases. Secondly to evaluate the application of the edge weight in the human brain, ten repeated measures of DWI in the same healthy human subject were analyzed. Mean edge weight values within the cingulum and corpus callosum were consistent and showed low variability. Thirdly, using excised rat brains to study the effects of spatial resolution, the weight of edges connecting major structures in the temporal lobe were used to characterize connectivity in this local network. The results indicate that with adequate resolution and SNR, connections between network nodes are characterized well by this edge weight metric. Therefore this new dimensionless, scale-invariant edge weight metric provides a robust measure of network connectivity that can be applied in any size regime."
https://openalex.org/W1604794166,"Sarafotoxin-m (24 amino acids) from the venom of Atractaspis microlepidota microlepidota was the first long-sarafotoxin to be identified, while sarafotoxin-b (21 aa) is a short-sarafotoxin from Atractaspis engaddensis. Despite the presence of three additional C-terminus residues in sarafotoxin-m, these two peptides display a high sequence homology and share similar three-dimensional structures. However, unlike sarafotoxin-b, sarafotoxin-m shows a very low in vitro affinity for endothelin receptors, but still has a very high in vivo toxicity in mammals, similar to that of sarafotoxin-b. We have previously demonstrated, in vitro, the crucial role of the C-terminus extension in terms of pharmacological profiles and receptor affinities of long- versus short-sarafotoxins. One possible hypothesis to explain the high in vivo toxicity of sarafotoxin-m could be that its C-terminus extension is processed in vivo, resulting in short-like sarafotoxin. To address this possibility, we investigated, in the present study, the in vivo cardiovascular effects of sarafotoxin-b, sarafotoxin-m and sarafotoxin-m-Cter (sarafotoxin-m without the C -terminus extension). Male Wistar rats were anaesthetised and mechanically ventilated. Invasive haemodynamic measurements and echocardiographic measurements of left and right ventricular function were performed. The rats were divided into four groups that respectively received intravenous injections of: saline, sarafotoxin-b (one LD50), sarafotoxin-m (one LD50) or sarafotoxin-m-Cter (one LD50). All measurements were performed at baseline, at 1 minute (+1) and at 6 minutes (+6) after injection.Sarafotoxin-b and sarafotoxin-m-Cter decreased cardiac output and impaired left ventricle systolic and diastolic function, whilst sarafotoxin-m decreased cardiac output, increased airway pressures and led to acute right ventricular dilatation associated with a decreased tricuspid annulus peak systolic velocity. Sarafotoxin-b and sarafotoxin-m-Cter appear to exert toxic effects via impairment of left ventricular function, whilst sarafotoxin-m increases airway pressures and impairs right ventricular function. These results do not support the hypothesis of an in vivo processing of long sarafotoxins."

Thioflavin T fluorescence assay as well as fluorescence and transmission microscopies revealed that upon lipid binding, fibril formation by apoA-I 1–83 is strongly inhibited, whereas the G26R mutant still retains the ability to form fibrils. Such distinct effects of lipid binding on fibril formation were also observed for the amyloidogenic prone region-containing peptides, apoA-I 8–33 and 8–33/G26R. This amyloidogenic region shifts from random coil to α-helical structure upon lipid binding. The G26R mutation appears to prevent this helix transition because lower helical propensity and more solvent-exposed conformation of the G26R variant upon lipid binding were observed in the apoA-I 1–83 fragment and 8–33 peptide. With a partially α-helical conformation induced by the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, fibril formation by apoA-I 1–83 was strongly inhibited, whereas the G26R variant can form amyloid fibrils. These findings suggest a new possible pathway for amyloid fibril formation by the N-terminal fragment of apoA-I variants: the amyloidogenic mutations partially destabilize the α-helical structure formed upon association with lipid membranes, resulting in physiologically relevant conformations that allow fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W877016431,"Exposing fully cold-acclimated wheat plants to a mild freeze-thaw cycle of -3 °C for 24h followed by +3 °C for 24 or 48 h results in dramatically improved tolerance of subsequent exposure to sub-freezing temperatures. Gene enrichment analysis of crown tissue from plants collected before or after the -3 °C freeze or after thawing at +3 °C for 24 or 48 h revealed that many biological processes and molecular functions were activated during the freeze-thaw cycle in an increasing cascade of responses such that over 150 processes or functions were significantly enhanced by the end of the 48 h, post-freeze thaw. Nearly 2,000 individual genes were upregulated more than 2-fold over the 72 h course of freezing and thawing, but more than 70% of these genes were upregulated during only one of the time periods examined, suggesting a series of genes and gene functions were involved in activation of the processes that led to enhanced freezing tolerance. This series of functions appeared to include extensive cell signaling, activation of stress response mechanisms and the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, extensive modification of secondary metabolites, and physical restructuring of cell membranes. By identifying plant lines that are especially able to activate these multiple mechanisms it may be possible to develop lines with enhanced winterhardiness."
https://openalex.org/W886330677,"We aimed to examine the extent to which inaccurate assumptions for nuisance parameters used to calculate sample size can affect the power of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a simulation study, we separately considered an RCT with continuous, dichotomous or time-to-event outcomes, with associated nuisance parameters of standard deviation, success rate in the control group and survival rate in the control group at some time point, respectively. For each type of outcome, we calculated a required sample size N for a hypothesized treatment effect, an assumed nuisance parameter and a nominal power of 80%. We then assumed a nuisance parameter associated with a relative error at the design stage. For each type of outcome, we randomly drew 10,000 relative errors of the associated nuisance parameter (from empirical distributions derived from a previously published review). Then, retro-fitting the sample size formula, we derived, for the pre-calculated sample size N, the real power of the RCT, taking into account the relative error for the nuisance parameter. In total, 23%, 0% and 18% of RCTs with continuous, binary and time-to-event outcomes, respectively, were underpowered (i.e., the real power was < 60%, as compared with the 80% nominal power); 41%, 16% and 6%, respectively, were overpowered (i.e., with real power > 90%). Even with proper calculation of sample size, a substantial number of trials are underpowered or overpowered because of imprecise knowledge of nuisance parameters. Such findings raise questions about how sample size for RCTs should be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1623671065,"To investigate the importance of topoisomerases for transcription of the galactose induced genes, we have studied the expression of GAL1, GAL2, GAL7 and GAL10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells deficient for topoisomerases I and II. We find that topoisomerases are required for transcriptional activation of the GAL genes, but are dispensable for ongoing transcription, eliminating a role of the enzymes in transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that promoter chromatin remodeling of the GAL genes is unaffected in the topoisomerase deficient strain. However, the cells fail to successfully recruit RNA polymerase II due to an inability of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to bind to the TATA box in these promoters. We therefore argue that topoisomerases are required for accurate assembly of the preinitiation complex at the promoters of the GAL genes."
https://openalex.org/W907084273,"Although more emphasis has been given to the genetic and environmental factors that determine host vulnerability to malaria, other factors that might have a crucial role in burdening the disease have not been evaluated yet. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the effect of khat chewing on the incidence of severe malaria syndromes and immune responses during malaria infection in an area where the two problems co-exist. Clinical, physical, demographic, hematological, biochemical and immunological data were collected from Plasmodium falciparum mono-infected malaria patients (age ≥ 10 years) seeking medication in Halaba Kulito and Jimma Health Centers. In addition, incidences of severe malaria symptoms were assessed. The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 20) software. Prevalence of current khat chewer malaria patients was 57.38% (95%CI =53-61.56%). Malaria symptoms such as hyperpyrexia, prostration and hyperparasitemia were significantly lower (P<0.05) among khat chewer malaria patients. However, relative risk to jaundice and renal failure were significantly higher (P<0.05) in khat chewers than in non-khat chewer malaria patients. Longer duration of khat use was positively associated with incidence of anemia. IgM and IgG antibody titers were significantly higher (P<0.05) among khat chewer malaria patients than among malaria positive non-chewers. Although levels of IgG subclasses in malaria patients did not show significant differences (P>0.05), IgG3 antibody was significantly higher (P<0.001) among khat chewer malaria patients. Moreover, IgM, IgG, IgG1and IgG3 antibodies had significant negative association (P<0.001) with parasite burden and clinical manifestations of severe malaria symptoms, but not with severe anemia and hypoglycemia. Additionally, a significant increment (P<0.05) in CD4+ T-lymphocyte population was observed among khat users. Khat might be an important risk factor for incidence of some severe malaria complications. Nevertheless, it can enhance induction of humoral immune response and CD4+ T-lymphocyte population during malaria infection. This calls for further investigation on the effect of khat on parasite or antigen-specifc protective malaria immunity and analysis of cytokines released upon malaria infection among khat chewers."
https://openalex.org/W894778660,"The duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV), a member of the family Picornaviridae, is the major cause of outbreaks with high mortality rates in young ducklings. It has three distinctive serotypes and among them, serotypes 1 (DHAV-1) and 3 (DHAV-3) were recognized in China. To investigate evolutionary and antigenic properties of the major capsid protein VP1 of these two serotypes, a primary target of neutralizing antibodies, we determined the VP1 coding sequences of 19 DHAV-1 (spanning 2000-2012) and 11 DHAV-3 isolates (spanning 2008-2014) associated with disease outbreaks. By bioinformatics analysis of VP1 sequences of these isolates and other DHAV strains reported previously, we demonstrated that DHAV-1 viruses evolved into two genetic lineages, while DHAV-3 viruses exhibited three distinct lineages. The rate of nucleotide substitution for DHAV-1 VP1 genes was estimated to be 5.57 x 10(-4) per site per year, which was about one-third times slower than that for DHAV-3 VP1 genes. The population dynamics analysis showed an upward trend for infection of DHAV-1 viruses over time with little change observed for DHAV-3 viruses. Antigenic study of representative DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 strains covering all observed major lineages revealed no detectable changes in viral neutralization properties within the serotype, despite the lack of cross-neutralization between serotypes 1 and 3 strains. Structural analysis identified VP1 mutations in DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 viruses that underpin the observed antigenic phenotypes. Results of our experiments described here shall give novel insights into evolution and antigenicity of duck picornaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W867470862,"The Grain to Green Project (GGP) is an unprecedented land restoration action in China. The project converted large areas (ca 10 million ha) of steep-sloped/degraded farmland and barren land into forest and grassland resulting in ecological benefits such as a reduction in severe soil erosion. It may also affect soil microorganisms involved in ammonia oxidization, which is a key step in the global nitrogen cycle. The methods for restoration that are typically adopted in semi-arid regions include abandoning farmland and growing drought tolerant grass (Lolium perenne L.) or shrubs (Caragana korshinskii Kom.). In the present study, the effects of these methods on the abundance and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were evaluated via quantitative real-time PCR, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and clone library analysis of amoA genes. Comparisons were made between soil samples from three restored lands and the adjacent farmland in Inner Mongolia. Both the abundance and community composition of AOB were significantly different between the restored lands and the adjacent control. Significantly lower nitrification activity was observed for the restored land. Clone library analysis revealed that all AOB amoA gene sequences were affiliated with Nitrosospira. Abundance of the populations that were associated with Nitrosospira sp. Nv6 which had possibly adapted to high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen, decreased on the restored land. Only a slight difference in the AOB communities was observed between the restored land with and without the shrub (Caragana korshinskii Kom.). A minor effect of land restoration on AOA was observed. In summary, land restoration negatively affected the abundance of AOB and soil nitrification activities, suggesting the potential role of GGP in the leaching of nitrates, and in the emission of N2O in related terrestrial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W870560827,"Investigation of house conditions that promote health revealed that negatively charged-particle dominant indoor air-conditions (NCPDIAC) induced immune stimulation. Negatively charged air-conditions were established using a fine charcoal powder on walls and ceilings and utilizing forced negatively charged particles (approximate diameter: 20 nm) dominant in indoor air-conditions created by applying an electric voltage (72 V) between the backside of the walls and the ground. We reported previously that these conditions induced a slight and significant increase of interleukin-2 during a 2.5-h stay and an increase of NK cell cytotoxicity when examining human subjects after a two-week night stay under these conditions. In the present study, seven healthy volunteers had a device installed to create NCPDIAC in the living or sleeping rooms of their own homes. Every three months the volunteers then turned the NCPDIAC device on or off. A total of 16 ON and 13 OFF trials were conducted and their biological effects were analyzed. NK activity increased during ON trials and decreased during OFF trials, although no other adverse effects were found. In addition, there were slight increases of epidermal growth factor (EGF) during ON trials. Furthermore, a comparison of the cytokine status between ON and OFF trials showed that basic immune status was stimulated slightly during ON trials under NCPIADC. Our overall findings indicate that the NCPDIAC device caused activation of NK activity and stimulated immune status, particularly only on NK activity, and therefore could be set in the home or office buildings."
https://openalex.org/W870517870,"The most popular model to explain how prehensile movements are organized assumes that they comprise two ""components"", the reaching component encoding information regarding the object's spatial location and the grasping component encoding information on the object's intrinsic properties such as size and shape. Comparative kinematic studies on grasping behavior in the humans and in macaques have been carried out to investigate the similarities and differences existing across the two species. Although these studies seem to favor the hypothesis that macaques and humans share a number of kinematic features it remains unclear how the reaching and grasping components are coordinated during prehension movements in free-ranging macaque monkeys. Twelve hours of video footage was filmed of the monkeys as they snatched food items from one another (i.e., snatching) or collect them in the absence of competitors (i.e., unconstrained). The video samples were analyzed frame-by-frame using digitization techniques developed to perform two-dimensional post-hoc kinematic analyses of the two types of actions. The results indicate that only for the snatching condition when the reaching variability increased there was an increase in the amplitude of maximum grip aperture. Besides, the start of a break-point along the deceleration phase of the velocity profile correlated with the time at which maximum grip aperture occurred. These findings suggest that macaques can spatially and temporally couple the reaching and the grasping components when there is pressure to act quickly. They offer a substantial contribution to the debate about the nature of how prehensile actions are programmed."
https://openalex.org/W1564812054,"Retinoids have been shown to serve promising therapeutic agents for human cancers, e.g. the treatment of neuroblastoma. Synthetic retinoids, specific for particular retinoic acid (RA) receptors, are tested as new therapy strategies. In the present study, application of recombinant retinoic acid (RA) lowers retinoblastoma (RB) cell viability and induces apoptosis in RB cell lines. Combined treatment of RA and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) increases the pro-apoptotic effect of RA in the RB cells lines WERI-Rb1, Y-79, RB355, RBL-30 and RBL-15, indicating an additive effect. We could show that in WERI-Rb1 cells RA/BMP-4 mediated cell death is at least partially caspase-dependent, whereby RA and BMP-4 additively increased (i) Apaf-1 mRNA levels, (ii) caspase-9 cleavage activity and (iii) the number of activated, cleaved caspase-3 positive cells. Compared to single application of RA and BMP-4, combined RA/BMP-4 treatment significantly augments mRNA levels of the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) RARα and RARß and the retinoic X receptor (RXR) RXRγ suggesting an interaction in the induction of these RA receptor subtypes in WERI-Rb1 cells. Agonist studies revealed that both, RARs and RXRs are involved in RA/BMP-4 mediated apoptosis in WERI-Rb1 retinoblastoma cells. Employing specific RAR subtype antagonists and a RXRß and RXRγ knockdown, we proved that RA/BMP-4 apoptosis signaling in WERI-Rb1 cells requires the RA receptor subtypes RARα, RARß, RXRß and RXRγ. Deciphering signaling mechanisms underlying apoptosis induction of RA and BMP-4 in WERI-Rb1 cells, our study provides useful starting-points for future retinoid-based therapy strategies in retinoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W877068674,"Commonly used visible markers for transgenesis use fluorescent proteins expressed at the surface of the body, such as in eyes. One commonly used marker is the 3xP3-EGFP cassette containing synthetic binding sites for the eyeless/Pax6 conserved transcription factor. This marker cassette leads to fluorescent eyes in a variety of animals tested so far. Here we show that upon reaching adulthood, transgenic Bicyclus anynana butterflies containing this marker cassette exponentially loose fluorescence in their eyes. After 12 days, transgenic individuals are no longer distinguishable from wild type individuals. The decreased eye fluorescence is likely due to significantly decreased or halted eyeless/Pax6 expression observed in wild type animals upon adult emergence. Implications from these findings include care in screening transgenic animals before these reach adulthood, or shortly thereafter, and in using adult animals of the same age for quantitative screening of likely homozygote and heterozygote individuals."
https://openalex.org/W909749234,"The recently growing interest in studying flight behaviours of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, has highlighted the need for developing tools that acquire quantitative motion data. Despite recent advance of video tracking systems, acquiring a flying fly’s orientation remains a challenge for these tools. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating individual flying fly’s orientation using image cues. Thanks to the line reconstruction algorithm in computer vision field, this work can thereby focus on the practical detail of implementation and evaluation of the orientation estimation algorithm. The orientation estimation algorithm can be incorporated into tracking algorithms. We rigorously evaluated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm by running experiments both on simulation data and on real-world data. This work complements methods for studying the fruit fly’s flight behaviours in a three-dimensional environment."
