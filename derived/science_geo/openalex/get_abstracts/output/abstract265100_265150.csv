https://openalex.org/W2036476002,"The equatorial sinuous channels on Mars detected by Mariner 9 point to a past epoch of higher pressures and abundant liquid water. Advective instability of the martian atmosphere permits two stable climates-one close to present conditions, the other at a pressure of the order of 1 bar depending on the quantity of buried volatiles. Variations in the obliquity of Mars, the luminosity of the sun, and the albedo of the polar caps each appear capable of driving the instability between a current ice age and more clement conditions. Obliquity driving alone implies that epochs of much higher and of much lower pressure must have characterized martian history. Climatic change on Mars may have important meteorological, geological, and biological implications."

Increased diversity below the continental shelf has been attributed to increased environmental stability. Decreased diversity on the abyss may result from extremely low productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2071194946,Unit spikes were recorded from the spinal cord of the lungfish Protopterus and were identified with Mauthner's axon. With these spikes occurred nongraded tail flips suggesting startle responses. The tail flip and the giant spike resulted from certain forms of jarring and prodding. The conduction velocity for the slightly myelinated. 45 micro diameter fibers was 18.5 m/sec.

Field collections were held at 35 degrees C for less than 24 hours before experimental incubations. Calculated temperatues for 50 percent mortality for 60, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 1 minute of exposure were 50.44 degrees , 50.96 degrees , 51.43 degrees , 52.03 degrees , 52.77 degrees , and 55.12 degrees C, respectively."

Evidence suggests that in every diploid epidermal cell their orientation is specific with respect to (i) cell symmetry and cuticular patterning, and (ii) intercellular positioninig and polarity. Microtrichia may be homologous with the flagella of other organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2088867393,"A residual negative free-air and Bouguer anomaly of at least 80 milligals, superimposed on a broader high, occurs over the Galápagos Islands The axis of the anomaly trends roughly east and plunges eastward. Thus, a low-density mass in the crust or upper mantle must underlie the archipelago. This anomaly may be caused by thermal expansion over a crust-mantle "" hot spot""."
https://openalex.org/W2074746100,"Secondary phloem explants removed to standard aseptic culture in the spring proliferate most extensively. Explants taken successively through the growing season proliferate less. The decreasing growth trend reverses some months before bud break, and the increasing growth in winter is not dependent on the breaking of dormancy in the terminal buds."
https://openalex.org/W2093323983,Clouds over the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains were artificially seeded to reduce the riming and fall speeds of snow crystals and to divert snowfall across the crest. Aircraft observations showed that the clouds were glaciated by the seeding. The crystal habits and the degrees of riming of snow crystals reaching the target area were modified. Snowfall rates decreased at the crest and simultaneously increased 20 kilometers east of the crest.

https://openalex.org/W2032030368,"Fine-grained micas are consistent impurities in Camp-Berteaux (Morocco) and Wyoming montmorillonities. These micas give selected-area electron diffraction spot patterns with triclinic, monoclinic, and hexagonal symmetries similar tO those reported previously for monmorillonites. Camp-Berteaux montmorillonite appears as folded and flexible polycrystalline aggregates with pronounced texturing along the [02],[11], and[1ī] directions. Wyoming montmorillonite displays better crystallinity and larger crystallite size, and its structure is no longer truly ""turbostratic""."

https://openalex.org/W3126104118,"Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) of chronic renal failure is a major problem of chronic renal failure patient who were treated with hemodialysis, CAPD and renal trans- plantation. By the way, authors inspected the bone changes of ROD which were measured by microden- sitometer method (MD) with Inoue in CRF on hemodialysis (5 patients), CAPD (11 patients) and renal transplantation (3 patiets). Also they were evaluated the metabolic index of bone change such as serum Ca, P, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and iPTH which were speculated the correla- tion of MD index in each groups. The result obtained were as follows: 1) MCI of normal female was significantly higher than that of CRF, d of normal female under 30 years was lower than that of CRF (p<0.05). The correlation of iPTH and serum P, alkaline phosphatase and iPTH, d and Ca, and so on alkaline phosphatase and Gsmin were positive significantly (p<0.05). 2) In maintenance hemodialysis group of CRF, d and Gsmax was decreased and serum Ca increased after hemodialysis significantly (p<0.05). MCI and serum BUN, Gsmin and BUN, also alkaline phosphatase and d showed positive correlation (p<0.05). A MCI of mainte- nance hemodialysis group of CRF was lower than that of CRF, d of which was decreaed (p<0.05). The serum Ca and alkaline phosphatase of which was increased significantly (p<0.05). 3) In CAPD group of CRF, Gsmin and GS/D were lower than that of CRF and serum BUN, Ca, P were decreased (p<0.05). A Gsmin of CAPD group whose serum BUN, creatinine and P were decreased after CAPD. P & GS/D revealed a positive correlation (p<0. 05). Gsmax, Gsmin, GS/D and serum Ca, GS/D show a negative correlation (p<0.05). 4) In renal trnsplantation group of CRF, Gsmax of renal transplantation was higher and serum BUN, creatinine, Ca, alkaline phsphatase of those were higher than that of CRF, significantly (p<0.05). There were increased d and decreased serum BUN, creatinine and P after renal transplantation (p<0.05). This results suggest that CAPD for CRF is more effective to treat ROD than hemodialysis and renal transplantation. The bone index of MD method and metabdic index such as seum Ca, P, alkaline phopatase and iPTH are useful to detect or moniter a change of ROD clinicaly."
