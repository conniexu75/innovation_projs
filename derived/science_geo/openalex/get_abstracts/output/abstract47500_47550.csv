https://openalex.org/W1578072993,"We have established four cell lines derived from the human KB carcinoma cell line which express high-level multiple drug resistance. One of these lines was selected for resistance to colchicine, one was selected for resistance to colchicine in the presence of the tumor promoter, mezerein, one for resistance to vinblastine, and one for resistance to adriamycin. All of these cell lines are cross-resistant to the other selective agents. The development of multidrug resistance in these cultured human carcinoma cells is associated with a limited number of specific protein alterations revealed by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. These protein alterations in multidrug-resistant lines include the decreased prevalence of members of a family of proteins of molecular mass 70,000 to 80,000 daltons, pI 4.8-5.0, the increased synthesis of a protein of molecular mass 21,000 daltons, pI 5.0, in the colchicine-resistant cell lines only, and the increased expression of a 170,000-dalton protein in membrane preparations from all of the resistant cells. The loss of the 70,000- to 80,000-dalton proteins in the multidrug-resistant lines, which can also be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of these proteins with specific antisera, is associated with a loss of translatable mRNA for these proteins. These studies suggest that only a limited number of protein changes occur in multidrug-resistant cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2004135885,"Administration of cholecystokinin (CCK) to rats caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma levels of the neurohypophyseal hormone oxytocin (OT). The OT secretion was comparable to that found in response to nausea-producing chemical agents that cause learned taste aversions. The effect of CCK on OT secretion was blunted after gastric vagotomy, as was the inhibition of food intake induced by CCK. Food ingestion also led to elevated plasma OT in rats, but CCK and aversive agents caused even greater OT stimulation. Thus, after administration of large doses of CCK, vagally mediated activation of central nausea pathways seems to be predominantly responsible for the subsequent decrease in food intake. Despite their dissimilar affective states, both nausea and satiety may activate a common hypothalamic oxytocinergic pathway that controls the inhibition of ingestion."
https://openalex.org/W62912041,"A conserved feature of all nicotinic receptors is the presence of a readily reducible disulfide bond adjacent to the acetylcholine binding site. Previously we showed that in intact receptor from Torpedo californica electric tissue reduction of this disulfide followed by affinity alkylation with 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltri[3H] methylammonium iodide specifically and uniquely labels the alpha subunit residues Cys-192 and Cys-193. To identify all of the half-cystinyl residues contributing to the binding site disulfide(s), we have now reduced receptor under mild conditions and alkylated with a mixture of 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltri[3H]methylammonium iodide and N-[1-14C]ethylmaleimide and find that Cys-192 and Cys-193 are labeled exclusively. Furthermore, from unreduced receptor we have isolated two cyanogen bromide peptides of alpha, one containing Cys-192 and Cys-193, and the other containing Cys-128 and Cys-142 (which are the other potential contributors to the binding site disulfide(s]. These isolated peptides incorporate iodo[1-14C]acetamide only following reduction by dithiothreitol. Our results demonstrate that: 1) the binding site disulfide is between Cys-192 and Cys-193; 2) Cys-128 is disulfide-cross-linked to Cys-142; and 3) under conditions that reduce Cys-192 and Cys-193 completely, Cys-128 and Cys-142 remain cross-linked. At the acetylcholine binding site, agonists induce a local conformational change that stabilizes the binding site disulfide against reduction. We suggest that a transition between two stable conformations of the vicinal disulfide, both involving a nonplanar cis peptide bond between Cys-192 and Cys-193, is associated with receptor activation by agonists."

https://openalex.org/W2086666526,Tissue welding is a potentially important biomedical application of laser technology. The structural alterations basic to this phenomenon were studied in experimental repair of lesions of the rat carotid artery and sciatic nerve. A modified neodymiumdoped yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser operating at a wavelength of 1.319 micrometers was used in conjunction with conventional suture techniques. Histological and fine-structural analysis revealed a homogenizing change in collagen with interdigitation of altered individual fibrils that appeared to be the structural basis of the welding effect.
https://openalex.org/W2068471380,"The growth of university-industry research relationships in biotechnology has raised questions concerning their effects, both positive and negative, on universities. A survey of over 1200 faculty members at 40 major universities in the United States reveals that biotechnology researchers with industrial support publish at higher rates, patent more frequently, participate in more administrative and professional activities and earn more than colleagues without such support. At the same time, faculty with industry funds are much more likely than other biotechnology faculty to report that their research has resulted in trade secrets and that commercial considerations have influenced their choice of research projects. Although the data do not establish a causal connection between industrial support and these faculty behaviors, our findings strongly suggest that university-industry research relationships have both benefits and risks for academic institutions. The challenge for universities is to find ways to manage these relationships that will preserve the benefits while minimizing the risks.An analysis is provided of a survey of over 1,200 faculty members at 40 major U.S. universities concerning their research activities and funding by industrial sources. The survey findings suggest that university-industry biotechnology research relationships have both benefits and risks for the university. Faculty members receiving industry support tend to be more productive. They publish, patent, and earn more. They participate in more administrative and professional activities, while teaching as much as other faculty members. However, their research also leads to more unpublished trade secrets, and commercial considerations may influence their choice of projects. The authors recommend public as well as commercial funding of research, protection of the right to publish research results, and university-industry agreements that do not unduly restrict faculty behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2099600190,"We have introduced the human fetal γ- and adult β-globin genes into the germ line of mice. Analysis of the resulting transgenic mice shows that the human γ-globin gene is expressed like an embryonic mouse globin gene; the human β-globin gene is expressed (as previously shown) like an adult mouse globin gene. These results imply that the regulatory signals for tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of the globin genes have been conserved between man and mouse but that the timing of the signals has changed. Because the two genes are expressed differently, we introduced a hybrid γβ-globin gene construct. The combination of the regulatory sequences resulted in the expression of the hybrid gene at all stages in all the murine erythroid tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2071078274,"The hormone 17 beta-estradiol acts through its receptor system to induce MCF-7 human breast cancer cells to form tumors in athymic mice. In vitro studies have identified the production of estrogen-induced growth factors from MCF-7 cells that may have a role in growth control. These induced growth factors were sufficient to stimulate MCF-7 tumor growth in ovariectomized athymic mice, thus partially replacing estradiol. Growth factors may act as estrogen-induced ""second messengers"" in estrogen-responsive growth of human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2061207726,"Electrical activity may regulate a number of neuronal functions in addition to its role in transmitting signals along nerve cells. The hypothesis that electrical activity affects neurite elongation in sprouting neurons was tested by stimulating individual snail neurons isolated in cell culture. The findings demonstrated that growth cone advance, and thus neurite elongation, is reversibly stopped during periods when action potentials are experimentally evoked. A decrease in filopodial number and growth cone area was also observed. Thus, action potentials can mediate the cessation of neurite outgrowth and thereby may influence structure and connectivity within the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1549117291,"Human KB carcinoma cells resistant to high levels of colchicine, vinblastine, vincristine, adriamycin, and actinomycin D exhibit reduced accumulation of these structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents (Akiyama, S.-I., Fojo, A., Hanover, J. A., Pastan, I., and Gottesman, M. M. (1985) Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 11, 117-126; Fojo, A., Akiyama, S.-I., Gottesman, M. M., and Pastan, I. (1985) Cancer Res. 45, 3002-3007). To examine the mechanism of reduced drug accumulation in these cells, we measured [3H]vinblastine ([3H]VBL) binding to membrane vesicles made from drug-sensitive (KB-3-1), drug-resistant (KB-C4), and revertant (KB-R1) cells. Membrane vesicles from KB-C4 cells bound up to 8-fold more [3H]VBL than vesicles from the parental KB-3-1 or revertant KB-R1 cell lines. No difference in binding of [3H]dexamethasone, to which the cells are equally sensitive, was observed. The difference in [3H]VBL binding by vesicles from resistant and sensitive cells was eliminated by the addition of 10 micrograms/ml verapamil, which is known to reverse the multidrug-resistance phenotype. Drug binding by KB-C4 vesicles was osmotically insensitive, temperature-dependent, and trypsin-sensitive. Binding of [3H]VBL by KB-C4 vesicles was inhibited by vinblastine, vincristine, and daunomycin (in decreasing order). Dexamethasone at 100 microM, colchicine at 100 microM, and actinomycin D at 100 microM did not significantly inhibit [3H]VBL accumulation. No significant differences in tubulin content were detected among vesicles from sensitive and resistant cells. These data demonstrate that membrane vesicles from multiply drug-resistant cells bind increased amounts of vinblastine."

https://openalex.org/W1489567813,"Proto-oncogene fos mRNA levels are rapidly and transiently elevated 12-fold in regenerating liver 10-60 min following partial hepatectomy. This response, and the induction of fos protein synthesis, has been simulated qualitatively and quantitatively in long term primary cultures of quiescent adult rat hepatocytes where proliferative transitions can be initiated directly in serum-free medium by known hepatocyte mitogens like epidermal growth factor. Expression of a second proto-oncogene, c-rasH, in proliferatively activated hepatocyte cultures between 6 and 24 h also simulates the delayed hepatic response that occurs in vivo following partial hepatectomy. These results suggest that sequential proto-oncogene expression during liver regeneration is caused directly by hepatocellular interactions with specific mitogens. In addition, a role for monovalent cations in the regulation of hepatocyte gene expression is implicated from findings that Na+ deprivation inhibits induction of fos expression in cultured hepatocytes by epidermal growth factor under chemically defined conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1647458656,"The role of the high mannose carbohydrate chains in the mechanism of action of ricin toxin was investigated. Ricin is taken up by two routes in macrophages, by binding to cell surface mannose receptors, or by binding of the ricin galactose receptor to cell surface glycoproteins. Removal of carbohydrate from ricin by periodate oxidation led to a large loss in toxicity via both routes of uptake by an effect on the B chain not due to a loss of galactose binding affinity. These data suggest that the carbohydrate chains of ricin B chain may be required for full toxicity. The pathway of uptake of ricin by the macrophage mannose receptor was found to differ in several respects from uptake via the galactose-specific pathway. Analysis of intoxication of macrophages by ricin in the presence of ammonium chloride suggested that mannose receptor bound ligand passes through acidic vesicles prior to translocation, unlike galactose bound ligand. Intoxication by ricin via galactose-specific uptake was potentiated by swainsonine but not by castanospermine, suggesting that ricin may be attacked by an endogenous mannosidase within the cell, and that ricin passes through either a lysosomal or a Golgi compartment prior to translocation."

https://openalex.org/W1539001739,"Pertussis toxin catalyzes incorporation of 20.2 pmol of ADP-ribose/mg of protein into approximately 40-kDa protein(s) in human neutrophil membranes compared with 14.1 pmol/mg in bovine brain membranes. Based on these measurements we estimate that pertussis toxin substrate(s) should represent at least 0.085% of total membrane protein in neutrophils. Both brain and neutrophil membranes show high concentrations (0.34 versus 0.16% of total membrane protein, respectively) of the common beta subunit of guanine nucleotide binding proteins. Affinity purified antibodies specific for Go-alpha fail to detect any protein in immunoblots of neutrophil membranes (150 micrograms) under conditions where as little as 10 ng of purified Go-alpha is detectable, and Go-alpha is readily detected in brain membranes (100 micrograms). An antiserum against transducin that cross-reacts strongly with Gi-alpha, detects as little as 5 ng of purified Gi-alpha and readily detects Gi-alpha in brain membranes, but in neutrophil membranes, the antiserum detects an approximately 40-kDa band that corresponds to less than 10% of the expected amount of pertussis toxin substrate(s). The results show that human neutrophil membranes contain relatively large amounts of pertussis toxin substrate(s), but that the predominant pertussis toxin substrate is immunochemically distinct from previously identified substrates, transducin, Gi, and Go."

https://openalex.org/W1544887968,"A Drosophila heat-shock gene transcription factor (HSTF) has been shown to bind to three domains upstream from the TATA homology on a hsp 70 gene. The domain closest to the TATA homology consists of two contiguous binding sites with different binding affinities. Occupancy of the TATA homology proximal site (site 1) coordinates HSTF binding to the neighboring site (site 2) in a cooperative manner (Topol, J., Ruden, D. M., and Parker, C. S. (1985) Cell 42, 527-537). We have used alkylation interference and protection experiments to determine which residues within the binding sites are closely contacted by the HSTF. The contacts inferred from these studies included the residues present in the consensus sequence found in all HSTF binding sites and exhibit rotational symmetry, suggestive of a multimeric HSTF. By employing a gel electrophoresis separation technique we were able to resolve two protein-DNA complexes consisting of site 1 occupancy (complex A) and sites 1 and 2 occupancy (complex B). Analysis of these discrete species reveals that a subset of contacts within site 1 change upon HSTF binding to site 2, suggesting that a conformational change in the protein-DNA complex occurs. Implications for the activation of heat-shock gene transcription are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2079305834,"Previous studies have suggested that the retinotectal system of the goldfish contains a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that is sensitive to alpha-bungarotoxin. Extracellularly recorded field potentials elicited in response to visual stimulation can be blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin, and alpha-bungarotoxin can interfere with the maintenance of retinotectal synaptic connections. Whether the transmission between the retinal ganglion cells and the tectal cells is mediated by acetylcholine and whether nAChR's exist on the dendrites of tectal cells are questions that remain. The experiments described in this report were designed to determine the site of synthesis of the nAChR's associated with the goldfish retinotectal projection. Radioactive (35S-labeled) methionine was injected into either the eye or the tectal ventricle, and the incorporation of radioactivity into the nAChR was measured by immunoprecipitation. The use of this technique provides evidence that an nAChR associated with the goldfish retinotectal projection is synthesized in the retina and transported to the optic tectum, which suggests a presynaptic site of acetylcholine action on retinal terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2006942867,"A detailed schematic representation of high-resolution G-banding patterns was prepared from elongated and finely banded mitotic chromosomes of the mouse. Such chromosomes can be obtained from both animal tissue and cell lines by a simple protocol, facilitating precise demarcation of breakpoints in chromosome rearrangements and aiding in the sublocalization of genes. Regions of subbanding homology were observed between human and mouse chromosomal segments known to have conserved gene assignments, an indication that, at the cytogenetic level, extensive regions of the mammalian genome may remain intact after 60 million years of species divergence."

https://openalex.org/W1604162266,"The addition of the tumor promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate to intact human red blood cells activates protein kinase C and stimulates the phosphorylation of the membrane skeletal proteins band 4.1 and band 4.9 as well as two proteins of molecular mass 115 and 110 kDa. We show that 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate promotes the association of cytosolic protein kinase C with the red cell membrane and that the enzyme is present on ghost membranes but is largely absent from inside-out vesicles. We show that micromolar Ca2+ added to ghosts also promotes the phosphorylation of band 4.1 and the approximately 100-kDa proteins, a reaction which has not been described previously. Digestion and extraction studies show that the 100-kDa proteins are unrelated to band 3 since they are absent from NaOH stripped membranes, but are found in Triton-prepared cytoskeletons. Digestion of intact red cells with chymotrypsin or neuraminidase, which attack principally band 3 and glycophorin, respectively, markedly inhibits protein kinase C phosphorylation of band 4.1 in red cells and ghosts and of the 100-kDa proteins in ghosts. These enzymes have no effect upon the activity of the Ca2+-activated phosphorylation reaction, suggesting that it does not involve protein kinase C. These results shed light on two phosphorylation reactions which act exclusively on red cell membrane skeletal proteins. Our findings suggest that digestion of the integral membrane proteins band 3 and glycophorin, the principal targets of external protease digestion, affects the activity or specificity of protein kinase C. Finally we have described two apparently novel approximately 100-kDa phosphorylated proteins which are components of Triton-prepared red cell membrane skeletons."

https://openalex.org/W1503071674,"Chondrocytes isolated from 15-day-old embryonic chick sterna were cultured as monolayers for 7 days in control medium or in medium supplemented with retinoic acid or 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. Control cells exhibited characteristic polygonal morphology and maintained the synthesis of cartilage-specific collagens, i.e. type II, type IX, 1 alpha, 2 alpha, and 3 alpha chains, and 45 K (presumptive type X). Type IX was the second most prevalent collagen and represented 12-15% of the phenotype. When exposed to retinoic acid, chrondrocytes displayed a fibroblast-like morphology and decreased collagen synthesis by day 2. The synthesis of collagen types II and IX declined in parallel along with that of the other cartilage collagens and ceased by day 7. During the same period, the synthesis of collagen types I, III, and V and two unidentified collagen chains was initiated and stimulated. Similar changes in collagen expression were caused by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine but were delayed, beginning after day 4. Type III collagen, however, was never detected in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine or control cultures. Because two different agents and two rates of modulation produced parallel changes in the synthesis of collagen types II and IX, these collagens appear to be coordinately regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1528816585,"Alkyllysophospholipids (ALP) which are 1-O-alkyl analogs of the cell membrane component 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-acyl-GPC) represent a family of new antitumor drugs. Susceptibility of cells to ALP is correlated to a selective inhibition of fatty acid incorporation into 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in intact cells. This report examines oleoyl-CoA-1-acyl-GPC acyl-transferase activities in cell-free systems of ALP-sensitive methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma cells (MethA cells) and ALP-resistant bone marrow-derived murine macrophages (BMM phi). The specific activities for the oleoyl-CoA-1-acyl-GPC acyltransferases were 1.05 +/- 0.06 nmol X mg-1 X min-1 and 2.98 +/- 0.27 nmol X mg-1 X min-1, respectively. The kinetic parameters for 1-palmitoyl-GPC were Km = 16.6 microM, Vmax = 4.3 nmol X mg-1 X min-1 (BMM phi) and Km = 7.6 microM, Vmax = 2.0 nmol X mg-1 X min-1 (MethA cells). In the presence of 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl racemic glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3), one of the most potent cytotoxic ALP, the acyltransferase was dose dependently inhibited in MethA cells with a 50% inhibition concentration at 40 micrograms/ml. The BMM phi-acyltransferase was not affected up to 80 micrograms of ET-18-OCH3/ml. The kinetic parameters (Km' = 15.4 microM, Vmax' = 2.2 nmol X mg-1 X min-1) suggest that ET-18-OCH3 is a competitive inhibitor in MethA cells. Inhibitor constants for ET-18-OCH3, calculated from Dixon plots, were found to be 423 microM (BMM phi) and 13 microM (MethA cells) indicating a 33-fold larger affinity of ET-18-OCH3 to the MethA cells than to the BMM phi acyltransferase. From these data we assume that the inhibition of oleic acid incorporation into cellular phosphocholine during the antineoplastic action of ALP may be due to different affinities of the inhibitor to the 1-acyl-GPC acyltransferases in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2102778596,"We have purified the membrane-intrinsic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from both normal and hyperthyroid rat liver mitochondria by extraction with Triton X-100, hydrophobic affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and FAD-linked Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. The yields in both cases were over 20%, and purification ranged from 800- to 650-fold in mitochondria from hyperthyroid and normal rats, respectively. The final preparations appeared to be greater than 95% pure by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The pure enzyme focused at pH 5.5 and produced a biphasic thermal inactivation plot at 50 degrees C. The holoenzyme was found to have a molecular mass of 250,000 daltons on gel filtration. The subunit molecular mass was found to be 74,000 daltons +/- 3,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. 1 mol of the holoenzyme preparation contains 1.1 mol of non-heme iron and 0.7-0.9 mol of noncovalently bound FAD. The absorption spectrum has a maximum at 375 nm and a shoulder at 450 nm which is bleached on treatment with sodium dithionite. The enzymatic reaction is competitively inhibited by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and phosphoglycolic acid. The apparent Km for DL-alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate and noncovalently bound FAD were found to be 6 mM and 7 microM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1567566414,"We have determined reduction potentials for porcine mitochondrial general fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (GAD) and electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) using an anaerobic spectroelectrochemical titration method. Computer simulation techniques were used to analyze the absorbance data. Nernst plots of the simulated data gave E'0, 7.1, quinone/semiquinone = -0.014 V and E'0, 7.1, semiquinone/hydroquinone = -0.036 V for ETF and E'0, 7.1, quinone/semiquinone = -0.155 V and E'0, 7.1, semiquinone/hydroquinone = -0.122 V for GAD. Using these techniques we have also determined a conditional reduction potential of -0.156 V for the chromophore producing fatty acyl-CoA substrate beta-2-furylpropionyl-CoA. From this value and our previous determination of the equilibrium constant for the transhydrogenation reaction between beta-2-furylpropionyl-CoA and the oxidized substrate crotonyl-CoA (Keq = 10.4), we have determined a reduction potential of -0.126 V for the butyryl-CoA/crotonyl-CoA couple. In light of the structural similarity between butyryl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA, the optimal substrate for GAD, the reduction potential for octanoyl-CoA should be similar to that for butyryl-CoA; i.e. fatty acyl-CoA substrates and GAD are essentially isopotential. The ability of octanoyl-CoA to reduce GAD quantitatively (Keq = 9.0) poses a dilemma in light of the nearly equal reduction potentials. We postulate that the stable charge-transfer complex formed between enzyme and optimal product is significantly lower in energy than enzyme and product and thus is responsible for pulling the reaction toward completion."
https://openalex.org/W1532710350,"Urease was purified 592-fold to homogeneity from the anaerobic rumen bacterium Selenomonas ruminantium. The urease isolation procedure included a heat step and ion-exchange, hydrophobic, gel filtration, and fast protein liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibited a Km for urea of 2.2 +/- 0.5 mM and a Vmax of 1100 mumol of urea min-1 mg-1. The molecular mass estimated for the native enzyme was 360,000 +/- 50,000 daltons, whereas a subunit value of 70,000 +/- 2,000 daltons was determined. These results are in contrast to the findings of Mahadevan et al. (Mahadevan, S., Sauer, F. D., and Erfle, J. D. (1977) Biochem. J. 163, 495-501) in which isolated rumen urease was reported to be one-third this size (Mr 120,000-130,000) and to catalyze urea hydrolysis at a maximum velocity of only 53 mumol min-1 mg-1. S. ruminantium urease contained 2.1 +/- 0.4 nickel ions/subunit, comparable to the nickel content in jack bean urease (Dixon, N.E., Gazzola, C., Blakeley, R.L., and Zerner, B. (1975) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 97, 4131-4133). Thus, the active site of bacterial urease is very similar to that found in the plant enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1495152744,"In this report, the secretory response to Ca2+ in GH3 rat pituitary cells permeabilized by electric field discharge has been compared in both magnitude and Ca2+ sensitivity to prolactin (PRL) release from intact GH3 cells. The half-maximally effective [Ca2+] for stimulating PRL release in permeable cells was approximately 0.5 microM, and maximal stimulation was obtained at 3-10 microM Ca2+. The magnitude of Ca2+ stimulation in permeable cells was in the same range as that obtained from an equal number of intact cells stimulated by depolarizing K+. Moreover, the Ca2+ sensitivity of PRL release in intact GH3 cells (measured by Quin 2 fluorescence) closely resembled the Ca2+ sensitivity determined in permeable cells. Release of a sulfated proteoglycan whose release is stimulated by secretagogues in intact cells was stimulated by Ca2+ in permeable cells with the same Ca2+ sensitivity as for PRL release. Maximal Ca2+ stimulation of PRL release in permeable cells required the addition of MgATP. Other energy sources (ADP, GTP, and inorganic phosphate) also supported Ca2+-stimulated secretion but were less effective. The above results indicated that PRL release from permeable cells resembles the physiological process in intact cells. The permeable cell system should prove useful in investigating the mechanism mediating the effect of Ca2+ on secretion, although our studies with pharmacological agents have so far proved inconclusive. Among calmodulin antagonists tested, only trifluoroperazine inhibited Ca2+-stimulated secretion, whereas pimozide and calmidazolium did not."
https://openalex.org/W1504285654,"We have produced five hybridomas which secreted monoclonal antibodies that reacted with human plasma apolipoprotein D. On analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) high density lipoproteins and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.43)-enriched fractions of plasma contained many protein bands that reacted with the antibodies. Purified apolipoprotein D had the lowest Mr (29,000), the lowest pI (4.8-5.2), and the greatest migration on alkaline urea-PAGE of all the immunoreactive bands. These characteristics agreed with those described for apolipoprotein D in the literature. The other immunoreactive proteins had apparent Mr from about 39,000 to 98,000, they migrated more slowly than apolipoprotein D on alkaline urea-PAGE, and there were 10 polymorphs on isoelectric focusing. These cross-reacting proteins were present in the high density lipoproteins of each of four individuals sampled on several occasions and in pooled plasma. All of the monoclonal antibodies reacted both with apo-D and the higher Mr cross-reacting proteins. Each of our five monoclonal antibodies bound to one of two distinct antigenic sites on apo-D, determined by antibody competition immunoassays. Neither of these two sites was composed of carbohydrate, but expression of both sites seemed to be influenced by thiol-reducing agents: site 5G10 gained but 4E11 either lost immunoreactivity or was unchanged by reduction according to the conditions. We conclude that apolipoprotein D is only one of several plasma proteins, which contain two homologous polypeptide antigenic sites, recognized by monoclonal antibodies and also by a specific goat antiserum. Apolipoprotein D had the least Mr of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1561305636,"Abstract This study describes the effect of actin-binding protein derived from rabbit lung macrophages on the mechanical properties of F-actin. The dynamic storage modulus, G'(omega), and loss modulus, G(omega) of F-actin, at concentrations from 1 to 4 mg/ml, in the absence or presence of actin-binding protein at molar ratios to actin of 1:1000 to 1:125, were measured at frequencies ranging from 3 X 10(-3) to 0.5 Hz. Actin-binding protein increased the dynamic moduli of F-actin, but this increase was much greater as either the actin-binding protein/actin ratio or the total protein concentration increased. Moreover, there was a convergence of the values of G' and G at high frequencies for F-actin which became more prominent upon the addition of actin-binding protein. The value of the modulus obtained by an extrapolation of these data to actin concentrations similar to that found in the cell cortex was close to values which have been obtained by direct measurements. The addition of actin-binding protein to an F-actin solution enabled it to reach an equilibrium strain following the application of a stress, in contrast to pure F-actin. These data allow a more rigorous definition of the sol to gel transition and suggest that the cross-linking of actin filaments by actin-binding protein leads to the formation of a network structure whose underlying mechanism of mechanical behavior is short range intrafilament bending in contrast to the classical rubber network."

These two esterases have formerly been characterized as acylcarnitine hydrolases and the more active one is also a potent diacylglycerol lipase. Its TPA-hydrolyzing activity is inhibited by other substrates like 1-naphthylacetate, lauroylcarnitine, or dioleoyl glycerol. The results support the view that phorbol esters act like structural analogs of diacylglycerols, not only with respect to their activating effect on protein kinase C, but also as substrates for the same lipases."
https://openalex.org/W1587325585,"The role of cationic amino acid residues in the binding of porphyrin substrates by purified bovine ferrochelatase (protoheme ferro-lyase, EC 4.99.1.1) have been examined via chemical modification with camphorquinone-10-sulfonic acid, phenylglyoxal, butanedione, and trinitrobenzene sulfonate. The data obtained show that modification of arginyl, but not lysyl, residues results in the rapid inactivation of ferrochelatase. The 2,4-disulfonate deuteroporphyrin, which is a competitive inhibitor of mammalian ferrochelatase, protects the enzyme against inactivation. Ferrous iron has no protective effect. Reaction with radiolabeled phenylglyoxal shows that modification of 1 arginyl residue causes maximum inhibition of enzyme activity. The inactivation does not follow simple pseudo-first order reaction kinetics, but is distinctly biphasic in nature. Comparison of the enzyme kinetics for modified versus unmodified enzyme show that modification with camphorquinone-10-sulfonic acid has no effect on the Km for iron but does alter the Km for porphyrin."
https://openalex.org/W1488537075,"Studies on the formation and release of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2.GDP binary complex formed during eIF-5-mediated assembly of an 80 S initiation complex have been carried out. Incubation of a 40 S initiation complex with eIF-5, in the presence or absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits at 25 degrees C, causes rapid and quantitative hydrolysis of ribosome-bound GTP to form an eIF-2.GDP binary complex and Pi. Analysis of both reaction products by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration reveals that while Pi is released from ribosomes, the eIF-2.GDP complex remains bound to the ribosomal initiation complex. The eIF-2.GDP binary complex can however be released from ribosome by subjecting the eIF-5-catalyzed reaction products to either longer periods of incubation at 37 degrees C or sucrose gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, addition of a high molar excess of isolated eIF-2.GDP binary complex to a 40 S initiation reaction mixture does not cause exchange of ribosome-bound eIF-2.GDP complex formed by eIF-5-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP. These results indicate that eIF-2.GDP complex is directly formed on the surface of ribosomes following hydrolysis of GTP bound to a 40 S initiation complex, and that ribosome-bound eIF-2 X GDP complex is an intermediate in polypeptide chain initiation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1493937798,"Abstract Cell-free translation of total RNA from rabbit intestinal mucosa in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, after immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against sucrase-isomaltase, yielded a polypeptide of 200 kDa, which was identified as pro-sucrase-isomaltase. Addition of dog pancreatic microsomal vesicles to the translation system resulted in the appearance of an additional 220-kDa polypeptide. The 220-kDa polypeptide was associated with the membranes in a way that made it inaccessible to proteolysis; this protection was abolished by lytic detergent concentrations, indicating that the polypeptide was segregated into the microsomal vesicle. The 220-kDa polypeptide was glycosylated as evidenced by it being bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose and eluted with alpha-methyl-D-mannopyranoside. The increase in apparent molecular mass (approximately 20 kDa) of the primary translation product upon translocation was due to the addition of carbohydrate; treatment of the 220-kDa polypeptide with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H increased its electrophoretic mobility to that of the 200-kDa polypeptide which was obtained in the absence of membranes. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of a translation product labeled with [3H]Leu in the absence of membranes revealed that Leu was incorporated into identical positions as in the final (pro)-sucrase-isomaltase, thus indicating the lack of a transient signal peptide."

https://openalex.org/W1605186366,"In a previous study, it was shown that purified soluble bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase exhibits pH-dependent reversible tetramer-dimer dissociation (Saxena, A., Hensley, P., Osborne, J. C., Jr., and Fleming, P. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3386-3392). Here we report evidence for the dissociation of this enzyme by magnesium-adenosine diphosphate independent of pH in the pH range 5-7. Quantitative binding of ADP to dopamine beta-hydroxylase revealed that there are two binding sites/dimeric species of hydroxylase and that ADP is tightly bound with a KD less than 10(-8) M. Kinetic data obtained at pH 5.5, the pH inside the chromaffin granule, shows that the apparent Km values for both the substrates tyramine and ascorbate are lowered by the presence of ADP without affecting the Vmax of the enzyme. The ADP-dependent lowering of apparent Km values results from a dissociation of the enzyme to the dimeric species which has inherently lower apparent Km values for substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1555329014,"Abstract The nonapeptide less than Glu-Ala-Lys-Ser-Gln-Gly-Gly-Ser-Asn (formerly called serum thymic factor) is a factor produced by the thymic epithelium, which needs a zinc ion to express its immunoregulatory properties. We report here on 1H and 13C NMR investigation of the conformational properties of the free peptide in aqueous medium and in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 solution by a combination of homo- and heteronuclear one- and two-dimensional experiments. The various resonances have been assigned in a straightforward manner on the basis of 1H,1H COSY spectroscopy for the recognition of the proton spin systems; two-dimensional NOESY spectra with the correlation peaks across amide bonds and for the amino acid sequence assignment; amide bonds and for the amino acid sequence assignment; 13C,1H COSY experiments using selective polarization transfer from 1H- to 13C-nucleus via the 13C,1H long-range couplings for the attribution of the carboxyl and carbonyl groups; and 13C,1H COSY experiments with selective polarization transfer via the 13C,1H direct couplings for the assignment of all the aliphatic carbons. Other experiments such as pH-dependent chemical shifts, combined use of multiple and selective proton-decoupled 1H and 13C NMR spectra, the temperature and the concentration dependence of the proton shifts of the amide resonances, the solvent dependences of peptide carbonyl carbon resonances, and comparison of the spectra with three different analogues were performed. In aqueous solution, the data are compatible with the assumption of a highly mobile dynamic equilibrium among different conformations, whereas in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6, a more rigid structure is found involving three internal hydrogen bonds. These observations provide an insight into the conformational tendencies of this peptidic hormone in two different media."

https://openalex.org/W1530360609,"ATP analogues were used to study the active site specificity of the catalytic unit (C) of solubilized and partially purified bovine brain caudate nucleus adenylate cyclase. Phenylenediamine ATP (PD-ATP), 8-azido ATP (8-N3ATP), chromium(III) 3'-beta-alanylarylazido ATP (CrATPa), and 2',3'-dialdehyde ATP (oATP) are competitive inhibitors of C in the presence of the substrate MnATP and the activator forskolin. (Km for MnATP is 50 +/- 11 microM, n = 13). The Ki values determined under initial velocity conditions are: PD-ATP, Ki = 695 +/- 60 microM, n = 5; 8-N3ATP, Ki = 155 +/- 23 microM, n = 5; CrATPa, Ki = 7 +/- 3 microM, n = 2; oATP, Ki = 42 +/- 5 microM, n = 3. Irradiation of 100 microM 8-N3ATP by UV light (254 nm) causes the first-order loss of reagent either in the presence or absence of C. Concomitant irreversible inhibition of C in the presence of 8-N3ATP was more complex and asymptotically approached 50% within 4-6 min. Loss of C activity in controls was 10-20%. The fraction of C covalently modified by 8-N3ATP, alpha, was calculated for each time point of irradiation for an increasing initial concentration ([A]o) of 8-N3ATP. Extrapolated to infinite time of photolysis, the value of alpha reached a final level, termed alpha t whose magnitude depended on [A]o. From these data we calculated an apparent KD of 4.5 microM for 8-N3ATP. ATP protected against the irreversible inhibition due to 8-N3ATP. These data are most consistent with a mechanism of photoaffinity labeling involving equilibrium binding and covalent insertion of 8-N3ATP into the active site. These results indicate that the active site binds analogues of ATP which are considerably modified in the adenine, ribose, and gamma-phosphate portions and that the affinity of C for these analogues is within an order of magnitude of the Km for ATP."
