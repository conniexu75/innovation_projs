https://openalex.org/W2081948388,"Although Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing c-myc constitutively are unable to arrest growth in low serum, their numbers do not increase in culture because of substantial cell death. We show this cell death to be dependent upon expression of c-myc protein and to occur by apoptosis. Regions of the c-myc protein required for induction of apoptosis overlap with regions necessary for cotransformation, autoregulation, and inhibition of differentiation, suggesting that the apoptotic function of c-myc protein is related to its other functions. Moreover, cells with higher levels of c-myc protein are more prone to cell death upon serum deprivation. Finally, we demonstrate that deregulated c-myc expression induces apoptosis in cells growth arrested by a variety of means and at various points in the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2028263033,"The high mobility group (HMG) domain is a DNA-binding motif that is associated with several eukaryotic regulatory proteins, including the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor LEF-1 and the testis-determining factor SRY. Here, we provide evidence that DNA binding by the HMG domain of LEF-1 involves primarily minor groove contacts and induces a bend of approximately 130 degrees in the DNA helix. Bending was also found to accompany sequence-specific DNA binding by the SRY-HMG domain. Examining possible regulatory roles of HMG domain-induced DNA bends, we found that LEF-1 can function in a manner similar to bacterial integration host factor and facilitate communication between widely separated protein-binding sites in a recombination assay. Together with the previous observation that LEF-1 by itself is unable to augment basal promoter activity, these data suggest that HMG domain proteins can serve as ""architectural"" elements in the assembly of higher-order nucleoprotein structures."
https://openalex.org/W1562216431,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces the proliferation of endothelial cells and is a potent angiogenic factor that binds to heparin. We have therefore studied the effect of heparin upon the interaction of VEGF with its receptors. Heparin, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml, strongly potentiated the binding of 125I-VEGF to its receptors on endothelial cells. Scatchard analysis of 125I-VEGF binding indicates that 1 microgram/ml heparin induces an 8-fold increase in the apparent density of high affinity binding sites for VEGF, but does not significantly affect the dissociation constant of VEGF. Cross-linking experiments showed that heparin strongly potentiates the formation of the 170-, 195- and 225-kDa 125I-VEGF-receptor complexes on endothelial cells. At high 125I-VEGF concentrations (4 ng/ml), heparin preferentially enhanced the formation of the 170- and 195-kDa complexes. Preincubation of the cells with heparin, followed by extensive washes, produced a similar enhancement of subsequent 125I-VEGF binding. The binding of 125I-VEGF was completely inhibited following digestion of endothelial cells with heparinase and could be restored by the addition of exogenous heparin to the digested cells. The enhancing effect of heparin facilitated the detection of VEGF receptors on cell types that were not known previously to express such receptors. Our results suggest that cell surface-associated heparin-like molecules are required for the interaction of VEGF with its cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1550768646,"An Mr = 524,000 oligomeric protein was isolated from bovine cartilage and designated COMP (Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein). The protein is composed of disulfide-bonded subunits with an apparent Mr of 100,000 each. It is markedly anionic, probably due to its high contents of aspartic acid and glutamic acid, as well as to its substitution with negatively charged carbohydrates. COMP was found in all cartilages analyzed, but could not be detected in other tissues by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of guanidine HCl extracts. Within a given cartilage, COMP shows a preferential localization to the territorial matrix surrounding the chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1499384204,"Several approaches were used to test the hypothesis proposing a role for acyl-CoA esters in nutrient-induced insulin release (Prentki, M., and Matschinsky, F. M. (1987) Physiol. Rev. 67, 1185-1248; Corkey, B. E., Glennon, M. C., Chen, K. S., Deeney, J. T., Matschinsky, F. M., and Prentki, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21608-21612). Exogenous saturated long chain fatty acids markedly potentiated glucose-induced insulin release and elevated long chain acyl-CoA esters in the clonal beta-cell line (HIT). The secretory action depended on the fatty acid chain length, occurred in the range 3-20 microM (free concentration of palmitate), and was reversible and inhibitable by the neuromodulator somatostatin. 2-Bromopalmitate, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, suppressed the oxidation of endogenous fatty acids and promoted release of insulin. Only the nutrients or the combination of nutrients that caused secretion elevated malonyl-CoA. The short-chain acyl-CoA profile of HIT cells stimulated by various nutrients was determined in the presence of the nonstimulatory fuel glutamine. Glucose and leucine each provoked similar changes in acyl-CoA compounds. Both secretagogues elevated malonyl-CoA 3-6-fold, whereas succinyl-CoA, free CoASH, acetyl-CoA, and the free CoASH to acetyl-CoA ratio remained unaltered. Furthermore, only when inhibition of fatty acid oxidation was associated with a rise in malonyl-CoA did the total (mitochondrial plus cytoplasmic) content of long chain acyl-CoA esters correlate inversely with insulin release promoted by various nutrients. The results are consistent with the concept that fuel stimuli cause a rise in malonyl-CoA which by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation increase cytosolic long chain acyl-CoA esters. These data provide further support for a model in which malonyl-CoA and long chain acyl-CoAs esters serve as metabolic coupling factors when pancreatic beta-cells are stimulated with glucose and other nutrient secretagogues."
https://openalex.org/W1979505297,"The floor plate is a cell group implicated in the control of neural cell pattern and axonal growth in the developing vertebrate nervous system. To identify molecules that might mediate the functions of the floor plate, we have used subtractive hybridization techniques to isolate floor plate-enriched cDNA clones. One such clone encodes a novel secreted protein, F-spondin, which is expressed at high levels in the floor plate. The C-terminal half of the protein contains six repeats identified previously in thrombospondin and other proteins implicated in cell adhesion. F-spondin is expressed in the floor plate at the time that axons first extend and at lower levels in the peripheral nerve. Recombinant F-spondin promotes the attachment of spinal cord and sensory neuron cells and the outgrowth of neurites in vitro. F-spondin may contribute to the growth and guidance of axons in both the spinal cord and the PNS."
https://openalex.org/W2086284430,"Brefeldin A (BFA) causes a rapid redistribution of coat proteins (e.g., gamma-adaptin) associated with the clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), while the clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane are unaffected. gamma-Adaptin redistributes with the same kinetics as beta-COP, a coat protein associated with the non-clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the Golgi complex. Upon removal of BFA, however, gamma-adaptin recovers its perinuclear distribution more rapidly. Redistribution of both proteins can be prevented by pretreating cells with AlF4-. Recruitment of adaptors from the cytosol onto the TGN membrane has been reconstituted in a permeabilized cell system and is increased by addition of GTP gamma S and blocked by addition of BFA. These results suggest a role for G proteins in the control of the clathrin-coated vesicle cycle at the TGN and further extend the similarities between clathrin-coated vesicles and non-clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2122670476,"Oligosaccharyltransferase catalyzes the N-linked glycosylation of asparagine residues on nascent polypeptides in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). A protein complex composed of 66, 63, and 48 kd subunits copurified with oligosaccharyltransferase from canine pancreas. The 66 and 63 kd subunits were shown by protein immunoblotting to be identical to ribophorin I and II, two previously identified RER glycoproteins that colocalize with membrane-bound ribosomes. The transmembrane segment of ribophorin I was found to be homologous to a recently proposed dolichol recognition consensus sequence. Based on a revision of the consensus sequence, we propose a model for the interaction of dolichol with the glycosyltransferases that catalyze the assembly and transfer of lipid-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1528931356,"cDNA for the epithelial sialomucin episialin encodes a transmembrane molecule with a large extracellular domain, which mainly consists of repeats of 20 amino acids. Here we confirm the existence of a previously proposed proteolytic cleavage of episialin that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (Hilkens, J., and Buijs, F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4215-4222) and show that a similar cleavage takes place in in vitro translation systems. Using in vitro translation of truncated mRNAs, we map the cleavage site to a region located between 71 and 53 amino acids upstream of the transmembrane domain. Analysis of a mutant, in which this region has been deleted, indicates that the cleavage sites used in vitro and in vivo are identical or in close proximity. Both cleavage products remain associated although they are not linked through disulfide bonds. Therefore, the subunit derived from the N terminus, which represents the actual mucin-like domain, remains indirectly anchored to the cell membrane as a result of its interaction with the C-terminal subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1589060168,"Previously we had demonstrated that the termini of the arabinan component of mycobacterial cell wall arabinogalactan, the site of mycolic acid location, consists mostly of clusters of a pentaarabinofuranoside, [beta-D-Araf-(1----2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1----]2----(3 and 5)-alpha-D-Araf. Subsequently, the same arrangement was shown to dominate the non-reducing ends of lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a key component in the interaction of mycobacteria with host cell. Accordingly, we had proposed that mycobacteria universally elaborate the same Araf-containing motifs in two settings for different pathophysiological purposes. However, we now report that the termini of LAM from the virulent, Erdman, strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, unlike those from the attenuated H37Ra strain, are extensively capped with mannosyl (Manp) residues, either a single alpha-D-Manp, a dimannoside (alpha-D-Manp-(1----2)-alpha-D-Manp), or a trimannoside (alpha-D-Manp-(1----2)-alpha-D-Manp-(1----2)-alpha-D-Manp ). The use of monoclonal antibodies demonstrates a clear difference in the antigenicity of the basic and mannose-capped LAM. The possibility that these structures are a factor in the virulence of some strains of M. tuberculosis and represent an example of carbohydrate mimicry in mycobacterial infections is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1514161203,"A high glutathione peroxidase activity toward phospholipid hydroperoxides is present in rat testis. The attribution of this activity to the selenoenzyme phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX) was supported by cross-reactivity with antibodies raised against pig heart PHGPX which had been purified and characterized. Rat testis PHGPX is partially cytosolic and partially linked to nuclei and mitochondria. The soluble and organelle-bound enzymes appear identical by Western blot analysis. PHGPX, but neither selenium-dependent nor non-selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity, is expressed in testes only after puberty, disappears after hypophysectomy, and is partially restored by gonadotropin treatment. Specific immunostaining of testes by antiserum against PHGPX appears as a fine granular brown pattern localized throughout the cytoplasm in more immature cells but is confined to the peripheral part of the cytoplasm, the nuclear membrane, and mitochondria in maturating spermatogenic cells. As expected, immunostaining of spermatogenic cells in hypophysectomized animals was negative, but gonadotropin treatment only marginally increased the immunoreactivity. The expression of PHGPX in testes is consistent with the previously described specific requirement for selenium for synthesis of a 15-20-kDa selenoprotein which is related to the production of functional spermatozoa."
https://openalex.org/W1910940147,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein was isolated in the native state from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. A crucial step was its selective extraction with EDTA-containing buffer. The purified protein was subjected to electron microscopy using rotary shadowing and negative stain. The images allowed the construction of a structural model. The bouquet-like protein consists of five 28-nm-long arms containing a peripheral globular domain, a flexible strand, and a central assembly domain, where the five arms meet in a cylindrical structure."
https://openalex.org/W1547975753,"Exposure of bovine estrogen receptor to the metal chelators EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline results in a loss of nonspecific DNA binding, presumably because of the removal of zinc. Nonspecific DNA binding, as measured by a DNA-cellulose binding assay, can be restored by dialysis of the aporeceptor against buffer containing zinc, cadmium, and cobalt but not with buffer containing copper or nickel. More detailed studies were carried out using a bacterially expressed polypeptide encompassing the DNA binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. Apopolypeptide fails to bind DNA specifically, as measured by mobility shift assay using a consensus estrogen response element hexamer containing oligonucleotide, but DNA binding was restored by dialysis of the apopolypeptide against buffer containing zinc, cadmium, and cobalt but not with buffer containing copper or nickel. Dissociation constants of zinc- and cadmium-reconstituted polypeptide for the estrogen response element hexamer (66 and 48 nM, respectively) are virtually indistinguishable from native polypeptide (Kd = 48 nM) whereas cobalt-reconstituted polypeptide has a lower affinity (Kd = 720 nM). However, native, zinc-, cadmium-, and cobalt-reconstituted polypeptides gave identical results in a methylation interference assay. Competition experiments with zinc and copper or nickel suggest that copper and nickel are able to bind to zinc finger residues but do so nonproductively. The relative affinities copper greater than cadmium greater than zinc greater than cobalt greater than nickel for the polypeptide were determined by a zinc blot competition assay. The ability of cadmium and cobalt to substitute for zinc in the zinc fingers demonstrates a structural flexibility in the DNA binding domain as each of these metals has slightly different ionic radii. On the other hand, subtle differences in DNA binding affinity and/or specificity could exist, which may not be detectable here. Also, the ability of metals to substitute for zinc in the DNA binding domain suggests that metal substitution in these zinc fingers in vivo may be of relevance to the toxicity and/or carcinogenicity of some of these metals."
https://openalex.org/W1482754145,"In muscle and adipocytes, glucose transport is regulated by the translocation of insulin regulatable glucose transporters (GLUT4) between an intracellular compartment and the cell surface. In these studies we have characterized the cellular compartments containing GLUT4 in rat skeletal muscle. Immunocytochemical studies showed that in unstimulated muscle, GLUT4 was not present in surface membranes. Tubulo-vesicular structures clustered in the trans Golgi reticulum were enriched in GLUT4. GLUT4 underwent translocation to the sarcolemma in response to combined stimulation with insulin and exercise. Using immunoisolation, the intracellular GLUT4 vesicles (IRGTV) were purified 300-fold over the cell homogenate. IRGTV from unstimulated muscle were not enriched in markers specific for the sarcolemma, transverse tubules, sarcoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria; this was confirmed using gel filtration chromatography. Insulin resulted in a 40% decrease in GLUT4 levels in IRGTV confirming that this represents the intracellular compartment of GLUT4. GLUT4 is a major component of the IRGTV, constituting at least 5% of total vesicle protein. A subset of polypeptides are also markedly enriched in the muscle IRGTV. In conclusion, these data suggest that translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular tubulo-vesicular structures is the major mechanism by which insulin and exercise regulate muscle glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1582873709,"The lipopolysaccharides of mycobacteria, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and lipomannan (LM), of key importance in host-pathogen interaction, were recently shown to contain a phosphatidylinositol anchoring domain. We now have established that LAM and LM are based on the phosphatidylinositol mannosides, the characteristic glycophospholipids of mycobacteria. Digestion of the arabinose-free LM with an endo-alpha 1----6-mannosidase yielded evidence for the presence of the 1-(sn-glycerol-3-phospho)-D-myo-inositol-2,6-bis-alpha-D-mannopyranoside unit, indistinguishable from that derived from phosphatidylinositol dimannoside. This same inositol substitution pattern was shown to be present in LAM by methylation analysis before and after dephosphorylation. Positions C-2 and C-6 of the inositol unit of LAM are occupied by mannosyl residues and C-1 by a phosphoryl group. Partial acid hydrolysis of per-O-methylated LAM and comparison by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the resulting derivatized oligosaccharides with like products from phosphatidylinositol hexamannoside demonstrated that the C-6 of inositol is the point of attachment of the mannan core of LAM, which consists of an alpha 1----6-linked backbone with considerable alpha-1----2 side chains. Thus, a structural and presumably biosynthetic relationship is established between some of the membranous mannosylphosphatidylinositols described some 25 years ago and the newly emerging, biologically active lipopolysaccharides of mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1522846126,"The separate catalytic roles of Zn2+ and Mg2+ and the specificity of the prenyl pyrophosphate-binding site of the rat brain protein farnesyltransferase were explored using a purified enzyme preparation. The binding of p21Hras to the enzyme was abolished by dialysis against EDTA and restored by addition of ZnCl2, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking. The binding of the other substrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, was independent of divalent cations, as demonstrated by gel filtration. Transfer of the enzyme-bound farnesyl group to the bound p21Hras required Mg2+. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate bound to the prenyl pyrophosphate-binding site with an affinity equal to that of farnesyl pyrophosphate, but the geranylgeranyl group was not transferred efficiently to p21Hras. It also was not transferred to a modified p21Hras containing COOH-terminal leucine, a protein that was shown previously to be a good substrate for a rat brain geranylgeranyltransferase. We conclude that the protein farnesyltransferase is a metalloenzyme that most likely contains Zn2+ at the peptide-binding site. It thus resembles certain metallopeptidases, including carboxypeptidase A and the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Strategies previously developed to screen for inhibitors of those enzymes may aid in the search for inhibitors of the protein farnesyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2041958161,"The 2.2 kb mRNA of the Dictyostelium discoideum prespore gene EB4-PSV is constitutively transcribed during growth and development, but the message is only accumulated when cells form aggregates and establish the prespore-prestalk pattern. Disruption of the pattern by mechanical disaggregation results in a rapid loss of the mRNA, while transcription remains nearly unchanged. In early development and after disaggregation, when the mRNA is unstable, a 1.8 kb antisense transcript originating from the same gene locus is detected. This RNA has apparently no coding capacity and is transcriptionally regulated by a promoter located within the translated region of the gene. Excess transcription of antisense RNA in vegetative cells and after disaggregation suggests its involvement in the control of mRNA stability. In agreement with this assumption, the inhibition of RNA synthesis during disaggregation prevents destabilization of the mRNA. This stability regulation of an endogenous mRNA is reminiscent of the loss of specific mRNAs in cells transformed with antisense constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1978660049,"We have used synchronized HeLa cells to investigate the role of the nuclear membrane in preventing rereplication in a single cell cycle. Nuclei were prepared with intact nuclear membranes using streptolysin-O or digitonin and assayed for replication in Xenopus egg extracts. Intact G1 nuclei replicate semiconservatively, but intact G2 nuclei do not replicate in egg extract. However, permeabilizing the nuclear membranes of G2 nuclei by treatment with NP-40 allows them all to replicate in egg extract under cell cycle control, suggesting that integrity of the nuclear membrane is required to distinguish G2 from G1 human nuclei and to prevent rereplication within a single cell cycle. The results are discussed in terms of the previously proposed licensing factor model."
https://openalex.org/W40584579,"Cell surface proteoglycans help present some polypeptide growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to their receptors and may act as reservoirs for others such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Betaglycan, a cell surface heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that binds TGF-beta via its core protein, is shown here to bind bFGF via its heparan sulfate chains. We investigated the potential for regulation of betaglycan by its ligands in osteoblasts, a system in which bFGF and TGF-beta have complementary effects. We report here that the apparent molecular mass of betaglycan from an osteoblast-enriched primary culture of fetal rat calvaria is decreased in response to bFGF, as detected by an increased electrophoretic migration of betaglycan. The betaglycan forms expressed in bFGF-treated osteoblasts have a reduced content of heparan sulfate GAGs, without detectable changes in the content of chondroitin sulfate GAGs or the size of the core protein. bFGF did not affect the overall population of cell-surface-associated proteins identified by sulfate labeling, which contained primarily heparan sulfate, and had only small effects on the major secreted proteoglycans, which were, by contrast, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. The effect of bFGF on betaglycan is therefore a selective one. These results suggest that cells can interact with members of the TGF-beta and FGF families through separate domains of the same membrane proteoglycan, and can selectively regulate the bFGF-binding carbohydrate chains of this proteoglycan in response to bFGF."
https://openalex.org/W1524798848,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae OLE1 gene encodes the delta-9 fatty acid desaturase, an enzyme which forms the monounsaturated palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) fatty acids from palmitoyl (16:0) or stearoyl (18:0) CoA. Previous studies demonstrated that OLE1 mRNA levels and desaturase enzyme activity are repressed when either 16:1 delta-9 and 18:1 delta-9 are added to the growth medium (1). The polyunsaturate, linoleic acid (18:2, delta-9,12), which is not a product of the enzyme, is also a strong repressor. The specificity of the OLE1 transcriptional regulatory sensor was examined by testing the response of OLE1 promoter-lacZ fusion reporter genes to fatty acids that differ in chain length, degree of unsaturation and double bond positions. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids that contain a delta-9 double bond are strong repressors of reporter gene activity and native OLE1 mRNA levels. Monounsaturated fatty acids containing double bonds in the delta-10, delta-11, or delta-5 positions showed no repression of reporter enzyme levels although they were rapidly incorporated into membrane lipids and some supported growth of an OLE1 gene disrupted strain. Although 17:1 delta-10 does not repress OLE1 transcription, lipid analysis showed that it replaces almost all of the endogenous 16:1 delta-9 and 18:1 delta-9 in cellular lipids and OLE1 mRNA levels are strongly repressed. This suggests that additional systems regulate desaturase activity by post-transcriptional mechanisms that differ from the transcriptional sensor in their responses to specific fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1599906338,"We provide here the first direct evidence that D-aspartyl residues in peptides are substrates for the L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77). We do this by showing that D-aspartic acid beta-methyl ester can be isolated from carboxypeptidase Y digests of enzymatically methylated D-aspartyl-containing synthetic peptides. The specificity of this reaction is supported by the lack of methylation of L-aspartyl-containing peptides under similar conditions. Methylation of D-aspartyl residues in synthetic peptides was not observed previously because with Km values ranging from 2.5 to 4.8 mM, these peptides are recognized by the methyltransferase with 700-10,000-fold lower affinity than are their L-isoaspartyl-containing counterparts. The physiological significance of D-aspartyl methylation was investigated in two ways. First, analysis of in situ methylated human erythrocyte proteins showed that at least 22% of the methyl groups associated with the proteins ankyrin and band 4.1 are on D-aspartyl residues, suggesting that D-aspartyl methylation is an important function of the methyltransferase in vivo. Second, mathematical modeling of the protein aging and methylation reactions occurring in intact erythrocytes indicated that the accumulation of D-aspartyl residues can be reduced as much as 2-5-fold by the methyltransferase activity. Although this reduction is much less than that predicted for L-isoaspartyl residues, it may be significant in maintaining functional proteins throughout the 120-day life span of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1624763535,"The mitochondrial DNA polymerase of HeLa cells was purified 18,000-fold to near homogeneity. The purified polymerase cofractionated with two polypeptides that had molecular mass of 140 and 54 kDa. The 140-kDa subunit was specifically radiolabeled in a photoaffinity cross-linking assay and is most likely the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The purified enzyme exhibited properties that have been attributed to DNA polymerase gamma and shows a preference for replicating primed poly(pyrimidine) DNA templates in the presence of 0.5 mM MgCl2. As in the case of mitochondrial DNA polymerases from other animal cells, human DNA polymerase gamma cofractionated with a 3'----5' exonuclease activity. However, it has not been possible to determine if the two enzymatic activities reside in the same polypeptide. The exonuclease activity preferentially removes mismatched nucleotides from the 3' end of a duplex DNA and is not active toward DNA with matched 3' ends. These properties are consistent with the notion that the exonuclease activity plays a proofreading function in the replication of the organelle genome."
https://openalex.org/W1519843687,"Activation of human neutrophils involves the degranulation of specific and azurophil granules. This process is GTP-dependent and the presence of small GTP-binding proteins (SGBPs) has been detected in the two granule populations. At present, none of these SGBPs has been definitely identified. In order to characterize some of these proteins and obtain further insights as to their potential role in degranulation processes, we have used specific antibodies directed against the ras-related rap1 and rap2 proteins. By immunoblot analysis, we observed that rap2p is predominantly located in specific granules, whereas rap1p is detected both in specific granules and a fraction enriched in plasma membranes. Neither rap1p nor rap2p was found in the cytosol or in azurophil granules. Similarly, by indirect immunofluorescence, we observed that cytoplasmic granules were stained with anti-rap1p antibodies and anti-rap2p antibodies, and the plasma membrane was labeled with both antibodies but more distinctly with anti-rap1p than with anti-rap2p antibodies. rap1p and rap2p are tightly bound to the membrane of specific granules since they cannot be extracted by high salt or alkaline buffers. In addition, treatment of intact specific granules with pronase induced the degradation of rap proteins suggesting that they are exposed to the cytoplasmic face of the granules. Degranulation of neutrophils consists of the translocation and subsequent fusion of granules with the plasma membrane. Activation of this process induced the accumulation of rap proteins in the plasma membrane as observed by subcellular fractionation and indirect immunofluorescence experiments; this was not associated with the appearance of a soluble form of these proteins, showing that they remain membrane-bound during this process. The identification and subcellular localization of rap1p and rap2p at the surface of specific granules and the observation that they translocate to the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation without appearance of soluble forms constitute an important step toward the understanding of their physiological functions in human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2128900810,"Biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene in higher plants proceeds via the following pathway: S-adenosylmethionine—-1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)—-ethylene. Ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE), the enzyme responsible for the oxidation of ACC to ethylene, has been only partially characterized in vitro. We have obtained authentic EFE activity in vitro from extracts of avocado fruit (Persea americana Mill. cv Hass). Ammonium sulfate fractionation revealed the presence of two EFE activities, which we designate as EFE1 and EFE2. EFE1 activity utilizes ACC and O2 as substrates and requires Fe(II) and ascorbate as cofactors. The enzyme has a relatively low Km (32 microM) for ACC, discriminates diastereomers of 1-amino-2-ethyl-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and is inhibited competitively by 2-aminoisobutyric acid, thus confirming its identity with authentic EFE. Activity is retained in a 100,000 x g supernatant and has a pH optimum of 7.5-8.0, suggesting a cytosolic localization."

After exhaustive protease digestion, reductive beta-elimination, and subsequent chondroitinase ABC digestion, 13 hexasaccharide alditols, which are nonsulfated, sulfated, and/or phosphorylated, were obtained from the carbohydrate-protein linkage region. Six compounds, containing 0 or 1 sulfate and/or phosphate residue, represent approximately 40% of the isolated linkage hexasaccharide alditols. They were analyzed by chondroitinase ACII or alkaline phosphatase digestion in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography, and by 500 MHz one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. All six compounds have the conventional structure in common. Delta 4,5-GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl-ol One compound has no sulfate nor phosphate. Two of the monosulfated compounds have a O-sulfate on C-6 or on C-4 of the GalNAc residue. The third monosulfated compound has a novel O-sulfate on C-6 of the Gal residue attached to xylitol.

https://openalex.org/W251422572,"We showed in an earlier study (Arita, H., Hanasaki, K., Nakano, T., Oka, S., Teraoka, H., and Matsumoto, K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19139-19141) that there is a high affinity and specific binding site for mammalian group I phospholipase A2 (PLA2-I) in Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells. Analysis of the cellular distribution in rat using 125I-PLA2-I as a radioligand indicated the presence of this site in various cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), vascular endothelial cells, synovial cells, chondrocytes, and gastric mucosal cells. Scatchard analysis of rat VSMC revealed the existence of a single class of binding site with a Kd value of 1.60 nM and a Bmax value of 51.0 fmol/10(6) cells. The mammalian mature type of PLA2s-I derived from several animal species specifically recognized the same site in cells and stimulated DNA synthesis, whereas its inactive zymogen, mammalian group II PLA2s, and snake and bee venom PLA2s showed much lesser activities. 125I-PLA2-I bound to VSMC was rapidly internalized and subsequently released from the cells as trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. Down-regulation of the PLA2-I site was observed in the treatment of VSMC with cAMP-elevating agents, as well as glucocorticoids. Affinity labeling experiments indicated that PLA2-I binds to a single polypeptide with a mass of approximately 200,000 daltons. These results suggest a novel PLA2-I action on the cellular function via its specific binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2017423522,"We previously documented a greater than 100-fold rostrocaudal gradient of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in the muscles of adult mice that bear a myosin light chain-CAT transgene: successively more caudal muscles express successively higher levels of CAT. Here we studied the development and maintenance of this positional information in vitro. CAT levels reflect the rostrocaudal positions of the muscles from which the cells are derived in cultures established from adult muscles, in clones derived from individual adult myogenic (satellite) cells, in cultures prepared from embryonic myoblasts, and in cell lines derived by retrovirus-mediated transfer of an oncogene to satellite cells. Our results suggest that myoblasts bear a positional memory that is established in embryos, retained in adults, cell autonomous, heritable, stable to transformation, and accessible to study in clonal cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1547494165,"We have determined the complete sequence of chick brain alpha-actinin (892 amino acids; 107,644 Da). The sequence differs from that of smooth muscle alpha-actinin only in the region of the first EF-hand calcium-binding motif, where 27 residues in brain alpha-actinin are replaced by just 22 residues in the smooth muscle isoform. This probably accounts for the different calcium sensitivities of the two isoforms with respect to actin binding. Analysis of the gene structure showed that this region of sequence divergence is encoded by two separate exons whose incorporation is mutually exclusive. We have determined the proportion of the two transcripts in various tissues and cell lines using poly(A)+ RNA and a quantitative assay based on the polymerase chain reaction. MRC-5 fibroblasts and HeLa cells express mRNAs encoding both isoforms, whereas Namalwa lymphoblastoid cells, which lack actin stress fibers, express only the non-muscle mRNA. Both isoforms of alpha-actinin became incorporated into stress fibers and cell-matrix junctions when full-length chick alpha-actinin cDNAs were expressed in monkey COS cells. The levels of chick alpha-actinin mRNAs were found to be serum-inducible, suggesting that alpha-actinin may be an early response gene."
https://openalex.org/W1604930697,"The relationship between maturation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and its translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex was determined by measuring lipolytic activity under conditions preventing transport of the enzyme from the ER to the Golgi compartment. In the presence of brefeldin A, a reagent that inhibits movement of proteins from the ER and causes the disassembly of the Golgi complex, pro-5 Chinese hamster ovary cells accumulated catalytically active LPL, while secretion of the enzyme was effectively blocked. LPL retained intracellularly by brefeldin A treatment possessed oligosaccharide chains that were processed to the complex form by the Golgi enzymes redistributed into the ER. At 16 degrees C, a condition disrupting protein transport to the cis-Golgi, the retained enzyme again remained catalytically active although the oligosaccharides remained in the high mannose form. Lastly, attachment of the specific ER retention signal KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) to the carboxyl terminus of LPL also resulted in intracellularly retained enzyme that was fully active. The importance of oligosaccharide processing for attainment of LPL catalytic activity in vitro was also determined. LPL was active and secreted when trimming of the mannose residues was inhibited by deoxymannojirimycin and when addition of complex sugars was blocked using Chinese hamster ovary mutants (lec1 and lec2), indicating that these processing events are not necessary for the expression of a functional enzyme. However, blocking glucose removal by glucosidase inhibitors (castanospermine and N-methyl-deoxynojirimycin) resulted in a significant reduction in LPL specific activity and secretion. Thus, glucose trimming of LPL oligosaccharides is essential for enzyme activation; however, further oligosaccharide processing or translocation of the enzyme to the cis-Golgi is not required for full expression of lipolytic activity in vitro."

After exhaustive protease digestion, reductive beta-elimination and subsequent chondroitinase ABC digestion, 13 hexasaccharide alditols were obtained from the carbohydrate-protein linkage region and six of them contain 0 or 1 sulfate and/or 1 phosphate residue (Sugahara, K., Ohi, Y., Harada, T., de Waard, P., and Vliegenthart, J. F. G. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6027-6035). The other seven compounds, which represent approximately 60% of the isolated linkage hexasaccharides, were analyzed by chondroitinase ACII digestion in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography and by 500-MHz one- and two dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. All seven compounds have the following conventional structure in common. [formula: see text] Two disulfated compounds have an O-sulfate on C-6 of the Gal-2 residue attached to xylitol in combination with an O-sulfate on C-4 or on C-6 of the GalNAc residue. The third disulfated compound has O-sulfate on C-6 of Gal-2, and also on C-6 of Gal-3. Two of the trisulfated compounds also have O-sulfate on C-6 of both Gal-2 and Gal-3 with in addition sulfate on C-6 or C-4 of GalNAc. The other two trisulfated compounds have O-sulfate on C-6 of Gal-2 and on C-4 of Gal-3 in conjunction with sulfate on C-6 or C-4 of GalNAc."
https://openalex.org/W1606333544,"Abstract Unfolded (inactive) rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) can be reactivated in the presence of detergents, e.g. lauryl maltoside (LM). Here, we report the reactivation of urea-unfolded rhodanese in the presence of mixed micelles containing LM and the anionic mitochondrial phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL). Reactivation times increased as the number of CL molecules/micelle was increased. A maximum of 94% of the activity was recovered at 2.2 CL/micelle. Only 71% of the activity was recovered in the absence of CL. The major zwitterionic mitochondrial phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), had no effect on the LM-assisted reactivation of rhodanese. Size exclusion chromatography showed that denatured, but not native, rhodanese apparently binds to micellar amounts of LM and CL/LM, but not to PC/LM micelles. The lifetime of the enzyme-micelle complex increased with the number of CL molecules/micelle. Furthermore, chromatographic fractions containing micelle-bound enzyme had no activity, while renatured rhodanese-containing fractions were active. These results suggest that transient complexes form between enzyme and both LM and CL/LM micelles, and that this complex formation may be necessary for reactivation. For CL/LM micelles, interactions may occur between the positively charged amino-terminal sequence of rhodanese and the negatively charged CL phosphate. Finally, this work shows that there are similarities between micelle-assisted and chaperonin-assisted rhodanese refolding."
https://openalex.org/W1479680693,"Human selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (hGPx1) (EC 1.11.1.9) is thought to be involved in many critical cellular functions as a result of its role in glutathione-mediated reduction of toxic peroxides, and it is implicated as a mechanism of resistance against oxygen free radicals. Previous studies have demonstrated that the gene encoding hGPx1 (hgpx1) is more highly expressed in multidrug-resistant AdrR MCF-7 human breast cancer cells than in the parental WT MCF-7 cell line. In order to further study the transcriptional regulation of hgpx1, we have cloned the genomic hgpx1 gene and determined its nucleotide sequence. The 2550-base pair (bp) 5'-flanking sequence of hgpx1 contained the terminal 511 bp of the 3' end of a previously reported rhoH12 cDNA (Yeramian, P., Chardin, P., Madaule, P., and Tavitian, A. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 1989), a ras-related oncogene. Further downstream from rhoH12, but before the start of transcription of hgpx1, RNase protection analysis revealed a transcribed sequence of at least 270 bp which we have called mid. RNA transcripts homologous to both rhoH12 (1.8 and 1.5 kilobase pairs (kb)) and mid (1.8 kb) are also more highly expressed in AdrR MCF-7 cells than in WT MCF-7 cells. We screened an AdrR MCF-7 cDNA library with the mid sequence and isolated a partial cDNA clone which contains both mid and rhoH12 sequences and is colinear with the genomic sequence which extends from 10 bp 3' to the rhoH12 stop codon to 810 bp 5' to the start of transcription of hgpx1. The start of transcription of hgpx1 in AdrR MCF-7 cells was determined by primer extension analysis. The promoter and 2 kb of the 5'-flanking sequence of hgpx1 was fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (hGPx1-CAT1). Analysis of deletion constructs of hGPx1-CAT1 revealed three possible cis-acting regulatory regions. The transcriptional regulation of hgpx1 was examined using the hGPx1-CAT hybrid genes and nuclear run-on studies. We found no evidence that increased mRNA transcript formation could account for different levels of hgpx1 RNA either in different breast cancer cell lines or in response to selenium."
https://openalex.org/W1578314153,"When Trypanosoma brucei procyclic trypomastigotes were permeabilized with digitonin in a reaction medium containing MgATP, succinate, and 3.5 microM free Ca2+, they lowered the medium Ca2+ concentration to the submicromolar level (0.05-0.1 microM), a range that correlates favorably with that detected in the intact cells with fura-2. The carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-insensitive Ca2+ uptake, certainly represented by the endoplasmic reticulum, was completely inhibited by 500 microM vanadate. When vanadate instead of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was present, the Ca2+ set point was increased to 0.6-0.7 microM. The succinate dependence and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone sensitivity of the later Ca2+ uptake indicate that it may be exerted by the mitochondria. When bloodstream trypomastigotes were used, neither succinate nor alpha-glycerophosphate stimulated the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. The mitochondrial Ca2+ transport could be measured only in the presence of ATP and 500 microM vanadate to inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum uptake. Bloodstream trypomastigotes have a lower cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, as detected with fura-2 and a smaller extramitochondrial Ca2+ pool than procyclic trypomastigotes. Despite the presence of inositol phosphates, as determined by [3H]inositol incorporation, and the large extramitochondrial Ca2+ pool of procyclic trypomastigotes (61.7 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein), no inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ release could be detected in these parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1603019965,"Each subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) contains two conserved cysteine residues, which are known to form a disulfide bond, in the N-terminal extracellular domain. The role of this retained structural feature in the biogenesis of the AChR was studied by expressing site-directed mutant alpha and beta subunits together with other normal subunits from Torpedo californica AChR in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation of the cysteines at position 128 or 142 in the alpha subunit, or in the beta subunit, did not prevent subunit assembly. All Cys128 and Cys142 mutants of the alpha and beta subunits were able to associate with coexpressed other normal subunits, although associational efficiency of the mutant alpha subunits with the delta subunit was reduced. Functional studies of the mutant AChR complexes showed that the mutations in the alpha subunit abolished detectable 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BuTX) binding in whole oocytes, whereas the mutations in the beta subunit resulted in decreased total binding of 125I-alpha-BuTX and no detectable surface 125I-alpha-BuTX binding. Additionally, all mutant subunits, when co-expressed with the other normal subunits in oocytes, produced small acetylcholine-activated membrane currents, suggesting incorporation of only small numbers of functional mutant AChRs into the plasma membrane. The functional acetylcholine-gated ion channel formed with mutant alpha subunits, but not mutant beta subunits, could not be blocked by alpha-BuTX. Thus, a disulfide bond between Cys128 and Cys142 of the AChR alpha or beta subunits is not needed for acetylcholine-binding. However, this disulfide bond on the alpha subunit is necessary for formation of the alpha-BuTX-binding site. These results also suggest that the most significant effect caused by disrupting the conserved disulfide loop structure is intracellular retention of most of the assembled AChR complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1604147470,"We have previously provided evidence that laminin assembly occurs by the specific interaction of the alpha-helical domains of the A, B1, and B2 chains, located within the long arm of the molecule (Hunter, I., Schulthess, T., Bruch, M., Beck, K., and Engel, J. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 188, 205-211). Recent evidence for noncoordinate synthesis of the laminin chains, and in particular, the absence of the 400-kDa A chain from laminins produced by a number of cell types, has led us to examine the molecular mechanism of laminin assembly using the isolated A and B1-B2 chains of laminin fragment E8. E8A shows little tendency to self-associate, and when renatured from urea forms globular structures with little detectable alpha-helix. In contrast, E8B1-B2 renatures to form rod-like molecules, 30 nm in length. The rod-like structure, high alpha-helix content, and sharp thermal transition indicate that they are double stranded coiled coils. When mixed in equimolar amounts, E8A and E8B1-B2 renature to form molecules which are biochemically and ultrastructurally indistinguishable from native E8. If E8A and E8B1-B2 are renatured separately and mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio, they also form E8 molecules. These results suggest a mechanism of laminin assembly which involves the formation of a double coiled-coil B1-B2 intermediate with which the A chain subsequently interacts to form a triple coiled-coil laminin molecule. In addition, our results indicate that isoforms consisting of the B1 and B2 chains only would form stable laminin-like structures."
https://openalex.org/W1671275184,"We have investigated the dissociation, internalization, and degradation of 125I-interleukin-6 (125I-IL-6) by primary rat hepatocytes. Temperature shift experiments following saturation binding of 125I-IL-6 to cell surface receptors in hepatocytes showed a rapid loss of surface-bound 125I-IL-6 (t1/2 = 15 min), concomitant with a rapid rise in internalized radiolabeled ligand. After reaching a maximum by 30 min at 37 degrees C, the level of internalized 125I-IL-6 decreased with time and appeared in the culture media in a non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable (degraded) state. The addition of the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine inhibited this receptor-mediated degradation of IL-6 without affecting ligand internalization. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of internalized 125I-IL-6 confirms these results. Additionally, we show that the IL-6.IL-6 receptor complex is stable, and dissociation of these two molecular species occurs at a pH below 5.0. In contrast to published results, data presented in this study clearly indicate that IL-6 is rapidly internalized and degraded within hepatocytes by a receptor-mediated mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W287067515,"We have determined the half-lives and amounts per hepatocyte of the polymeric IgA receptor (pIgA-R) and four rat hepatocyte plasma membrane proteins and subsequently have predicted their rates of synthesis and possible routes of degradation. Using in vivo pulse-chase metabolic labeling with L-[35S]cysteine, we found that the pIgA-R had an apparent half-life of 1.1 h. Additional metabolic labeling experiments showed that CE9, HA4, and HA321 had apparent half-lives of 4-5 days, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV had an apparent half-life of 9 days. To quantify the amount of each protein per hepatocyte, homogenates and a standard curve of purified protein were compared by immunoblotting. We found that these proteins were present at 1-8 x 10(6) molecules/hepatocyte. The calculated rate of synthesis for pIgA-R was 1.6 x 10(6) molecules/hepatocyte/h, whereas the others were synthesized at much lower rates (0.9-5 x 10(4) molecules/hepatocyte/h). Using immunoblot analysis, we found that pIgA-R was released into bile at a rate of 30%/h (700%/day), whereas dipeptidyl peptidase IV and HA4 were released at a rate of 2-3%/day. While the majority of the loss of pIgA-R from hepatocytes occurred by release into the bile, less than 30% of the degradation of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and HA4 could be accounted for by this pathway, suggesting that the remaining molecules must be retrieved from the apical surface before degradation."

This protein, expressed from the cloned gene using the T7 polymerase system and [35S]methionine labeling, fractionated with cell membranes. Right-side-out (RSO) membrane vesicles prepared from a kgtP negative mutant strain did not transport alpha-ketoglutarate, but RSO vesicles from the same strain expressing KgtP from a transforming plasmid transported alpha-ketoglutarate effectively as measured by uptake of the 14C-labeled substrate. E. coli JC7623 strain grown in M9 minimal medium with glucose, glycerol, or alpha-ketoglutarate as carbon source contained a 1.3-kilobase RNA which hybridized to nick-translated kgtP probe. In addition, strain MC1061 cultures grown under these same conditions were all capable of transporting alpha-ketoglutarate, demonstrating that KgtP is constitutively expressed. The Km and Vmax of KgtP assayed in strain MC1061 vesicles were 13-46 microM and 8 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Uncouplers that permeabilized the membrane to protons inhibited alpha-ketoglutarate transport into energized vesicles, and the addition of alpha-ketoglutarate to vesicle suspensions under non-energized conditions resulted in an increase in pH. These results indicate that KgtP is an alpha-ketoglutarate-proton symporter."
https://openalex.org/W1502758571,"Cosmid clones containing the 5' region of the human alpha 2(VI) collagen gene have been isolated and characterized. DNA sequencing indicates that the signal peptide and the amino-globular domain are encoded by four exons of 142, 596, 21, and 66 base pairs (bp). However, S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses show that the transcription start site is not present in the 142-bp exon. Two different 5' cDNA clones are generated by the anchored polymerase chain reaction. Using the 5' cDNA clones as probes, two untranslated exons (1, 1A) are found 12 kilobase pairs upstream of the first coding exon. These two exons are alternatively used in human fibroblasts, and most transcripts contain exon 1 sequence. Exon 1 shows, by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection assay, two major and several minor transcription start sites. The promoter region contains a canonical TATA box, seven GGGCGG sequences, two possible CAAT boxes, and two sequences resembling AP2 binding sites. Exon 1A contains three alternative splice donor sites and is located 650 bp downstream of exon 1. The most 3' splice donor site of exon 1A is found within an Alu repeat sequence. Exon 1A is preceded by five GGGCGG sequences and one resembling the AP2 binding site although neither TATA or CAAT boxes are found. Two additional GGGCGG sequences are located at the beginning of exon 1A. This study establishes that the human alpha 2(VI) collagen gene is 36 kilobase pairs long and contains 30 exons. The 5'-untranslated and promoter regions are significantly different from the corresponding segments of the chicken gene. The human gene produces by alternative processing multiple mRNAs differing in the 5'-untranslated region as well as the 3'-coding and noncoding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1512981737,"The sequence-specific binding pattern of mammary nuclear proteins to the 545-base pair (bp) 5'-flanking region of the mouse beta-casein gene was compared between pregnant and lactating mice by a gel mobility shift assay. By using appropriate probes, two complexes were detected only during pregnancy, whereas an additional four complexes were detected during both pregnancy and lactation. The two pregnancy-specific complexes showed identical electrophoretic mobility and were cross-competed with two unlabeled DNA fragments used to generate the probes. Methylation interference experiments indicated that the two binding regions involved guanosine residues at nucleotides -350 and -8, and the sequences around each guanosine residue have a common palindromic sequence, 5'-TGAT/ATCA-3'. This binding factor is termed pregnancy-specific mammary nuclear factor. In gene transfection experiments, expression of the chimeric beta-casein-CAT gene linked to the 545 bp of mouse beta-casein gene promoter region was maximally induced when transfected mammary epithelial cells were cultured with the lactogenic hormones prolactin, hydrocortisone, and insulin, whereas it was very low when insulin alone was added. The addition of progesterone together with the lactogenic hormones inhibited the hormonal induction of the chimeric gene, whereas co-transfection with an oligonucleotide containing the pregnancy-specific mammary nuclear factor binding site substantially overcome the progesterone-mediated repression of transcription. Furthermore, mutation of the pregnancy-specific mammary nuclear factor binding sites of the chimeric beta-casein-CAT gene resulted in attenuation of the inhibitory effect of progesterone without blocking the stimulatory effect of the lactogenic hormones. These results indicate the presence of a pregnancy-specific mammary nuclear factor(s) that bind to two separate sites of the beta-casein gene promoter and suggest that it may serve as a repressor that mediates the inhibitory action of progesterone on beta-casein gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1609959936,"An extracellular phosphoglycan (exPG), present in the culture medium of the promastigote form of Leishmania donovani, was purified and structurally characterized. The purification scheme included ethanol precipitation of the culture medium, anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Structural analysis by 1H-1H NMR, methylation linkage analysis, and glycosidase digestion revealed that the exPG consisted of the following structure: (CAP)----[PO4-6Galp beta 1-4Manp alpha 1]10-11-PO4-6Galp beta 1-4Man. The cap was found to be one of several small, neutral oligosaccharides, the most abundant of which was the trisaccharide Galp beta 1-4(Manp alpha 1-2)Man. The results indicated structural analogy to the cellular-derived lipophosphoglycan (LPG) from L. donovani. The important exceptions are a lack of the lipid anchor, the entire phosphosaccharide core, and several of the repeating disaccharide units. Although the function of exPG is presently unknown, it may play a protective role for the promastigote in the insect vector or during infection of a mammalian host."

Combination of clinical, laboratory and radiological criteria were used in diagnostic approach of tuberculous meningitis. Urinary mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen detection is a promising diagnostic tool. Detection of mycobacterial antigen in concentrated urine sample is predicted to improve the positivity rate of the qualitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) diagnostic tool. The purpose of this study is to examine the detection ability of a monoclonal antibody qualitative ELISA in concentrated and unconcentrated urine of tuberculous meningitis patients.METHODS: This research is a descriptive, crosssectionally designed.

A total of 27 patients diagnosed as tuberculous meningitis patients were included and the subjects were classified into possible and probable criteria according to consensus criteria. The subjects were classified as definite if the cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Mycobacterial tuberculosis growth. The subjects were examined for the presence of LAM in unconcentrated and concentrated urine with a monoclonal antibody qualitative ELISA method.RESULTS: Unconcentrated urinary LAM examination positivity was 0% while in concentrated urine was 14.8%. The positivity of concentrated urinary LAM were higher among the definite criteria group.CONCLUSION: Concentrating urine sample increase the positivity rate of urinary LAM detection with ELISA method as high as 14.8%.

https://openalex.org/W1506596889,"The template strand of the URA3 gene in the minichromosome YRpTRURAP is repaired of UV-induced cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers (PD) much more efficiently than the nontemplate strand in growth-arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells (Smerdon, M. J., and Thoma, F. (1990) Cell 61, 675). However, other regions of the plasmid are also efficiently repaired. We have examined the transcription and chromatin structure of these regions in growth-arrested cells to allow a more detailed comparison of transcription, nucleosome stability, and excision repair efficiency. Northern analysis, using strand-specific probes, indicates that four different transcripts are made from YRpTRURAP in addition to the URA3 mRNA in both growing and growth-arrested cells. The templates for these transcripts encompass all of the efficiently repaired regions outside of the URA3 gene. Nucleosome mapping indicates that the structure of the minichromosome in growth-arrested cells is indistinguishable from that of growing cells except for two nucleosomes in the region 500-800 base pairs 5' of the URA3 gene which become much less stable in growth-arrested cells. Comparison of the distribution of YRpTRURAP topoisomers in the two states, however, indicates that these nucleosomes are not lost from the majority of plasmid molecules. One of the four transcripts initiates in this region and increases by more than 5-fold in growth-arrested cells. Another transcript extends into a ""slowly repaired"" region which contains a very stable nucleosome. By determining the stability and relative amounts (at equilibrium) of the RNAs made from YRpTRURAP, transcription rates were determined and compared with the average PD repair rate for the different template regions. The results indicate that: 1) the rate of excision repair increases once a low, basal rate of transcription is achieved; 2) beyond this rate of transcription there is no simple correlation between the rates of transcription and PD repair; 3) nucleosome stability may ""override"" the coupling between transcription and repair if the transcription rate is low; and 4) at higher transcription rates, repair may be insensitive to nucleosome stability."

A protocol consisting of DEAE-cellulose, Matrex Blue-A, hydroxylapatite, DEAE-Sephadex, Sephadex G-100, and NAD(+)-agarose column chromatography was used to purify this enzyme 6000-fold to homogeneity. This enzyme consists of two identical subunits, each with a molecular weight of 42,500. Using CDP-D-glucose as the substrate, the Km and Vmax of this catalysis were determined to be 222 microM and 8.3 mumols mg-1 min-1, respectively. Unlike most other oxidoreductases of its class which have a tightly bound NAD+, this highly purified CDP-D-glucose oxidoreductase showed an absolute requirement of NAD+ for its activity. Using chemically synthesized (6S)- and (6R)-CDP-D-[4-2H,6-3H]glucose as substrates, a stereochemical analysis showed this enzymatic reaction involves an intramolecular hydrogen migration from C-4 to C-6, and the displacement of C-6 hydroxyl group by the C-4 hydrogen occurs with inversion. Thus, despite the low cofactor affinity, this enzyme undergoes a mechanism consistent with that followed by other members of its type. Such a mechanistic and stereochemical convergency found for all sugar oxidoreductases so far characterized suggests the presence of a common progenitor of this class of enzyme."

Cys-89 represented the only cysteine residue in the protein. L7/L12Cys89 was overproduced in E. coli and purified. An allele replacement strain was also constructed. Growth of this strain was indistinguishable from that of wild type. Ribosomes from the allele replacement strain were used to determine the location of the C-terminal domains of L7/L12 by disulfide cross-linking. A new homobifunctional cysteine-specific cross-linking reagent, 1,4-di[3'-(2'-pyridyldithio)-propionamido]butane, and diagonal gel electrophoresis were used to identify ribosomal proteins cross-linked to L7/L12Cys89. A cross-link between L7/L12 and the single cysteine in L10 was found, in addition to L7/L12 dimers. The L7/L12Cys89-L10 cross-link locates the C-terminal domain of at least one L7/L12 dimer on the body of the large subunit and supports our previous model (Olson, H. M., Sommer, A., Tewari, D.

Fusion of human erythrocytes was monitored by light microscopy as well as spectrophotometrically by the octadecylrhodamine dequenching assay. Phospholipid translocation and distribution between the inner and the outer leaflet of intact red blood cells were determined with spin-labeled phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Significant fusion of lipid-asymmetric red blood cells where PS and PE are predominantly oriented to the inner leaflet was only observed at Ca2+ concentrations greater than or equal to 10 mM (in the presence of 10 mM phosphate buffer) while fusion of lipid-symmetric erythrocyte membranes was established at greater than or equal to 1.5 mM Ca2+. The Ca2+ threshold of fusion of lipid-asymmetric red blood cells was significantly reduced (i) after exposure of PS to the outer layer but not after redistribution of PE alone, and (ii) upon incorporation of spin-labeled PS into the outer leaflet of red blood cells. Spin-labeled PE or PC did not affect fusion, suggesting that the serine headgroup is an important factor in calcium-phosphate-induced fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1578152976,"To analyze the mechanism of the cell type-specific expression of protein kinase C beta (PKC beta), we isolated the 5'-portion of the human gene for PKC beta and identified multiple positive and negative regulatory sequences that regulate its transcription. S1 nuclease mapping as well as primer extension analysis of the 5'-end of the PKC beta mRNA identified a putative transcriptional initiation site (position +1) 484 base pairs (bp) upstream of the first ATG codon. The 5'-upstream sequence contains a CCAAT sequence at position -110, but no TATA box. The transcriptional activities of various 5'-deletion mutants of the PKC beta gene upstream region, fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene, were examined in terms of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression after transfection into three kinds of rodent cell lines: P19 and GH4C1, which are positive for the expression of PKC beta mRNA; and 3Y1, which is negative. Mutants containing a 5'-flanking sequence longer than 1.9 kilobases (kb) showed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities of the same order as the expression of the endogenous gene. This indicates that this region contains sequences regulating the cell-type specificity of PKC beta gene expression and that the specificity is determined at least partially at the level of transcription. The 1.9-kb sequence contains at least three positive elements: P1 (-56 to -234 bp), P2 (-234 to -411 bp), and PN (-1.4 to -1.9 kb). PN is active only in P19 cells, P1 in GH4C1 and P19 cells, and P2 in all three cell lines. In addition to these positive elements, there are negative elements: N1 (-411 to -674 bp), which is active in all three cell lines; and PN, which is active only in GH4C1 cells. These results suggest the presence of multiple trans-acting factors that act on these positive and negative cis-acting elements and regulate the cell type-specific expression of the PKC beta gene."
https://openalex.org/W178836386,"Possible involvement of protein phosphorylation in interferon (IFN)-mediated activation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) was investigated. For this purpose, in vivo experiments with specific inhibitors of protein kinases and in vitro experiments with protein phosphatases were carried out. In HeLaM cells, 2-aminopurine, an inhibitor of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, blocked the induction of ISGF3 gamma subunit but not the activation of ISGF3 alpha subunit. A series of experiments using combinations of protein and RNA synthesis inhibitors and 2-aminopurine indicated that the block elicited by 2-aminopurine was at the level of ISGF3 gamma mRNA synthesis. Activation of ISGF3 alpha, although insensitive to 2-aminopurine, was completely blocked by 10 nM staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. On the other hand, even 500 nM staurosporine did not block the induction of ISGF3 gamma. Incubation of cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts of IFN-treated HeLaM cells in vitro with alkaline phosphatase completely eliminated their ability to form the ISGF3 complex but not the ISGF1 complex. Treatment with acid phosphatase, on the other hand, changed the electrophoretic mobility of the ISGF3 complex but did not obliterate it. Complementation experiments revealed that ISGF3 alpha was the alkaline phosphatase-sensitive component of the complex. These results suggest that a protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation step is involved in ISGF3 alpha activation and a 2-aminopurine-sensitive component is involved in ISGF3 gamma mRNA induction."
https://openalex.org/W218149522,"Three serine kinases which phosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II have been identified in Aspergillus nidulans. The kinases (KI, KII, KIII) were identified using a synthetic peptide containing four copies of the CTD consensus heptamer repeat, and differ in chromatographic behavior, and apparent molecular mass (KI approximately 60kDa; KII approximately 82kDa; KIII approximately 43 kDa). KIII utilized, in addition to peptide, histone H1 as substrate, whereas casein was not phosphorylated by any of the three kinases. The kinases appear to be unrelated to the p34cdc2 kinase, as judged by Western blot analysis and the position of serine phosphorylation of the synthetic CTD peptide. KI was highly purified and renaturation experiments have shown that it consists of a single polypeptide of 57 kDa. KI also phosphorylated RNA polymerase II associated in a preinitiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W292782049,"Goat beta-mannosidase was purified 120,000-fold in 26% yield from kidney using concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography followed by immunoaffinity and cation-exchange chromatography. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, the purified enzyme preparation consists of 90- and 100-kDa peptides. Both these peptides react with anti-beta-mannosidase monoclonal antibodies and produce similar electrophoretic peptide patterns when subjected to limited proteolysis. Deglycosylation reduces the size of the 90- and 100-kDa peptides to 86 and 91 kDa, respectively. Goat kidney tissues lacking beta-mannosidase activity, acquired from animals affected with beta-mannosidosis, do not contain detectable quantities of the 90- and 100-kDa peptides as judged by monoclonal antibody reactivity. We postulate that the 90- and 100-kDa peptides represent two related forms of beta-mannosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1511106643,"Calmodulin (CaM) mediates the Ca(2+)-dependent activation of many enzyme systems in accordance with its cellular localization. We have described previously a muscarinic receptor-mediated translocation of CaM from membranes into the cytosol of SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. To explore the potential targets (CaM-binding proteins, CaMBP) for CaM upon translocation, a photoreactive CaM derivative was introduced into living SK-N-SH cells using a scrape-loading technique. Scrape-loading incorporated rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled CaM with an efficiency of 38%. CaM-diazopyruvamide (CaM-DAP), a Ca(2+)-dependent and CaM-specific probe, was also introduced into the cells. The muscarinic agonist carbachol stimulated a translocation of CaM from membranes into cytosol in CaM-DAP-loaded SK-N-SH cells. Upon photochemical cross-linking, cross-linked adducts of CaM-CaMBP were detected by immunoblotting with anti-CaM antibody. Carbachol stimulated increased photoaffinity labeling of three proteins with relative adduct molecular masses of 70, 120, and 180 kDa. The time course of labeling for the 70- and 120-kDa adducts showed maximal increased by 15-30 min. The 180-kDa adduct displayed a slower time course of maximal labeling, with increases maintained for 2-4 h. Subtracting the molecular mass of CaM, carbachol stimulated binding to CaMBPs of 55, 105, and 163 kDa. Predominant cellular CaMBP were identified using a biotinylated CaM overlay procedure. Western blot analysis indicated the expression of specific CaM-dependent enzymes such as calcineurin, phosphodiesterase, the beta-isoform (rat brain) of CaM kinase II, and Ca(2+)-ATPase. Numerous cytoskeletal CaMBP were expressed such as microtubule-associated protein-2, spectrin, tubulin, caldesmon, adducin, and neuromodulin. Of the CaMBP expressed, phosphodiesterase, calcineurin, caldesmon, and adducin cross-linked with CaM-DAP in the loaded SK-N-SH cells. Carbachol stimulated the time-dependent CaM-DAP labeling of calcineurin and adducin. This study demonstrates the novel incorporation of a photoreactive CaM derivative into living cells, as well as muscarinic receptor-activated CaM-DAP interaction with several cellular CaMBP. We postulate that carbachol-stimulated CaM translocation in SK-N-SH cells may affect the activity of CaM-dependent enzymes and may alter aspects of cytoskeletal function."
