https://openalex.org/W1517035469,"Alternative splicing of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) primary transcript produces two receptor isoforms, hGRα and hGRβ, which differ at their carboxyl termini. The hGRα isoform conveys endocrine information to target tissues by altering patterns of gene expression in a hormone-dependent fashion. In contrast to hGRα, very little is known about the hGRβ splice variant. Using hGRα- and hGRβ-specific riboprobes on human multiple tissue Northern blots, we show that the hGRβ message has a widespread tissue distribution. We also prove by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction that the alternative splicing event underlying the formation of the hGRβ message occurs in these tissues. Because the hGRβ protein differs from hGRα at the extreme COOH terminus, we investigated several of the biochemical properties of hGRβ expressed in transfected cells. hGRβ does not bind the glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone nor the glucocorticoid antagonist RU38486 <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, in contrast to hGRα, hGRβ is located primarily in the nucleus of transfected cells independent of hormone administration. Finally, in the absence of hGRα, hGRβ is transcriptionally inactive on a glucocorticoid-responsive enhancer. However, when both isoforms are expressed in the same cell, hGRβ inhibits the hormone-induced, hGRα-mediated stimulation of gene expression. Thus, hGRβ potentially functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of hGRα activity."

In a previous study we have shown that circular plasmid molecules containing multiple AP sites are efficiently repaired by Chinese hamster extracts in an in vitro repair assay. An average patch size of 6.6 nucleotides for a single AP site was calculated. To define the exact repair patch, a circular DNA duplex with a single AP site was constructed. The repair synthesis carried out by hamster and human cell extracts was characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis of the area containing the lesion. The results indicate that, besides the repair events involving the incorporation of a single nucleotide at the lesion site, repair synthesis occurred also 3′ to the AP site and involved a repair patch of approximately 7 nucleotides. This alternative repair pathway was completely inhibited by the presence in the repair reaction of a polyclonal antibody raised against human proliferating cell nuclear antigen. These data give the first evidence that mammalian cell extracts repair natural AP sites by two distinct pathways: a single nucleotide gap filling reaction targeted at the AP site and a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent pathway that removes a short oligonucleotide containing the abasic site and 3′-flanking nucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W1492344672,"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) was recently isolated by expression cloning based on its ability to induce an increase in cell size in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Sequence similarity data suggested that CT-1 is a novel member of a family of structurally related cytokines sharing the receptor component gp130. The present study documents that gp130 is required for CT-1 signaling in cardiomyocytes, by demonstrating that a monoclonal anti-gp130 antibody completely inhibits c-fos induction by CT-1. Similarly, a leukemia inhibitory factor receptor subunit β (LIFRβ) antagonist effectively blocks the CT-1 induction of c-fos, indicating a requirement for LIFRβ in the hypertrophic response, as well. Upon stimulation with CT-1, both gp130 and the LIFRβ are tyrosine-phosphorylated, providing further evidence that CT-1 signals through the gp130/LIFRβ heterodimer in cardiomyocytes. CT-1 induces a hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes that is distinct from the phenotype seen after α-adrenergic stimulation, both with regard to cell morphology and gene expression pattern. Stimulation with CT-1 results in an increase in cardiac cell size that is characterized by an increase in cell length but no significant change in cell width. Confocal laser microscopy of CT-1 stimulated cells reveals the assembly of sarcomeric units in series rather than in parallel, as seen after α-adrenergic stimulation. CT-1 induces a distinct pattern of immediate early genes, and up-regulates the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, but does not affect skeletal α-actin or myosin light chain-2v expression. As evidenced by nuclear run-on transcription assays, both CT-1 and α-adrenergic stimulation lead to an increase in ANF gene transcription. Transient transfection analyses document that, in contrast to α-adrenergic stimulation, the CT-1 responsive cis-regulatory elements are located outside of the proximal 3 kilobase pairs of the ANF 5′-flanking region. These studies indicate that CT-1 can activate a distinct form of myocardial cell hypertrophy, characterized by the promotion of sarcomere assembly in series, via gp130/LIFRβ-dependent signaling pathways.

These studies indicate that CT-1 can activate a distinct form of myocardial cell hypertrophy, characterized by the promotion of sarcomere assembly in series, via gp130/LIFRβ-dependent signaling pathways. Hypertrophy is one of the most important compensatory responses of the myocardium, as it is critical for the maintenance of normal cardiac function in response to pressure overload in the setting of hypertension or volume overload during valvular insufficiency. However, the mechanical stimuli of pressure versus volume overload produce distinct cardiac muscle phenotypes, with the former resulting in a concentric pattern of hypertrophy, and the latter promoting an eccentric form of hypertrophy with cardiac chamber dilation. On a single cell level, cardiac myocytes isolated from concentric hypertrophic hearts display an increase in cell diameter with the addition of new myofibrils in parallel(1.Morkin E. Science. 1970; 167: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2.Anversa P. Ricci R. Olivetti G. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1986; 7: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), while myocytes derived from dilated hearts exhibit an increase in cell length, reflecting the addition of new sarcomeric units in series(3.Anversa P. Levicky V. Beghi C. McDonald S.L. Kikkawa Y. Circ. Res. 1983; 52: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4.Gerdes A.M. Campbell S.E. Hilbelink D.R. Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 857-861PubMed Google Scholar). These distinct morphological phenotypes are associated with different effects on global cardiac function. Chronic volume overload hypertrophy can result in an irreversible loss of cardiac function, while pressure overload hypertrophy is usually associated with the preservation of contractile function, and can often be reversible. While both forms of hypertrophy can lead to the induction of the atrial natriuretic factor gene, distinct molecular phenotypes have also recently been observed(5.Calderone A. Takahashi N. Izzo N.J. Thaik C.M. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2385-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although it has long been accepted that there are distinct morphologic forms of hypertrophy in the setting of pressure or volume overload, the signaling pathways which mediate these distinct cardiac phenotypes remain unclear. One of the critical questions is whether divergent signaling pathways are responsible for the activation of these distinct forms of hypertrophy that display clear differences with respect to cell morphology, physiology, and the induction of molecular markers. Our current insight into the mechanisms controlling cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has primarily been obtained from an in vitro model employing neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.

Following activation of the G-protein-dependent pathways, cardiomyocytes display a uniform enlargement of cell size, with increases in cell width and length, resulting from the assembly of new myofibrils in parallel(12.Shubeita H.E.

Taken together, these studies indicate that G-protein coupled receptors and ras-dependent pathways activate a form of cardiac hypertrophy that resembles the hypertrophy seen in the setting of pressure overload. The question arises as to whether divergent signaling pathways would mediate a volume overload like hypertrophic phenotype, characterized by sarcomere assembly in series and myocyte enlargement primarily due to an increase in cell length versus width. By coupling expression cloning to a miniaturized version of the in vitro hypertrophy assay, we have recently isolated a novel 21.5-kDa protein that induces an increase in cell size and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) 1The abbreviations used are: ANFatrial natriuretic factorCT-1cardiotrophin-1LIFleukemia inhibitory factorhLIFhuman LIFILinterleukinCNTFciliary neurotrophic factorCNTFRCNTF receptorOSMoncostatin MPEphenylephrine(s)IL-6R(soluble) IL-6 receptorLIFRβLIF receptor subunit βMLC-2vventricular myosin light chain-2βMHCβ myosin heavy chainGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineI.E.immediate earlyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRSVRous sarcoma virusbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). release in cardiomyocytes(19.Pennica D.

Sequence similarity data and structural considerations suggest that CT-1 is a new member of a family of structurally related cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-11, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and oncostatin M (OSM). The receptors of this cytokine family are multimeric and share the class-specific transmembrane signal transducing component gp130 (20.Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T.

Other members of this cytokine family first bind to a private receptor component and subsequently induce gp130 dimerization. For example, IL-6 binds to the receptor component IL-6R, and the IL-6•IL-6R complex then induces the homodimerization of gp130 (28.Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B.

The cloning of CT-1 based on its ability to induce an increase in cell size in cardiomyocyte culture (19.Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R.

A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) suggested that gp130-dependent signaling pathways may be coupled to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In the present study we define the receptor system used by CT-1 in cardiomyocytes, and we examine the effects of CT-1 and two other members of the IL-6 cytokine family, LIF and CNTF, on morphological and molecular features defining a hypertrophic response in cultured cardiomyocytes. By using a monoclonal anti-gp130 antibody and a LIFRβ antagonist, we establish that both gp130 and LIFRβ are required for CT-1 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting data show that CT-1 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 and a higher molecular weight protein, corresponding in size to LIFRβ. Using confocal laser microscopy of cells stained for both thick and thin filament markers, our studies further indicate that gp130/LIFRβ-dependent signaling pathways induce a hypertrophic phenotype in cardiomyocytes that is distinct from the response seen after α-adrenergic stimulation, and that shows resemblance to volume overload cardiac hypertrophy both with regard to cell morphology and gene expression pattern. Murine LIF was produced at Genentech, Inc. Murine LIF was used throughout the study, except for the experiment employing the LIFRβ antagonist (hLIF-04), in which both murine LIF and human LIF were used. Rat CNTF and human IL-6 were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and from Genzyme, respectively. Human sIL-6R was prepared as outlined previously(21.Taga T. Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Miki D.

The α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) was obtained from Sigma. The reading frame of murine CT-1 was cloned C-terminal to the sequence encoding the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D followed by a factor Xa cleavage site. Following expression in 293 cells and cleavage of the herpes simplex virus secretion signal sequence, the CT-1 fusion protein contained a 34-amino acid N-terminal extension followed by the CT-1 sequence(19.Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The CT-1 fusion protein was purified from conditioned medium with a herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D-specific monoclonal antibody and quantified by a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). The LIFRβ antagonist hLIF-04 was used to assess the requirement of the LIFRβ for CT-1 signaling. Human LIF (hLIF) and the hLIF mutant, hLIF-04, were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, as described previously(32.Robinson R.C. Grey L.M. Staunton D. Vankelecom H. Vernallis A.B.

A detailed characterization of the LIFRβ antagonist hLIF-04 will be presented elsewhere. 2K. R. Hudson, A. B. Vernallis, and J. K. Heath, manuscript submitted for publication. Hearts from 1-3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were removed, the ventricles were pooled, and the ventricular cells were dispersed by digestion with collagenase II (Worthington) and pancreatin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell suspension was purified by centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll gradient to obtain myocardial cell cultures with >95% myocytes, as assessed by immunofluorescence with an anti-TrpE/MLC-2v antiserum(12.Shubeita H.E.

The cardiomyocytes were plated at a density of 5-6 × 104 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/medium 199 (4:1) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and antibiotics (plating medium), and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were then washed twice with DMEM/medium 199 and further incubated in DMEM/medium 199 supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics (maintenance medium) in the presence or absence of various agents. Neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes were isolated from 1-4-day-old NIH Swiss mice, following the protocol outlined above. One litter (8-12 pups) yielded ˜5 × 105 cells. Approximately 95% of the cells displayed spontaneous contractile activity in culture. Cardiomyocytes were stimulated with various agents and solubilized with ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mMp-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Clear lysates were obtained by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-gp130 cytoplasmic peptide antibody(34.Hirata Y. Taga T. Hibi M. Nakano N Kishimoto T. J.

Immunoprecipitates (protein A-Sepharose, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology), employing an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). For the detection of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the cell lysates were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with 4G10. Cardiomyocytes were plated in Lab-Tek plastic chamber slides (Nunc), precoated with 4 μg/cm2 laminin (Sigma), and incubated in the presence or absence of various agents. After 48 h, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Following three phosphate-buffered saline washes, the chamber slides were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin for 10 min to block nonspecific sites. Subsequently, the cells were dual-stained for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin with 1) a polyclonal anti-TrpE/MLC-2v antiserum from rabbit(12.Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U.

Following four phosphate-buffered saline washes, the slides were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 10 min, incubated for 1 h in 5% normal donkey serum using a Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories), and finally mounted on glass coverslips. Cardiomyocytes stained against MLC-2v and ANF were viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Cell size was estimated by measuring the area to which individual MLC-2v-positive cells attached (planimetry), cell length and width were determined as outlined in Fig. 1, and the percentage of MLC-2v positive cells that displayed perinuclear staining for immunoreactive ANF was calculated. Cardiomyocytes stained against βMHC and F-actin (rhodamine phalloidine) were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy using a 60 × oil immersion objective. Images of cardiomyocytes stained against βMHC were used to determine the effect of various agonists on the average sarcomere length. The concentration of immunoreactive ANF in cell culture supernatants was determined by radioimmunoassay, using the monoclonal mouse anti-rat ANF antibody with synthetic ANF-(99-126) as the standard and 125I-ANF-(99-126) (Amersham) as the trace(35.Glembotski C.C.

Run-on transcription assays were performed as described previously(48.Marzluff W.F. Huang R.C.C. Harnes B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 89-129Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and further disrupted by 10 gentle strokes with a loose pestle in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were recovered by centrifugation. The supernatants (representing the cytosolic fractions) were saved, and vanadylribonucleoside complexes (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to inhibit RNase activity. Total RNA was isolated from the cytosolic fractions and subjected to Northern blot analysis using prepro-ANF, GAPDH, and 28s cDNA probes. The nuclei were washed once in Nonidet P-40 buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of storage solution (50% glycerol, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol), and stored at −80°C. On the day of the assay, the nuclei were thawed, 27.5 μl of run-on buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 750 mM KCl, 25 mM dithiothreitol, 1.25 mM of ATP, GTP, and CTP), 6 μl (62.5 μCi) of [α-32P]UTP, and 1 μl of RNasin (Promega) were added, and the nuclei were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. Following DNA and protein digestion (RQ-1 DNase 1, Promega; proteinase K, Life Technologies, Inc.), the 32P-labeled RNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and purified over a RNase-free Sephadex G50 column (Boehringer Mannheim). The total amount of 32P-labeled RNA recovered from each reaction was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman).

The filters were prehybridized for 1 h in 56.25% formamide, 0.25 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.25 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS. An equal number of counts from each run-on reaction were added to the prehybridization solution, and hybridizations were carried out for 48 h at 42°C. Finally, the filters were washed under stringent conditions and exposed to x-ray film. The amount of ANF and GAPDH-specific hybridization was determined by densitometry. No hybridization to the empty pBluescript control was detectable (data not shown). pANF(−3003)Luc5′, an ANF-luciferase reporter construct composed of the most proximal 3003 bp of the rat ANF gene 5′-flanking region inserted into the promoterless firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pSVOALuc5′ was used to assess the CT-1-, LIF-, CNTF-, and PE-indu"

To identify potential intracellular compartments involved in Aβ production, we expressed human APP-695 (APPwt) and APP-695 harboring the Swedish double mutation (APPswe) associated with familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease, in mouse N2a cells. We demonstrate that cells expressing APPswe secrete high levels of Aβ peptides and β-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives (APPsβ) relative to cells expressing APPwt. In addition, we observed a concomitant diminution in the levels of α-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives (APPsβ). Our interpretation of these findings is that β-secretase cleavage occurs in an intracellular compartment and disables those substrates which would normally be cleaved by α-secretase. As anticipated, the levels of APPswe are diminished relative to the steady-state levels of surface-bound APPwt; moreover, surface-bound APPswe and APPwt molecules are released from the plasma membrane after cleavage by α-secretase, but not by β-secretase. Finally, by examining the rate of appearance of specific APP metabolites generated by β-secretase, we now unequivocally demonstrate that β-secretase cleavage of APPswe occurs within the Golgi apparatus, as early as the medial compartment.

The biochemical mechanism(s) and cellular compartments involved in Aβ production have not been fully elucidated. Despite earlier excitement created by the discovery of potential amyloidogenic fragments generated in endosomal-lysosomal pathways, several lines of evidence now suggest that lysosomal degradation of APP is unlikely to contribute to the production of Aβ (reviewed in (24.Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar)). However, agents that interfere with pH gradients (i.e. ammonium chloride and chloroquine) inhibit the production of Aβ(19.Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 21.Shoji M. Golde T.E. Ghiso J. Cheung T.T. Estus S.

Science. 1992; 258: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), suggesting that Aβ may be generated in acidic compartments (i.e. endosomes and/or late Golgi). Indeed, biochemical studies by Koo and Squazzo (23.Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed that Aβ production and release involves the endocytosis of full-length APP from the cell surface and subsequent recycling. In this model, β-secretase cleavage occurs within endocytic compartments while γ-secretase cleavage of the residual ˜100-amino acid membrane fragment occurs virtually simultaneously with Aβ formation and release. However, the stoichiometry of Aβ contributed by reinternalized APP to Aβ generated in the biosynthetic pathway is not known. To identify potential intracellular compartments involved in Aβ production, we examined the metabolism of APP with a double mutation at codons 670 and 671 (of APP-770) described in two large Swedish pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease. Cells expressing this mutant APP secrete ˜6-8-fold higher levels of Aβ relative to cells expressing wild-type APP(25.Cai X-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 26.Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). In preceding efforts, we examined the trafficking and metabolism of APPwt and APPswe in polarized epithelial cells (MDCK)(27.Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30966-30973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that APPswe was cleaved at the β-secretase site and that the resulting soluble derivative, termed APPsβ, was detectable in cell lysates. These results lead to the suggestion that “β-secretase” cleavage occurs in an intracellular compartment. In the present report, we extend the observations in MDCK cells by characterizing the maturation of APPswe in transiently and stably transfected N2a cells, a mouse peripheral neuroblastoma line. We demonstrate that N2a cells expressing APP harboring the Swedish mutations secrete high levels of Aβ peptides and APPsβ derivatives relative to cells expressing APPwt. Interestingly, we observed a concomitant diminution in the levels of secreted APPsα. One scenario to explain this intriguing result is that normal α-secretase substrates are disabled by the prior action of β-secretase. This model predicts that β-secretase must cleave APPswe in an intracellular compartment proximal to the cellular site(s) of α-secretase activity. We now confirm that β-secretase cleavage occurs within the Golgi apparatus, as early as the medial compartment. The construction of expression plasmids pAPPwt and pAPPswe were described previously(27.Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30966-30973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to generate pAPPwt, a DNA fragment encoding wild-type human APP-695 with an carboxyl-terminal epitope tag of 12 amino acids from the c-Myc oncoprotein (MEQKLISEEDLN), at the COOH terminus of APP, was subcloned downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter in plasmid pCB6. Plasmid pAPPswe (27.Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

To generate plasmid pEF-VSVG, a 1.7-kilobase XhoI fragment encoding the VSVG protein from plasmid pJC/G (28.Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was subcloned downstream of the elongation factor 2α promoter in plasmid pEF-Bos(29.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells were transfected using a high-efficiency CaPO4 co-precipitation procedure(30.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). To generate cell lines that express human APPwt and APPswe, N2a cells were transfected with pAPPwt or pAPPswe and stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) (the pCB6 vector contains a gene encoding resistance to the neomycin analog, G418). Expression of c-Myc-modified human APP was assayed by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antiserum Myc-I raised against the synthetic peptide MEQKLISEEDLN(31.Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling, N2a cells were starved for 20 min in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then labeled with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN) in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for either 3 h or 10 min. For pulse-chase analysis, parallel dishes of cells were labeled for 5 min; at the end of the labeling period, one dish of cells was washed and then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing detergents and protease inhibitors(11.Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), while the remaining dishes were washed once and incubated for various periods of time in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 mML-methionine. Cell-associated and soluble APP derivatives were immunoprecipitated as described previously(11.Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L.

To examine the levels of cell surface-bound APP, duplicate dishes of cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 h. At the end of the labeling period, conditioned medium was collected and cell monolayers were rinsed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM each of CaCl2 and MgCl2. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in 10 mM borate buffer, pH 9.0(37.Siemers K.A. Wilson R. Mays R.W. Ryan T.A. Wollner D.A. Nelson W.J. Science. 1993; 260: 554-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for 45 min at 4°C. Cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM NH4Cl to quench unreacted biotin. Ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum was added to one set of cells and kept on ice; prewarmed medium was added to the other set of cells and placed at 37°C for 10 min. After 10 min, the medium from cells held at 4°C or at 37°C were collected and detergent-soluble extracts were prepared from cell monolayers after lysis in immunoprecipitation buffer. To assess the level of cell surface-bound APP, radiolabeled cell lysates were subject to immunoprecipitation with 369 antiserum. The immunoprecipitates were boiled in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% SDS to dissociate APP-related polypeptides from the antibody. The resulting soluble fraction was subsequently incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) to recover biotinylated APP, as described previously(27.Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30966-30973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the fraction of soluble derivatives which were biotinylated, i.e. that were released from the cell surface, equivalent aliquots of medium collected from cells incubated at 37°C following biotinylation was incubated with either mAb 22C11, an antibody that recognizes a region between residues 66 and 81 of APP (6.Weidemann A.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were dissociated by boiling in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% SDS. The resultant soluble fraction was adjusted to 1 × immunoprecipitation buffer and subjected to a second round of binding to streptavidin-agarose beads. [35S]Methionine-labeled APP was immunoprecipitated from detergent soluble lysates using Myc-I antiserum. The immune complexes were boiled for 3 min in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% SDS, and 0.2%β-mercaptoethanol to dissociate APP-related proteins from the antibody and sodium citrate was added to a final concentration of 0.2 M. The samples were split into two 50-μl aliquots and incubated in the presence or absence of 2 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37°C for 16 h. Expression constructs encoding c-Myc tagged APPwt or APPswe (27.Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30966-30973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were transiently transfected into N2a cells and recipient cells were labeled continuously with [35S]methionine for 3 h. APP-related species were immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates using an antibody, 369, raised against the entire cytoplasmic domain of APP. Essentially identical levels of accumulated “immature”˜105-kDa and “mature”˜120-kDa species were detected in lysates of cells expressing APPwt of APPswe (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3), which were clearly overexpressed over endogenous APP species (Fig. 1A, lane 1). As expected, ˜100-kDa soluble APP-related species (APPs) were immunoprecipitable from conditioned medium of cells expressing APPwt using antibody P2-1, specific for an epitope in the human APP amino terminus (Fig. 1A, lane 5). On the other hand, we consistently immunoprecipitated elevated levels of soluble APP derivatives from conditioned medium of cells overexpressing APPswe (Fig. 1B, lane 6) relative to derivatives in medium of cells expressing APPwt. Moreover, the vast majority of the soluble derivatives generated from APPswe migrated with somewhat accelerated electrophoretic migration relative to the ˜100-kDa soluble form of APPwt, suggesting that APPswe was cleaved upstream of the α-secretase site. The latter result is consistent with our earlier findings in MDCK cells in which we demonstrated that APPsβ species derived from APPswe failed to be recognized by antibodies specific for amino-terminal epitopes of the Aβ sequence(27.Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30966-30973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the levels of APPsα and APPsβ, we immunoprecipitated APPs with an antibody, 6E10, which recognizes an epitope between residues 1 and 17 of Aβ. As anticipated, 6E10 immunoprecipitated ˜100-kDa APPsα from conditioned medium of cells expressing either APPwt or APPswe (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9, respectively). However, and in sharp contrast to the results obtained with antibody P2-1, we consistently observed that the accumulated level of APPsα was considerably lower in medium from cells expressing APPswe relative to cells expressing APPwt (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 9 and 8, respectively). Thus, we argue that the vast majority of soluble derivatives derived from APPswe which are detected by antibody P2-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 6) are likely generated following cleavage upstream of the α-secretase site, and most likely at the β-secretase site (i.e. at the amino terminus of Aβ). These latter observations are not the result of overloading of trafficking pathways in transient transfection assays as similar results have been obtained following transfection of as little as 250 ng of expression plasmids (not shown) and by analysis of stably transfected N2a cells that constitutively express APPwt or APPswe (see below). Finally, we demonstrate that cells expressing APPswe secrete 4-5-fold higher levels of Aβ (Fig. 1A, lane 11) than cells expressing APPwt (Fig. 1A, lane 10), a result consistent with earlier studies of APPswe in transfected HEK293 (26.Citron M.

Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) cells. Finally, and to confirm that endoproteolytic cleavage by β-secretase occurs between Leu596 and Asp587 of APPswe, we characterized the carboxyl terminus of the secreted soluble derivative and the amino terminus of Aβ. To confirm the authenticity of the β-secretase-generated soluble derivative, we subjected parallel aliquots of conditioned medium shown on Fig. 1A, lanes 4-6, to immunoprecipitation analysis with antibody 54, specific for APPsβ(35.Howland D.S.

As anticipated, antibody 54 recovered high levels of ˜95-kDa species from medium of cells expressing APPswe (Fig. 1B, lane 3); this result is in sharp contrast to the isolation of nonspecific polypeptides of ˜85 and ˜95 kDa from medium of cells transfected with empty vector or wtAPP cDNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). To analyze the amino terminus of Aβ derived from cells expressing APPwt and APPswe, we radiolabeled cells with [3H]phenylalanine and immunoprecipitated Aβ and p3 from the conditioned medium; the isolated 4-kDa band was subjected to radiosequencing. Predominant peaks of radioactivity in cycles 4, 19, and 20 clearly show that >95% of the 4-kDa peptides secreted by cells expressing either APPwt and APPswe initiate at Asp1 (Fig. 1B, panels APPwt and APPswe). Taken together with studies demonstrating that the membrane-bound fragment generated by β-secretase initiates at Asp1(39.Cheung T.T. Ghiso J. Shoji M. Cai X-D. Golde T. Gandy S. Frangione B. Younkin S. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1994; 1: 30-38Google Scholar), our demonstration that the carboxyl terminus of the soluble derivative extends to Leu596 fully confirms our view that β-secretase cleaves APPswe between Leu596 and Asp597. In order to further characterize intracellular trafficking and processing of APPwt and APPswe APP in N2a cells, we generated 20 and 18 independent stably transfected cell lines which expressed variable levels of APPwt or APPswe, respectively. We did not observe any toxicity-related phenotypes in the N2a lines expressing either APPwt or APPswe. Biosynthetic rates of c-Myc epitope-tagged transgene-derived polypeptides in individual cell lines were assessed by short (3 min) pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation analysis with Myc-1 antibody. Two cell lines, 695.12 and Swe.1, that express essentially indistinguishable levels of newly synthesized APPwt and APPswe, respectively (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2, respectively), were selected for further analysis. Immunoprecipitation of APP-related species using APP NH2-terminal antibody, P2-1, from lysates of 695.12 and Swe.1 cells labeled for 3 h, revealed the presence of accumulated ˜105- and ˜120-kDa forms (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, we also detected a species with an apparent molecular mass of ˜95 kDa in lysates of cell line Swe.1 (Fig. 1C, lane 4), similar to a species observed in lysates of MDCK that constitutively express APPswe(27.Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30966-30973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of soluble APP derivatives in radiolabeled conditioned medium of lines 695.12 and Swe.1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 5-8) fully supported our findings in transient assays. For example, relative to the level of soluble derivatives in 695.12 cell medium (Fig. 1C, lane 5) the total level of soluble derivatives in Swe.1 cell medium (Fig. 1C, lane 6) was clearly elevated; by phosphorimaging analysis, the total level of secreted derivatives generated by line Swe.1 was increased ˜3-fold relative to line 695.12, and the vast majority of these species exhibited accelerated electrophoretic mobility. Moreover, the levels of APPsα in Swe.1 cell medium was clearly diminished relative to the level of APPsα in 695.12 cell medium (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 8 and 7, respectively); phosphorimaging analysis showed ˜3-fold higher levels of APPsα in 695.12 cel"
https://openalex.org/W2002776738,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the major cytokine inducing transcription of human C-reactive protein (CRP) during the acute phase response. STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family members, recently shown to be important mediators of the effects of many cytokines including IL-6, generally induce their effects by binding to palindromic sequences with TT(N)<sub>5</sub>AA motifs. We report an IL-6 responsive element in the proximal region of the human CRP 5′-flanking region that bears a TT(N)<sub>4</sub>AA motif, which we have termed CRP acute phase response element (CRP-APRE). In Hep3B cells, IL-6 but not interferon-γ was capable of activating CAT constructs driven by the CRP promoter containing CRP-APRE. Overexpressed STAT3 was able to transactivate CRP-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs through the CRP-APRE and was able to enhance endogenous CRP mRNA accumulation in response to IL-6. STAT3 (or an antigenically related molecule) bound to the CRP-APRE in response to IL-6. Overexpression of STAT3 in the presence of IL-6 was capable of inducing expression of a construct consisting of the CRP-APRE and a minimal thymidine kinase promoter lacking a C/EBP site. Taken together, these findings indicate that STAT3 participates in the transcriptional activation of CRP in response to IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W1600052472,"The widely distributed and highly conserved Ca2+-binding protein calreticulin has been suggested to play a role as a Ca2+ storage protein of intracellular Ca2+ stores. To test this hypothesis, we have generated a mouse L fibroblast cell line stably transfected with a calreticulin expression vector. The calreticulin content of the overexpressers was increased by 1.6 ± 0.2-fold compared with mock-transfected cells. The total cellular Ca2+ content of calreticulin-overexpressing and control cells, as assessed by equilibrium 45Ca2+ uptake, was 141 ± 8 and 67 ± 6 pmol of Ca2+/106 cells, respectively (i.e. a 2.1 ± 0.2-fold increase in the Ca2+ content of calreticulin-overexpressing cells). Over 80% of the increased Ca2+ content was found within thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The pattern of calreticulin distribution, revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy, showed an endoplasmic reticulum-like pattern and was identical in overexpressers and control cells. In overexpressers, cytosolic free [Ca2+] elevations due to Ca2+ release were enhanced when either ATP or a combination of ionomycin and thapsigargin was used as a stimulus. In contrast, thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ and Mn2+ influxes from the extracellular space were markedly diminished in calreticulin-overexpressing cells, suggesting an active involvement of calreticulin in the regulation of store-operated Ca2+ influx.

Intracellular Ca2+ stores are faced with the dilemma to store large amounts of Ca2+ within a restricted fraction of the cellular volume. For this reason, it is widely assumed that intracellular Ca2+ stores contain intraluminal Ca2+ buffers that allow the accumulation of large amounts of Ca2+ without an excessive increase in the free intraluminal Ca2+ concentration. The protein that has been suggested to make the physiologically most relevant contribution to Ca2+ storage in nonmuscle Ca2+ stores is calreticulin(2.Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J.

Besides playing a crucial role in Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ release, intracellular Ca2+ stores appear to regulate, in a large variety of cell types, the divalent cation permeability of the plasma membrane: a decrease in the store Ca2+ concentration activates the so-called store-operated Ca2+ influx(9.Putney J.W.J. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 10.Penner R. Fasolato C. Hoth M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The intraluminal Ca2+ sensor that detects the drop in the Ca2+ concentration within intracellular stores is not known, nor is the biochemical machinery that mediates the signaling from Ca2+ stores to the plasma membrane. In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of calreticulin in L fibroblasts leads to an increase in the Ca2+ content of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores and to a decrease in store-operated Ca2+ influx. Thapsigargin and Geneticin were obtained from Life Technologies (Basel, Switzerland); monensin, ionomycin, and DTPA were obtained from Sigma. 45Ca2+ was purchased from Du Pont de Nemours/New England Nuclear Inc. (Dreieich, Germany), and fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Gibco (Paisley, Scotland). Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Life Technologies, Inc., and Bio/Can Scientific. Mouse L fibroblasts were a generous gift of D. Kobasa (Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta). All other chemicals were of the highest grade available and were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) or Sigma. The medium referred to as “Ca2+-free medium” contained 138 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The medium referred to as “Ca2+ medium” contained, in addition, 1.0 mM CaCl2. When drugs were added as dimethyl sulfoxide solutions, final concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide in the recording medium did not exceed 0.25%. To construct pRCR calreticulin expression vector, the DraI/SmaI restriction DNA fragment (nucleotides 20-1653) of pcDx-CRT (GenBank accession number J05138) (4.Fliegel L. Burns K. MacLennan D.H. Reithmeier R.A.F. Michalak M. J. Biol.

Next, the XhoI/SstI DNA restriction fragment, containing cDNA encoding full-length calreticulin, was excised from pSCR-1 vector and inserted into XhoI/SstI restriction sites of pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) to generate pRCR. pRCR vector was used for generation of stably transfected mouse L fibroblasts overexpressing calreticulin. Mouse L fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For transfection experiments, plasmid DNA was purified using a QIAGEN column by the Meg-Plasmid purification protocol as recommended by the manufacturer. Mouse L fibroblasts were electroporated (1500 V cm-1, 25 microfarads) with 20 μg of pRCR plasmid containing calreticulin cDNA in sense orientation or mock-transfected with 20 μg of pRc/CMV vector. Cells were selected for resistance to Geneticin (G418) (200 μg/ml). After 14 days of growth in the presence of G418, ˜50 clones were obtained and tested for the expression of calreticulin(11.Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the calreticulin expression vector are referred to as overexpressers; mock-transfected controls are referred to as control cells. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nut mix F-12, Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml Geneticin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine. Cells were used for experiments during a period of 5 weeks to 3 months after thawing. In the first 5 weeks after thawing, no thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx was observed in control cells. After ˜3 months, a decrease in calreticulin overexpression was observed despite the presence of Geneticin in the culture medium. For intracellular localization of calreticulin, polyclonal antibodies against calreticulin were used at 1:50 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)(12.Milner R.E. Baksh S. Shemanko C. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L. Vance J.E. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7155-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:30 dilution in PBS. For immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, cells on coverslips were fixed in 3.8% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min; extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in buffer containing 100 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, and 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 6.9, for 3 min; washed in PBS for 10 min; and then processed for labeling with primary antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fibroblast monolayers were cultured (under the above-described standard conditions) for 54 h in the presence of 10 μCi/ml 45Ca2+. Monolayers were then washed three times with the culture medium (without fetal calf serum), detached by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS), and finally resuspended in Ca2+-free medium. For the measurement of total cell-associated 45Ca2+, aliquots of 106 cells were centrifuged; the radioactivity in the supernatant was counted and subtracted from the radioactivity measured for the same volume of cell suspension. For the measurement of 45Ca2+ release in response to thapsigargin, ionomycin, and monensin, aliquots of 106 cells were removed immediately before and at the indicated times after thapsigargin addition and centrifuged, and the radioactivity was counted in the supernatant. Supernatants were placed in a vial containing a liquid scintillation mixture (Ultima Gold, Packard Instrument Co.), and the radioactivity was measured using a Packard 1900 TR scintillation counter. Cells (2 × 107/ml) suspended in Ca2+ medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were loaded for 40 min with 2 μM fura-2/AM, taking the following precautions to minimize compartmentalization of the dye. (i) Loading was performed at room temperature; (ii) 0.02% pluronic acid was included to prevent precipitation of solid fura-2/AM; and (iii) sulfinpyrazone (at a final concentration of 250 μM), an inhibitor of organic ion transport, was added to avoid intracellular transport or extrusion from the cells of fura-2-free acid(13.Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Swanson J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 915-920PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the amount of cytosolic versus compartmentalized fura-2, two types of protocols were used. (i) Cells were suspended in Ca2+-free medium containing 1 mM EGTA in the fluorometer cuvette, and fura-2 fluorescence was monitored at λex = 340 nm. After 3 min, 20 μM digitonin was added to permeabilize the plasma membrane. Calibration was performed by adding 5 mM Tris and 0.1% Triton (minimum) and 10 mM HCl and 3 mM Ca2+ (maximum). (ii) Digitonin (20 μM) was added to 106 cells suspended in 2.4 ml of Ca2+-free medium. After 5 min of incubation at 37°C, cells were centrifuged. The supernatant was transferred to a fluorometer cuvette, and 2 mM Ca2+ was added. The pellet was resuspended in 2.4 ml of Ca2+ medium, and cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100. Fluorescence was measured at λex = 340 nm in the supernatant and in the cell lysate. Results are expressed as percent of the sum of the total fluorescence in the pellet and in the supernatant. All further steps of the fluorescence measurements were performed as described previously(14.Demaurex N. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2318-2324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure Mn2+ influx, 10 μM Mn2+ was added to the extracellular medium, and the Mn2+-dependent decrease in intracellular fura-2 fluorescence (quenching) was measured at the Ca2+-independent wavelength of fura-2 (λex = 360 nm). The decay of fura-2 fluorescence upon Mn2+ addition is expressed as percent decrease in fura-2 fluorescence per time unit (initial fluorescence = 100%). The immediate fluorescence increase after addition of the heavy metal chelator DTPA reflects the “unquenching” of the extracellular fura-2 fluorescence and therefore gives an estimate of the amount of extracellular fura-2. For details concerning the Mn2+ influx measurements, see (15.Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were directly lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (containing 0.5% SDS and a mixture of protease inhibitors), followed by sonication to decrease viscosity of the samples. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using minigel systems. Quantitative immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibodies was performed and analyzed as described previously(16.Van Delden C. Favre C. Spat A. Cerny E. Krause K.H. Lew D.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); however, chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) rather than alkaline phosphatase was used for detection of secondary antibody binding. Mouse L fibroblasts were stably transfected with a calreticulin expression vector or a control vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To assess the level of calreticulin overexpression, we performed quantitative immunoblotting of calreticulin-transfected and control cells (Fig. 1A). Immunoblots were scanned, and the slope of the correlation between cell number and optical density was determined. The slope of calreticulin-transfected cells divided by the slope of control cells yielded directly the increase in calreticulin content due to expression of calreticulin in transfected cells (see also (16.Van Delden C. Favre C. Spat A. Cerny E. Krause K.H. Lew D.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). Fig. 1B shows that cells transfected with the calreticulin expression vector had a 1.6 ± 0.2-fold increase in the level of immunoreactive calreticulin. We next investigated whether calreticulin overexpression leads to a change in the pattern of calreticulin localization. Both control cells (Fig. 2A) and overexpressers (Fig. 2B) were heavily stained by anti-calreticulin antibodies. In both cells types, calreticulin appears to be located in the perinuclear system of the membrane corresponding in localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. More important, neither in control cells nor in overexpressers was nuclear, cytoplasmic, or surface staining observed. To assess whether the Ca2+ content of intracellular Ca2+ stores is modified by the overexpression of calreticulin, we performed equilibrium loading experiments with 45Ca2+. Calreticulin overexpressers and control cells were cultured for 54 h in the regular culture medium containing 10 μCi/ml 45Ca2+. The time required to obtain isotopic equilibrium was within 36-48 h and was not significantly different between overexpressers and control cells (data not shown). The total cellular Ca2+ content was then calculated based on the cell-associated radioactivity and on the specific activity of Ca2+ in the culture medium. Control cells contained 67 ± 6 pmol of Ca2+/106 cells, whereas the overexpressers contained 141 ± 8 pmol of Ca2+/106 cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, the 1.6 ± 0.2-fold increase in cellular content of calreticulin protein led to a 2.1 ± 0.2-fold increase in cellular Ca2+ content. We next wanted to know whether the increased cellular Ca2+ content reflected an increased Ca2+ load of agonist-sensitive, rapidly exchangeable intracellular Ca2+ stores. Agonist-sensitive, rapidly exchangeable intracellular Ca2+ stores accumulate Ca2+ through sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases. We therefore used thapsigargin, an inhibitor of sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases(17.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar), to measure the amount of Ca2+ associated with rapidly exchangeable intracellular Ca2+ stores. To assess the residual amount of Ca2+ contained within thapsigargin-insensitive luminal Ca2+ stores, we added the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Finally, as ionomycin has been shown to be inactive in releasing Ca2+ from acidic intracellular compartments, we added the sodium proton ionophore monensin. For these experiments, cells were equilibrium-loaded with 45Ca2+ isotope as described above and resuspended in a nonradioactive Ca2+-free buffer. Unidirectional fluxes to the extracellular medium after addition of the respective compounds were then measured. For more details concerning this approach, see (18.Fasolato C. Zottini M. Clementi E. Zacchetti D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20159-20167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that in both calreticulin overexpressers and control cells, ˜60% of the total cellular Ca2+ could be released by thapsigargin. The remaining Ca2+ was almost completely released by ionomycin. The increase in cellular Ca2+ content of calreticulin overexpressers was mostly due to an increase in the size of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Fig. 3B). The monensin-induced Ca2+ release was very small, suggesting that neither controls nor calreticulin-transfected cells contained relevant quantities of Ca2+ stored within acidic compartments. To study the effect of the increased Ca2+ content of intracellular Ca2+ stores on the regulation of [Ca2+]i, we next performed experiments with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2. Cells were loaded with fura-2/AM under conditions preventing sequestration of the dye into subcellular organelles (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes). (i) Indicator loading was performed at room temperature; (ii) pluronic acid was added during incubation with fura-2/AM; (iii) sulfinpyrazone, an inhibitor of organic anion transport, was included in the buffer for dye loading and [Ca2+]i measurements(19.Pizzo P. Murgia M. Zambon A. Zanovello P. Bronte V. Pietrobon D. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3372-3378PubMed Google Scholar). To document the efficacy of these precautions, we measured the amount of fura-2 that was released by digitonin (20 μM) or Triton X-100 (0.1%); >90% of the fura-2 from both control and calreticulin-overexpressing cells was released by digitonin, demonstrating the cytosolic localization of the dye (Fig. 4, A and B). Note also that the maximal fluorescence in control cells and overexpressers was comparable (Fig. 4A), suggesting that both cell lines contained the same amount of cytosolic fura-2. We next examined the effect of calreticulin overexpression on [Ca2+]i elevations in response to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. We first investigated the effect of the receptor agonist ATP, which in mouse L fibroblasts has been shown to activate P2y purinergic receptors linked to phospholipase C(19.Pizzo P. Murgia M. Zambon A. Zanovello P. Bronte V. Pietrobon D. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3372-3378PubMed Google Scholar). ATP stimulation of cells suspended in Ca2+-free medium caused a rapid and transient [Ca2+]i increase that was totally abolished by thapsigargin pretreatment of the cells (data not shown). The amplitude of the [Ca2+]i elevation elicited by ATP was increased by a factor 1.5 in calreticulin overexpressers as compared with control cells (Fig. 5, A and E). Similarly, increased [Ca2+]i elevations due to Ca2+ release were observed when calreticulin overexpressers were concomitantly stimulated by thapsigargin and ionomycin (Fig. 5, D and E). In contrast, when cells were stimulated separately either by the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor or by the ionophore, the peak and the duration of the [Ca2+]i elevations due to Ca2+ release were comparable in overexpressers and in control cells (Fig. 5, B, C, and E). Fig. 5F shows the amount of Ca2+ that was released under the identical conditions in 45Ca2+ experiments. Note that the increased amount of Ca2+ that is mobilized by either thapsigargin or ionomycin alone is not reflected by increased [Ca2+]i elevations (Fig. 5, compare E and F; see also “Discussion”). No significant 45Ca2+ release was detected after ATP stimulation of either control cells or overexpressers, suggesting that most of the released Ca2+ was rapidly reaccumulated by intracellular Ca2+ stores. In many cell types, the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores leads to the activation of a Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, a phenomenon referred to as store-operated Ca2+ entry. We therefore investigated the effect of calreticulin overexpression on the activation of Ca2+ influx in response to store depletion. [Ca2+]i elevations after addition of Ca2+ to cells stimulated by thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium were markedly decreased in calreticulin overexpressers (Fig. 6). These results raise the possibility that calreticulin overexpression diminishes store-operated Ca2+ influx. However, [Ca2+]i elevations in response to Ca2+ readdition experiments are the complex result of the activity of a variety of Ca2+ transport pathways and may, at least partially, be explained by an inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase through extracellular Ca2+. To measure more specifically the activation of the Ca2+ influx pathway, we studied thapsigargin-induced Mn2+ influx. Mn2+ is able to permeate through store-operated Ca2+ channels, but is not transported by Ca2+ transport ATPases. Mn2+ influx is detected as a quenching of the fluorescence of cytosolic fura-2. In both control cells and calreticulin overexpressers, there was a relatively important Mn2+ influx without thapsigargin stimulation (Fig. 7). This most likely reflects the previously observed presence of mechanisms that allow Mn2+ entry independent of store-operated Ca2+ influx(20.Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, in control cells, thapsigargin clearly increased the amplitude of the fura-2 quenching after addition of Mn2+, demonstrating the presence of store-operated Ca2+ influx in control mouse L fibroblasts. In contrast, no thapsigargin activation of Mn2+ influx was observed in the overexpressers (Fig. 7). The suppression of thapsigargin-induced Mn2+ influx was even observed when Mn2+ was added 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 7D), i.e. at times when there was an almost complete emptying of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (see Fig. 3A).Figure 7:Thapsigargin-induced Mn2+ influx. Cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. Recordings were performed at the Ca2+-independent excitation wavelength of fura-2 (360 nm).

The small amplitude of the fluorescence increase after DTPA addition witnesses the low amount of extracellular fura-2.

J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). So far, however, this notion is based on circumstantial evidence(6.Krause K.H. Simmerman K.B. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7.Treves S. De Mattei M. Lanfredi M. Villa A. Green M. MacLennan D.H. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Biochem.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate for the first time that the Ca2+ content of cells that stably overexpress calreticulin is augmented. 2Since submission of this manuscript, a publication by Bastianutto et al.(25.Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) showed an increase in the capacity of rapidly exchanging Ca2+ stores through transient overexpression of calreticulin in HeLa cells; the authors also observed an inhibition of Ca2+ influx in calreticulin-transfected cells. This elevation in stored Ca2+ is mostly due to an increase in the size of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Thus, our results add novel arguments in favor of a role for calreticulin as a Ca2+ storage protein of agonist-sensitive, rapidly exchangeable Ca2+ stores. The precise mechanism through which calreticulin increases the Ca2+ content of intracellular Ca2+ stores is not known. Our results would be compatible with the concept that the increased intraluminal Ca2+ buffering in overexpressers is compensated by an increased total Ca2+ store content, resulting in an unchanged intraluminal free Ca2+ concentration. However, alternatively, one might consider the possibility that the effect of calreticulin on cellular Ca2+ storage could include a regulatory role for this protein, rather than being a simple function of its Ca2+ buffering properties. The latter possibility is supported by a recent study that demonstrates that in Xenopus laevis oocytes, calreticulin overexpression inhibits repetitive intracellular Ca2+ waves and that this inhibition is independent of the Ca2+ storage domain of calreticulin (23.Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Cell. 1995; 82: 765-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The amount of calreticulin overexpression found in this study is relatively modest (i.e. an 1.6 ± 0.2-fold increase over control), but we consider this relatively low overexpression as an advantage. Indeed, rather than studying a massive overexpression with its inherent uncertainties (correct protein targeting, nonspecific effects due to very high protein concentrations), we have studied an overexpression that is presumably still within the limits of the physiological range of calreticulin expression(24.Khanna N.C. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our observation that the increased Ca2+ storage occurred almost exclusively in thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Fig. 3) adds weight to this argument. The relationship between the increased Ca2+ content of intracellular stores in calreticulin-transfected cells (as assessed by 45Ca2+ measurements) and the [Ca2+]i elevations in response to Ca2+ release (as assessed by fura-2 measurements) is complex and depends on the applied stimulus. Increased [Ca2+]i elevations in calreticulin overexpressers are observed with ATP or with a combination of thapsigargin and ionomycin, but not when thapsigargin or ionomycin is separately used as a stimulus. We think that, in the case of thapsigargin, the slowness of Ca2+ release allows negative feedback mechanisms (in particular, Ca2+ extrusion through the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase) to obscure the differences in Ca2+ release in relation to the level of [Ca2+]i measurements. In the case of ionomycin, a residual Ca2+ accumulation through Ca2+ stores might dampen [Ca2+]i elevations. The latter explanation is supported by the observation that, in overexpressers, increased [Ca2+]i elevations in response to Ca2+ release are observed when cells are concomitantly stimulated with ionomycin and thapsigargin. Finally, the massive and rapid Ca2+ release that occurs mainly through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in cells stimulated with ATP appears to generate, at least for a short period (˜30 s; see Fig. 5A), [Ca2+]i transients whose amplitude is not governed by negative feedback mechanisms, but rather by the amplitude of the Ca2+ release itself. The inhibition of the store-operated Ca2+ influx pathway by calreticulin overexpression provides new and independent experimental evidences for the intimate connection between the Ca2+ content of rapidly exchangeable intracellular Ca2+ stores and the plasma membrane permeability for divalent cations. The calreticulin inhibition of Ca2+ influx might be due to the increased intraluminal Ca2+ buffering of intracellular Ca2+ stores. However, we have measured thapsigargin-induced Mn2+ influx even 10 min after thapsigargin addition. At this point, thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores were almost completely depleted, as shown by 45Ca2+ experiments (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, virtually no store-operated Ca2+ influx was observed. Thus, our results suggest that high calreticulin concentrations do not simply slow down the appearance of store-operated Ca2+ influx because of a delayed depletion of Ca2+ stores through the increased intraluminal Ca2+ buffering. High intraluminal calreticulin concentrations block store-operated Ca2+ influx even after a complete depletion of Ca2+ stores. This might be a first indication that calreticulin plays a direct regulatory role in the mechanism of store-operated Ca2+ influx.

https://openalex.org/W2002782099,"The 46-kDa protein YDJ1 is one of several known yeast homologues of the Escherichia coli DnaJ protein. Like all J homologues, it shares homology with the highly conserved NH2-terminal of DnaJ. A component of the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone machinery that mediates protein folding, DnaJ is necessary for survival at elevated temperatures. It stimulates ATP hydrolysis by DnaK and effects the release of DnaK-bound polypeptides. Previous genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the J-domain is necessary for these functions. Using peptides corresponding to J-domain sequence, we show that a peptide containing the highly conserved His-Pro-Asp sequence at positions 34-36 in the J-domain competes off YDJ1 stimulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity. Inhibitory concentrations of peptide do not prevent binding of folding substrates, therefore YDJ1 must interact with Hsp70 at a site distinct from that for substrate binding. This interaction is critical for Hsp70 activity, since a mutant YDJ1 protein harboring a H34Q change (ydj1Q34) stimulates neither Hsp70 ATPase nor substrate release. The importance of the proper function of this region of the protein is supported by the poor growth and temperature-sensitive phenotype of yeast expressing ydj1Q34."

The reduction of the ob mRNA in the Zucker lean rats was accompanied by significantly greater food intake and weight gain. However, in ZDF rats and db/db mice, there was profound increase in body weight without hyperphagia.

Recently, members of this class of agents have been identified as high affinity ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a transcription factor that modulates the expression of various adipose-specific genes(15.Lehmann J.M.

The results of the present study demonstrate that in addition to being an effective antidiabetic agent, a thiazolidinedione (AD-5075) down-regulates the expression of the ob gene in the two animal models that were studied. Therefore, ob gene expression is subject to modulation by a pharmacological agent that ameliorates insulin resistance and improves glucose homeostasis. The reduction of the level of ob gene expression is also accompanied by changes in body weight and energy intake. Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice and lean littermates (+/?) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF-fa/fa) rats and Zucker lean littermates (+/?) were from Genetic Models, Inc. The animals were 10-14 weeks old when dosing began. AD-5075 (AD, 5-[4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl)-2-hydroxyethoxy]benzyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione) was administered via oral gavage for 4 weeks at doses of 2 and 5 mg/kg/day, for db/db mice and ZDF rats, respectively. The doses were chosen based on previous experiments in order to achieve near normalization of plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations. All animals received milled rodent chow (Purina 5008) ad libitum and had free access to water. Food intake, body weight, plasma glucose, and triglyceride levels were monitored throughout the dosing period. -Total RNA was prepared from epididymal fat pads using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx). The RNA concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. For Northern analyses, 10 μg of RNA was denatured in formamide/formaldehyde and electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels(16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham) by capillary blotting. Prehybridization was performed at 42°C for 1 h in 40-50% formamide in a solution containing 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.9 M sodium chloride, 50 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% each of gelatin, Ficoll, and polyvinylpyrollidone, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 20 h in the same solution with 32P-labeled cDNA probes as described below. After washing the membranes under appropriately stringent conditions, the hybridization signals were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A cDNA probe for ob was obtained by cloning the entire coding region of ob using polymerase chain reaction based on the published sequence(3.Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11383) Google Scholar). Briefly, total white adipose RNA was isolated from Swiss-Webster mice and first strand cDNA synthesized. Using polymerase chain reaction the coding region of the ob cDNA was isolated as 2 overlapping fragments using the following primer sets (5′-CAGTGAGCCCCAAGAAGAGG-3′, 5′-TCCAGGTCATTGGCTATCTG-3′, and 5′-ATTCCTGGGCTTCAGGGGATTCTGAGTTTC-3′, 5′-GCGTGTACCCACGGAGGAAC-3′). The resulting 380- and 626-base pair fragments were purified and used as templates in a subsequent polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-AAGAATTCATGTTGCTGGAGACCCCTGTGTC-3′ and 5′-AAGGATCCTCAGCATTCAGGGCTAACATC-3′. The final 501-base pair fragment was used as the ob cDNA probe. The cDNA probe for mouse adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) (aP2) was obtained from Dr. David Bernlohr (University of Minnesota). The probes were labeled with the Oligolabeling Kit (Pharmacia), using [α-32P]deoxy-CTP. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised against a C-terminal (RLQGSLQDILQQLDVSPEC) peptide of the predicted leptin protein(3.Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11383) Google Scholar). The antibody was affinity purified using SulfolinkR antibody purification kit (Pierce) following the manufacturers instruction. Western blots using this antibody detect a 16-kDa protein in the media of HEK-293 cells transfected with pCMV vector containing the coding region of the ob cDNA(8.Frederich R.C. Lollamnn B. Hamann A. Napolitano-Rosen A. Kahn B.B. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1658-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by the absence of the 16-kDa protein in the media of 293 cells transfected with the vector alone, its disappearance when the rabbit serum was preincubated with excess peptide antigen, and its absence from the serum of ob/ob mouse homozygous for the truncation mutation prior to the C-terminal peptide(8.Frederich R.C. Lollamnn B. Hamann A. Napolitano-Rosen A. Kahn B.B. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1658-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Six microliters of plasma from control and AD-5075-treated mice were separated by electrophoresis on 16% Tricine-SDS gels. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore) using electroblotting. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 5% powdered milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, incubated in the same solution with the anti-leptin antibody, washed, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The signals corresponding to leptin were detected using the ECL system (Amersham). Conditioned medium of HEK-293 cells expressing the recombinant leptin protein (8.Frederich R.C. Lollamnn B. Hamann A. Napolitano-Rosen A. Kahn B.B. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1658-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. The Western blots were scanned by a densitometer (LKB). Treatment of ZDF rats with AD-5075 for 4 weeks greatly reduced hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia (Table 1). Likewise, AD-5075 was effective in lowering plasma glucose and triglyceride levels in db/db mice. The agent did not affect plasma glucose levels in the lean littermates of ZDF rats or db/db mice, however, it caused significant reduction of plasma triglyceride levels in both groups of lean animals. Therefore, AD-5075 exhibited anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypertriglyceridemic efficacy in the two rodent models tested in this study. Northern blot analyses of RNA from white adipose tissue indicated that, compared to control lean rats, untreated obese ZDF rats expressed a 3-fold higher level of ob mRNA (Fig. 1). Following treatment with AD-5075, this level was reduced to that detected in the untreated lean animals. Moreover, when Zucker lean littermates were treated with AD-5075, a profound reduction of ob mRNA levels (3-fold) was also observed (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that expression of the ob gene was subject to regulation by the antidiabetic agent not only in a rodent model of NIDDM, but also in the lean controls. In contrast to the down-regulation of ob mRNA expression by AD-5075, the compound significantly increased mRNA levels of adipocyte FABP in both lean and ZDF rats (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with earlier studies which demonstrated the regulatory effect of these insulin-sensitizing agents on FABP gene expression in ob/ob mice and 3T3-L1 cells(17.Kletzien R.F. Foellmi L.A. Harris P.K.W. Wyse B.M. Clarke S.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 558-562PubMed Google Scholar). We attempted to measure the level of leptin protein in plasma samples from lean and ZDF rats with or without AD-5075 treatment, but were unsuccessful due to the cross-reactivity of the antibodies used in this study with proteins in rat plasma. The effect of AD-5075 on ob gene expression was further studied in db/db mice, another rodent model of NIDDM. Similar to ZDF rats, db/db mice expressed a 7 times higher level of the ob mRNA compared to the lean animals. Treatment with AD-5075 resulted in a 78% reduction of the ob mRNA level (Fig. 2). To determine the circulating level of leptin in db/db mice following chronic administration of AD-5075, plasma samples from control and treated mice were analyzed by Western blotting using affinity purified polyclonal antibodies directed against a C-terminal peptide derived from the mouse ob sequence (Fig. 3). db/db mice had 12-fold higher level of plasma leptin relative to that of the lean controls. Treatment of db/db mice with AD-5075 for 4 weeks resulted in an 86% reduction of plasma leptin concentration, with final leptin level approaching that found in the lean littermates. We attempted to measure plasma leptin protein level and ob mRNA level in white adipose tissue of lean mice following treatment with AD-5075 for 1 week but did not detect any significant changes (data not shown). Since the control lean mice expressed low amounts of ob mRNA in adipose tissue (Fig. 2 and (7.Maffei M. Fei H. Lee G.-H. Dani C. Leroy P. Zhang Y. Proenca R. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar)) and had very low levels of circulating leptin as shown in Fig. 3, detection of further reduction of these parameters was hindered by the sensitivities of Western and Northern blotting. Therefore, the question of whether AD-5075 affected ob gene expression in lean animals was better addressed in the rat model. Taken together, the results indicate that the expression of the ob gene is up-regulated in obese-diabetic states and that such overexpression of the ob gene can be attenuated by treatment with an antidiabetic agent. Moreover, the agent also causes reduction of ob gene expression in the Zucker lean animals. To investigate the relationships of ob gene expression with feeding behavior and weight change, food consumption and body weight were measured during the treatment with AD-5075. During the course of this study, the AD-5075-treated Zucker lean rats gained more weight and consumed more food compared to the control animals. At the end of the study, mean body weight was increased by 11.4% for the control group and 16.3% for the treated group (Table 2). The food intake was unchanged for the control lean animals but increased by 18.8% for the AD-5075-treated lean rats (Table 2). Therefore, the 70% reduction of the ob mRNA level in the lean rats as a result of treatment with AD-5075 correlated with significant increases in weight and food consumption. These data are consistent with a role of ob in the balance of caloric intake and expenditure and the control of body weight. Decrements of the ob mRNA levels in the obese ZDF rats and the ob mRNA as well as circulating leptin levels in db/db mice were accompanied by substantial weight gains after administration of AD-5075 for 4 weeks. Mean body weight was increased by 38.8 ± 1.6% for AD-5075-treated ZDF rats (n = 8) versus 2.7 ± 1.0% for the untreated controls (n = 7), and 16.5 ± 1.8% for AD-treated db/db mice versus 7.8 ± 1.1% for untreated controls (n = 10 for each group) (Table 2). However, unlike the Zucker lean rats, there was no significant change in food consumption for db/db mice or ZDF rats treated with AD-5075 (Table 2). When lean (+/?) mice were treated for 4 weeks with AD-5075 (5 mg/kg/day), there was also a trend toward increased weight gain. The AD-treated lean mice had a tendency to consume more food during the first 2 weeks of treatment. However, the changes were not statistically significant at the termination of the experiment. The lack of significant weight gain and hyperphagia may correlate with the lack of detectable reduction of the circulating leptin protein level and the adipose ob mRNA level in the lean mice. The maintenance of energy balance and body weight requires a complex network involving central nervous system regulation of food intake, hormonal regulation of metabolism, energy expenditure, and ultimately energy storage in adipose tissue(18.Flier J.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 15-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Parabiosis studies have suggested that the product of the ob gene may function as a circulating factor which provides negative feedback to the satiety center of the hypothalamus(19.Coleman D.L. Diabetologia. 1973; 9: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In addition, such studies have suggested that db/db mice and obese Zucker rats are able to produce the regulatory factor but are deficient in responding to it (20.Coleman D.L. Hummel K.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 217: 1298-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21.Harris R.B.S. Hervey E. Hervey G.R. Tobin G. Int. J. Obes. 1987; 11: 275-283PubMed Google Scholar). This concept is supported by our data which demonstrate markedly increased levels of ob mRNA and leptin in these rodents. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with an insulin-sensitizing agent of the thiazolidinedione class down-regulated the expression of ob mRNA in the Zucker lean and ZDF rats. In addition, ob mRNA level and circulating leptin level were markedly reduced in db/db mice as a result of AD-5075 treatment. In agreement with the proposed role of the ob gene product in energy balance, the reduction of ob expression correlated with increases in food intake and body weight in the Zucker lean rats which, unlike ZDF rats and db/db mice, have an intact leptin signaling loop. The mechanism by which AD-5075 regulates ob gene expression is not well defined at present. Recent studies have indicated that thiazolidinediones are high affinity ligands for PPARγ (15.Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar) and forced expression and the activation of PPARγ results in the conversion of fibroblasts to adipocytes and activation of various adipose-specific genes(22.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). It is possible that AD-5075 down-regulates the expression of the ob gene directly through its binding and activation of the transcription factor PPARγ. Alternatively, AD-5075 may exert its effect on ob gene expression indirectly as a result of activation of PPARγ which leads to changes in levels of hormones, such as insulin, and other metabolites. The animal models of NIDDM used in the present study both manifest high levels of plasma insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acids. It is possible that any one of these factors by itself or in combination could modulate ob gene expression through direct or indirect mechanisms. Lowering these parameters by intervention with the antidiabetic agent might then result in the reduction of ob expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent studies have indicated that ob gene expression is subject to regulation by glucocorticoids (9.De Vos P. Saladin R. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15958-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) which affect plasma glucose concentration. Of note is the fact that AD-5075 only decreased the level of triglyceride but not glucose in the Zucker lean rats. The decreased ob gene expression in these lean rats suggests that there may be a correlation between the plasma lipid level and the level of ob mRNA in adipose tissue. Since ZDF rats and db/db mice are presumed to have defects at the level of leptin receptor or downstream signaling pathways, the effect of AD-5075 in these two rodent models suggests that the compound may regulate the expression of the ob gene through a mechanism independent of the signal transduction pathways involving the leptin receptor. The fact that there are no drug-induced changes in food consumption in either of the obese animal models in the context of weight gain, while there were profound changes in both food consumption and weight gain in the intact lean rats, is potentially important. Recent studies indicate that the ob gene product regulates body weight and adiposity through effects on appetite and metabolism (5.Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3808) Google Scholar). The lack of hyperphagia in ZDF rats and db/db mice following the treatment with AD-5075 in this study may reflect the lack of responsiveness of these animals to the effect of leptin on suppressing appetite. It is possible that the defect in these animals may be selective for components of this system involving metabolic efficiency. On the other hand, the increased weight gain seen in the two animal models may be due to the fact that AD-5075 apparently has direct effects on fat cell differentiation and fat metabolism. Thus, thiazolidinedione derivatives are efficacious adipogenic agents in 3T3-L1 and other preadipocytes(23.Kletzein R.F. Clarke S.D. Ulrich R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 393-398PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Sparks R.L. Strauss E.E. Zygmunt A.I. Phelan T.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25.Sandouk T. Reda D. Hofman C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1600-C1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and such adipogenesis could be the cause of the substantial weight gain observed in db/db mice and ZDF rats following treatment with AD-5075. It is possible that some aspects of altered adipocyte metabolism occur in response to the decrement of ob gene expression. An important finding of our study was the clear demonstration that the level of ob expression is not necessarily directly proportional to the mass of the tissue. The ob gene is expressed exclusively in white adipose tissue and the level of its expression is increased in several models of obesity and decreased with fasting(8.Frederich R.C. Lollamnn B. Hamann A. Napolitano-Rosen A. Kahn B.B. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1658-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), however, administration of AD-5075 resulted in the dissociation of weight gain from increased ob expression. Furthermore, the finding of parallel induction of adipose FABP and repression of ob by AD-5075 may have important ramifications for the mechanism(s) by which this class of agent exerting antidiabetic effect. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the ob gene is overexpressed in two rodent models of obesity and NIDDM, and that chronic administration of a potent antidiabetic agent results in reduction of ob gene expression in ZDF rats, db/db mice, as well as in lean rats. The results provide new insights into our understanding of the metabolic defects underlying obesity and diabetes. It is important to point out that overexpression of the ob gene has recently been reported in human obese patients(26.Considine R.V. Considine E.L. Williams C.J. Nyce M. Magosin S.A. Bauer T.L.

ArsR proteins with C32G, C34G, and C32G/C34G substitutions were active repressors, but were not inducible in vivo. In vitro, the altered repressor-ars DNA complexes could not be dissociated by inducers. Alteration of Cys-37 and Ser-43, residues located in or near the putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding region of the protein, had no effect on the inducibility of the operon. While these results indicated that neither the thiolate of Cys-37 nor the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-43 is required for induction, they did not eliminate either atom as a potential arsenic ligand. Another approach involved reaction with an alternative inducer, phenylarsine oxide, which can form only two coordinations. Phenylarsine oxide was shown to be as effective as or more effective than arsenite or antimonite in induction in vivo.

We have made chimeric receptors by fusing the murine forms of NR2A (∋<sub>1</sub>) and NR2B (∋<sub>2</sub>) to localize the high affinity determinants of ifenprodil inhibition on the 2B subunit. Binding experiments with <sup>125</sup>I-MK-801 implicated the region between amino acids 198 and 356 of NR2B for high affinity ifenprodil interaction. Site-directed mutants at Arg-337 showed that this residue is absolutely required for high affinity ifenprodil inhibition. Polyamines also modulate the NMDA receptor with a preference for NR2B subunits, and the pharmacology of these agents overlaps with ifenprodil. Although the determinants of the polyamine enhancement of iodo-MK-801 binding also localize to the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of NR2B, the point mutants at Arg-337 form receptors that are polyamine-stimulated at wild type levels. In addition, polyamine stimulation depends on the expression of NR1 splice variants, whereas high affinity ifenprodil inhibition is independent of NR1 isoform expression. These studies provide evidence that ifenprodil and polyamines interact at discrete sites on the NR2B subunit."

Previous studies have shown that the sialic acid-binding site lies within the two membrane-distal domains of CD22 (domains 1 and 2), which are V-set and C2-set immunoglobulin superfamily domains, respectively. To further localize the binding site, we have made 42 single amino acid substitutions throughout both domains. All 12 mutations that abrogated binding to CD45-thy without disrupting antibody binding were of residues within the GFCC′C″β-sheet of domain 1. These residues are predicted to form a contiguous binding site centered around an arginine residue in the F strand that is conserved in all members of the sialoadhesin family. Our results provide further evidence that immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules use the GFCC′C″β-sheet of membrane-distal V-set domains to bind structurally diverse ligands, suggesting that this surface is favored for cell-cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2150449715,"The subcellular distributions of folate and folate-synthesizing enzymes were investigated in pea leaves. It was observed that the mitochondrial folate pool (˜400 μM) represented ˜50% of the total pool. Furthermore, all the enzymes involved in tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate synthesis were present in the mitochondria. In marked contrast, we failed to detect any significant activity of these enzymes in chloroplasts, cytosol, and nuclei. The presence of the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway in mitochondria is apparently a general feature in plants since potato tuber mitochondria also contained a high folate concentration (˜200 μM) and all the enzymes required for tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate synthesis.The specific activities of tetrahydrofolate-synthesizing enzymes were rather low (1.5-15 nmol h-1 mg-1 matrix protein), except for dihydrofolate reductase (180-500 nmol h-1 mg-1 matrix protein). Dihydrofolate reductase was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme had a native molecular mass of ˜140 kDa and was constituted of two identical 62-kDa subunits. Interestingly, this mitochondrial protein appeared to be a bifunctional enzyme, also supporting thymidylate synthesis. The cell distribution of thymidylate synthase was also investigated. No significant activity was observed in cell fractions other than mitochondria, indicating that plant cell mitochondria are also a major site for thymidylate synthesis.

No significant activity was observed in cell fractions other than mitochondria, indicating that plant cell mitochondria are also a major site for thymidylate synthesis. In all organisms, one-carbon transfer reactions are mainly mediated by tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate coenzymes(1.McGuire J.J. Coward J.K. Blakeley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. Wiley-Interscience, New York1984: 135-190Google Scholar). As a result, a number of pathways such as those involved in the metabolism of methionine, serine, purine, or thymidylate are dependent on an endogenous supply of these coenzymes(2.McGuire J.J. Bertino J.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 38: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because animals lack the first three steps of folate biosynthesis, folate supply in these organisms is dependent on feeding. In contrast, plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo. This pathway requires the sequential operation of five enzymes: a dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK), 1The abbreviations used are: HPPKdihydropterin pyrophosphokinaseDHPSdihydropteroate synthaseDHFSdihydrofolate synthetaseDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseFPGSfolylpolyglutamate synthetaseTSthymidylate synthaseSHMTserine hydroxymethyltransferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyH4PteGlun5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroylglutamateH4FGlun5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate with n glutamate residuesFdUMP5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate. a dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), a dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFS), a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and a folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) (Fig. 1). The second step of this pathway is the target of antimicrobial sulfonamide drugs, and considerable effort has been focused on the molecular characterization of the bacterial enzymes involved in the early steps of folate synthesis(3.Lopez P. Espinosa M. Greenberg B. Lacks S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4320-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Dallas W.S. Gowen J. Ray P.H. Cox J. Dev I.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5961-5970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Bognar A.L. Osborne C. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12337-12343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, the study of folate metabolism is complicated by the presence of different subcellular compartments. Indeed, there is now some evidences that, in addition to the cytosol, discrete pools of folate are associated with mitochondria and chloroplasts(6.Cossins E.A. Blakeley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. Wiley-Interscience, New York1984: 2-59Google Scholar). The distribution of folate-synthesizing enzymes between the cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids remains, however, uncertain, and it is not clear whether all these compartments are autonomous for folate synthesis. The HPPK and DHPS activities were reported to be carried on a single bifunctional enzyme in plants (7.Okinaka O. Iwai K. J. Vitaminol. (Kyoto). 1970; 16: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in Plasmodium(8.Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This situation is different in bacteria, where two separate proteins are involved(3.Lopez P. Espinosa M. Greenberg B. Lacks S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4320-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Lopez P. Greenberg B. Lacks S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4766-4774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation studies in pea seedlings suggested the presence of the enzyme in a “mitochondrial” fraction (73%) and in a “soluble” fraction (25%)(10.Okinaka O. Iwai K. J. Vitaminol. (Kyoto). 1970; 16: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but an eventual cross-contamination of these fractions was not investigated. Likewise, DHFS from pea seedlings was reported to be present in a mitochondrial fraction (40%), a “chloroplastic” fraction (15%), and a soluble fraction (22%), but the cross-contamination of the fractions was not estimated(11.Ikeda M. Iwai K. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1975; 21: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). DHFR in plants was described either as a bifunctional enzyme, also supporting the thymidylate synthase (TS) activity(12.Cella R. Nielsen E. Parisi B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13.Lazar G. Zhang H. Goodman H.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or as a monofunctional polypeptide associated with TS in a large multimeric enzyme complex(14.Toth I. Lazar G. Goodman H.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In protozoa, the DHFR and TS activities were also reported to be carried on a single protein, but not in prokaryotes and mammals, where two different proteins are involved (for a review, see (15.Blakley R.L. Blakeley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. Wiley-Interscience, New York1984: 191-253Google Scholar)). The enzyme has been localized in the cytosol of animal cells (16.Hurt E. Pesold-Hurt B. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but its compartmentalization in plants remains to be established. FPGS was reported to be cytosolic and mitochondrial in mammalian cells (17.Lin B.F. Huang R.F.S. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21674-21679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in fungi(18.Cossins E.A. Chan P.Y. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1984; 23: 965-971Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but its distribution in higher plant cells is still unknown. In bacteria, this enzyme is bifunctional, supporting also the dihydrofolate synthetase activity(5.Bognar A.L. Osborne C. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12337-12343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase dihydropteroate synthase dihydrofolate synthetase dihydrofolate reductase folylpolyglutamate synthetase thymidylate synthase serine hydroxymethyltransferase high pressure liquid chromatography 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroylglutamate 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate with n glutamate residues 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate. Subcellular localization of folate synthesis in higher plant cells is hampered by the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of purified organelles devoid of contamination from the other cell fractions. So far, the only reported studies were focused on the dihydropteroate synthase and the dihydrofolate synthetase(10.Okinaka O. Iwai K. J. Vitaminol. (Kyoto). 1970; 16: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11.Ikeda M. Iwai K. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1975; 21: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but the different cellular fractions were not purified, and the cross-contamination of these fractions was not measured. Furthermore, the distribution of folate (and the distribution of the enzymes involved in its synthesis) might vary from one tissue to another, depending on the specificity of the tissue. From this point of view, the presence in leaf mitochondria of the glycine cleavage system, which represents 40% of the soluble proteins and requires folate as cofactor(19.Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), might affect the cellular folate distribution. In this study, we investigated the presence of the tetrahydrofolate-synthesizing enzymes in the different cell compartments of pea leaves using Percoll-purified mitochondria, chloroplasts, and nuclei or a cytosol-enriched fraction. In addition, we purified the mitochondrial DHFR/TS bifunctional enzyme, and we studied some of its biochemical properties. We also determined the TS distribution in the leaf cell. Our results indicate that mitochondria are a major site for tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate and thymidylate synthesis in plants. Potatoes were purchased at the local market. Pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Douce Provence) plants were grown from seeds in vermiculite for 15 days under a 12-h photoperiod at 26°C (day) or 20°C (night). Approximately 1 kg of leaves was collected for preparation of the different subcellular fractions. Marker enzymes (fumarase for mitochondria(20.Hill R.L. Bradshaw R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 91-99Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar), phosphoribulokinase for chloroplasts(21.Kagawa T. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1982: 695-706Google Scholar), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase for cytosol (22.Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grabl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2. Academic Press, New York1983: 275-276Google Scholar)) were measured in all the fractions in order to determine any cross-contamination. Mitochondria were isolated and purified as described previously (23.Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-425Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) using a self-generating gradient of Percoll. Chloroplasts were isolated and purified on a discontinuous Percoll gradient as described by Douce and Joyard(24.Douce R. Joyard J. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1982: 239-256Google Scholar). Protein extracts from these cell organelles were obtained as described previously(25.Neuburger M. Bourguignon J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 18-22Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). With these experimental procedures, mitochondria and chloroplasts were usually devoid of contamination from the other compartments. Nuclei were extracted from pea leaves and purified as described by Dunham and Bryant(26.Dunham V.L. Bryant J.A. Hall J.L. Moore A.L. Isolation of Membranes and Organelles from Plant Cells. Academic Press Ltd., London1983: 237-275Google Scholar). Purified nuclei were devoid of contamination from mitochondria. Contamination by cytosol proteins was very low (up to 1% of the total protein), but contamination by proteins from chloroplasts was up to 30% of the total protein. To obtain the cytosol-enriched fraction, leaves (0.5 kg) were ground with a Waring blender at low speed for 3 s in 1 liter of a medium containing 0.3 M mannitol, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mM malate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After filtration on three layers of gauze, the filtrate was centrifuged at 1500 × g to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 × g to remove all the cell organelles, and the remaining soluble fraction, enriched with cytosol, was concentrated to ˜3-5 ml using a Diaflo XM-10 membrane and an Amicon stirred cell. To obtain the leaf extracts, leaves (0.3 kg) were ground with a Waring blender at high speed for 10 s in 0.5 liter of a medium containing 100 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After filtration on three layers of gauze, the filtrate was centrifuged at 1500 × g to remove cellular debris and then at 18,000 × g to remove the membranes. The supernatant was concentrated to a final volume of 5 ml using a Diaflo XM-10 membrane and an Amicon stirred cell. Folate, pteroate, and pterin were obtained from Sigma. Pterin pyrophosphate and folate polyglutamate were obtained from Schircks Laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). These products were reduced as dihydro and tetrahydro compounds as described by Scrimgeour(27.Scrimgeour K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Folate was determined using a radioisotopic binding assay as described by Waxman and Schreiber(28.Waxman S. Schreiber C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The assay medium (100 mM potassium Pi, pH 7, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) contained 1 μl of [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid (1 μM, 100 GBq mmol-1), various amounts of biological samples, and finally 30 μl of a folate binder (β-lactoglobulin, 10 mg ml-1) in a final volume of 500 μl. After 20 min, the free unbound folate was separated from that which was bound by 10 min of contact with 500 μl of bovine serum albumin-coated charcoal suspension (1.3 g of charcoal were suspended in 100 ml of the assay medium containing 65 mg of bovine serum albumin). Following centrifugation, 600 μl of clear supernatant were added to 15 ml of the scintillation mixture and counted. For each determination, a control was run in the absence of binder to measure the amount of radioactivity that was not adsorbable by charcoal. This remaining radioactivity was subtracted from each measurement. A standard curve was constructed with various amounts (0-20 μl) of 0.4 μM folic acid solution. In these measurements, the media and all the solutions were maintained under a stream of argon to minimize the oxidation of folate derivatives. The reactions were assayed at 30°C. The protein concentrations used in these assays ranged from 5 to 50 mg ml-1, depending of the activity of the samples. The HPPK activity was estimated in association with the DHPS activity. The standard reaction medium (medium A) contained, in a total volume of 120 μl, 20 mM Tris, 20 mM K2HPO4, pH 8, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mM MgCl2, 10 mM ATP, and various amounts of our protein extracts. 2 μl of 2 mMp-[carboxyl-14C]aminobenzoic acid (1.85 GBq mmol-1) were added to the assay medium, and then the reaction was started by the addition of 100 μM dihydropterin. After 20 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by heating the samples at 100°C for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged to remove the precipitated proteins, and the [14C]dihydropteroate formed was determined with a reverse-phase HPLC system (Nova-Pak C18 column, Waters) coupled with a Berthold LB 506D scintillation counter. The HPLC conditions were as follows: solvent A, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 6; and solvent B, acetonitrile. Solvent B was increased linearly 1% every minute. The DHPS activity was measured in medium A (final volume of 120 μl) devoid of ATP. 2 μl of 2 mMp-[carboxyl-14C]aminobenzoic acid (1.85 GBq mmol-1) were added in the assay medium, and then the reaction was started by the addition of 100 μM dihydropterin pyrophosphate. After 5 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped, and the [14C]dihydropteroate formed was estimated as described above. The DHFS activity was measured in medium A (final volume of 120 μl) in the presence of 3 mM [3H]glutamate (0.5 GBq mmol-1). This medium contained 20 mM K2HPO4 buffer. A further addition of K+ monovalent cation, which is required for DHFS activity (29.Iwai K. Ikeda M. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1975; 21: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), did not significantly improve the reaction rate. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μM dihydropteroate. After 20 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of a solution containing 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5, and 50 mM glutamate. The sample was then loaded on an ion-exchange column (DE52, Whatman) previously equilibrated with the sodium acetate/glutamate solution. The column was washed with 12 ml of this solution, and then the [3H]dihydrofolate formed, which was retained on the column, was eluted with 2 ml of 1 N HCl and counted. The FPGS activity was determined by the same method as described above, except that the reaction was initiated with 100 μM tetrahydrofolate instead of dihydropteroate. The DHFR activity was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm (∋mM = 12.3 cm-1). The assay mixture contained 50 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.2, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM NADPH, 0.2 mM H2FGlu1, and known amounts of protein extract in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The TS activity was measured by the tritium release assay (30.Lomax M.I.S. Greenberg G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 30 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mM H4PteGlun, 2.5 mM formaldehyde, 100 μM [5-3H]dUMP (0.16 GBq mmol-1), and protein extract in a final volume of 1 ml. At various times, 0.2 ml of the reaction medium was withdrawn and added to 1 ml of a 2% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 0.2 g of charcoal (initially washed with the 2% trichloroacetic acid solution) to remove free dUMP. After vigorous shaking, the suspension was centrifuged, and 0.4 ml of the clear upper phase was counted to quantify 3H2O released from [5-3H]dUMP. Activity is expressed as nmol of dUMP formed h-1. The SHMT activity was measured according to Taylor and Weissbach (31.Taylor R.T. Weissbach H. Anal. Chem. 1965; 13: 80-84Google Scholar) as described previously(32.Besson V. Rébeillé F. Neuburger M. Douce R. Cossins E.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, known amounts of our protein extract were added to a medium containing 50 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 5 mM NADP, and 2 mM HCHO in a final volume of 500 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μM tetrahydrofolate, and NADPH formation was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Matrix proteins obtained from purified mitochondria (25.Neuburger M. Bourguignon J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 18-22Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were loaded on a Superdex 200 column (60 × 1 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) previously equilibrated with the following buffer: 10 mM potassium Pi, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 15% (w/v) glycerol. The proteins were eluted with the same buffer at 4°C (rate of elution, 0.3 ml min-1; fraction size, 2.4 ml). To estimate the molecular mass of our enzymes, the P, H, T, and L proteins of the glycine cleavage system present in the matrix extract (19.Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were used as internal standards to calibrate the column. Under denaturing conditions, electrophoresis was performed on a 1-mm-thick SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel containing a 7.5-15% linear acrylamide gradient. The procedures used were those described by Laemmli(33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Under nondenaturing conditions, electrophoresis was performed without SDS on a 3.5-27% linear acrylamide gradient as described by Clarke and Critchley (34.Clarke A.K. Critchley C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 100: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Soluble mitochondrial proteins (˜1 g) were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Sterivex-GS, Millipore Corp.), and ammonium sulfate was added to bring the solution to 30% saturation. After standing for 30 min at 0°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded, and more ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to bring the solution to 60% saturation. After standing for 1 h at 0°C, the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 8-10 ml of a medium containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM 2-β mercaptoethanol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 15% (w/v) glycerol (medium B). The protein suspension was dialyzed against medium B and concentrated by ultrafiltration on a 50-kDa cutoff membrane. The proteins were loaded on an anionic DEAE-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with medium B at pH 7.5 and connected to a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was washed with medium B, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min-1, until the A280 of the effluent was <0.1. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M KCl in medium B. Active fractions containing DHFR activity were pooled, dialyzed against medium B, and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 2-3 ml. In a final step, DHFR was purified by affinity chromatography on a methotrexate-agarose column. The sample was applied to the column previously equilibrated with medium B and connected to the fast protein liquid chromatography system. The flow rate was 0.2 ml min-1. The column was washed until the A280 of the effluent was <0.1. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M KCl in medium B. At this stage, the DHFR remained fixed on the column. After washing the column with 12 ml of medium B containing 1 M KCl, the DHFR was finally eluted with 10 ml of a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 1 M KCl, 1 mM H2FGlu1, 30 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 15% (w/v) glycerol. To avoid oxidation of H2FGlu1, this buffer was previously bubbled with argon. The technique used for these measurements is based on a radioassay methodology similar to the one applied for serum and erythrocyte folate determination(28.Waxman S. Schreiber C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results are calculated by direct reference to a standard curve constructed with various concentrations of folate monoglutamate (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Table 1, the folate content of pea leaves was ˜26 pmol mg-1 protein. This corresponds to ˜0.5 μg of folate g-1 fresh weight, a value in the range of what is generally reported for green vegetables (0.3-3 μg g-1)(6.Cossins E.A. Blakeley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. Wiley-Interscience, New York1984: 2-59Google Scholar). The folate levels of Percoll-purified chloroplasts and mitochondria are also shown in Table 1. In mitochondria, the folate content was ˜400 pmol mg-1 protein. This value is in agreement with previous measurements (390-1000 pmol mg-1 protein) (32.Besson V. Rébeillé F. Neuburger M. Douce R. Cossins E.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) performed with a different method involving zinc HCl treatments and HPLC separation of p-aminobenzoyl polyglutamate derivatives(35.Shane B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we repeatedly observed that, on a protein basis, the folate level in chloroplasts was ˜150 times lower than in mitochondria (Table 1). Assuming a mitochondrial volume of 1 μl mg-1 protein (36.Tobin A. Djerdjour B. Journet E. Neuburger M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1980; 66: 225-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a chloroplastic volume of 1.5 μl mg-1 protein(37.Mourioux G. Douce R. Biochimie (Paris). 1979; 61: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial and chloroplastic folate concentrations have been estimated to ˜400 and 1.7 μM, respectively (Table 1). In a leaf extract, the amounts of protein originating from either mitochondria or chloroplasts could be determined through the activity of marker enzymes, fumarase for mitochondria and phosphoribulokinase for chloroplasts (Table 1). According to these determinations, it could be calculated that ˜50% of the total folate pool was associated with the mitochondria, whereas only 6-7% was associated with chloroplasts. Unfortunately, it was not possible to have a direct reliable estimation of the cytosolic folate content. Indeed, to obtain a cytosol-enriched fraction largely devoid of contamination from the other cell compartments, the grinding of the leaves must be very mild. Under such conditions, the yield of cell aperture was very low, and the cytosol was highly diluted in the grinding medium. During the concentration procedure, folate, in contrast with proteins, was partly lost, preventing any direct determination. However, it might be reasonably assumed that the remaining 40-45% of the folate pool was associated with the cytosol and/or the nuclei. Thus, our results indicate that mitochondria contain the major part of the cellular folate. However, this high folate concentration may reflect a particular situation resulting from the leaf tissue specificity. Indeed, the presence in these mitochondria of the glycine decarboxylase complex and SHMT, which require folate as cofactor and represent 40% of the matrix proteins, could lead to a mitochondrial folate accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we determined the folate content of potato tuber mitochondria, which do not contain glycine decarboxylase activity. As shown in Table 1, the folate concentration in these mitochondria was ˜200 μM. This concentration, although two times lower than in leaf mitochondria, was still 100 times higher than in chloroplasts. Therefore, taking into account the high folate concentration in mitochondria, we investigated whether all the enzymes required for folate synthesis were present in mitochondria.Table 1 Open table in a new tab The enzyme activities involved in folate synthesis, i.e. HPPK, DHPS, DHFS, DHFR, and FPGS, were measured in purified mitochondria, in purified chloroplasts, in purified nuclei, and in a cytosol-enriched fraction. Mitochondrial, chloroplastic, and cytosolic marker enzyme activities were systematically determined in the various fractions to estimate possible cross-contamination. As shown in Table 2, all the enzyme activities involved in tetrahydrofolate synthesis were present in pea leaf mitochondria as well as in potato tuber mitochondria. Surprisingly, the DHFR-specific activity was 10-100 times higher than the activities found for the other enzymes, suggesting a possible involvement of DHFR in other metabolic functions. In marked contrast, we failed to detect any significant activity in pea leaf chloroplasts and nuclei. Likewise, in the cytosol-enriched fraction these activities were very low, at the limit of detection, and could be totally accounted for by the small mitochondrial contamination (Table 2). In control experiments, we verified that these negative results were not the fact of specific inhibitors or proteolytic enzymes. Indeed, the addition of mitochondrial proteins to the same amounts of chloroplastic or cytosolic extract that were used when assayed alone resulted in a good recovery of the added mitochondrial activities (data not shown). Although folate-synthesizing enzymes were not detected in the cytosol, nuclei, and chloroplasts, other folate enzymes were present in these compartments. As shown in Table 2, two other folate enzymes, SHMT and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, involved in the interconversion of substituted tetrahydrofolate derivatives, could be easily detected in all the cellular fractions (see also (38.Besson V. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Douce R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 665-673Google Scholar) for SHMT). As previously reported(38.Besson V. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Douce R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 665-673Google Scholar), the SHMT activity was very high in leaf mitochondria because of its participation in the photorespiratory pathway. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that folate enzymes are highly compartmentalized and that activities required for tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate synthesis are mainly localized in the mitochondria.Table 2 Open table in a new tab The different activities involved in tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate synthesis in mitochondria were then separated by gel filtration (se"

In vitro labeling of immunoprecipitated proteins from transfected cells showed that ROMK could be phosphorylated by PKA. Metabolic labeling of ROMK resulted in a significantly increased phosphorylation upon pretreatment of the cells with forskolin, consistent with an action of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphoamino acid analyses of the ROMK phosphoproteins revealed that phosphate was attached exclusively to serine residues. Three putative PKA phosphorylation sites containing serine residues in the predicted ROMK proteins are shown directly to be substrates for PKA. Site-directed mutagenesis of each of these sites or double mutation of any two sites showed that ROMK proteins retained the ability to be phosphorylated by PKA both in vivo and in vitro to a variable extent, while triple mutation of all three PKA sites abolished the phosphorylation induced by cAMP agonists in transfected cells. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments showed that PKA-dependent phosphorylation was required for ROMK channel activity and that at least two of the three sites were required for channel function when expressed in X. laevis oocytes. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that direct phosphorylation of the channel polypeptide by PKA is involved in channel regulation and PKA-dependent phosphorylation is essential for ROMK channel activity.

Transferrin (80 kDa) is a serum iron transport glycoprotein with a concentration in blood of ˜2-4 mg/ml. Its normal function is to carry iron as Fe3+ between sites of uptake, utilization, and storage(1.Brock J.H. Harrison P.M. Metalloproteins: Part 2.

It contains two specific Fe3+ binding sites per molecule, each approximately octahedral and consisting of two tyrosinates, one histidine, one aspartate, and a bidentate carbonate anion (the synergistic anion) derived from the buffer(5.Bailey S.

The strength of binding appears to be dependent on the size of the metal ion, being optimum for Fe3+ (ionic radius 0.65 Å), weaker for either slightly smaller, e.g. Ga3+ (0.62 Å), or slightly larger, e.g. In3+ (0.80 Å), ions and much weaker for very small, e.g. Al3+ (0.54 Å), or very large, e.g. lanthanide (0.86-1.03 Å) ions (Table 1). These data appear to indicate that strong binding arises from the matching of the ionic radius to the size of the binding cleft(4.Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-463Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

Since transferrin is only about 30% saturated with iron in normal serum(8.Leibman A. Aisen P. Blood. 1979; 53: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is substantial binding capacity for other metal ions that enter the blood. Thus transferrin is an important serum transport agent for metal ions of therapeutic, diagnostic or toxic importance including Al3+(9.Martin R.B. Chadwick D.J. Whelan J.

There are no previous reports of the binding of Bi3+ to transferrin, although such binding might be expected to be weak on account of the large size of Bi3+ (ionic radius 1.03 Å, log K ˜ 5; predicted from Table 1). Bismuth compounds have been used in medicine for more than 200 years for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders(12.Baxter G.F. Pharm. J. 1989; 243: 805-810Google Scholar, 13.Baxter G.F. Chem. Br. 1992; 28: 445-448Google Scholar). There is particular interest in bismuth(III) citrate solubilized by ammonium and potassium hydroxide, which forms the basis of the colloidal bismuth subcitrate present, for example, in the drugs Telen®: (Byk Gulden) and De-Nol®: (Gist Brocade)(14.Herrmann W.A.

Recently a new adduct of ranitidine with bismuth citrate (Glaxo Wellcome plc), which combines the antisecretory action of ranitidine with mucosal protectant and bactericidal properties of bismuth(III), has been granted a product license in the UK(16.Clitherow, J.

There is also interest in using compounds containing radioactive bismuth isotopes as targeted radiotherapeutic agents(18.Kozak R.W. Waldmann T.A. Atcher R.W. Gansow O.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1986; 4: 259-264Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite this medicinal interest, the speciation of bismuth in blood plasma, in particular the binding of Bi3+ to blood plasma proteins, is poorly understood. In this paper we report the first detection of the binding of Bi3+ to serum transferrin(19.Li H. Sadler P.J. Sun H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 59: 105Crossref Google Scholar). We determine the binding constants via electronic absorption spectroscopy and show, by absorption and NMR spectroscopy, that Bi3+ is taken up into the specific iron sites of transferrin and is accompanied by concomitant binding of the synergistic anion carbonate. We also show that there is preferential uptake into the C-lobe site. Linear free energy plots correlating the strength of binding of Bi3+ and Fe3+ to a wide variety of ligands provide an insight into the reasons why Bi3+ binds tightly to transferrin. Apo-hTF was purchased from Sigma (catalog no. T0519) and was washed three times with 0.1 M KCl to remove low molecular mass impurities using Centricon 30 ultrafilters (Amicon). [Bi(Hcit)] was provided by Glaxo Wellcome plc. Crystalline [Bi(NTA)] was synthesized according to a literature procedure (20.Summers S.P. Abboud K.A. Farrah S.R. Palenik G.J. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 88-92Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and had a satisfactory elemental analysis. NaHCO3 (Aldrich), NaH13CO3 (99% enriched 13C, MSD Isotopes), H3NTA (Aldrich), and Hepes (Aldrich) were used as received. A 50 mM stock solution of [Bi(Hcit)] was prepared by adding the minimum amount of ammonia solution to a suspension of [Bi(Hcit)] until it became clear. The final pH of this solution was ˜7, and it was then diluted to 1.0 mM before use. [Bi(NTA)x] solutions were prepared from a stock solution of [Bi(NTA)] in water (pH ˜4.7) by adding the appropriate amount of NTA. The bismuth concentration was determined by inductively coupled-plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer). A solution of [Fe(NTA)2] was prepared from an iron atomic absorption standard solution (1000 ppm in 1% HNO3, Aldrich) and 2 mol eq of NTA. The pH was gently raised to 5-6 with microliter amounts of NaOH (1 M). This solution was then further diluted to give the required [Fe(NTA)2] concentration in 10 mM Hepes buffer. To allow H-D exchange, apo-hTF was dissolved in 0.1 M KCl in D2O, and after adjustment of the pH∗ to 7.25, was left for 4 h at ambient temperature. After lyophilization, the sample was redissolved in D2O containing 10 mM NaHCO3. The pH∗ was then readjusted to 7.25 ± 0.05, when necessary, using NaOD and DCl (0.2 M). The pH∗ values of NMR solutions were recorded before and after NMR measurements. These were prepared by diluting aliquots of a stock apo-hTF solution to ˜10-5M with 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. The concentration of apo-hTF was determined spectrophotometrically on the basis of ∋280 93,000 M-1 cm-1(21.Chasteen N.D. White L.K. Campbell R.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immediately before adding Bi3+, an aliquot of a concentrated solution of NaHCO3 (0.25 M) was added to give a 5 mM concentration of HCO3-. For kinetic experiments, a solution containing 10 mM Hepes buffer was used for background correction. The spectrum of the apo-hTF solution (containing 5 mM bicarbonate) was recorded after equilibration at 310 K for 10 min. Aliquots of the stock solution of bismuth (usually 5-20 μl of [Bi(Hcit)] or [Bi(NTA)] solutions) were then added to the apo-hTF cuvette, and the spectrum was recorded at various time intervals. For titration experiments (at equilibrium), a similar procedure was used. Each solution was allowed to equilibrate at 310 K for at least 30 min before the spectrum was recorded. The dependence of the stability of bismuth hTF on pH was determined by varying the pH of a solution containing 3 mol eq of [Bi(NTA)] and 10-5M hTF in 5 mM NaHCO3 and recording the UV spectrum after equilibration for 1 h. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on JEOL GSX500 or Varian Unity 600 spectrometers at 500 and 600 MHz, respectively. Spectra were acquired using 0.7 ml of solution in 5 mm tubes at 310 K, using 400-1200 transients, 6-μs (50°) pulses, recycle time 2 s, 16,384 data points, and water suppression via presaturation. The chemical shift reference was TSP via endogenous formate (8.465 ppm, pH∗ > 7), which was always present in our samples as a minor impurity. Resolution enhancement of the spectra was achieved by processing the FIDs with a combination of unshifted sine-bell and exponential functions (line broadening of 1.5-5 Hz) on a Silicon Graphics computer using Varian VNMR software. A two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum (mixing time 60 ms) of hTF at pH∗ 7.25 was acquired using 2,048 data points in the f2 dimension, acquisition time 0.12 s, 48 scans, and 256 increments in the f1 dimension, in a total time of 14 h. Proton-coupled 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL GSX 500 instrument operating at 125 MHz. Typically 10,000-30,000 scans were collected using a pulsewidth of 6 μs (50°), relaxation delay 2 s, 16,384 data points. The spectra were processed using exponential functions (line-broadening of 5-8 Hz). The chemical shift reference was TSP via added internal dioxan (67.4 ppm). This was performed on a computer-controlled Perkin-Elmer Lambda 16 spectrometer. The temperature of the cells was maintained at 310 ± 0.1 K using a PTP-1 Peltier temperature programmer. These were made using a micro-combination electrode (Aldrich) and a Corning 145 pH meter calibrated with standard buffers at pH 4, 7, and 10. Equilibrium titration curves were initially fitted using the modified Hill plot(22.Raymond C. Physical Chemistry with Application to Biological Systems. 2nd Ed. Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York1981: 247-251Google Scholar), followed by an iterative procedure similar to that used by Harris and Pecoraro (23.Harris W.R. Pecoraro V.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) to recalculate K2. Briefly this involves evaluating the concentrations of free Bi3+, free NTA, and apo-hTF by iteration to minimize differences between calculated and experimentally fixed values of total bismuth, total NTA, and total apo-hTF, assuming a set of values of K1 (from modified Hill plot) and K2 for bismuth binding. Values of K2 were varied to minimize the difference between observed and calculated Δ∋ values. The calculations were carried out using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The complexation of metal ions to the phenolic groups of the tyrosine residues in the specific metal-binding sites of apo-hTF leads to the production of two new absorption bands at 241 and 295 nm(2.Harris D.C. Aisen P. Loehr T.M. Iron Carriers and Iron Proteins. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1989: 239-351Google Scholar). These new bands are readily apparent in difference UV spectra of metal-transferrins and apo-hTF. Fig. 1 shows time-dependent difference UV spectra of apo-hTF in the presence of 2 mol eq of [Bi(Hcit)] at 310 K in 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mM bicarbonate. The two new absorbance bands that appear at 241 and 295 nm are similar to those reported previously for binding of other trivalent metal ions to apotransferrin(2.Harris D.C. Aisen P. Loehr T.M. Iron Carriers and Iron Proteins. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1989: 239-351Google Scholar). The variation in absorbance at 241 nm with time, together with data for reactions involving 1 and 4 mol eq of [Bi(Hcit)], are shown in Fig. 2. The time dependence of the absorbance at 295 nm is similar. It can be clearly seen that the absorbance increases rapidly within the first 10 min, followed by a slower second phase. With 2 mol eq of [Bi(Hcit)] present, about 50% of total bismuth binding occurs within the first fast phase, and within the next 10 h the remaining 50% binds. With increasing bismuth concentration, the rate of the first phase increases, whereas that of the slower step remains almost the same. Detailed experiments that might allow a full kinetic analysis were not attempted.Figure 2:Dependence of A241 on time for the reaction of apo-hTF with different mol ratios of [Bi(Hcit)] at 310 K.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under similar conditions, the reaction of apo-hTF with [Bi(NTA)] also gave rise to the same absorbance bands at 241 and 295 nm, but at a much faster rate than that observed for [Bi(Hcit)]. Complete reaction of hTF with 1 or 2 mol eq of [Bi(NTA)] occurred within 30 min (data not shown). Apo-hTF was titrated with [Bi(NTA)x] (x = 1, 8, or 20), and the absorbance at 241 nm was monitored. A set of titration curves for NTA:Bi ratios of 1:1 to 20:1 is shown in Fig. 3. For NTA:Bi = 1:1, Δ∋ increases linearly with increase in Bi:hTF ratio (r) until a value of r = ˜1 is reached, showing that all the added bismuth is bound to apo-hTF at low values of r. Beyond r = 1, the absorbance increases further but the plot curves downward indicative of the occupation of a second site with a lower binding constant and of competition between free NTA and hTF. With increasing NTA:Bi ratios (8:1 and 20:1), the plots (Fig. 3) show more pronounced downward curvature at high r values due to the competition between hTF and NTA. The slope of the initial linear portion of these curves is 21,900 (± 650) M-1 cm-1 and can be equated to the molar absorptivity of transferrin with one site saturated with Bi3+ (Δ∋1). Hence if the two sites are equivalent, a Δ∋ value of ˜43,800 M-1 cm-1 would be expected when both sites are filled. These values are compared to those of other metal-transferrin complexes in Table 1. The absorbance data obtained at different molar ratios of NTA:Bi were used to calculate the binding constants for bismuth-transferrin complexes, using and below. Bi(NTA)+hTF=Bi-hTF+NTAKa1[Bi(hTF)NTA][Bi(NTA)hTF](Eq. 1) Bi(NTA)+Bi-hTFBi2-hTf+NTAKa2[Bi2-hTF][NTA][Bi(NTA)][Bi-hTF](Eq. 2) The relationships between the equilibrium constants Ka1 and Ka2 and the stability constants for bismuth transferrin (K1 and K2) and bismuth NTA are given by the following equations. Bi 1 hTF 5 Bi 2 hTFK1[Bi-hTF][Bi][hTF]=K[Bi(NTA)]⋅Ka1(Eq. 3) Bi-hTF+hTF=Bi2-hTFK2[Bi2-hTF][Bi-hTF][hTF]=K[Bi(NTA)]⋅Ka2(Eq. 4) If it is assumed that the two binding sites for bismuth on hTF are independent and equivalent, then 1Y=1n+1nKa[NTA][Bi(NTA)](Eq. 5) where the fractional saturation Y = [Bi-bound]/[hTF]total, n = average number of bismuth ions bound per transferrin molecule, Ka is the intrinsic binding constant, and Ka1 = 2 Ka and Ka2 = Ka/2. For 20:1 NTA:Bi titration curve, the maximum Δ∋ observed (˜18,000) never exceeded the calculated molar absorptivity (Δ∋1 = 21,900 M-1 cm-1) (Fig. 3), even at r = 2.5. This suggested that only one Bi3+ ion binds to hTF under these conditions, and so these data were used to calculate Ka1. The slope of the plot of 1/Y versus [NTA]/[Bi(NTA)] gave log Ka1 = 1.88 ± 0.02 (correlation coefficient r = 0.992, n = 1.01). From the 8:1 NTA:Bi titration curve, it was possible to use a similar plot to calculate log Ka1 = 1.87 ± 0.02 (in agreement with that obtained from the 1:20 titration curve) and log Ka2 = 1.28 ± 0.02 (r = 0.99, n = 1.99).

IUPAC/Academic Software, Otley, United Kingdom1993Google Scholar) for the stability constant of [Bi(NTA)] of log KBi(NTA)=17.75 and and, pH-independent binding constants of log K1 = 19.63 and log K2 = 19.03 were calculated for bismuth hTF. However, there is good evidence that the two binding sites are not in fact equivalent (see below), and therefore the second binding constant was recalculated using the mass balance equation, followed by fitting the apparent absorptivity at each point on the titration curve (the method of Harris and Pecoraro; see “Experimental Procedures”). This was simplified by the initial calculation of K1 and gave log K2 = 18.80 ± 0.05, a value 0.2 log units smaller than that obtained from the Hill plot (). The fitting procedure is very sensitive to the value of K2, and hence the difference in binding constants between the two sites does not arise from experimental errors. This confirms that the two Bi3+ sites are non-equivalent. The difference in binding constants of log K1 - log K2 = 0.84 is similar to that reported for Al3+, Ga3+, and Fe3+ (Table 1). The bicarbonate-independent binding constants (K∗) were calculated from the relationship (25.Harris W.R. Chen Y. Wein K. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 4991-4998Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) shown by, logK*=logK+logαc(Eq. 6) where αc represents the fractional saturation of the apo-hTF binding sites with bicarbonate. αc{Kc[HCO3-]}/{1+Kc[HCO3-]}(Eq. 7) With 5 mM bicarbonate, pH 7.4, αc = 0.6, giving log K∗1 = 19.42 and log K∗2 = 18.58. The variation of the absorbance at 241 nm with the pH of a solution containing apo-hTF (10 μM), 3 mol eq [Bi(NTA)] (i.e. both sites occupied with Bi3+) and 5 mM bicarbonate in 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4, the optimum pH for Bi3+ binding is ˜7.5, and an increase or decrease in pH decreases the absorbance at 241 nm. The competition between hTF and NTA for Bi3+ binding was compared to that of citrate. Large excesses of NTA remove Bi3+ from both binding sites, whereas even a 140-fold excess of citrate removes only one of the two bound Bi3+ ions from transferrin (Fig. 5). NTA would be expected to be more effective in removing Bi3+ from transferrin compared to citrate on the basis of the reported stability constants for Bi3+ citrate and NTA complexes (log K 13.48 and 17.75(24.Pettit G. Pettit L.D. IUPAC Stability Constants Database. IUPAC/Academic Software, Otley, United Kingdom1993Google Scholar), respectively). When [Fe(NTA)2] was added to a solution of apo-hTF containing a 20-fold molar excess of [Bi(NTA)], a new broad band in the visible region centered at ˜470 nm gradually increased in intensity (Fig. 6). This band has previously been assigned to a phenolate (π)-metal (dπ∗) transition of Fe3+-hTF(26.Patch M.G. Carrano C.J. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1981; 56: L71-L73Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Three mol eq of [Fe(NTA)2] were sufficient to completely displace bismuth from hTF showing that Fe3+ binds more tightly to hTF than Bi3+. In accordance with this, when we added excess (up to 20 mol eq) of [Bi(NTA)] to Fe2-hTF, there was no evidence for iron displacement from the protein. These were carried out to investigate whether the binding of Bi3+ to hTF also involves concomitant binding of carbonate as synergistic anion. Fig. 7 shows the carbonyl region of the 13C NMR spectrum of hTF in the presence of H13CO3- (10 mM, enriched to >99% in 13C), and after addition of 0.89 and 2.0 mol eq of Bi3+ (as [Bi(NTA)]). In the absence of Bi3+, a sharp signal at 161.1 ppm due to H13CO32- is observed, together with a broad envelope at 170-183 ppm corresponding to the backbone and side-chain carbonyls of hTF (natural abundance 13C). When Bi3+ is present, a new peak assignable to bound 13CO32- is observed at 165.8 ppm. The intensity of this peak increases on addition of the second equivalent of Bi3+, suggesting that both sites contain bound carbonate. Addition of the anti-ulcer drug ranitidine bismuth citrate to a similar solution of hTF (allowed to equilibrate overnight) produced the same spectral changes. Although the 13C NMR spectrum showed that most of the free bicarbonate was readily removed from bismuth hTF solutions by ultrafiltration, this procedure had little effect on the peak for bound carbonate (data not shown). These experiments were carried out in order to determine the order of lobe loading and to investigate bismuth-induced structural changes in hTF. The 500-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of hTF in the presence of 10 mM bicarbonate was recorded after addition of 0-2 mol eq of [Bi(NTA)] in steps of 0.5 mol eq. In the high field region, between 0.4 and −1.2 ppm, some peaks, for example peaks a, e, g, and h, are unchanged throughout the titration (Fig. 8A), whereas others either decrease (peak c) or increase (peak d) in intensity on addition of the first equivalent of Bi3+ and then show no further change on addition of the second equivalent. The most noticeable change in the aromatic region of the spectrum is the decrease in intensity of peak q (6.34 ppm) and increase in intensity of peak q′ during addition of the first equivalent of Bi3+ (Fig. 8B). A two-dimensional TOCSY 1H NMR spectrum of apo-hTF in presence of 10 mM bicarbonate, pH∗ 7.25 showed a cross-peak at 6.34(peak q)/7.72 ppm, suggesting that this may arise from a C∋H/CδH connectivity of the imidazole ring of a histidine residue. Furthermore, in the His C∋H region (7.5-8.8 ppm, Fig. 8B), peaks s′, t′, and j′ appear on addition of the first equivalent of Bi3+ but remain almost unchanged with the second equivalent, whereas peak y decreases in intensity gradually throughout the titration. The most intense peaks in the region of the spectrum from ˜2.0 to 2.2 ppm are likely to arise from the N-acetyl groups of the glycan chains in the C-lobe of hTF. On addition of the first equivalent of Bi3+ to apo-hTF, a new apparent singlet peak appears at 2.097 ppm, the peak at 2.080 ppm splits into two, and the shoulder at δ 2.038 ppm decreases in intensity (see Fig. 8C). These changes occur progressively from 0 to 1 mol eq of Bi3+, and no further changes occur in this region on addition of the second equivalent of Bi3+. There appear to be no previous reports of the binding of transferrin to bismuth, and it might be expected that Bi3+ would bind only weakly since it is a large metal ion (six-coordinate ionic radius 1.03 Å), and ions of this size, such as the lighter lanthanide ions, have previously been found to bind ˜1012 times more weakly than Fe3+ (Table 1). The concept has arisen that transferrin cannot exhibit the same closed structure with large metal ions bound because the interdomain clefts cannot close(4.Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-463Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, therefore, our data show that there is strong binding of Bi3+ to human serum transferrin. The changes in the UV spectra of hTF on binding of Bi3+ are similar to those observed previously for the binding of other metal ions to the specific Fe3+ binding sites. The new bands at 241 and 295 nm are attributable to binding to tyrosine ligands (π-π∗ transitions). From the magnitude of the change in extinction coefficient (Table 1 and Fig. 3), it can deduced that two tyrosines are involved in binding Bi3+ in both the N- and C-lobes (Tyr-95/Tyr-188, and Tyr-426/Tyr-517) as is the case for Fe3+. The displacement of Bi3+ from transferrin by Fe3+, and lack of binding to Fe2-hTF provided further evidence for specific binding of Bi3+ to the protein. Moreover the 13C NMR data show that carbonate is directly bound to Bi3+ in each lobe. Therefore Bi3+ can now be added to Cr3+, VO2+, Mn3+, Co3+, Cu2+, Ga3+, and In3+ as metal ions that satisfy the criteria (4.Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-463Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 25.Harris W.R. Chen Y. Wein K. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 4991-4998Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for specific metal binding to transferrin. The two binding constants that we have determined for Bi3+ binding to transferrin are only slightly lower than those for Ga3+ binding (Table 1). Several other previous studies have demonstrated the non-equivalence of the two transferrin binding sites, e.g. by NMR(27.Kubal G. Sadler P.J. Evans R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1117-1118Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28.Kubal G. Mason A.B. Patel S.U. Sadler P.J. Woodworth R.C.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34.Harris A.W. Sephton R.G. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 3634-3638PubMed Google Scholar). The strength of Bi3+ binding to transferrin is not so surprising when a linear free energy relationship (LFER) is used to compare the binding constants for Bi3+ with those of Fe3+ and a wide range of O,N-donor ligands, Fig. 9. There is a good correlation, which is described by, with correlation coefficient r = 0.979. logKBi=-0.906+1.172(logKFe)(Eq. 8) The slope of the LFER is greater than 1.0, and many of the stability constants for Bi3+ complexes are greater than those of Fe3+. However, the oxygen ligands in the plot are carboxylates and not phenolates, and the former might favor Bi3+ since they are softer donors. The two bismuth-hTF binding constants are roughly within the LFER region, although the values are 3 log units lower than predicted, i.e. hTF should bind Bi3+ more strongly than Fe3+. However, the slope of the LFER might be lower if more appropriate model complexes containing phenolates could be incorporated. Harris et al. have found that hydroxybenzyl-containing ligands provide the best predictors for In-hTF binding constants(25.Harris W.R. Chen Y. Wein K. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 4991-4998Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The recent data of Hancock et al.(35.Hancock, R. D., Cukrowski, I., Cukrowski, E., Hosken, G. D., Iccharam, V., Brechbiel, M. W., Gansow, O. (1994) J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 2679–2685Google Scholar) support this argument. They have found that the binding constants of Bi3+ and Fe3+ with DTPA change from log KBi (35.6) > log KFe (28.0) to log KBi (27.76) < log KFe (30.44) when the two terminal carboxylate groups are replaced by phenolate groups. The strength of binding of metal ions to hTF therefore appears to be related more to the type of donor set provided by the protein than to the size of the metal ion. A critical maximum metal ion radius of 0.8-0.9 Å has been suggested for domain closure to occur(36.Smith C.A. Ainscough E.W. Baker H.M. Brodie A.M. Baker E.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7889-7890Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus it has been suggested that the interdomain cleft is open when Ce3+ (r = 1.01 Å) binds to lactoferrin. In the case of Bi3+, it seems clear from the values of Δ∋241 (Table 1 and Fig. 3) that two Tyr ligands are bound to Bi3+ in each lobe, as is the case with Fe3+. Since the Tyr residues are on domain 2 and an interdomain polypeptide strand, such binding could occur without domain closure(37.Lindley P.F. Bajaj M. Evans R.W. Garratt R.C. Hasnain S.S. Jhoti H. Kuser P. Neu M. Patel K. Sarra R. Strange R. Walton A. Acta Crystallogr. Ser. D. 1993; 49: 292-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It would therefore be interesting to study bismuth hTF by x-ray scattering to determine the radius of gyration for comparison with other metallotransferrins(38.Grossman J.G. Neu M. Pantos E. Schwab F.J. Evans R.W. Townes- Andrews Lindley P.F. Appel H. Thies W.G. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39.Castellano A.C. Barteri M. Castagnola M. Bianconi A. Borghi E. Della Longa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The NMR studies show that (bi)carbonate binds to both the N- and C-lobes of hTF concomitantly with Bi3+. The 13C shift of the bound synergistic anion (165.8 ppm) is close to that observed previously for other metallotransferrins, e.g. 166.0/166.2 ppm for Tl3+(40.Aramini J.M. Krygsman P.H. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3304-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), 165.4 ppm for Al3+, and 166.5 ppm for Ga3+(41.Bertini I. Luchinat C. Messori L. Scozzafava A. Pellacani G. Sola M. Inorg. Chem. 1986; 25: 1782-1786Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar mode of binding, probably as a bidentate carbonate ion. The anion is strongly bound to bismuth hTF and is not readily removed by dialysis. Studies of Bi3+ binding to transferrin can also be readily monitored by 1H NMR since apo-hTF and Bi-hTF are in slow exchange on the NMR time scale (indicative of strong Bi3+ binding). Peaks in both the aromatic and the methyl regions of the spectrum suggest preferential binding of Bi3+ to the C-lobe. The relatively sharp peak q at 6.34 ppm is affected by the first mol eq of Bi3+ and has been previously assigned to a C-lobe residue(42.Kubal G. Sadler P.J. Tucker A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has an associated low pKa (5.87) and an unusual pH titration shift range (0.75 ppm), and arises from a His Cδ proton (based on two-dimensional TOCSY data) with an unusual high field shift. From examination of the x-ray structure of hTF with Fe3+ in the C-lobe(7.Zuccola, H. A. 1993 The Crystal Structure of Monoferric Human Serum Transferrin. Ph.D. thesis, Georgia Institute of TechnologyGoogle Scholar), possible candidates are His-473 or His-535. The sharp resonances at 2.0-2.1 ppm are attributable to the N-acetyls of the NAcGlc and NAcNeu residues in each of the two biantennary glycan chains attached to Asn-413 and Asn-611 in the C-lobe of hTF. Since these resonances were perturbed only on addition of the first mol eq of Bi3+, we can conclude that preferential binding occurs to the C-lobe of hTF. A similar NMR behavior has been observed for Ga3+ (with oxalate as synergistic anion) and In3+ binding to hTF(28.Kubal G. Mason A.B. Patel S.U. Sadler P.J. Woodworth R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43.Beatty, E. J. 1995 Recognition of Metal Ions and Anions by the N-lobe of Human Serum Transferrin, Ph.D. thesis, University of LondonGoogle Scholar), and several other metal ions are known to bind more strongly to the C-lobe of hTF than to the N-lobe (40.Aramini J.M. Krygsman P.H. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3304-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). No attempt was made to investigate the kinetics of reactions of hTF with Bi3+ citrate or NTA complexes at this stage, but it is apparent that there at least two distinct kinetic steps. The citrate complex reacts much more slowly with hTF than the NTA complex, and dissociation of the low molecular mass ligand bound to Bi3+ appears to be partly rate-determining. Similar observations have been reported for Fe3+ binding to hTF(33.El Hage Chahine, J. M., Fain, D. (1993) J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 3137–3143Google Scholar, 44.Bates G.W. Wernicke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3679-3685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We expected the binding of Bi3+ to transferrin to be weak because the size of the binding cleft is thought to be matched to that of the metal ion, being optimum for Fe3+ (ionic radius 0.65 Å). Unexpectedly, therefore, we have found that Bi3+ (radius 1.03 Å) binds very tightly to both the N- and C-lobes of transferrin with affinities close to those of the smaller metal ions Ga3+ (0.62 Å) and In3+ (0.80 Å). Hence, ionic size can now be said not to be the major factor determining the strength of metal binding to transferrin. Linear free energy relationships for the binding of Fe3+ and Bi3+ to a range of different ligands demonstrate that the ligand donor set plays a dominant role."

We observed naturally occurring differences in CD44 keratan sulfate substitution between two clonal variants of the KM12 human colon carcinoma cell line. CD44 on the highly metastatic KM12L4 clone is more heavily substituted with keratan sulfate than CD44 on the poorly metastatic KM12C6 clone. Moreover, CD44H on KM12L4 bound to hyaluronate poorly compared to CD44H on KM12C6. Removal of keratan sulfate from CD44 greatly enhanced CD44-mediated cell adhesion to hyaluronate. Removal of keratan sulfate from CD44H-immunoglobulin fusion proteins also enhanced their adhesion to hyaluronate. The influence of glycosaminoglycan substitution on CD44 function was specific to keratan sulfate substitution; treatment to remove chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, or hyaluronate did not affect CD44-mediated cell adhesion to hyaluronate. Use of site-directed CD44H cDNA mutants with arginine changed to alanine at position 41 indicated that keratan sulfate modification of CD44 modulates hyaluronate adhesion through its B loop domain.

Polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are ubiquitous in all living organisms. They are involved in a wide variety of biological reactions, including nucleic acid and protein synthesis(1.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev.

Although it binds both spermidine and putrescine, spermidine is preferred(6.Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

These binding proteins, which have remarkably broad specificities, share a similar main chain fold, although they lack significant sequence similarities. Furthermore, they consist of two similar domains, which show an “opening-closing” movement likened to a Venus flytrap, depending upon substrate binding(22.Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyamines are unique substrates for a periplasmic binding protein, and their specific interactions with cognate binding proteins have never been studied in terms of three-dimensional structure. Therefore, a crystallographic study of the PotD protein at an atomic resolution was performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of its specific substrate recognition and the characteristics of the main chain folding. In this paper, we report the molecular structure of the PotD-spermidine complex determined at 2.5-Å resolution by x-ray analysis. Crystals, which belong to the monoclinic system space group P21, with unit cell parameters a = 145.3 Å, b = 69.1 Å, c = 72.5 Å, and β = 107.6°, were grown according to the procedure described previously(24.Sugiyama, S., Matsushima, M., Saisho, T., Kashiwagi, K., Igarashi, K., Morikawa, K. (1996) Acta Crystallogr. D, in pressGoogle Scholar). They contain four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The procedure for data collection was already reported (24.Sugiyama, S., Matsushima, M., Saisho, T., Kashiwagi, K., Igarashi, K., Morikawa, K. (1996) Acta Crystallogr. D, in pressGoogle Scholar). The major heavy atom sites of K2PtCl4 and Pb(NO3)4 derivatives prepared by soaking were determined from their difference Patterson maps. The initial analysis of the x-ray data showed that the structure factors for the reflections with the odd h indices were much smaller than those with the even h indices (<F(2n + 1, k, l)> = 0.5∗<F (2n, k, l)>) in a 6-Å resolution shell. This fact, along with the analysis of the heavy atom sites in the derivatives, confirmed that there are two dimers of the protein in the asymmetric unit, connected by an almost precise translational symmetry with of the a-axis of the crystal(24.Sugiyama, S., Matsushima, M., Saisho, T., Kashiwagi, K., Igarashi, K., Morikawa, K. (1996) Acta Crystallogr. D, in pressGoogle Scholar). The heavy atom parameters were refined with the programs PROTEIN (25.Steigemann, W. 1974 Die Entwicklung und Anwendung von Rechenverfahren und Rechenprogrammen zur Strukturanalyse von Proteinen am Biespiel des Trypsin-Trypsininhibitor Komplexes, des Frelen Inhibitors und der LAspariginase. Ph. D. thesis, Technishe Universität, MünchenGoogle Scholar) and MLPHARE (26.Leslie A.G.W. Bailey S. Dodson E. Phillips S. Proceedings of the Daresbury Study Weekend, 5-6 February 1988. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1988: 25-31Google Scholar) against the 3.0-Å resolution data, including anomalous data from all derivatives. The latter program provided the mean figure of merit of 0.63. Solvent flattening (27.Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) and noncrystallographic symmetry averaging techniques (28.Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. 1976; 32: 832-847Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar) were applied to improve the phases. The 2-fold molecular averaging, using only reflections with h = 2n, was successful in substantially improving the map. However, this map was still insufficient to achieve a complete chain tracing. The structure determination statistics for the MIR phasing are summarized in Table 1. The initial model was constructed on the basis of the averaged electron density map at 3.0-Å resolution, using the program O(29.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12990) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was then carried out using the program X-PLOR, version 3.0(30.Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar), with all the data to 3.0-Å resolution. The initial model was used to define the molecular envelope, and then the 4-fold averaging technique was repeated using all the data, for further improvement of the phases, by the program DM in the CCP4 package(26.Leslie A.G.W. Bailey S. Dodson E. Phillips S. Proceedings of the Daresbury Study Weekend, 5-6 February 1988. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1988: 25-31Google Scholar). The averaging was reiterated until convergence was achieved, while the phases were expanded from 3.0- to 2.7-Å resolution. The correlation coefficients increased from 0.33 to 0.85. Consequently, this map allowed us to achieve a complete chain tracing. The model was manually modified by the program FRODO (31.Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar) on an Evans & Sutherland PS390 graphics system, and it was refined against the 2.5-Å resolution data set, using the program X-PLOR. During the refinement, the (|Fo| - |Fc|) and (2|Fo| - |Fc|) maps were used for manual adjustments of the model, and for locating the four spermidine and the solvent molecules. Only the water molecules that form geometrically reasonable hydrogen bonds with the protein atoms were included in the refinement calculation. The Ramachandran plots for the main chain torsion angles have been analyzed with the PROCHECK program(32.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar), and the ψ and φ torsion angles for the nonglycine residues lie within the allowed regions. The overall geometry of the model is satisfactory, as shown in Table 2. The crystal contains two dimeric molecules of the PotD protein in the asymmetric unit. The final structure refined at 2.5-Å resolution includes four identical protein molecules, each of which contains 325 amino acids, and one ordered spermidine molecule, in addition to 236 ordered water molecules in the asymmetric unit. The first two residues (aspartate residues 24 and 25) at the N terminus (since the signal sequence is eliminated in the crystallized PotD protein, Asp24 is defined as the N-terminal residue) are not well defined in the electron density map, and their conformations appear to be disordered in the crystal. The primary sequence with the secondary structure elements and the ribbon representation are shown in Fig. 1. The PotD molecule has an ellipsoidal shape with dimensions of 30 × 40 × 55 Å. It consists of two distinct domains divided by a deep cleft. Each domain is formed by two noncontiguous polypeptide segments. Nevertheless, the two domains are very similar in the arrangements of their secondary structure elements. The first domain (N domain; residues 26-131 and 257-302) consists of five β-strands and six α-helices. The other domain (C domain; residues 132-256 and 303-348), with a larger size, contains five β-strands and seven α-helices. The β-sheet within each domain is flanked by several α-helices on both sides. The polypeptide chain crosses over three times between the two domains, which noncovalently interact with each other by an extensive interface. The three crossing segments and the interface form a deep cleft with approximate dimensions of 20 Å long, 5 Å wide, and 14 Å deep (Fig. 1B). The PotD protein, with its many β-α-β repeats, is classified as an α/β type. Of the amino acids, 40 and 18% are located in the α-helices and the β-sheets, respectively. The remaining amino acids (42%) belong to loops and coils. There is no substantial difference among the backbone structures of the four independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Their root mean square (r.m.s.) 1The abbreviation used is: r.m.s.root mean square. deviations for the superimposed Cα atoms are as low as 0.40 Å. However, when the Cα atoms of the N and C domains are superimposed separately among the corresponding domains in the asymmetric unit, the C domain shows a larger r.m.s. deviation value (0.42 Å) than the N domain (0.33 Å). root mean square. The crystal contains two dimeric molecules in the asymmetric unit. The dimensions of the dimer are approximately 70 × 70 × 55 Å. Each monomer in a dimer is related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 2). The r.m.s. deviation values for the Cα atoms between these two related dimers was calculated to be 0.52 Å. The dimerization mainly involves the interactions between the N domain (βA, α1, and βB) and the C domain (α6, α7, and βI). Consequently, the two clefts in the dimer face each other and cross over the solvent region that is centered around the 2-fold axis. The dimer is stabilized by a network of many hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. In fact, 14 residues participate in direct hydrogen bonds (Tyr30 to Asp141, Gly41 and Glu44 to Gln238, Tyr56 to Gly240 and Thr241, Thr58 to Met219, Glu60 to Glu220, and Asp212 to Asn216 and Glu220). These extensive interactions contribute to the maintenance of the dimer. Crystals of PotD have been grown in the presence of spermidine. Indeed, the omit map at 2.5-Å resolution shows an elongated electron density (Fig. 3), which is assigned to a spermidine molecule bound to the central cleft between the two domains. The same densities have been found within all four molecules in the asymmetric unit, indicating that the bound spermidine molecules adopt the identical conformation. Interestingly, the spermidine molecule is bent within the PotD molecule, whereas all kinds of the crystal structures of spermidine in the Cambridge structural data base exhibit a linear shape(33.Giglio E. Liquori A.M. Puliti R. Ripamonti A. Acta Crystallogr. 1966; 20: 683-688Crossref Google Scholar, 34.Huse Y. Iitaka Y. Acta Crystallogr. 1969; B 25: 498-509Crossref Google Scholar). The substrate binding site is located at the middle of the cleft between the two domains. This site forms a hydrophobic box, which is composed of four aromatic side chains, Trp34, Tyr37, Trp225, and Tyr293 in the N domain and Trp229 in the C domain. These aromatic side chains anchor the methylene backbone of the spermidine molecule through van der Waals interactions. The methylene bonds of spermidine are sandwiched between the aromatic side chains of Trp34 and Trp225, which are arranged in parallel (Fig. 4A). The side chain of Trp229, oriented perpendicular to the previous side chains, covers the spermidine like a lid over the cleft. Another important feature in the binding site is that four acidic residues, Glu36, Asp168, Glu171, and Asp257, recognize the charged nitrogen atoms of spermidine through numerous ionic interactions (Fig. 4B). The conformations of these aromatic and acidic residues are conserved well among the four molecules in an asymmetric unit. One terminal amino group of propyl amine moiety in the spermidine forms the salt bridges with the carboxyl side chains of Asp168 and Glu171, and the hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Gln327 and Tyr85. The secondary amino group in the middle is recognized through the side chain of Asp257, and the other terminal amino group forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu36 and a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Thr35. These aromatic and acidic side chain atoms embed the spermidine molecule in the cleft so as to prevent no solvent access. Among the periplasmic binding proteins, the PotD backbone is most similar to that of MBP from E. coli, although their two sequences exhibit an identity less than 20%. In particular, the similarity between the two N domains is remarkable. When the two domains of PotD are optimally superimposed on the corresponding domains of MBP, the r.m.s. deviation values are evaluated to be 1.64 Å for the 100 Cα atoms between the N domains and 2.63 Å for the 100 Cα positions between the C domains. Furthermore, the active residues of the PotD and MBP proteins can be observed in similar regions of the two topologies (Fig. 5). Another notable similarity between the two structures is that a conserved sequence motif is found in both PotD and MBP(35.Matsuo Y. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This conserved sequence motif spans residues 46-54 (FTKETGIKV) of PotD, which corresponds to the loop between α1 and βB, and residues 53-61 (FEKDTGIKV) of MBP (Fig. 1). These sequences exhibit a remarkably similar conformation between the two molecules, as proved by the very small r.m.s. deviation value of 0.40 Å for the nine Cα positions. The crystal structures of MBP have been reported in both states of the open and closed forms (Brookhaven Protein Databank entry 1MBP, closed liganded form; 1OMP, open unliganded form), which correspond to the substrate-free form and the complex with the substrate, respectively. Substrate binding induces few conformational changes within each domain. However, it generates a substantial alteration in the relative orientation of the two domains. Substrate binding to MBP yields a hinge bending angle of 35° about an axis through the central hinge residues (residues 111 and 261)(36.Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Szmelcman S. Hofnung M. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The interdomain orientation of PotD is much closer to the closed form of MBP, indicating that both the PotD and MBP molecules adopt a similar domain arrangement upon binding the substrates (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that the spermidine-bound PotD molecule assumes the closed form, which presumably was converted from the open, ligand-free form. The PotD molecule forms a dimer in this crystal structure, although PotD exists as monomeric form in the presence of the substrate (data not shown). The ionic interactions between the two subunits are so extensive that they are unlikely to have accidentally taken place during crystallization. All of the crystal structures of the periplasmic binding proteins exhibit monomeric molecules except for a MBP mutant crystal produced in the presence of maltose. This mutant crystal structure revealed a dimeric molecule(36.Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Szmelcman S. Hofnung M. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MBP protein is purified as a dimer from an E. coli strain that is constitutive for the expression of the maltose system and that has been grown in the absence of maltose (37.Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that the switch from the dimer to the monomer of the PotD protein may have physiological significance in polyamine transport. The residues that participate in the recognition of spermidine spread over the two domains. The N domain comes into more extensive contact with the spermidine through the walls of the hydrophobic box, while the C domain provides the lid of the box. The ligand serves as a pin that links the two domains, and it is completely embedded in the protein atoms that lie between them (Fig. 4B). The PotD protein can bind putrescine as well as spermidine, although the affinity of putrescine is much lower than that of spermidine. The dissociation constants (Kd) for spermidine and putrescine are 3.2 μM and 100 μM, respectively(23.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These Kd values reflect the spermidine-preferential recognition for the primary receptor of the polyamine transport system. The shorter putrescine molecule could possibly make ionic interactions with the acidic residues of Glu36 and Asp257, and form van der Waals interactions with the aromatic residues Trp34, Tyr37, Trp229, Trp225, and Tyr293. These interactions may stabilize the closed conformation. However, the smaller number of interactions, as compared with those with spermidine, would decrease the stability of the closed form. The highly conserved sequence motif observed in MBP and PotD suggests a common functional role in the transport system, although mutations introduced in this region of MBP do not clearly cause a transport defect(21.Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 38.Zhang Y. Conway C. Rosato M. Suh Y. Manson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the PotD structure is optimally superimposed onto the MBP structure, the motif is located in the surface loop of the N domain (Fig. 1), which is distant from the substrate binding site. On the other hand, it is directly connected to the loop βA to α1, which participates in the substrate binding and is opposite the hinge between the domains. This motif, which also lies on the molecular surface, does not participate in the dimerization. It may be possible that the physiological role of the consensus sequence is to interact with the membrane components, PotB and/or PotC, which could be an initial switch to release the substrate from the protein. In the course of periplasmic receptor-dependent transport, the substrate is initially recognized by a specific binding protein. The subsequent translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane requires a set of membrane protein components. The membrane-bound components in the polyamine transport machinery are three nonidentical proteins (PotA, -B, and -C). Polyamine uptake appears to be initiated by the formation of a complex between the two membrane-bound components (PotB and PotC) and the periplasmic receptor (PotD). The substrate-free PotD protein slightly inhibits spermidine uptake to the cytoplasm(23.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result implies that the closed form of PotD is preferentially recognized by the membrane components. In spite of many relevant reports(38.Zhang Y. Conway C. Rosato M. Suh Y. Manson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Duplay P. Szmelcman S.

Hermodson M.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), mutational analyses have not clearly identified the interface of periplasmic binding proteins with their membrane protein components yet. However, it should be noted that the consensus sequence lies in the N domain, which shows a higher similarity of PotD and MBP in terms of the three-dimensional structure. Furthermore, in most of the periplasmic binding proteins including PotD and MBP (Fig. 5), the folding topology of the N domain is more conserved than the C domain(22.Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the interface of PotD with the membrane components is located in the N domain rather than the C domain. We are grateful Drs. K. Katayanagi, T. Shimizu, H. W. Song, T.

The active species of this enzyme was previously found to be a large homodimer of 160 kDa (α2) with a stable, oxygen-sensitive radical located at Gly-681 of the 80-kDa polypeptide chain. The radical is formed in an enzymatic reaction involving S-adenosylmethionine, NADPH, a reducing flavodoxin system and an additional 17.5-kDa polypeptide, previously called activase.

Anaerobically grown Escherichia coli synthesizes the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates required for DNA replication via the action of a specific ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase, which is different from the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase employed during aerobic growth(1.Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In their active form, both enzymes are radical proteins. One of the amino acids of the polypeptide chain is an organic radical and initiates the radical chemistry required for the activation of the substrate ribonucleotide. To this purpose the aerobic enzyme contains a stable tyrosyl radical (Tyr-122) that is formed by an oxygen-dependent process(2.Peterson L. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6706-6712Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The anaerobic enzyme contains a glycyl radical (Gly-681), stable during anaerobic conditions but rapidly destroyed by oxygen(3.Sun X.

The direct isolation of an active anaerobic reductase was for a long time prevented by the exquisite lability of the glycyl radical to oxygen. The enzyme was instead isolated in an inactive form that could be reactivated by preincubation with a complex activating system consisting of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosylmethionineDTTdithiothreitolPFLpyruvate formate lyase. a reducing system (NADPH, dithiothreitol, flavodoxin reductase and flavodoxin)(4.Harder J.

Activation occurred by “radicalization” of Gly-681. With time we could exclude oxygen more efficiently during enzyme purification and now can obtain a protein that has partially retained its glycyl radical and reduces ribonucleotides without prior activation(8.Mulliez E.

However, the activity of the best preparations is increased by the activation system. S-adenosylmethionine dithiothreitol pyruvate formate lyase. The anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase shows considerable similarities to pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), another E. coli anaerobic enzyme. Previous elegant work by Knappe and collaborators showed that active PFL contains a glycyl radical required for enzyme activity(9.Knappe J. Sawers G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 383-398Google Scholar, 10.Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This radical is generated in inactive PFL by an enzyme system consisting of AdoMet, the reducing flavodoxin system and an activating protein(11.Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohman H.-P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of the activating proteins, the components required for generation of the glycyl radical are identical for PFL and the reductase. The two activases also show some sequence homology(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In particular three cysteines occupy identical positions at the N terminus of both proteins(7.Sun X.

In the case of the PFL activase, the cysteines were suggested to bind the iron required for the activation reaction. Iron had to be added during the course of the reaction, and the pure protein could bind close to 1 Fe/polypeptide (12.Wong K.K. Murray B.W. Lewisch S.A. Baxter M.K. Ridky T.W. Ulissi-DeMario L. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14102-14110Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The protein required for the generation of the glycyl radical of the reductase was found to contain substoichiometric amounts of iron(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The pure protein was red-brown in solution, and its electronic spectrum showed three poorly resolved absorption bands between 380 and 620 nm, suggesting the possibility of an iron-sulfur cluster(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In further studies we now demonstrate that the protein after anaerobic treatment with sulfide and Fe(II) dimerizes and forms a labile 4Fe-4S cluster with considerable increase in enzyme activity. The dimer (β2) forms a quite tight α2β2 complex with the protein (α2) containing the glycyl residue that undergoes radical formation. Originally this second protein was considered to be the reductase proper. It now appears more appropriate to look upon the complex as the complete anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. In this paper we will use the term “large protein” for α2 and the term “small protein” for β2. Except as stated below, the sources and purification of enzymes and other materials have been described previously(4.Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol.

The large protein used in the present work was obtained from a new mutant strain of E. coli with an insertion in the chromosomal gene for the large protein, carrying a plasmid with the gene for only the large protein. 2A. Jordan, X. Garriga, and J. Barbé, manuscript in preparation. When prepared by the previously used procedure (8.Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8759-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) the large protein obtained from this strain contained no iron and was not contaminated with the small protein. Pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase from Clostridium pasteurianum was provided by J. M. Moulis (CENG, Grenoble, France) and ferredoxin IV from Rhodobacter capsulatus by Y. Jouanneau (CENG, Grenoble, France). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (14.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (210789) Google Scholar), standardized by amino acid analyses of the small and large subunits. Iron was determined as described by Fish(15.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and sulfide as described by Beinert(16.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Two different preparations of the small protein were used. In one case, the protein was purified in the presence of DTT as described earlier(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This method gave a nearly homogeneous protein preparation, contaminated with nucleotides that were removed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. In a typical experiment, we first decreased the salt concentration of a solution of 34 mg of protein to 30 mM KCl, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT by exchange on Sephadex G25 and filtration through a 5-ml column of DE52 (Whatman), equilibrated with the same buffer. The active protein, free of nucleotides, passed directly through the column and was concentrated by centrifugation in Centriprep-10 to give a final yield of 25 mg. This material was used for the reactivation experiment described below. In an alternative preparation that avoided DTT, extracts from a different bacterium, E. coli BL 21(DE3), carrying phage pN9 were used. This strain gave much higher protein expression. Cells were grown at 37°C in LB medium with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose. When the A600 had reached 0.5, the culture was cooled rapidly to 25°C and induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl thio-β-D-galactoside. After 4 h of growth at this temperature, the cells were centrifuged, washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Purification of the enzyme was made at approximately 4°C. The cells (4 g) were suspended in 9 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and sonicated. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, the pinkish supernatant solution (10 ml, 35 mg of protein/ml) was precipitated with streptomycin sulfate (final concentration 3%) during 1 h of stirring, and again centrifuged. MgCl2 (final concentration 2 mM) was added to the supernatant solution, which was treated with 2-3 mg of pancreatic DNase for 60 min at 4°C and then precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate (final saturation 40%). The pellet after centrifugation was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (2.8 ml, 100 mg/ml), and the solution was chromatographed at 0.8 ml/min on a column of Superdex 75, 16/60 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/1 M KCl. After 40 ml had passed through the column, fractions (2 ml) were collected and assayed for protein and enzyme activity. Enzyme activity (in a total of 150 mg of protein) was recovered in two well separated peaks, corresponding to the dimer and monomer of the protein, as shown under “Results.” Fractions corresponding to each peak were combined, and the protein was concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon-10 tubes. We describe here a typical experiment in which radioactive iron was introduced. A solution of 15 mg of enzyme (0.6 ml in three small tubes) was continuously purged with argon on a manifold and treated in an ice bath under strict anaerobiosis for 3 h with 4 μmol of DTT and 3 μmol each of Na2S and 59Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (6 μCi), added in that order. After addition of iron the solution became immediately dark brown. After 3 h, EDTA (9 μmol) was added, the capped tubes were transferred to an anaerobic hood, and the solution was passed through a 15-ml column of Sephadex G25, equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with recovery of 9.1 mg of protein. The final material contained 2.1 atoms of Fe/protein monomer and initially had a specific radioactivity of 0.81 × 106 cpm/mg protein. In some of the samples used for EPR measurements, 10% glycerol was included during the last Sephadex G25 step to prevent the concentrated protein from precipitating. Under standard conditions the small and large proteins (usually between 0.5 and 5 μg each) in a total volume of 20 μl were added to small tubes attached to a manifold and purged with moist argon during 30 min at room temperature to remove all air. An anaerobic preincubation mix (15 μl) was added with a syringe through the septum of the tubes and incubation was continued for 60 min at room temperature to generate the glycyl radical on the large protein. The reductase reaction was then started at room temperature by addition of 15 μl of substrate mix and allowed to proceed for between 5 and 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of 1 M HClO4, and the solution was worked up as described earlier(4.Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity represents the formation of 1 nmol dCTP/min. The preincubation mix was 2.5 mM NADPH, 1.0 mM AdoMet, 12.5 mM DTT, 12.5 mM sodium formate, 75 mM KCl, 75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and contained flavodoxin (4 μg/ml) and flavodoxin reductase (2 μg/ml). The substrate mix contained 5 mM [3H]CTP (9 cpm/pmol), 2.5 mM ATP, and 25 mM MgCl2. EPR first-derivative spectra were recorded on a Varian E 109 (9.5 GHz) EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 helium flow cryostat. Double integrals of the EPR signals were evaluated by using a computer on-line with the spectrometer. Spin concentrations in the protein samples were determined by calibrating double integrations of the EPR spectra with a standard sample of a 2Fe-2S protein (62 μM of ferredoxin IV of R. capsulatus). Power saturation experiments were carried out by measuring the amplitude of the central component of the EPR signal (g = 1.92) as a function of the incident microwave power in the 40 dB (20 microwatts) to 4 dB (82 milliwatts) range at fixed temperature. The amplitude at the lowest power value was taken as 100%. At each power increment, the amplifier gain was changed in order to keep the signal amplitude constant (non-saturating conditions). The 2Fe-2S center of ferredoxin IV and one of the 4Fe-4S centers of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase were used as references. The iron signal of the small protein was recorded directly on solutions of the pure protein after reconstitution with iron and sulfide. Analyses of the reduced form of the small protein were carried out after anaerobic incubation of the reconstituted protein (200-300 μM) in the presence of 10 mM dithionite at 25°C for 1 h in EPR tubes. To stabilize the small protein, all experiments were done in 10% glycerol. Centrifugations (17.Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were made at 35,000 rpm for 15 h at 20°C with a 5-20% sucrose gradient (4.5 ml) containing 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mM KCl, 5 mM sodium formate, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, and 5.4 μM59Fe-labeled small protein. The large protein, dissolved in 0.1 ml of 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mM KCl was layered on top of the gradient. After centrifugation, fractions of 2 drops (0.13 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tubes. The amount of protein and radioactivity present in each tube was determined. In a previous publication, the small protein was obtained from an extract of E. coli JM 109(DE3) carrying plasmid pN9, by direct chromatography on a column of Superdex-75 in the presence of 5 mM DTT(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Part of the experiments described here were done with an enzyme obtained by a slightly modified procedure. The protein chromatographed on Superdex-75 as a monomer of 17.5 kDa and contained 0.3-0.8 Fe/polypeptide chain. A better yield of pure protein was obtained when the enzyme was prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying plasmid pN9, with the overproduced small protein constituting almost 40% of the total soluble protein. The recovery was highly dependent on growth conditions. When induction was made at 37°C, most of the protein was present as inclusion bodies. However, when the growth temperature was decreased to 25°C, the enzyme remained soluble. After the preliminary purification with streptomycin and ammonium sulfate described under “Experimental Procedures,” the protein was chromatographed without DTT on Superdex-75 with the results shown in Fig. 1. Enzyme activity was present in the two last, well defined peaks with apparent molecular masses of 35 and 17.5 kDa, corresponding to the di- and monomer, respectively, of the small subunit. On denaturing gel electrophoresis both peaks gave only a single band at 17 kDa. Together, 150 mg of pure material was recovered from 4 g of wet weight bacteria. The crude bacterial extract and the ammonium sulfate fraction were brown. After gel filtration the dimer fraction was also colored, whereas the monomer fraction was almost colorless. The optical absorption spectrum of the colored solutions showed broad bands around 420, 460, and 550 nm, suggesting that the enzyme contained an iron-sulfur cluster. In different preparations the dimer contained 0.10-0.25 Fe/polypeptide chain, whereas the monomer contained only 0.01-0.02 Fe. Both dimer and monomer thus contained less iron than the monomer preparation obtained in the presence of DTT(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sulfide was present in 1:1 stoichiometric amounts throughout the preparation of the enzyme (Table 1).Table 1 Open table in a new tab These results indicate that the small protein may exist as a dimer or monomer in solution and that it contains a highly labile iron-sulfur cluster. Preparations obtained in the presence of DTT retained a larger fraction of iron, suggesting a stabilizing effect of DTT. Anaerobic incubation of either dimer or monomer with a slight excess of iron and sodium sulfide as described under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in the uptake of close to 2 Fe and 2 sulfide/polypeptide chain (Table 1). Reconstitution was a slow process and required more than 2 h of incubation (data not shown). The absorption in the 420 nm region increased proportionally to the iron uptake, but the bands were less distinct after (Fig. 2B) than before (Fig. 2A) reconstitution. The molar extinction coefficient for iron at 420 nm was 3700 before and 3400 after reconstitution. During anaerobic incubation with dithionite, the absorption decayed (data not shown). When the reconstituted monomer was rechromatographed on Superdex-75 in the absence of DTT, the protein eluted as a mixture of fractions of different sizes, including the monomer, dimer and more aggregated structures. Fig. 3 shows such a chromatogram from an experiment in which a monomer preparation, reconstituted with 59Fe was chromatographed. The figure gives the tracing of the protein emerging mainly as dimer and monomer from the column as well as the amount of iron in the protein, calculated from the radioactivity in the fractions. Before chromatography, the protein contained 2.1 Fe/polypeptide. In the chromatogram, the dimer contains approximately 1.5 Fe/polypeptide, i.e. almost a full complement of the cluster, whereas the monomer has lost iron, with values starting at 0.8 Fe at the front of the peak and decreasing to 0.2 Fe at the end. The results indicate that the cluster was tightly bound in the dimer but was lost on dissociation to the monomer during chromatography. A plausible interpretation of these results is that the native small protein is a homodimer with the cluster holding together the two monomers. Further evidence on this point is presented below from EPR experiments. The EPR spectrum recorded at 10K of the iron-sulfur cluster present in the fully reconstituted (2 Fe and 2 S/polypeptide chain) small protein is shown in Fig. 4A. The weak signal, centered at g = 2.03, is characteristic of an oxidized S = 1/2 (3Fe-4S) iron-sulfur cluster. The iron in this cluster represents only 1-5% of the total iron. Treatment with ferricyanide or formate did not change the shape or intensity of the signal. After anaerobic incubation with a 20-fold excess of dithionite, the 3Fe-4S signal disappeared and a new rhombic signal was detected with features at 2.02, 1.92, and 1.88 (Fig. 4B). This signal became more axial (Fig. 4C) when glycerol was omitted during the G25 step after reconstitution of the protein (g = 2.03, 1.92). The signal arises from a S = rapidly relaxing species, detectable only at low temperature. Increasing the temperature to 20K resulted in broadening, with disappearance of the signal above 30K. The power saturation properties of the signal are shown in Fig. 5 and compared to those of well characterized 2Fe-2S and 4Fe-4S centers. Both temperature and power dependence values demonstrate that the EPR active species is a reduced 4Fe-4S cluster and not a 2Fe-2S cluster, as might be suspected from the Fe-polypeptide stoichiometry. Integration of the signal revealed that only 30% of the total iron was present in the EPR active reduced species. However, when a reduced EPR sample was chromatographed anaerobically on Sephadex G25 to separate protein-bound Fe from free Fe, we found that a large amount (from 20 to 50%) of the total iron had dissociated from the protein during reduction. Correcting for this loss, the EPR signal accounts for 50-80% of the remaining protein-bound iron. Combined with the Fe/polypeptide stoichiometry, the EPR results strongly suggest that two polypeptide chains bind one 4Fe-4S cluster. The interaction between the two proteins was studied both by kinetic experiments and by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The enzyme reaction consists of two steps. In the first, the enzyme is activated by generation of the glycyl radical. In the second, the active enzyme reduces CTP to dCTP. Our assay measures the second step. Both steps are carried out in the same anaerobic tube, but CTP is added only after preincubation of the enzyme with the activating system. We chose a preincubation period of 60 min, since this fully activated the enzyme, irrespective of the relative amounts of small and large proteins (data not shown). Addition of increasing amounts of the small protein to various amounts of the large protein generated the results shown in Fig. 6. The system became saturated with respect to the small protein and saturation was achieved later when the amount of the large protein was increased. From the molecular masses of the two proteins (160 kDa for the large and 35 kDa for the small protein) one can calculate that a 2-4-fold molecular excess of the small protein was required for saturation. The results can be explained by a tight but dissociable interaction between the two proteins. In a second experiment we compared the activity of the fully active small protein with its activity before reconstitution. The results of Fig. 7 show that the protein containing the full complement of the FeS center saturates the large protein much more readily than the protein with an iron-deficit. This might indicate that the interaction with the large protein occurs with the dimer of the small protein, since dimer formation is favored by the presence of the iron cluster. To measure the interaction more directly, we turned to sucrose gradient centrifugation, a method that earlier permitted the quantitation of proteins R1 and R2 in the complex of the aerobic reductase(18.Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To overcome the problem posed by the dissociation of the complex during centrifugation, an excess of the 59Fe-labeled small protein was included in the gradient through which the large protein was sedimented. This protein sediments much faster than the small protein and forms the complex during centrifugation. Fig. 8 illustrates such an experiment in which two different amounts of the large protein as well as a blank containing only the small protein were centrifuged. At the end of the centrifugation the complex was found in fractions 6-11, both by protein (Fig. 8A) and radioactivity (Fig. 8B) analyses. The concentration of small protein in each fraction can be calculated directly from radioactivity, since the protein did not lose iron during centrifugation. This was apparent from the finding that the specific radioactivity of the protein in the blank fractions 6-11 was virtually identical with the specific activity of the starting material. The concentration of the large protein was then obtained by subtracting the concentration of small protein from the total protein concentration. To obtain the fraction of bound small protein, the value from the corresponding blank centrifugation tube was subtracted. Table 2 summarizes such calculations for fractions 6-11 for both experiments. The results show a clear 1:1 stoichiometry between the two proteins. Strikingly convincing results were obtained at the higher concentration of the large protein when calculations are less influenced by some of the uncertainties involved in the blank corrections. The complex sediments at a position slightly heavier than that of an aldolase marker (158 kDa), suggesting that it is formed by dimers from each protein.Table 2 Open table in a new tab The small protein of the ribonucleotide reductase has certain structural and functional similarities with the activase involved in the PFL reaction(9.Knappe J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins contain iron and generate a glycyl radical in a second protein with the aid of AdoMet, with similar requirements for NADPH and the flavodoxin system. However, there are also important distinguishing features. The genes for the small and the large proteins are under coordinate control, whereas PFL and its activase are regulated separately. The two reductase proteins bind tightly in an α2β2 complex, whereas binding of the PFL-activase to PFL does not appear to be strong. In addition, the nature of iron seems to be different. The PFL-activase was reported to operate with loosely bound iron, one atom per polypeptide chain(12.Wong K.K. Murray B.W. Lewisch S.A. Baxter M.K. Ridky T.W. Ulissi-DeMario L. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14102-14110Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas we now show that the small protein of the reductase contains a 4Fe-4S center, proposed to link together two polypeptides. As prepared, only a small fraction of the molecules contains the cluster. However, a full complement of 2 Fe and 2 S/polypeptide can be restored to the protein by treatment with ferrous ion and sulfide. EPR spectroscopy of the reduced, reconstructed protein then indicates the presence of a 4Fe-4S. Taken together with the stoichiometry of 2 Fe/polypeptide, this suggests that the iron cluster is bound by cysteines from both polypeptides. A precedence for the location of an FeS cluster at the interface of two polypeptide chains is provided by the Fe protein of nitrogenase(19.Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 92: 2499-2503Google Scholar). The original concept of an activase implied a catalytically acting protein that introduces a structural change in a second protein, leading to its activation. In the case of the ribonucleotide reductase, it seems more appropriate to view the small protein as an integral component of the enzyme. The function of this protein is probably related to radical generation from AdoMet. However, more work is required on this point. A tight interaction between the two proteins is apparent already from previous work(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, we employed sucrose gradient centrifugation to demonstrate the formation of a 1:1 complex between dimers of the two proteins. It was necessary to centrifuge the large protein in a gradient containing an excess of of small protein to counteract dissociation. The kinetic experiments also speak for a tight interaction between the two proteins and suggest that the two proteins are bound together in a dissociating system that represents the active enzyme. In the absence of the large protein, the small protein apparently occurs in a dimer-monomer equilibrium in solution. When the protein was chromatographed in the absence of DTT both species were recovered, but only the dimer contained some iron and sulfide, albeit in substoichiometric amounts. This is in accord with the idea that the cluster is bound by cysteines from both polypeptides. DTT was able to stabilize the binding of iron to the monomeric protein, apparent from the relatively high iron content in the monomer in the presence of DTT. It seems possible that under those circumstances the SH-groups of DTT help to anchor the cluster to the protein. Such preparations could also be fully reconstituted by treatment with iron and sulfide. The fact that, during chromatography of the reconstituted monomer on Superdex-75, both the dimer and the monomer were recovered and that the monomer had lost its iron again argues for the necessity of an interaction between the two polypeptides to maintain a stable cluster. We reported earlier that the large protein prepared from bacteria overproducing both the large and the small proteins contains a 3Fe-4S cluster(20.Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later work showed that such preparations contained some tightly bound small protein(7.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2443-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With the demonstration of a 4Fe-4S cluster in the small protein, the question now arises whether the 3Fe-4S cluster might have been present in the contaminating protein as a degradation product of the 4Fe-4S cluster. When we now prepare the large protein from bacteria lacking a functioning gene for the small protein, iron is no longer present in the active large protein. The simplest explanation for these results is that only the small protein contains an iron-sulfur center, and that this center is a 4Fe-4S cluster. However, more complicated explanations cannot be excluded and these are being explored experimentally. The following model summarizes our present concept concerning the structure and function of the anaerobic E. coli ribonucleotide reductase. The enzyme is a heterodimer with an α2β2 structure, containing two identical polypeptides of each of the large and the small proteins, with the peptides of the small protein held together by a 4Fe-4S center. The principle of its quaternary structure is thus identical to that of class I enzymes and differs from class II enzymes that have an α or α2 structure(1.Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Because of the structural similarity with the PFL activase, it seems likely, but remains to be proven, that the small protein interacts with AdoMet to generate a transient radical, which subsequently generates the stable radical on Gly-681 of the large protein. This radical then participates in the catalytic process, possibly via a transient thiyl radical(21.Stubbe J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

In this study we examined the expression of the ob gene in a dietary model in which moderate obesity develops in response to fat (58% of calories from fat) without mutation of the ob gene, and in four genetic models of obesity in mice: ob/ob, db/db, tubby, and fat. Several white and brown adipose depots were examined (epididymal, subcutaneous, perirenal, and interscapular). Northern blot analysis shows that levels of ob mRNA are increased in all adipose depots examined in every model of obesity. The average fold increases were 12.0 ± 2.1 (ob/ob), 4.8 ± 1.5 (db/db), 2.8 ± 0.1 (tubby), 2.4 ± 0.3 (fat), and 2.1 ± 0.2 (high fat diet-induced A/J). Moreover, we found that the expression of the ob gene could be manipulated by pharmacologically blocking the development of diet-induced obesity. Supplementation of a high fat diet with a β3-adrenergic receptor agonist (CL316,243) prevented obesity, but not hyperphagia associated with high fat feeding (body weights of high fat-fed A/J mice = 34.0 ± 1.0 g; high fat plus CL316,243-fed mice = 26.8 ± 0.5 g; n = 10). CL316,243-treated, high fat-fed animals contained levels of ob mRNA in all adipose depots that were equal to or less than levels in low fat-fed mice (average levels in high fat plus CL316,243-fed mice relative to low fat-fed mice: 0.93 ± 0.09).

The transcriptional regulation of SMT in phytosterol biosynthesis is discussed. In plants, the dominant sterols are 24-alkyl sterols. Sterols such as cholesterol which are nonmethylated at C-24 are only present in low amounts. It has been suggested that sterols may have two distinct functions in higher plants (Haughan et al., 1988), as has been found for fungi (Ramgopal and Bloch, 1983; Rodriguez and Parks, 1983; Nes and Heupel, 1986). The first is as a structural component of membranes, a function which requires relatively large amounts of sterols. The second function is related to cell proliferation; trace amounts of 24-alkyl sterols such as stigmasterol are required for cell growth to proceed (Haughan et al., 1988). 24-Alkyl sterols also serve as precursors to steroid growth regulators such as brassinosteroids (Ikekawa, 1991). Biosynthesis of 24-alkyl phytosterols can be divided into two stages: conversion of acetate to cycloartenol and transformation of cycloartenol to 24-alkyl sterols. The transformation of cycloartenol to 24-alkyl sterols includes four steps: alkylation of the Δ24-bond in the side chain, removal of methyl groups at C-4 and C-14, isomerization of the cyclopropyl group into a Δ8(9)-double bond, and rearrangement of the Δ8(9) to Δ5 (Benveniste, 1986). The transmethylation of the Δ24-double bond in the cycloartenol side chain is catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyltransferase (SMT). 1The abbreviations used are: SMTS-adenosyl-L-methionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyltransferaseAdoMetS-adenosylmethioninebpbase pair(s)GC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Although several outcomes are possible for the methylation reaction, 24(28)-methylene cycloartanol appears to be the kinetically favored product in most, if not all, higher plants (Misso and Goad, 1983; Scheid at al., 1982; Nes et al., 1993; Guo et al., 1995) (Fig. 1). The C-24 methylation step has been implicated as a rate-limiting step in sterol transformations (Guo et al., 1995; Fang and Baisted, 1975; Parker and Nes, 1992; Nes et al., 1991a, 1991b; Chappell et al., 1995). In animals, instead of a C-24 methylation in the side chain of cycloartenol, a reduction of the Δ24-double bond in the side chain of lanosterol takes place, leading to cholesterol biosynthesis. S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyltransferase S-adenosylmethionine base pair(s) gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The SMT is a membrane-bound enzyme and has been localized in the endoplasmic reticulum in plant cells (Hartmann-Bouillon and Benveniste, 1978). The enzyme recognizes the sterols with a free 3β-hydroxyl group, a Δ24-double bond, and the flat conformation that mimics the three-dimensional shape of cycloartenol and catalyzes their methylation at C-24 position in in vitro assay (Nes et al., 1991a; Rahier et al., 1984). So far, no SMT has been purified to homogeneity. Our knowledge on this enzyme is based on in vivo studies on plants fed with radiotracers and stable isotopes (Guo et al., 1995), and in vitro studies using microsomal preparations as enzyme source (Misso and Goad, 1983; Scheid et al., 1982; Nes et al., 1991a). Cloning of the plant SMT genes and characterization of the gene products would provide an alternative approach to address some of the important questions on SMT such as the C-24 methylation mechanism and developmental regulation of the enzyme. Earlier studies indicated that the yeast ERG6 gene probably encodes an SMT (McCammon at al., 1984; Gaber et al., 1989). Mutations in ERG6 locus, arising from mutagenesis or gene replacement, partially or totally abolished SMT activity and 24-alkyl sterol production in yeast cells. However, SMT activity of the ERG6 gene product has not been documented. No plant SMT gene has been cloned previously. Reported here is the isolation of a cDNA encoding SMT from soybean. The polypeptide encoded by the soybean cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to be an active SMT enzyme. The expression of the SMT transcript was found to be developmentally regulated, and suppressed following elicitor treatment. Transcriptional regulation of SMT in sterol biosynthesis is discussed. Lanosterol and desmosterol were obtained from Sigma. The lanosterol (catalog number L-5768) was purified by TLC before use in the SMT assay. [methyl-3H]S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) (83.3 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St Louis, MO). Cell suspension cultures of soybean, cultivar Harosoy, were maintained in SH medium (Schenk and Hildebrandt, 1972) and subcultured weekly. After 40 h of subculture, yeast elicitor was added at 50 μg of Glu equivalent of yeast cell wall hydrolysate per milliliter of soybean cell cultures. The cells were harvested by filtration, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Yeast elicitor was prepared as described previously (Schumacher et al., 1987). A cDNA clone, Spm482, has been isolated from a soybean cDNA library in a previous study (Shi et al., 1995). To identify this clone, the coding region was modified by insertion of a 24-bp fragment, which encodes the FLAG epitope (Kodak/IBI), preceding the ATG start codon. The chimeric cDNA was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using a T7 primer and a primer which contained an NheI site, the FLAG sequence (underlined), and a 28-bp matched sequence (5′-GTATGGCTAGCGGATCCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATCGAAACG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NheI and the NheI fragment (including the FLAG sequence and the first 24-amino acid coding sequence of the soybean cDNA) was used to replace the corresponding region of the cDNA coding sequence. The resultant FLAG-tagged cDNA was inserted into the E. coli expression vector pRSET (Invitrogen) at its NheI and KpnI sites downstream of the phage T7 promoter, and the resultant plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain JM109. Expression of the recombinant gene in E. coli was induced by infection with the recombinant M13 strain expressing the T7 polymerase (referred to as M13/T7 phage) in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells (30 ml culture) were harvested 4 h after M13/T7 phage infection and the cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and then sonicated three times each for 20 s. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected as a crude extract, divided into 200-μl aliquots (2 μg of protein/μl), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Transformed E. coli cells that were neither induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside nor infected by M13/T7 served as a negative control for expression of the fusion protein. Expression of the FLAG-tagged soybean polypeptide was examined by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI). SMT activity was assayed as described previously (Scheid et al., 1982; Nes et al., 1991a). The reaction mixture (220 μl) contained 200 μl of crude extract prepared from transformed E. coli cells, 80 μM [methyl-3H]AdoMet (diluted with unlabeled AdoMet to make 3 × 105 dpm/reaction), 100 μM lanosterol, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80. Incubation was conducted at 30°C for 60 min and stopped by adding 1 volume of 6% KOH in ethanol. The mixture was extracted with hexane (3 × 3 ml). After evaporation of the solvent under nitrogen gas, the radioactivity of the residue was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The sterol content of the hexane extracts were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G plates (250 μm; J. T. Baker) and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with a HP-5890 mass detector equipped with a 25-μm HP-1701 capillary column. The GC was operated from 130°C to 280°C (15°C min−1), then held at 280°C for another 15 min. Genomic DNA was isolated from etiolated soybean seedlings (White and Kaper, 1989). Total RNA was isolated from various soybean tissues (Logemann et al., 1987) and cultured cells (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). DNA and RNA gel blot hybridizations were conducted at 65°C as described by Church and Gilbert(1984). Probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Prime-a-gene system (Promega). DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method. A Taq Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. The products were separated electrophoretically and the data were processed by an ABI373A automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). DNA and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed using the PC/Gene programs (Intelligenetics, Inc., CA). In a previous study, a cDNA expression library in λ Uni-ZAPII, constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of etiolated soybean hypocotyls, was screened using an anti-(plasma membrane) serum produced against purified soybean plasma membranes. Positive clones obtained in the immunoscreening were classified into 40 groups based on partial sequence analysis and data base search for homology (Shi et al., 1995). One group, including one clone Spm482, showed high similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG6 gene at its 3′-terminal. The cDNA clone Spm482 contained a 1.5-kilobase insert (Fig. 2). A 1101-bp open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 367 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 41.5 kDa. The DNA sequence upstream of the proposed ATG translation initiation codon contains four stop codons within the translation frame. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed no potential membrane-spanning sequence. The polypeptide was classified as a peripheral protein (with a P:I odds value 580.7) using the PC/Gene program SOAP (Klein et al., 1985). A data base search revealed similarity of the polypeptide encoded by the soybean cDNA to several known methyltransferases, such as Herpetosiphon giganteus cytosine-specific DNA-methyltransferase (P25265), Rhodobacter sphaeroides phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (Q05197), Streptomyces sp. aklanonic acid methyltransferase (L35154), and Rattus norvegicus dihydroxypolyprenylbenzoate methyltransferase (L20427). Further sequence comparison revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence contained three methyltransferase sequence motifs identified in diverse S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases (Fig. 3). The three motifs were arranged in the same order on the soybean polypeptide chain as on other methyltransferases and the amino acid sequences separating the three motifs had comparable length as those in other methyltransferases. Motif I was highly conserved in the soybean protein. The motif II in the soybean protein contained the invariant central aspartate residue. The conserved aromatic amino acid phenylalanine and tyrosine were found at positions −1 and +3 with respect to the central aspartate, as in other methyltransferases. The motif III was located at an interval of 19 residues C-terminal to motif II. The first half of this region was well conserved and the central glycine residue was present. However, the other half of the region did not match with the consensus described by Kagan and Clarke(1994). The presence of the three sequence motifs of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases suggests that the soybean cDNA may encode an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase. The yeast ERG6 gene product is the most closely related sequence to the soybean polypeptide in current protein data bases (Hardwick and Pelham, 1994). Overall, the two sequences share 47.1% amino acid identity. It has been suggested, but not yet proven, that the yeast ERG6 is the structural gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyltransferase (McCammon at al., 1984; Gaber et al., 1989). The high identity of amino acid sequence between the soybean protein and the yeast ERG6 gene product indicated that the soybean cDNA may encode an S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyltransferase. The cDNA was therefore designated as SMT1. While the deduced amino acid sequence of the soybean SMT1 cDNA suggests that it may encode an S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyltransferase, we sought direct biochemical evidence for its identification. A plasmid carrying the FLAG-epitope tagged cDNA under control of the T7 promoter was introduced into E. coli cells. Immunoblot analysis of extracts of induced E. coli cells using an anti-FLAG antibody revealed high levels of expression of the epitope-tagged fusion protein (Fig. 4). When SMT activity was tested under standard assay conditions with [methyl-3H]AdoMet as methyl group donor and lanosterol as acceptor, the crude extract of transformed E. coli cells catalyzed the formation of a radioactive product with an enzyme specific activity of 17.6 pmol/min/mg protein. The radioactive metabolite co-migrated with lanosterol on TLC plates developed with CH2Cl2 (two runs), as expected. No SMT activity was found when lanosterol was omitted from incubation mixtures. Extracts prepared from transformed E. coli cells that were not induced for expression of the soybean SMT1 protein did not show SMT activity. Incubation buffer only or boiled E. coli extracts served as negative controls. It has been reported that plant SMT can methylate a variety of Δ24-sterols, such as cycloartenol, lanosterol, and desmosterol, at the C-24 position in in vitro assay (Scheid et al., 1982; Nes et al., 1991a). SMT activity of the crude extract of the transformed E. coli expressing the soybean protein was also assayed using desmosterol as substrate. In the incubation condition of 50 μM desmosterol and 50 μM [methyl-3H]AdoMet (130,000 cpm/reaction), the extracts of the transformed E. coli cells showed an SMT specific activity of 4.8 pmol/min/mg protein. The product from the incubation of transformed E. coli cell lysates with lanosterol and AdoMet was analyzed using GC-MS. A peak corresponding to a more polar compound than lanosterol was detected in samples prepared from reaction mixtures containing the extracts of induced E. coli cells, as shown in Fig. 5. The peak was absent in samples prepared from reaction mixtures containing the extracts of uninduced E. coli cells. The metabolite has a molecular mass of 440 (the substrate lanosterol molecular mass is 426). Examination of the mass spectrum of the metabolite indicated that the methylation of lanosterol did not occur in the sterol nucleus. In the side chain of lanosterol, the only potential methylation site is the Δ24 -double bond (Fig. 1). Transmethylation of the double bond catalyzed by SMT could produce 24(28)-methylene-24,25-dihydrolanosterol and Δ23-24-methyl lanosterol (Scheid et al., 1982). This reaction could also produce Δ25-24-methyl lanosterol (Misso and Goad, 1983). These compounds differ in the position of a double bond in the side chain and have similar mass spectra. The mass spectrum of the metabolite (Fig. 5C) was compared with that of 24(28)-methylene-24,25-dihydrolanosterol methylation (Nes et al., 1991a). The mass spectra of the two compounds were identical except for two minor peaks at m/z 384 and m/z 399 atomic mass units that were missing in the mass spectrum of the metabolite, possibly due to low levels of signals. Although we cannot identify the double bond location in the side chain of the methylated lanosterol based on mass spectrum, methylation at the C-24 position in the lanosterol side chain is demonstrated. Therefore, it was concluded that the soybean cDNA SMT1 encodes the S-adenosylL-methionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyltransferase. To estimate the number of SMT genes in the soybean genome, total genomic DNA was digested with a variety of restriction enzymes and analyzed by DNA gel blot hybridization. Using a probe consisting of the entire SMT1 cDNA, multiple bands of hybridization were obtained at high stringency, as shown in Fig. 6. The restriction enzymes EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, and XhoI do not cut the SMT1 cDNA. BglII cuts once at nucleotide 993. The genomic DNA was also hybridized with probes derived from the 5′-end (nucleotide 15-207, including the 147-bp noncoding sequence and 45-bp coding sequence) and 3′-end (nucleotide 1198-1504, including the 243-bp noncoding sequence and 63-bp coding sequence) of the SMT1 cDNA (Fig. 6, B and C). The pattern of hybridization suggested that the soybean genome contains additional sequence(s) which shares similarity to the SMT1 cDNA. The tissue distribution of SMT transcripts was examined through RNA gel blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, transcript levels of SMT in vegetative tissues were higher in young seedlings than in mature plants; the difference being more pronounced in roots. In plants with pods, growing leaves had higher levels of expression than old leaves. Flowers had the highest levels of expression. Expression of SMT transcripts was very low in immature seeds and young pods. Elicitors prepared from fungal and plant cell walls induce a variety of responses in plants such as activation of defense genes, accumulation of phytoalexins, and lignification of cell walls (Dixon and Lamb, 1990). It has been reported that elicitor treatment suppresses sterol biosynthesis in parsley, potato, tobacco, and Tabernaemontana divaricata (Vögeli and Chappell, 1988; Haudenschild and Hartmann, 1995; Brindle et al., 1988; van der Heijden et al., 1989). The possible effect of elicitor treatment on sterol biosynthesis in soybean cell suspension cultures was examined by monitoring the steady state SMT transcript levels. Elicitor treatment resulted in a suppression of SMT transcript detectable within 2 h, with the lowest levels of transcript occurring 6 h after treatment (Fig. 8). The suppression was transient and transcript expression gradually increased 6 h after treatment. Identification of the soybean SMT1 cDNA was accomplished using both molecular and biochemical criteria. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the SMT1 cDNA revealed three conserved regions found in S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases. The methyltransferase motifs may contribute to the binding of the substrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine and/or the product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (Kagan and Clarke, 1994). The high identity of deduced amino acid sequences in the entire length between the soybean cDNA and the putative yeast SMT structural gene ERG6 suggested that the soybean cDNA might also encode SMT. This supposition was confirmed by expression of the cDNA in E. coli. Extracts from transformed bacteria had C-24 methylation activity on lanosterol. Although the natural substrate of plant SMT is cycloartenol, SMT can use lanosterol and other related sterols as methyl group acceptors in in vitro assays (Scheid et al., 1982; Nes et al., 1991a). Therefore, showing SMT activity on lanosterol provides biochemical evidence for positive identification of the soybean cDNA. Genomic DNA hybridization analysis indicates that the soybean genome may contain additional sequence(s) with similarity to the cloned SMT1 cDNA. Soybean is believed to be a diploidized tetraploid generated from an allotetraploid ancestor (Hymowitz and Singh, 1987). Duplicated DNA sequences occur widely in the soybean genome (Zhu et al., 1994). However, whether the additional genomic sequence(s) encode an active SMT enzyme remains to be studied. Alternatively, these sequences may represent unrelated gene segments. The soybean SMT1 was cloned by immunoscreening a cDNA expression library using an anti-(plasma membrane) serum. It has been shown that plant SMT is localized in endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Hartmann-Bouillon and Benveniste, 1978) and yeast SMT is associated with lipid particles (Zinser et al., 1993). However, recognition of the soybean SMT by anti-(plasma membrane) serum may not necessarily indicate the association of SMT with plasma membranes. It is more likely that the plasma membrane preparation used for raising antibodies contained some contaminating endoplasmic reticulum membranes, since the plasma membranes prepared by aqueous-polymer two-phase partitioning only have a purity of about 95% (Shi et al., 1995 and Refs. contained therein). Transcript levels of the soybean SMT were found to be regulated developmentally. Young roots, leaves, and stems had higher levels of steady state SMT transcripts as compared with those of mature tissues such as old leaves and roots of the plants with pods, reflecting a high rate of sterol biosynthesis in the growing vegetative tissues. These results agree with previous reports that the growing soybean vegetative tissues (shoots and roots) have very high sterol content on the basis of dry weight (Fenner et al., 1986). These results are also consistent with the observation that old leaves accumulate much more cycloartenol than young leaves do in transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (Chappell et al., 1995). High expression of SMT transcript was detected in soybean flowers, indicating active synthesis of sterols in flowers. Young pods and immature seeds had very low levels of SMT transcripts. It has been reported that soybean seeds have the highest sterol concentration on the basis of dry weight and total lipids shortly after pollination and sterol concentration then steadily decreases during seed development and maturation (Katayama and Katoh, 1973; Kajimoto et al., 1982). The low levels of SMT transcripts in immature seeds found in this study may indicate a low rate of sterol biosynthesis in soybean seeds during maturation. Biochemical and in vivo radiolabeling studies have suggested that SMT is a rate-limiting enzyme and may regulate the biosynthesis of 24-alkyl sterols (Guo et al., 1995; Fang and Baisted, 1975; Parker and Nes, 1992; Nes et al., 1991a, 1991b). Recently, it has been shown that transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase accumulate a large amount of cycloartenol, providing further evidence for the role of SMT in the regulation of phytosterol biosynthesis (Chappell et al., 1995). In this study, analysis of SMT transcript implicates the possibility of transcriptional control of SMT in regulating sterol biosynthesis. The transcript of SMT was highly expressed in the growing soybean vegetative tissues where sterol biosynthesis is very active (Fenner et al., 1986). Low levels of SMT transcript expression was associated with low levels of sterol content on the basis of dry weight in immature soybean seeds (Katayama and Katoh, 1973; Kajimoto et al., 1982). Furthermore, suppression of SMT transcripts was observed in soybean cell suspension cultures treated with elicitor. Suppression of sterol biosynthesis and alteration of sterol composition caused by elicitor treatment and pathogen infection have been demonstrated in various plants such as maize, parsley, potato, tobacco, and T. divaricata (Vögeli and Chappell, 1988; Haudenschild and Hartmann, 1995; Brindle et al., 1988; van der Heijden et al., 1989; Jennings et al., 1970). The Δ24-double bond transmethylation catalyzed by the SMT could produce several products with a double bond at various positions. The kinetically favored outcome of the reaction appears to be a 24(28)-sterol in maize and sunflower (Misso and Goad, 1983; Scheid et al., 1982; Nes et al., 1993; Guo et al., 1995). It has been proposed that a single SMT may be responsible for the production of three C-24-methylated cycloartenol [24(28)-methylene cycloartanol, Δ23-24-methyl cycloartenol, and Δ25-24β-methyl cycloartenol] in the C-24 methylation reaction, and the product distribution may result from kinetic, thermodynamic, and allosteric control mechanisms acting on the development of the enzyme-substrate complex and subsequent catalysis (Janssen and Nes, 1992). At the present time, mechanism of the C-24 methylation is poorly understood, partially due to lack of knowledge of SMT protein structure. The availability of SMT cDNA and active SMT enzyme expressed in E. coli will permit the establishment of the SMT protein structure. This might prove useful in elucidating the interactions of enzyme, AdoMet, and sterol substrate, and the C-24 methylation process.

Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysine in -X-Lys-Gly- sequences in collagens and other proteins with collagen-like sequences. The hydroxylysine residues have two important functions.

The 2-oxoglutarate binding site can be divided into distinct subsites: subsite I probably consists of a positively charged side chain of the enzyme which binds the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate, and subsite II consists of two cis-positioned coordination sites of the enzyme-bound Fe2+ which is chelated by the C-1-C-2 moiety(1.Kivirikko K.I.

The O2 is thought to be bound end-on in an axial position, and the subsequent decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate is assumed to lead to the formation of a ferryl ion, which hydroxylates a lysine residue (1.Kivirikko K.I.

A search for conserved residues within the sequences of several 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases and a related dioxygenase, isopenicillin N synthase, which also requires Fe2+, O2, and ascorbate, indicated a weak homology within two histidine-containing motifs spaced about 50-70 amino acids apart and termed His-1 and His-2 motifs(19.Myllylä R.

Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies on the α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase have demonstrated that conversion of either of the two conserved histidines present in these motifs to serine inactivates the enzyme completely, suggesting that these residues provide two of the three Fe2+-binding ligands in prolyl 4-hydroxylase(20.Lamberg A.

Furthermore, determination of the crystal structure of isopenicillin N synthase indicated that two of the Fe2+-binding ligands in this enzyme are the two histidines present in the His-1 and His-2 motifs; the third ligand is an aspartate residue present in position +2 with respect to the histidine in the His-1 motif(21.Roach P.L.

The mutagenesis steps were performed in a pBluescript vector containing the full-length cDNA for human lysyl hydroxylase(13.Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis was carried out using an oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system based on the unique site elimination procedure (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), after which the plasmid was digested with EagI and EcoRI, the resulting fragment was cloned to pVL1392, and the recombinant viruses were generated as above. The sequences were verified by Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing (24.Sanger K. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52150) Google Scholar). The insect cells (Sf9 or High Five, Invitrogen) were cultured as monolayers at 27°C in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells seeded at a density 5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate were infected at a multiplicity of 5 with any of the viruses coding for the wild-type lysyl hydroxylase or a mutant type. The cells were harvested 24-72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02 M phosphate, pH 7.4, and frozen at −20°C. The frozen cell pellets were suspended and homogenized in a 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 M glycine, and 0.02 M Tris buffer, pH 7.8 (termed Nonidet P-40 buffer), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The insoluble pellets were further homogenized in a 50% glycerol, 0.6 M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 M glycine, 100 μM dithiothreitol, and 0.06 M Tris buffer, pH 7.8 (glycerol buffer), incubated on ice for 30-60 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions or nondenaturing 8% PAGE and assayed for lysyl hydroxylase activity. The remaining pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS and also analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Lysyl hydroxylase activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate(25.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Km values were determined as described previously (26.Puistola U. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T.M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 611: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and protein concentrations with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The levels of expression of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were compared by densitometry of the Coomassie-stained bands in SDS-PAGE using a BioImage instrument (BioImage, Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed using a monoclonal antibody against the purified denatured human lysyl hydroxylase. A baculovirus coding for human lysyl hydroxylase was generated and used to infect High Five cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40 buffer, see “Materials and Methods”), and centrifuged. The cell pellet was homogenized further in a buffer containing 50% glycerol, 0.6 M NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (glycerol buffer, see “Materials and Methods”), incubated on ice, and centrifuged. Finally, the remaining pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1). The infected cells were found to possess large quantities of a new 85-kDa polypeptide, but little, if any, of this protein could be extracted with the Nonidet P-40 buffer (Fig. 1, lanes 4). Various means of extracting the enzyme were therefore tested. These included sonication, repeated freezing and thawing, and the use of buffers containing high salt concentrations and various detergents (details not shown). Use of a buffer containing 50% glycerol, 0.6 M NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 was found to be the best method of solubilizing the enzyme among all those tested (Fig. 1, lanes 5). This buffer solubilized about 10% of the enzyme produced during the 72 h, the remaining 90% being found in samples solubilized with 1% SDS (Fig. 1, lanes 6). Repeated extractions with the glycerol buffer solubilized only insignificant amounts of additional enzyme. Use of the Nonidet P-40 buffer before the glycerol buffer solubilized large amounts of other proteins, as the protein concentration in the Nonidet P-40 extracts was usually about 0.2 mg/106 cells, whereas the concentration in the glycerol extracts was 0.1-0.15 mg/106 cells. Densitometric tracing of the Coomassie-stained bands in the glycerol extracts suggested that lysyl hydroxylase represented about 30% of the protein in these extracts, i.e. about 30-50 μg/106 cells. Because this soluble enzyme represented about 10% of the total enzyme synthesized, the level of lysyl hydroxylase production appeared to be very high, up to 300-500 μg/106 cells. Additional experiments demonstrated that the level of production in the Sf9 cells is only about 10% of that obtained in the High Five cells (details not shown). To study the time course of the appearance of lysyl hydroxylase in High Five cells, the cells were infected with the virus coding for the enzyme and harvested up to 72 h after infection. After homogenization and extractions, aliquots of the samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 2). Lysyl hydroxylase could be detected in SDS-PAGE at 32 h after infection, about 90% of the enzyme being soluble in the glycerol buffer (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3). The amount of enzyme in both the glycerol buffer extract and the 1% SDS soluble portion increased up to about 64-72 h, but the increase in the enzyme that was insoluble in the glycerol buffer was much larger than that in the soluble enzyme, so that about half of the total enzyme was soluble at 40 h (Fig. 2, lanes 4), whereas only about 10% was soluble at 72 h (Fig. 2, lanes 7). The catalytic activity was measured with an assay based on hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate with the synthetic peptide L-1 (Ala-Arg-Gly-Ile-Lys-Gly-Ile-Arg-Gly-Phe-Ser-Gly) as a substrate(25.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 27.Kivirikko K.I. Shudo K. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A significant level of enzyme activity could already be detected 24 h after infection, the highest activity level being seen at 64 h (Table 1).Table 1 Open table in a new tab Km values were determined for Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate, and the peptide substrate with the glycerol buffer extract as a source for the enzyme (Table 2). The values were found to be very similar to those reported for lysyl hydroxylase from human placental tissue (28.Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T.M. Puistola U. Kivirikko K.I. Collagen Relat. Res. 1981; 1: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and chick embryos (26.Puistola U. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T.M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. Biochim. Biophys.

These included all five histidines present within the highly conserved 76-amino acid region close to the COOH terminus of the polypeptide (residues 639-715), which contains the His-1 and His-2 motifs(13.Hautala T.

J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The only histidine present in the other highly conserved region (residues 226-286) was likewise subjected to mutation. All of these mutants were expressed in High Five cells. The cells were harvested 48 h after infection and homogenized and extracted as above. The proteins soluble in glycerol buffer were then analyzed by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions and by SDS-PAGE, and aliquots of the extracts were used to assay lysyl hydroxylase activity and protein content. None of the mutations was found to inhibit the formation of the enzyme dimer and its polymeric forms (1.Kivirikko K.I. Myllyl ä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar) when studied by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions (details not shown). No differences were found in the mobilities of the various mutant polypeptides in SDS-PAGE, and only minor ones were found in the amounts of the enzyme in the glycerol buffer extracts as judged from the intensities of the Coomassie-stained bands (Fig. 4). These bands were studied by densitometry in each experiment, and the values obtained were used to correct the enzyme activities of the various mutants to the expression level of the wild-type enzyme. In the vast majority of cases this correction was less than ±20%.Figure 4:SDS-PAGE analysis of the expression of wild-type or histidine to serine mutant lysyl hydroxylases in High Five cells.

These three thus included the two histidines (19.Myllylä R. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggested by sequence comparisons as possible iron-binding ligands, residues 656 and 708, and a histidine closely flanking residue 708. Mutation of the two additional histidines present in the conserved COOH-terminal region, residues 657 (located at position +1 with respect to histidine 656 and −1 with respect to aspartate 658, see below) and 700, also had a marked effect in that mutation of the former reduced the enzyme activity to about 10% and the latter to 6% (Table 3). Nevertheless, these two mutations did not inactivate the enzyme completely. In addition, mutation of the conserved histidine 517 reduced the enzyme activity to about 10%, whereas mutation of three other conserved histidines, residues 88, 241 (located within a highly conserved region), and 536, had a much more minor effect (Table 3). Mutation of any of the three nonconserved histidines included in this study had either no effect (residue His-225) or reduced the enzyme activity to about 40% (His-474) or 50% (His-613) (Table 3). The Km values were determined for Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, and the peptide substrate for all histidine mutant lysyl hydroxylases that were not completely inactive. These values were found to be identical to those with the wild-type enzyme (details not shown).Table 3 Open table in a new tab Five aspartates, three of which are conserved between the human (13.Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and chick (15.Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Pajunen L. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2805-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequences (underlined in Fig. 3), were converted individually to alanine, and the mutant polypeptides were expressed in High Five cells and analyzed 48 h after infection as described for the histidine mutants. No differences were found in the formation of the enzyme dimer and its polymeric forms or the mobilities of the various mutant polypeptides, and only very minor differences were found in their expression levels (details not shown). Mutation of aspartate 658, the residue corresponding to the Fe2+-binding aspartate of isopenicillin N synthase (see the Introduction), appeared to inactivate the lysyl hydroxylase completely (Table 4). Mutation of either of the other two conserved aspartates included in this study reduced the enzyme activity to about 70% (Asp-648) or 40% (Asp-674) of the control value, whereas mutation of the nonconserved Asp-491 consistently increased the enzyme activity to about 170%, and mutation of the other nonconserved Asp-638 (glutamate in the chick sequence) decreased the activity to about 35% (Table 4). As in the cases of the histidine mutations (above), none of the four aspartate mutations (excluding Asp-658) altered the Km values of the enzyme (details not shown).Table 4 Open table in a new tab The human polypeptide contains four potential N-glycosylation sites(13.Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the second through the fourth of these being conserved in the chick enzyme(15.Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Pajunen L. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2805-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the carbohydrate units may be needed for maximal enzyme activity, as treatment of lysyl hydroxylase with endoglucosidase H has been found to reduce the catalytic activity to 40-60%(12.Myllylä R. Pajunen L. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All four of these asparagines were converted individually to glutamines, and the mutant polypeptides were expressed and analyzed as above. Two asparagine mutations, those involving residues 197 and 538, eliminated the enzyme band in SDS-PAGE with the lowest mobility (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5), whereas mutation of asparagines 163 or 686 had no distinct effect on the mobility (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). This suggests that only two of the four potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-197 and Asn-538) are effectively glycosylated, and thus the multiple bands seen with the wild-type enzyme may mainly correspond to a diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and nonglycosylated polypeptide. Mutation of the glycosylated Asn-197 decreased the enzyme activity to about 25%, whereas mutation of the other glycosylated Asn-538 or the probably nonglycosylated Asn-163 had no effect on enzyme activity (Table 5). Mutation of the probably nonglycosylated Asn-686 decreased the enzyme activity to about 40% (Table 5), suggesting that a glutamine in this position may have some negative effects, possibly because this residue is larger than asparagine.Table 5 Open table in a new tab The present data indicate that an active human lysyl hydroxylase can be produced by baculovirus vectors and that the Km values of the recombinant enzyme for its peptide substrate and cosubstrates are essentially identical to those of the enzyme isolated from vertebrate tissues. Although about 90% of the enzyme produced during the first 32 h of infection could be extracted with the glycerol buffer, about 90% of the enzyme produced during a 72-h infection was in an insoluble form. The level of lysyl hydroxylase production in the High Five cells was exceptionally high compared with those of most proteins in insect cells(29.Kidd M. Emery V.C. Appl. Biochem. Biotech. 1993; 42: 137-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and thus one reason for the insolubility may simply be the large quantity of enzyme produced. Lysyl hydroxylase is a luminally oriented peripheral membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum(30.Kellokumpu S. Sormunen R. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30524-30529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its complete solubilization from tissues is difficult and requires the use of a high salt buffer containing detergents(25.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). These properties of the enzyme may have contributed to its conversion to an insoluble form. In spite of the solubility problems, large amounts of the enzyme could be extracted with the glycerol buffer, and the quantity of enzyme in this extract 48 h after infection appeared to vary only within narrow limits. The human lysyl hydroxylase polypeptide has 27 histidines, 23 of which are conserved between the human and chick sequences(13.Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As it did not seem feasible to mutate all 27 histidines, residues were selected for this purpose in such a way that all five histidines present in the highly conserved COOH-terminal region and the only histidine present in the other conserved region (residues 226-286) were included. The additional residues selected consisted of three further conserved histidines and three nonconserved histidines. This meant that a large percentage of the histidine mutations could be expected to have major effects on catalytic activity. Three histidine to serine mutations were found to inactivate lysyl hydroxylase completely. These included residues 656 and 708, previously suggested by sequence comparisons as the key residues in the His-1 and His-2 motifs(19.Myllylä R. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As the results of recent mutagenesis studies on the α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (20.Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and crystal structure determination of isopenicillin N synthase (21.Roach P.L. Clifton I.J. Fülöp V. Harlos K. Barton G.J. Hadju J. Andersson I. Schofield C.J. Baldwin J.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) have suggested that the corresponding residues in the His-1 and His-2 motifs of these enzymes (19.Myllylä R. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) provide two of the three Fe2+-binding ligands, it seems very likely that histidines 656 and 708 have a similar function in lysyl hydroxylase. The function of the third critical histidine, residue 706, remains to be established. Mutation of three additional histidines also had a major effect, although none of these mutations inactivated the enzyme completely. One of these histidines, residue 657, is located between two of the suggested Fe2+-binding residues, His-656 and Asp-658 (see below), and it is thus not surprising that this mutation had a major effect. His-700 is located in the highly conserved COOH-terminal domain, whereas His-517 is located within a much less well conserved region. Mutation of the three further conserved histidines and the three nonconserved histidines included in this study had much more minor effects. One of the five aspartate to alanine mutations (residue 658) differed distinctly from the other four in that it inactivated the enzyme completely. This aspartate is located at position +2 with respect to His-656 in the His-1 motif. As an aspartate present in a corresponding position in the His-1 motif of isopenicillin N synthase provides the third Fe2+-binding ligand in that enzyme, it seems very likely that the three Fe2+-binding ligands in human lysyl hydroxylase are histidines 656 and 708 and aspartate 658. Data on the four asparagine to glutamine mutations suggest that only two of the four potential N-glycosylation sites present in the human polypeptide may be effectively used in vivo, at least in insect cells. In agreement with results obtained in the treatment of lysyl hydroxylase with endoglycosidase H(12.Myllylä R. Pajunen L. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), mutation of one of the two effectively glycosylated asparagines reduced the enzyme activity to 25%. The functions of the asparagine-linked carbohydrate units in lysyl hydroxylase are unknown, but present and previous (12.Myllylä R. Pajunen L. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) data on lysyl hydroxylase differ from the situation in the closely related enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase in that enzymatic removal of the carbohydrate (31.Kedersha N.L. Tkacz J.C. Berg R.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or mutation of the two glycosylated asparagines to glutamines (20.Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) had no effect on the activity of the latter enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2084782228,"Through the interaction with its ligands, CD80/B7-1 and CD86/B7-2 or B70, the human CD28 molecule plays a major functional role as a costimulator of T cells along with the CD3•TcR complex. We and others have previously reported that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inducibly associates with CD28. This association is mediated by the SH2 domains of the p85 adaptor subunit interacting with a cytoplasmic YMNM consensus motif present in CD28 at position 173-176. Disruption of this binding site by site-directed mutagenesis abolishes CD28-induced activation events in a murine T-cell hybridoma transfected with human CD28 gene.Here we show that the last 10 residues of the intracytoplasmic domain of CD28 (residues 193-202) are required for its costimulatory function. These residues are involved in interleukin-2 secretion, p85 binding, and CD28-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In contrast, the CD28/CD80 interaction is unaffected by this deletion, as is the induction of other second messengers such as the rise in intracellular calcium and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28-specific substrates. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that, within these residues, the tyrosine at position 200 is involved in p85 binding, probably together with the short proline-rich motif present between residues 190 and 194 (PYAPP). Through the interaction with its ligands, CD80/B7-1 and CD86/B7-2 or B70, the human CD28 molecule plays a major functional role as a costimulator of T cells along with the CD3•TcR complex. We and others have previously reported that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inducibly associates with CD28. This association is mediated by the SH2 domains of the p85 adaptor subunit interacting with a cytoplasmic YMNM consensus motif present in CD28 at position 173-176. Disruption of this binding site by site-directed mutagenesis abolishes CD28-induced activation events in a murine T-cell hybridoma transfected with human CD28 gene. Here we show that the last 10 residues of the intracytoplasmic domain of CD28 (residues 193-202) are required for its costimulatory function. These residues are involved in interleukin-2 secretion, p85 binding, and CD28-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In contrast, the CD28/CD80 interaction is unaffected by this deletion, as is the induction of other second messengers such as the rise in intracellular calcium and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28-specific substrates. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that, within these residues, the tyrosine at position 200 is involved in p85 binding, probably together with the short proline-rich motif present between residues 190 and 194 (PYAPP). In the absence of a costimulatory signal, activation of the CD3•TcR 1The abbreviations used are: TcRT-cell receptorPI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseIL-2interleukin 2ThT helperSHSrc homologyIgimmunoglobulinPLCphospholipase CmAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. complex is not sufficient to induce the complete activation of T lymphocytes. The interaction between CD28 on T lymphocytes and its counter-receptors CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B70 or B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells provides a costimulatory signal required for IL-2 production, T-cell proliferation, and effector functions such as T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and differentiation of Th cells into Th1 or Th2 subsets (for recent reviews, see (1.Allison J.P.

This CD28/CD80 interaction has also been shown to prevent anergy and to boost anti-tumor immunity(4.Chen L. Ashe S. Brady W.A. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Ledbetter J.A. McGowan P. Linsley P.S.

In the absence of catalytic motifs in this sequence, an indirect coupling via adaptor molecules was the most likely mechanism of action. Indeed, we and others have demonstrated previously that ligand stimulation of the human CD28 molecule induces its association with PI 3-kinase activity (11.August A. Dupont B. Int.

Similarly, the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Grb-2 has been shown to interact with this motif although with a lower affinity(16.Schneider H. Cai Y.C. Prasad K.V. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the CD28-associated Grb-2•Sos complexes are likely to link the activated CD28 receptor to the activation of p21ras and downstream events such as Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation and ERK2 stimulation(17.Nunes J. Collette Y. Truneh A. Olive D. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), as well as Jun kinase activation(18.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The primary events leading to CD28 phosphorylation are becoming better understood. The T-cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase ITK has been shown to associate with CD28 and to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after CD28 stimulation(19.August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Mills G.B. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9347-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and the Src-related tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn have been found in CD28 immune complexes from stimulated T cells(20.Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3260-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that CD28 is phosphorylated by p56lck and p59fynin vitro leading to the recruitment of ITK, Grb-2, and p85 (21.Raab M. Cai Y.C. Bunnell S.C. Heyeck S.D. Berg L.J. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8891-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the pattern of tyrosine phosphoproteins induced by a CD28 stimulation is similar but not superimposable to that induced by a CD3•TcR stimulation (22.Lu Y. Granelli-Piperno A.

Pages F. Klasen S. Battifora M. Costello R. Nunes J. Truneh A. Ragueneau M. Martin Y. Imbert J. Birg F. Mawas C. Bagnasco M. Cerdan C. Fundamental Clin. Immunol. 1995; 2: 185-197Google Scholar)). Using a murine T-cell hybridoma transfected with the human CD28 gene, we have shown previously that a point mutation of the Tyr173 residue into phenylalanine abolished CD28-induced IL-2 secretion, suggesting that the PI 3-kinase pathway plays a major role in the CD28 function(12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Here we report the generation and functional characterization of a set of intracytoplasmic variants of the human CD28 molecule. We have generated mutants of CD28 containing progressive truncations of its intracytoplasmic tail (10, 21, 30, and 41 residues), as well as a point mutation of the tyrosine residue at position 200. These variants were expressed in a murine T-cell hybridoma. By analyzing stable transfectants, we investigated whether these molecules were able to mediate cell adhesion to human CD80-transfected L-cells, to be phosphorylated, bind and activate PI 3-kinase, and to costimulate IL-2 production together with CD3•TcR. DC27.1 used for transfection is a murine T-cell hybridoma derived by transfecting the TcR αβ genes of KB5C20 in DO11.10.2 (kindly provided by B. Malissen, CIML, France). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, sodium pyruvate (1 mM), β-mercaptoethanol (50 μM), and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin, 10 IU/ml), supplemented by xanthine (250 μg/ml), hypoxanthine (13.6 μg/ml), and mycophenolic acid (2 μg/ml). LTK− and LB7+ cells are L cells respectively untransfected or transfected by a CD80/B7-containing expression vector. 2A. Truneh, manuscript in preparation. The human CD28 mAbs, CD28.1, CD28.2, CD28.3, CD28.5, CD28.6, and 248 used in this study have been described previously(25.Nunes J. Klasen S. Franco M.D. Lipcey C. Mawas C. Bagnasco M. Olive D. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). C11E.4 and 6A11.2 (anti-human IgG1 and IgM, respectively) were derived in the laboratory and used as negative isotypic controls. The anti-murine mAbs were, respectively, 145-2C11 (a hamster IgG specific for CD3-∋ chain) and 37.51 (specific for murine CD28, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The human CD28 cDNA (kind gift of B. Seed, (7.Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar)) was cloned into the SalI-BamHI open vector pBluescript KS+. We constructed deletion mutants using the “Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit” (Bio-Rad). The point mutation of the Tyr200 residue to phenylalanine was realized with the overlap extension technique. The double mutant Tyr173-200 was obtained by using these primers on the cDNA template containing the mutation Tyr173→ Phe173(12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are available upon request. Sequencing of mutated molecules was performed using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Wild type and mutated CD28 cDNA constructs were cloned into pHβAPr-1-neo (26.Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) at SalI/BamHI sites, and recombinant genes were introduced by protoplast fusion into DC27.1 as described(27.Couez D. Pages F. Ragueneau M. Nunes J. Klasen S. Mawas C. Truneh A. Olive D. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected for their resistance to 3 mg/ml geneticin G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and screened for CD28 expression by flow cytometry analysis. 2 × 105 cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of mAbs at 4°C for 1 h. After extensive washing, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig at 4°C for 30 min (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence data were collected with logarithmic amplification. 4 × 105 transfected cells loaded with calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added to 105 LTK− or LB7+ cells seeded the day before in a microtiter plate, in the absence or presence of mAb CD28.2 in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Adherent cells were analyzed by the quantification of fluorescence (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 538 nm) by fluorimetry (Fluoroscan). 105 transfected cells were stimulated for 24 h at 37°C in microtiter plates with various stimuli. 5 × 104 untransfected (LTK−) or CD80-transfected (LB7+) L cells were used for stimulation of transfectants. Negative (anti-CD5) and positive (anti-CD3) controls were respectively purified mAbs C11E.4 and 145-2C11 used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in combination with FcR+ B lymphoma cells LK35.2 (105 cells). Soluble CD28.2 mAb (30 μg/ml) was used in combination with soluble 145-2C11 (10 μg/ml). Culture supernatants were collected and titrated, by serial 2-fold dilutions, for their ability to support proliferation of the IL-2-dependent murine T cell line, CTLL-2, as assessed by the cell growth determination 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide kit (Sigma). Results were expressed as A570 nm obtained for each dilution of the supernatants. 107 transfected cells were either unstimulated or activated by CD28.2, then immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), or with a p85 antiserum (UBI). Measure of CD28-associated PI 3-kinase activity was performed as described in (12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). 107 cells were stimulated by a fibroblast cell line transfected (LB7+) or not (LTK−) by the CD80/B7 cDNA, with or without CTLA-4Ig. Western blotting of p85-associated CD28 molecules was performed as described in (12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Blots were then stripped and reprobed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, UBI). Integrated signal intensity of phosphorylated proteins was determined using the BioImage System (Millipore) and expressed as arbitrary units. Values were normalized by integration of the actual amount of CD28 molecule detected by Western blotting for each mutant. Fold induction corresponds to the ratio of CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells stimulated by CD80+-L cells versus unstimulated cells. Whole cell lysates from 2 × 106 stimulated cells were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described in (12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Blots were then probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, UBI), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL. CD28 peptides (residues 166-180, 166-180 with phosphorylated Tyr173, 186-202, 186-202 with phosphorylated Tyr200) were coupled on Actigel ALD beads (Sterogene). 15 μl of beads were incubated with 5 μg of either GST, GST-C-SH2, or GST-SH3 purified proteins (kind gift of Ivan Gout) for 4 h at 4°C. Precipitates were then extensively washed, resuspended in sample buffer, denaturated by 3 min boiling, then run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained. 2 × 108 transfected cells were labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (8500-9120 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) as described(28.Ward S.G. Westwick J. Hall N.D. Sansom D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29.Jackson T. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the labeling procedure, cells were washed and stimulated by the addition of CD80+-L cells. Cell contact was achieved by low speed centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 s. Phospholipids were extracted as described(29.Jackson T. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17162-17172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were deacylated and analyzed by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described(28.Ward S.G. Westwick J. Hall N.D. Sansom D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The high conservation of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain among various species (human, rat, mouse, chicken) suggested its major role in signal transduction. Nonetheless, in the absence of a recognizable catalytic domain within these sequences, an indirect coupling via adaptor molecules was suspected. We truncated 10 (del 10), 21 (del 21), 30 (del 30) C-terminal residues, respectively, or the whole intracellular domain (del 41) (Fig. 1A) and stably transfected these various constructs into the murine T-cell hybridoma DC27.1. Fig. 1B shows CD28 expression profiles for one clone representative of each transfection, after staining with the CD28.2 mAb. Deletion of 10, 21, 30, or 41 residues did not prevent surface expression of the transfected molecule (Fig. 1B), but for the del 41 mutant, the mean fluorescence intensity was 7-fold lower than that observed for wild type CD28 (49 and 370, respectively). We also tested these cells for staining with a panel of 5 distinct mAbs: CD28.1, CD28.4, CD28.5, CD28.6, and 248 identifying at least 4 distinct epitopes on the CD28 molecule(25.Nunes J. Klasen S. Franco M.D. Lipcey C. Mawas C. Bagnasco M. Olive D. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as well as for binding of a B7-Ig fusion protein, and they all stained the various CD28 deletion mutants (not shown). CD28 is an adhesion molecule since CD28/CD80 interaction allows cell adhesion(31.Linsley P.S. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5031-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Using L cells transfected with human CD80, we show that wild type CD28-expressing cells bound to huCD80+ cells (LB7+, 34.5% of binding) but not to untransfected cells (LTK−). In addition, this binding was inhibited by the addition of the human mAb CD28.2 (Fig. 1C). The del 10 and del 30 transfected mutants were still able to bind huCD80+-L cells with almost similar efficacy to wild type CD28. We previously reported the involvement of the tyrosine residue at position 173 in the activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway(12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that this mutation did not affect CD28/CD80 interaction. Altogether, these data indicate that all deleted CD28 molecules still bind CD28 mAbs and B7-Ig and, in addition, are equally able to mediate the CD28/CD80 interaction showing that their extracellular structure was not modified. We have previously shown that a point mutation of the tyrosine residue at position 173 abolished both PI 3-kinase binding and IL-2 secretion in a murine T-cell hybridoma transfected with human CD28 (12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Here we investigated whether other regions of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain were required for late events of activation. We therefore tested whether CD28 stimulations (huCD80+-L cells or CD28 mAb in combination with CD3 mAb) could induce IL-2 secretion in transfected cells. Fig. 2 shows that both stimulations induced IL-2 secretion in cells transfected by the wild type CD28 construct (upper panel), while IL-2 production was severely altered in del 10 cells whatever CD28 stimuli was used (lower panel). Similar data were obtained with cells transfected by molecules truncated by 21, 30, and 41 residues (not shown). By contrast, cross-linked CD3 stimulation resulted in strong IL-2 secretion in all these clones. We and others have shown previously that, upon stimulation, the human CD28 molecule was able to associate with a PI 3-kinase activity. This association involves the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit interacting with a YMNM motif present in the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. Here we tested gradually truncated CD28 molecules for their ability to associate with p85 and PI 3-kinase. Upon CD28 mAb stimulation PI 3-kinase activity associated with the wild type CD28 molecule (Fig. 3, lane 2), while a deletion of 30 C-terminal residues including the p85 binding site completely abolished this coupling (lane 8). Interestingly a deletion of only the 10 last residues was also able to inhibit 90% of the PI 3-kinase activity coupled to the CD28 molecule (lane 4). Since the total immunoprecipitable PI 3-kinase activity was equivalent in all these cells (data not shown), the observed defect in PI 3-kinase activity could be explained either by the inability of truncated molecules to activate the enzyme or by their failure to associate with its p85 adaptor subunit. p85 Western blotting of CD28 immunoprecipitates revealed that deletion of 10 C-terminal residues decreased the CD28/p85 association by more than 90% while a deletion of 30 C-terminal amino acids including residues 173-176 completely abolished it ((12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and data not shown). We also examined the ability of other transducing pathways to associate with CD28 deletion mutants. A rise in Ca2+ reflecting PLCγ1 activation was detected in cells expressing either wild type CD28 or del 10 mutant upon stimulation by CD3, as well as by CD28 mAbs (data not shown). CD28 and CD3 stimulations induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific substrates(17.Nunes J. Collette Y. Truneh A. Olive D. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22.Lu Y. Granelli-Piperno A. Bjorndhal J.M. Phillips C.A. Trevillyan J.M. J.

Med. 1992; 175: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A 2-min stimulation of both WT and del 10 transfected cells by CD3 mAbs induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, the two most prominent bands corresponding to molecular masses of 100 and 36 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5(32.Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). CD28 stimulation led to a strong phosphorylation of two proteins of 95 and 64 kDa, the former being vav. 3S. Klasen, F. Pagès, J. F. Peyron, D. Cantrell, and D. Olive, manuscript in preparation. As shown in Fig. 4, deletion of the 10 C-terminal amino acids did not prevent phosphorylation of these substrates. The cytoplasmic CD28 sequence contains two short proline-rich segments between residues 178-183 (PxxPxP) and 190-194 (PxxPP) which might serve as docking sites for the SH3 domain of p85(34.Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Deletion of 10 C-terminal residues (amino acids 193-202) disrupts one of these proline-rich sequences, and this may account for the observed defect in p85 binding. To test this hypothesis and to determine if individual SH3 and C-SH2 domains of p85 could bind directly to the C-terminal part of CD28 in vitro, we tested whether a 17-mer peptide corresponding to residues 186-202 of CD28 could interact with recombinant SH2 and SH3 domain fusion proteins. As shown previously, interaction of p85 with the YMNM consensus site was strictly dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation since a 15-mer phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 166-180 strongly bound the C-SH2 domain of p85 (Fig. 5, lane 4) while a nonphosphorylated form of the peptide did not (lane 2). In a non-phosphorylated form, peptide 186-202 did not interact with the C-SH2 domain (lane 6) while it did bind the p85 SH3 domain (lane 7). Interestingly, this p85 SH3 domain binding was decreased when peptide 186-202 was phosphorylated at position Tyr200 (lane 10). Despite the absence of a consensus p85 binding site in the phosphopeptide 186-202, a weak binding of the p85 C-SH2 domain was observed however (lane 9). To examine if the tyrosine residue at position 200 was involved in the PI 3-kinase pathway in vivo, we mutated it to phenylalanine and expressed the mutated construct in DC27.1 cells. Stable cell lines were analyzed for surface expression, CD80 binding, IL-2 secretion, p85 binding, and PI 3-kinase activation. Fig. 6A shows that point mutation of Tyr200→ Phe200 inhibited CD28-associated PI 3-kinase activity but did not abolish it (lane 4). Western blotting of p85 demonstrated that this impairment was due to a decrease in the quantity of CD28-associated p85 (not shown). It has never been proven that PI 3-kinase association with CD28 was necessary for activation of the enzyme. We have therefore tested CD28-induced accumulation of D-3 phosphoinositides in the transfectants expressing wild type or mutated (Tyr173, Tyr200) CD28 molecules. In wild type transfectants, B7 ligation induces a transient accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 6B). However, point mutation of the Tyr173 residue completely abolished CD28-induced PI 3-kinase activation as assessed by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation. In contrast, a point mutation of the Tyr200 residue, however, only delayed and attenuated its activation. Thus, the defect in the PI 3-kinase activation observed in the DYF200 transfectant occurs at the level of p85 association. We also examined the ability of p85 C-SH2 domain fusion proteins to precipitate wild type or mutated CD28 molecules following ligation. Fig. 7A shows that upon ligation by CD80+-L cells, the GST-p85 C-SH2 fusion protein precipitated wild type CD28 (lane 2), while a point mutation of Tyr173 strongly decreased this interaction (lane 8). Mutation of Tyr200 did not prevent CD28 interaction with p85 C-SH2 domain (lane 5). Mutation of both Tyr173 and Tyr200 to phenylalanine abrogated most of the CD28 ability to be recognized by the C-SH2 domain of p85 (lane 11). CD28 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation (12.Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D.

A. 1995; 92: 8891-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Tyr200 residue did not prevent CD28 phosphorylation, while point mutation of Tyr173 strongly decreased it. The double mutant Tyr173-200 lost most of its ability to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation (Fig. 7B). Hence, CD28 phosphorylation is further decreased by a double point mutation. The tyrosine residue at position 200 is therefore involved in PI 3-kinase binding and activation. We have also tested its role in CD28 function. Fig. 8 shows that CD28 mAbs in combination with CD3 mAbs induced IL-2 secretion although to a lesser extent than wild type CD28. In contrast, stimulation by CD80+-L cells did not induce IL-2 secretion (Fig. 8) while binding to CD80+-L cells was retained (not shown). In this report, we studied the structural requirements of the cytoplasmic domain of human CD28 for its signaling. For this analysis, the wild type CD28 molecule and various cytoplasmic mutants (deletion of 10, 21, 30, and 41 amino acids, or point mutation of Tyr200→ Phe) were expressed into the murine T-cell hybridoma DC27.1. We have shown previously that transfection of the full-length CD28 cDNA in these cells allowed surface expression of functional molecules which induce either early or late events of T-cell activation(27.Couez D.

Flow cytometric analysis showed that deletion of 10, 21, or 30 residues did not affect the cell surface expression of CD28. Deletion of the whole intracellular domain, however, impaired the expression of the construct. This observation has previously been reported for mutational analysis of the human CD2 molecule and could be explained by a partial instability of the molecule due to the removal of positively charged amino acids which are responsible for transmembrane stabi"

Evidence for a direct role for NGG1p in regulating activator function is supported by the finding that NGG1p is also required for transcriptional activation by GAL4p-VP16 and LexA-GCN4p (Pina, B., Berger, S. L., Marcus, G. A., Silverman, N., Agapite, J., and Guarente, L.(1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13, 5981-5989). By analyzing deletion derivatives of the 702-amino acid protein, we identified a region essential for glucose repression within residues 274-373. Essential sequences were further localized to a segment rich in Phe residues that is predicted to be an amphipathic α helix. As well as finding mutations within this region that reduced glucose repression, we identified mutations that made NGG1p a better repressor. In addition, NGG1p probably represses GAL4p activity as part of a complex containing ADA2p because single and double disruptions of ngg1 and ada2 had comparable effects on glucose repression. We also localized a transcriptional activation domain within the amino-terminal amino acids of NGG1p that is proximal or overlapping the region required for glucose repression.

Activation by GAL4p-NGG1p1-373 requires ADA2p; however, activation by GAL4p-NGG1p1-308 is ADA2p-independent. This suggests that a site required for ADA2p interaction lies between amino acids 308 and 373 and that ADA2p has a regulatory role in activation by GAL4p-NGG1p1-373."

Of the several parameters that govern the plasma level of factor Xa, control of its catabolism is of crucial importance. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which factor Xa is catabolized. In the present study we examine the cellular basis for the uptake and degradation of factor Xa. 125I-Factor Xa was degraded by hepatoma cells and embryonic fibroblasts via a process which required cell surface-bound tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a potent inhibitor of factor Xa. Uptake and degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI was also markedly stimulated in response to factor Xa binding. The intracellular kinetics of 125I-factor Xa and cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI display a strikingly similar pattern, suggesting that factor Xa and cell surface-bound TFPI are taken up as a bimolecular complex.

As the vascular endothelial cell surface retains a substantial pool of TFPI (Sandset, P. M., Alildgaard, U., and Larsen, M. L.(1988) Thromb. Res. 50, 803-813; Novotny, W. F., Brown, S. G., Miletich, J. P., Rader, D. J., and Broze, G.

J., Jr.(1991) Blood 78, 387-393), our data suggest that endothelial cell surface TFPI may be actively involved in the clearance of factor Xa from the circulation via mediated uptake and degradation. Factor X, a plasma glycoprotein involved in the blood coagulation cascade, can be converted to its active serine protease form factor Xa by both the intrinsic (factor IXa) and extrinsic (factor VII and tissue factor) pathways (Jackson and Nemerson, 1980). Factor Xa as the activator of prothrombin occupies a central position linking the two blood coagulation pathways. Control of factor Xa levels by its catabolism and by plasma protease inhibitors may therefore be pivotal in the regulation of the coagulation process. While little is known about factor Xa catabolism, a number of plasma serine protease inhibitors are thought to inhibit factor Xa activity. These include α1-antitrypsin (Colman et al., 1982), α2-macroglobulin (Jackson and Nemerson, 1980), antithrombin III (Kurachi et al., 1976), and the recently characterized TFPI 1The abbreviations used are: TFPItissue factor pathway inhibitorLRPLDL receptor-related proteinTFtissue factorDNS-GGACKdansyl-L-glutamyl-glycyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketonedansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. (reviewed in Broze et al.(1990)). TFPI is unique among coagulation inhibitors in having multiple protease inhibitory domains. It contains an acidic amino terminus followed by three tandem Kunitz-type protease inhibitory domains and a basic carboxyl terminus (Wun et al., 1988). The second Kunitz domain of TFPI mediates its binding to and inhibition of factor Xa, whereas the first Kunitz domain of TFPI is required for its inhibition of the factor VIIa/tissue factor catalytic complex (Girard et al., 1989). The carboxyl-terminal region of TFPI, including at least a portion of the third Kunitz domain, is required for its binding to heparin and for optimal inhibition of factor Xa (Wesselschmidt et al., 1992, 1993). The carboxyl terminus of TFPI is also necessary for its binding to the cell surface (Warshawsky et al., 1995). tissue factor pathway inhibitor LDL receptor-related protein tissue factor dansyl-L-glutamyl-glycyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. There are three sources of TFPI in vivo: plasma TFPI, which predominantly associates with lipoproteins and has a mean plasma concentration of 2.5 nM (Novotny et al., 1991); platelet TFPI, which is sequestered from the circulation and represents 10% of the plasma TFPI level (Novotny et al., 1988); and endothelial TFPI, which is proposed to associate with endothelial glycosaminoglycans. Plasma levels of TFPI rise severalfold following heparin infusion (Sandset et al., 1988; Novotny et al., 1991). The physiological roles of these three pools are not well defined. Platelet TFPI is released following thrombin stimulation and may exert an antithrombotic effect at local sites (Novotny et al., 1988). However, to date it has not been possible to demonstrate a direct correlation between plasma levels of TFPI and thromboses. The fact that patients with homozygous abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia have very low levels of plasma TFPI and do not suffer from thrombosis (Novotny et al., 1989) suggests that the TFPI associated with lipoproteins may not be essential. Perhaps the large endothelial cell surface pool of TFPI is of greater physiological importance. In order to begin to elucidate the function of cell surface-associated TFPI, we have investigated its role in factor Xa catabolism. Our data show that the uptake and degradation of 125I-factor Xa by human hepatoma cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts require cell surface TFPI and reciprocally, the uptake and degadation of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI is enhanced in response to factor Xa binding. Because of the similarity of the intracellular kinetics of factor Xa and TFPI, it is likely that they are taken up by cells as a complex. Our data further indicate that there is a specific receptor responsible for TFPI-factor Xa degradation and that this receptor is not the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), an endocytic receptor that mediates the uptake and degradation of uncomplexed TFPI (Warshawsky et al., 1994), nor tissue factor, an integral membrane glycoprotein capable of forming a quarternary complex with TFPI, factor Xa, and factor VIIa (Girard et al., 1989; Gemmell et al., 1990). Thus, our data suggest that in vivo endothelial cell surface TFPI may clear activated factor Xa from the circulation by mediating its cellular uptake and degradation. Iodogen was purchased from Pierce. [ 125I]Iodide was from Amersham Corp. Pronase, bovine serum albumin, and dansyl-L-glutamyl-glycyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone (DNS-GGACK) were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). Factors Xa and X were from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Tissue culture media and plasticware were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. An inhibitory rabbit anti-mouse soluble TF polyclonal antibody will be described separately. 2J. R. Toomey and G. J. Broze, Jr., unpublished data. Recombinant human full-length TFPI and the 39 kDa protein were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli (Warshawsky et al., 1993, 1994). DNS-GGACK inactivated factor Xa was achieved by incubating factor Xa at room temperature for 1 h in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, and a 100-fold molar excess of DNS-GGACK. Proteins (20-50 μg) were iodinated using the Iodogen method (Bu et al., 1992). Specific radioactivities were typically 0.5-3 × 106 cpm/pmol of protein. HepG2 cells were as described (Owensby et al., 1988). PEA 10 and PEA 13 cells were obtained from J. Herz (Willnow and Herz, 1994). TF (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from TF (-/-) chimeric embryos. TF (-/-) chimeric embryos were collected and sacrificed 13 days postcoitus. The embryos were eviscerated, minced, trypsinized, and plated onto tissue culture plates. Following expansion of the mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the cells were placed under selection with G418 and hygromycin. After 1 week of selection, surviving TF (-/-) fibroblasts were combined. The fibroblasts were immortalized using a 60-day 3T3 protocol. Confirmation of TF deficiency was assessed in a one stage clotting assay and compared to TF activity in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cells. Detailed methods and characterization will be described separately.2 All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin at 100 units/ml, and streptomycin at 100 μg/ml. Cells were incubated at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 12-well dishes 1 day prior to assay. Cell monolayers were generally used at 70-90% confluence. Assay buffers were Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Binding assays were carried out by washing cell monolayers with prechilled assay buffer twice and binding was initiated by adding 0.5 ml of 4°C assay buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 125I-labeled proteins. After incubation at 4°C for 2 h, overlying buffer containing unbound ligand was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 4°C assay buffer. The cells were then lysed in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2% SDS, and 10% glycerol. The radioactivity of cell lysates was determined in a γ counter (model C5304; Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). Nonspecfic binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand as specified in the figure legends (Owensby et al., 1989). Degradation assays were generally carried out at 37°C for 3 h in 0.5 ml of assay buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 125I-labeled proteins. Thereafter, the medium overlying the cell monolayers was removed and proteins were precipitated by addition of bovine serum albumin to 5 mg/ml and trichloroacetic acid to 10%. Degradation of ligand was defined as the appearance of radioactive ligand fragments in the overlying medium that were soluble in trichloroacetic acid. Degradation of 125I-ligand in parallel dishes that did not contain cells was subtracted from the total degradation (Owensby et al., 1989). Cells were seeded into 12-well dishes. After the cells had been washed twice with 4°C assay buffer, 0.5 ml of assay buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 125I-labeled proteins were added. After binding for 30 min at 4°C, cells were washed three times with 4°C assay buffer to remove unbound ligand. Cells were then warmed rapidly to 37°C by adding prewarmed assay buffer and incubated at 37°C for selected time intervals. The overlying medium was removed at each time point, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to assess the degradation. Cell monolayers were then washed three times with 4°C assay buffer and incubated at 4°C for 30 min in assay buffer containing 0.25% Pronase to remove cell suface radioligand and also detach cells from the culture wells. The detached cells were separated from the buffer by centrifugation and radioactivity associated with the cell pellet (i.e. internalized radioligand) was determined. Human factor Xa has been reported to bind to human hepatoma HepG2 cells in a specific and saturable manner, while the zymogen factor X failed to bind to these cells (Sakai and Kisiel, 1990). Using chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation techniques, this group subsequently showed that TFPI was the major factor Xa-binding protein on the cell surface (Kazama et al., 1993). To investigate the role of cell surface-bound TFPI in factor Xa degradation, HepG2 cells were preincubated at 4°C in the presence or absence of TFPI. Following washing to remove the unbound ligand, the cell monolayers were incubated with various concentrations of 125I-factor Xa. Degradation of 125I-factor Xa was carried out at 37°C for 3 h, and the overlying medium containing the resultant degradation products was assayed following trichloroacetic acid precipitation. As shown in Fig. 1, at each concentration of 125I-factor Xa added, its degradation was enhanced about 10-fold in cells which had been preincubated with TFPI compared with those without prior TFPI exposure. This result suggests that TFPI mediates the uptake and degradation of factor Xa by HepG2 cells. The small amount of 125I-factor Xa degradation seen in cells without exogenous TFPI addition may have resulted from either a small amount of endogenous TFPI or more likely from fluid-phase endocytosis (Fig. 1). LRP is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family involved in the endocytosis of several circulating plasma proteins and heteromeric protein complexes (reviewed in Krieger and Herz(1994)). We have shown recently that 125I-TFPI degradation by hepatoma cells is also mediated via LRP (Warshawsky et al., 1994). Because degradation of 125I-factor Xa required cell surface-bound TFPI, we examined whether LRP served as an endocytic receptor for factor Xa. To address this question directly, LRP-negative embryonic fibroblasts (PEA 13), isolated from mice homozygous for LRP gene-knockout (Willnow and Herz, 1994), were utilized. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA 10), isolated from LRP-heterozygous mice and expressing functional LRP (Willnow and Herz, 1994), were used as control. We first evaluated the binding of 125I-factor Xa to PEA 10 and PEA 13 cells as a function of cell surface-bound TFPI. Cells were preincubated at 4°C with increasing concentrations (0-16 nM) of TFPI. After washing to remove the unbound ligand, the cell monolayers were incubated with 2 nM 125I-factor Xa at 4°C for 2 h for binding assays. Fig. 2A shows that at zero concentration of TFPI during the preincubation, the specific binding of 125I-factor Xa to both cell lines was minimal. As the concentration of TFPI in preincubation buffer increased, binding of 125I-factor Xa to the cells increased accordingly (Fig. 2A). This result indicates that binding of factor Xa to these cells is TFPI-dependent, supporting the observation that TFPI is the major binding protein for factor Xa on cells (Kazama et al., 1993). The observation that binding of 125I-factor Xa to both PEA 10 and PEA 13 cells was indistinquishable (Fig. 2A) indicates that LRP does not play a role in factor Xa binding. Fig. 2B shows that binding of 125I-factor Xa to PEA 10 cells was saturable at fixed levels of prebound TFPI (similar data were obtained using PEA 13 cells, data not shown), confirming the specific nature of the TFPI-mediated factor Xa binding to cells. Previously we showed that the uptake and degradation of TFPI by hepatoma cells is blocked by anti-LRP antibody as well as by the 39 kDa protein, an LRP-binding protein that inhibits all known ligand interactions with LRP (Warshawsky et al., 1994). These observations led to the conclusion that LRP is the endocytic receptor for TFPI. To confirm this observation, 125I-TFPI degradation was evaluated in LRP-positive PEA 10 and LRP-negative PEA 13 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, 125I-TFPI degradation occurred in PEA10 cells, but not PEA 13 cells. There was an approximately 7-fold difference in 125I-TFPI degradation between these two cell lines (Fig. 3). PEA 10 and PEA 13 cells are phenotypically different only in their expression of LRP. Thus using these two cell lines, we next examined to what extent LRP contributed to TFPI-dependent 125I-factor Xa degradation. Cells were processed in an identical manner as that described in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 4, upon preincubation with TFPI, identical rates of 125I-factor Xa degradation were seen in both cell lines. Parallel experiments in which cells were not preincubated with TFPI also demonstrated identical rates between the cell lines (Fig. 4). However, as expected, the total amount of 125I-factor Xa degraded was much less than (approximately 10-fold) in experiments in which TFPI preincubation occurred. These data thus demonstrate that TFPI-dependent factor Xa degradation does not require the endocytic receptor LRP. To assess the effect of factor Xa on cell surface-bound TFPI, degradation of cell surface 125I-TFPI was assayed in the presence of factor Xa in PEA 10 and PEA 13 cells. Cells were preincubated at 4°C with an uniform concentration (16 nM) of 125I-TFPI followed by washing to remove unbound radioligand. The cell monolayers were subsequently incubated with increasing concentrations (0-16 nM) of unlabeled factor Xa at 4°C for 30 min to allow for factor Xa binding. Thereafter the cells were shifted to 37°C for assessment of the 125I-TFPI degradation. Fig. 5 shows that in the absence of factor Xa, the amount of 125I-TFPI degraded was 4-fold higher in PEA 10 cells than in PEA 13 cells. With increasing amounts of unlabeled factor Xa added to the cells, degradation of 125I-TFPI in both cell lines increased accordingly. This indicates an augmentation by factor Xa on 125I-TFPI degradation. Noticeably, a greater enhancement of 125I-TFPI degradation was observed in LRP-negative PEA 13 cells compared to LRP-positive PEA 10 cells (Fig. 5). Thus the difference in the amount of 125I-TFPI degraded by these two cell lines, which represents that degraded via the LRP endocytic pathway (solid circles in Fig. 5), varied inversely with the concentration of factor Xa added. These data therefore suggest that factor Xa-stimulated cell surface 125I-TFPI degradation, similar to TFPI-dependent 125I-factor Xa degradation, is not mediated via LRP. To determine whether this stimulatory effect on 125I-TFPI degradation requires activated factor X (i.e. Xa), zymogen factor X and the DNS-GGACK-inactivated factor Xa, both of which are unable to bind to TFPI (Broze et al., 1988), were evaluated in similar experiments. As shown in Fig. 6, neither factor X nor DNS-GGACK-inactivated factor Xa were able to augment the degradation of 125I-TFPI in either PEA 10 or PEA 13 cells. These results clearly demonstrate that active factor Xa in association with cell surface-bound TFPI is required for the observed effect. To determine at which step(s) factor Xa affect the cellular fate of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI, a single-cycle endocytosis analysis (Owensby et al., 1989) was performed. This analysis was carried out with PEA 13 cells, such that LRP does not contribute to the observed results. Fig. 7A shows that in the absence of factor Xa, there was essentially no internalization of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI, even after 60 min of incubation at 37°C. However rapid internalization of 125I-TFPI was observed upon binding to factor Xa. This indicates that factor Xa induces the uptake of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI. Fig. 7B shows that the degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI was also enhanced in the presence of factor Xa, apparently as a consequence of the increased internalization. It is of note that the internalized pool of 125I-TFPI was sustained intracellularly over a period of at least 60 min (Fig. 7A). This feature is distinct from that observed with ligands internalized by the constitutive endocytic receptor LRP (Owensby et al., 1988; Bu et al., 1992; Underhill et al., 1992; Warshawsky et al., 1994), in which ligand internalization peaks at 10-15 min and declines precipitously thereafter. To determine whether factor Xa followed similar intracellular kinetics to that of TFPI, the fate of a cohort of 125I-factor Xa was examined during single cycle endocytosis in TFPI-prebound PEA 13 cells. As shown in Fig. 7C, similar internalization and degradation kinetics were observed for 125I-factor Xa. These results, taken together with previous observations that factor Xa-stimulated TFPI degradation required association with factor Xa, strongly suggest that factor Xa and TFPI are internalized as a complex. Data seen in Fig. 7 imply that there is a specific receptor which mediates the internalization and degradation of factor Xa-TFPI complex. One obvious potential candidate is tissue factor (TF). TF is an integral membrane protein capable of forming quarternary complexes with TFPI, factor Xa, and factor VIIa (Girard et al., 1989; Gemmell et al., 1990). To examine this possibility we evaluated the effect of preincubation of cells with anti-TF polyclonal antibodies. When analyzed in LRP-negative PEA 13 cells, no significant inhibition of factor Xa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation was observed in the presence of anti-TF antibody (data not shown). This observation suggested that TF did not play a significant role in factor Xa-stimulated TFPI degradation; however, alternative explanations were possible. Therefore, in order to definitively eliminate a role for TF in this process, we took advantage of TF-negative fibroblasts that were generated by gene targeting and demonstrate a complete absence of TF expression.2 As seen in Table 1, TF-negative cells, in the absence of factor Xa, degraded 125I-TFPI at 122 fmol/106 cells. Degradation was completely abrogated by incubation with the 39-kDa protein, indicating that uncomplexed TFPI was degraded via LRP as has been shown (Warshawsky et al., 1994). In the presence of factor Xa, degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI was further enhanced to 215 fmol/106 cells. This indicates that TF-negative cells were capable of markedly increasing degradation of 125I-TFPI in response to factor Xa addition. Furthermore, this increased degradation was not blocked by the 39-kDa protein. Thus LRP did not contribute to the enhancement, as observed in other cells (e.g. see above). Taken together, these data demonstrate that TF is not the endocytic receptor for the factor Xa-TFPI complex.Table 1 Open table in a new tab In the current study we show that 125I-factor Xa is actively endocytosed and degraded by various cell lines in a manner that requires cell surface-bound TFPI. The uptake and degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI, in response to factor Xa binding, is also accelerated. Since the intracellular kinetics of 125I-factor Xa and 125I-TFPI are quite similar, it is likely that they are taken up by cells as a complex. Furthermore, our data indicate that there is a specific endocytic receptor responsible for the TFPI-factor Xa degradation and that this receptor is neither LRP nor TF. TFPI interacts with factor Xa in 1:1 stoichiometry; however, the interaction is reversible (Broze et al., 1987, 1988). Thus one would expect an eventual transfer of factor Xa from this complex to its major plasma inhibitors, antithrombin III, α1-proteinase inhibitor, and α2 macroglobulin, which form irreversible bonds with factor Xa (Pratt and Pizzo, 1986; Colman et al., 1987). Our data shown here indicate that rather than targeting factor Xa to other plasma protease inhibitors, cell surface-bound TFPI directly inactivates factor Xa by mediating its cellular degradation. Considering the fact that the endothelial cell surface provides a substantial reservoir of TFPI (Sandest et al., 1988; Novotny et al., 1991), it is reasonable to speculate that the vascular endothelium, through its surface-bound TFPI, is crucial in factor Xa catabolism in vivo. We showed previously that cellular degradation of 125I-TFPI is inhibited by antibodies directed against LRP and by the 39-kDa protein (Warshawsky et al., 1994). These observations led to the conclusion that LRP is the endocytic receptor for TFPI. In addition, recent studies with adenoviral mediated delivery of the 39-kDa protein to mice in vivo further confirm the role of LRP as the predominant receptor governing TFPI uptake and degradation (Narita et al., 1995). In the present study we demonstrate that 125I-TFPI degradation occurs only in LRP-positive PEA 10 cells, but not in LRP-negative PEA 13 cells (Fig. 3). This result thus confirms and extends our previous findings. Using these two cell lines in degradation assays, we have observed that TFPI-mediated 125I-factor Xa degadation, however, is independent of the LRP endocytic pathway (Fig. 4). Several lines of evidence suggest that factor Xa and cell surface-bound TFPI are internalized as a bimolecular complex. First, binding and degradation of 125I-factor Xa are mediated by cell surface-bound TFPI (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 4). Second, the cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI, upon association with factor Xa, is also internalized (Fig. 7). Last, the intracellular kinetics of 125I-TFPI and 125I-factor Xa are similar if not identical (Fig. 7). The above observations also indicate that a specific endocytic receptor is responsible for the uptake of the complex. It is interesting to note that 125I-factor Xa or 125I-TFPI internalized by the putative receptor does not share the internalization kinetics typical of that observed for ligands internalized by the endocytic receptor LRP (Owensby et al., 1988; Bu et al., 1992; Underhill et al., 1992; Warshawsky et al., 1994). Rather than rapid declining after 10-15 min at 37°C, 125I-factor Xa or 125I-TFPI is sustained intracellularly at plateau levels for a significantly prolonged time. The underlying mechanism is not clear at present. Whether this is due to an unusual intracellular pathway traversed by the TFPI-factor Xa complex or to resistance of the complex or its individual component proteins to proteolysis within the vacuolar system, as is the case for PAI-1 of the t-PA•PAI-1 complex (Underhill et al., 1992), remains to be discerned. In an effort to identify the receptor for the TFPI-factor Xa complex, we explored the possibility of TF as a potential candidate. TF is an integral membrane protein capable of forming quarternary complexes with TFPI, factor Xa, and factor VIIa (Girard et al., 1989; Gemmell et al., 1990). Adventitial fibroblasts beneath the vascular endothelium constitutively express TF (Wilcox et al., 1989; Drake et al., 1989; Fleck et al., 1990). On the contrary, endothelial cells that are in intimate contact with blood, under physiological conditions, either do or do not express very little TF (Wilcox et al., 1989; Grake et al., 1989; Fleck et al., 1990). Assuming that the endothelium serves as a potential site for degradation of the TFPI-factor Xa complex, one may not predict that TF serves as this receptor due to its scarce expression on endothelial cells. This is in fact what we have observed. Using TF-negative fibroblasts, marked stimulation of degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI is manifest in response to factor Xa binding (Table 1), similar to that seen in TF-positive cells. Kazama et al.(1993) reported that in addition to binding to cell TFPI, 30% of 125I-factor Xa could be cross-linked to protease nexin-1 on HepG2 cells. Hence they proposed that nexin-1 is a receptor for factor Xa as well. Protease nexin-1 is secreted by many anchorage-dependent cells, including fibroblasts, cardiac muscle cells, and kidney epithelial cells (Eaton and Baker, 1983). However secretion by endothelial cells has not been reported. Whether nexin-1 plays a role in factor Xa catabolism is not presently known, nor is its physiological significance in this matter. These issues will certainly deserve further study. As will the molecular identity of the TFPI-factor Xa clearance receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1979252983,"Prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) reversibly blocked the cell cycle progression of NIH 3T3 cells at G1 and G2/M phase. When it was applied to cells synchronized in G0 or S phase, cells were blocked at G1 and G2/M, respectively. The G2/M blockage was transient. Microinjected oncogenic leucine 61 Ras protein could not override the PGA2 induced G1 blockage, nor could previous transformation with the v-raf oncogene. The serum-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was not inhibited by PGA2 treatment. These data suggest that PGA2 blocks cell cycle progression without interfering with the cytosolic proliferative signaling pathway. Combined microinjection of E2F-1 and DP-1 proteins or microinjected adenovirus E1A protein, however, could induce S phase in cells arrested in G1 by PGA2, indicating that PGA2 does not directly inhibit the process of DNA synthesis. In quiescent cells, PGA2 blocked the normal hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptible gene product and the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 and CDK4, in response to serum stimulation. PGA2 treatment elevated the p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 protein expression level. These data indicate that PGA2 may arrest the cell cycle in G1 by interfering with the activation of G1 phase CDKs. Prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) reversibly blocked the cell cycle progression of NIH 3T3 cells at G1 and G2/M phase. When it was applied to cells synchronized in G0 or S phase, cells were blocked at G1 and G2/M, respectively. The G2/M blockage was transient. Microinjected oncogenic leucine 61 Ras protein could not override the PGA2 induced G1 blockage, nor could previous transformation with the v-raf oncogene. The serum-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was not inhibited by PGA2 treatment. These data suggest that PGA2 blocks cell cycle progression without interfering with the cytosolic proliferative signaling pathway. Combined microinjection of E2F-1 and DP-1 proteins or microinjected adenovirus E1A protein, however, could induce S phase in cells arrested in G1 by PGA2, indicating that PGA2 does not directly inhibit the process of DNA synthesis. In quiescent cells, PGA2 blocked the normal hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptible gene product and the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 and CDK4, in response to serum stimulation. PGA2 treatment elevated the p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 protein expression level. These data indicate that PGA2 may arrest the cell cycle in G1 by interfering with the activation of G1 phase CDKs."
https://openalex.org/W1576481206,"The effects of magnesium ions on a 32-mer ribozyme (R32) were examined by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. In solution, R32 (without its substrate) consisted of a GAAA loop, stem II, a non-Watson-Crick 3-base pair duplex and a 4-base pair duplex that included a wobble G:U base pair. When an uncleavable substrate RNA (RdC11) was added to R32 without Mg2+ ions, a complex did not form between R32 and RdC11 because the substrate recognition regions of R32 formed intramolecular base pairs (the recognition arms were closed). By contrast, in the presence of Mg2+ ions, the R32-RdC11 complex was formed. Moreover, titration of mixtures of R32 and RdC11 with Mg2+ ions also induced the ribozyme-substrate interaction. Elevated concentrations (1.0 M) of monovalent Na+ ions could not induce the formation of the R32-RdC11 complex. These data suggest that Mg2+ ions are not only important as the true catalysts in the function of ribozyme-type metalloenzymes, but they also induce the structural change in the R32 hammerhead ribozyme that is necessary for establishment of the active form of the ribozyme-substrate complex."

https://openalex.org/W2112447922,"Two new polyprenyl products in addition to dehydrodolichol and dolichol were detected by two-plate silica gel thin layer chromatography of nonpolar products formed from [1-14C]isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate in the reaction with a crude 1,000 × g supernatant of yeast homogenates in the presence of NADPH. The new products were indistinguishable from authentic dehydrodolichal and dolichal. Analyses of the time-dependent and pH-dependent formation of the four products including dehydrodolichal and dolichal suggested that the biosynthetic pathway from dehydrodolichol leading to dolichal is different from that to dolichol. In double-labeled experiments with a combination of [1-14C]isopentenyl diphosphate and a [4B-3H]NADPH-generating system, the ratio of 3H- and 14C-derived radioactivities found in dolichal was six times higher than that in dolichol. A small amount of 3H-labeled dehydrodolichol was also detected. Considering the fact that dolichol is synthesized from dehydrodolichol (Sagami, H., Kurisaki, A., and Ogura, K.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10109-10113), we propose that dehydrodolichol is a common branch point intermediate in the biosynthetic pathways leading to dolichal and dolichol and that dehydrodolichal is an intermediate in the pathway from dehydrodolichol to dolichal. Two new polyprenyl products in addition to dehydrodolichol and dolichol were detected by two-plate silica gel thin layer chromatography of nonpolar products formed from [1-14C]isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate in the reaction with a crude 1,000 × g supernatant of yeast homogenates in the presence of NADPH.

Since the discovery of the involvement of the long-chain polyprenyl-P, dolichyl-P, in the pathway of assembly of the oligosaccharide chain of N-linked glycoproteins(1.Waechter C.J. Lennarz W.J. Annu.

The initial steps from mevalonate to farnesyl-P2 are identical with those of the biosynthesis of cholesterol, ubiquinone, and farnesylated proteins. The next step begins with the cis-condensation of isopentenyl-P2 with farnesyl-P2 to form dehydrodolichyl-P2. It has been proposed that in the chain elongation reactions are involved two steps comprising farnesyl-P2 → Z,E,E-geranylgeranyl-P2 and Z,E,E-geranylgeranyl-P2→ dehydrodolichyl-P2(10.Sagami H. Matsuoka S. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3458-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Matsuoka S. Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3464-3468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The terminal biosynthetic pathway still remains to be clarified, although four mechanisms have been proposed(12.Chojnacki T. Dallner G. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13.Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10109-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) : 1) dehydrodolichyl-P2 is converted into dolichyl-P by dephosphorylation followed by saturation of the α-isoprene double-bond; 2) dolichol is the end product from which dolichyl-P is produced by phosphorylation; 3) the final condensation in which isopentenol instead of isopentenyl-P2 is added is accompanied by concomitant reduction to yield dolichol; and 4) dehydrodolichol produced by dephosphorylation of dehydrodolichyl-P2 is reduced to dolichol. We have demonstrated that the fourth mechanism is operative for the dolichol biosynthetic pathway, since exogenous dehydrodolichol was shown to be converted to dolichol under in vitro assay conditions with preparation from mammalian liver and testis(13.Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10109-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the conversion of dehydrodolichol into dolichol was too low to study on the mechanisms. Recently, Roos et al.(21.Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) described a novel screen for yeast temperature-sensitive mutants with defects in the dolichol-mediated pathway for N-glycosylation of proteins. In their experiments the mutants were further classified into phase 1, 2, and 3 mutants with defects in the pathways for the formation of dolichyl-P, oligosaccharyl-P2-dolichol, and N-linked oligosaccharyl proteins, respectively. In order to understand the terminal biosynthetic pathway to dolichol, we planned to establish an in vitro dolichol assay method for yeast enzyme systems and to search among the phase 1 mutants for one which might be a mutant defective in the reduction of dehydrodolichol. We also were interested in learning if the hydride of NADPH is incorporated into dolichol and, if so, if the 4A- or the 4B-hydride of NADPH is stereospecifically incorporated. In the course of these studies, we have found two new enzymatic products, namely dehydrodolichal and dolichal. These results are discussed in the context of the terminal step in dolichol biosynthesis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid strain A364A (MATαade1 ade2 ura1 lys2 tyr1 his7 gal1) used as wild type and all mutants were described earlier (21.Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl.

Farnesyl-P2 was prepared according to the method of Davisson et al.(14.Davisson V.J. Woodside A.B. Poulter C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Dolichol with major chain lengths of C90 and C95, dehydrodolichol with major chain lengths of C85 and C90, ethyl geranylgeranoate, and ethyl geranylneroate were generous gifts from Kuraray Co. α-Dihydrohexaprenol was kindly provided by Eizai Co. Acid phosphatase (type II, from potato), hexokinase (type C-300, from bakers' yeast), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (type VII, from bakers' yeast), and Schiff's reagent were purchased from Sigma. Silica Gel 60 thin layer and reverse-phase LKC-18 thin layer plates were purchased from Merck and Whatman, respectively. RP-18 Sep-Pak and Dowex 50W-X8 were purchased from Waters and The Dow Chemical Company, respectively. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Dehydrodolichal was prepared from dehydrodolichol according to the method of Attenburrow et al.(15.Attenburrow, J, Cameron, A. F. B, Chapman, J. H., Evans, R. M., Hems, B. A., Jansen, A. B.

The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove brown pellets. The chloroform extracts containing dehydrodolichal were dried under vacuum, dissolved in toluene, and purified by silica gel column chromatography in toluene. In the case of dolichal synthesis, dolichol (10 mg) was treated with pyridinium dichromate in 0.35 ml of dichloromethane at room temperature for 24 h according to the method of Corey and Schmidt (16.Corey, E.

The dichloromethane extracts containing dolichal were dried under vacuum, dissolved in toluene, and purified by similar chromatography to that of dehydrodolichal in toluene. Both aldehydes were quantitatively obtained. Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium (2% Bacto-peptone, 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% glucose, 0.003% adenine sulfate) at 23°C to late logarithmic phase, collected, washed, suspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, and incubated at 23°C for 5 min. The cells were collected, resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.2 M sorbitol, 0.75% Bacto-yeast extract, 1.5% Bacto-peptone, 0.5% glucose, and 0.2 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T, and then incubated at 23°C for 30 min. Spheroplasted cells were collected, washed with 1.2 M sorbitol, resuspended in a preparation buffer containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.6 mg/ml protease inhibitors (leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, pepstatin A, aprotinin), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and homogenized with 30 strokes in a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was used as crude enzyme. Protein was determined with DC protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Mutant crude enzymes were prepared as described above except that cells were grown at 23°C to mid-logarithmic phase and then divided in two equal aliquots; one aliquot was incubated at 36°C for 90 min and the other remained at 23°C. The standard assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.5 ml, Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM patassium fluoride, 50 mM [1-14C]isopentenyl-P2, 40 mM farnesyl-P2, 1 mM NADPH, and 2.5 mg/ml crude enzymes. The mixture was incubated at 23°C for 30 min. The enzymatic products were extracted with butanol saturated with water. The butanol extracts were treated with acid phosphatase according to the method of Fujii et al.(17.Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Liberated products were extracted with hexane, and the hexane extracts were passed through RP-18 Sep-Pak in methanol. Nonpolar products were eluted with hexane and analyzed by two-plate thin layer chromatography as described in a previous report(18.Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. Chojnacki T. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 1857-1861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) 1The abbreviations used are: SUVsmall unilamellar vesicleCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. were prepared by a sonication method similar to that of Van Dessel and Lagrou(19.Van Dessel G. Lagrow A. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1994; 41: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (3 mmol) and [1-14C]dehydrodolichol (0.18 mCi) were mixed in chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v). The mixture was evaporated under N2, dried under vacuum for 3 h, and then suspended in 1 ml of a preparation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. The suspension was then sonicated for 6 min (Branson Sonifier 200) on ice and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Quantitative encapsulation of [1-14C]dehydrodolichol in SUVs was confirmed by liquid scintillation counting of an aliquot (50 ml) of the supernatant. The supernatant (650 ml) was used as SUVs source.

The application of [4B-3H]NADPH generating system in double-labeled experiments was performed by the modified method of Moran et al.(20.Moran R.G. Sartori P. Reich V. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A mixture containing, in a final volume of 0.2 ml, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8), 0.33 mM [1-3H]glucose (1 mCi), 1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.23 unit of hexokinase was incubated at 25°C for 2 h. The reaction products were passed through a Dowex 50W-X8 column (0.5 ml) in water to remove Mg2+. [1-3H]Glucose-6-phosphate in the run-through fraction was incubated with 0.5 mmol of NADP+ and 0.5 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, in a total volume of 0.3 ml, at 23°C for 5 min. Then, the preincubated mixture was added to the standard assay mixture. To confirm whether the formation of dolichol by yeast enzyme preparations can be detected, we first applied the assay system established with crude enzyme preparations of rat liver to the yeast system. Fig. 1A shows growth of yeast and synthesis of dolichol with a 10,000 × g supernatant of yeast homogenates. The activity for dolichol synthesis was the highest in the late-logarithmic phase of growth. Therefore, in the following experiments we harvested the cells before the stationary phase (A600 nm, 1.0). Next we prepared 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 100,000 × g supernatants of homogenates and assayed their activities for synthesis of dehydrodolichyl compounds and dolichol (Fig. 1B). The 1,000 × g supernatant had an activity for dolichol synthesis about 10 times as high as that of the 10,000 × g supernatant. The 100,000 × g supernatant had no activity for dolichol synthesis, although it had a considerable activity for the synthesis of dehydrodolichyl compounds. Therefore, we used the 1,000 × g supernatant to examine the assay conditions concerning optimum pH, time, and NADPH dependence. We found that there was no remarkable improvement of the dolichol assay conditions earlier established for the 10,000 × g supernatant of rat liver homogenates(13.Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10109-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined the effects of various detergents such as Triton X-100, CHAPS, octyl glucopyranoside, deoxycholate, and Tween 80 on the activity of dolichol synthesis. As shown in Fig. 2, all the detergents except Tween 80 completely at their critical micellar concentrations inhibited the activity of dolichol synthesis, whereas the activity for dehydrodolichol synthesis was less affected. Since the specific activity of the yeast enzyme system was higher than that of the rat liver enzyme system, in these studies a protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml was used in the following experiments. Analysis of products derived from [1-14C]isopentenyl-P2 and farnesyl-P2 with or without acid phosphatase treatment revealed the absence of dolichyl diphosphate and dolichyl phosphate in the enzymatic products and no difference in the chain length distribution between dehydrodolichyl products and dolichol (data not shown).Figure 2:Effects of the concentration of several detergents on the formation of dehydrodolichyl products (○) and dolichol (•). The enzymatic assays were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Triton X-100; B, CHAPS; C, octylglucopyranoside; D, deoxycholate; E, Tween 80.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mutant strain nos. 64, 149, 283, 279, and 358 used in this study are phase 1 mutants thought to be defective in the biosynthesis reactions responsible for the source of dolichyl-P(21.Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We prepared a 1,000 × g supernatant of each mutant pretreated at the permissive temperature (23°C) or the restrictive temperature (37°C), incubated the supernatant with [1-14C]isopentenyl-P2 and farnesyl-P2, and analyzed the products by two-plate thin layer chromatography. Dolichol was formed in all of these mutants pretreated at the restrictive temperature. A mutant (no. 283), which has been already identified to be allelic to sec 59, which is a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in dolichol kinase activity, was almost equal to the wild type strain in the capability of synthesizing dolichol. However, surprisingly, the abilities to synthesize dehydrodolichyl compounds and dolichol by the mutant nos. 64, 149, 279, and 358 were higher than that of the wild type strain. Remarkably, these mutants seem to have a mutation which causes an increase in in vitro activity involved in the formation of dehydrodolichyl compounds and dolichol. We chose to use the mutant, #149 in the following experiments. To see whether the hydride of NADPH is in fact incorporated into dolichol and whether the hydride is derived from 4B- or 4A-hydrogen of NADPH, we tried to prepare stereospecifically labeled [4B-3H]NADPH and [4A-3H]NADPH according to the method of Moran et al.(20.Moran R.G. Sartori P. Reich V. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, we had difficulty in preparing and purifying labeled NADPH in amounts enough for the minimum concentration of 0.1 mM in the standard assay mixture for dolichol formation. We took another approach using an NADPH-generating system to assay the incorporation of the hydrogen of NADPH into dolichol, because this approach was expected to provide in situ even such high concentrations of labeled NADPH as 1.0 mM. Preliminary experiments with a crude 1,000 × g supernatant showed that NADP+ rather than NADPH had a stimulatory effect on the activity for dolichol synthesis, suggesting the occurrence of an endogenous system of synthesizing NADPH from NADP+. Extended dialysis of the 1,000 × g supernatant considerably reduced the effects of the endogenous system on dolichol formation. Fig. 3 shows the effects of the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate or NADP+ on the formations of dolichol and squalene in NADPH-generating systems. In the case of squalene (Fig. 3B) synthesis, the formation was saturated with the addition of 0.1 mM glucose 6-phosphate in the presence of 1 mM NADP+ or with 0.5 mM NADP+ in the presence of 1 mM glucose 6-phosphate. The formation of dolichol (Fig. 3A) was increased with increasing concentrations of NADP+ in the presence of 1 mM glucose 6-phosphate, whereas it was saturated at a concentration of 0.1 mM glucose 6-phosphate in the presence of 1 mM NADP+ and then decreased with the increase of the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate. The amount of formation of dolichol with the NADPH-generating system was larger than that with 1 mM NADPH alone. We next examined the incorporation of tritium of [4B-3H]NADPH formed from NADP+ and [1-3H]glucose-6-phosphate by the NADPH-generating system into dolichol. Significant incorporation of radioactivity into the dolichol fraction (903 dpm) was observed. To our surprise, the dehydrodolichol fraction also contained radioactivity (1,345 dpm). This implies that dehydrodolichol and dehydrodolichal are interconvertible by the action of NADP+/NADPH-dependent dehydrogenases. To see the chemical behavior of dehydrodolichal on silica gel thin layer chromatography, we chemically synthesized an authentic specimen of dehydrodolichal by treating dehydrodolichol with MnO2. We also synthesized dolichal by treatment of dolichol with pyridinium dichromate for comparison. As shown in Fig. 4A, the dehydrodolichal compound (lane 2) migrated much slower than the dolichal compound (lane 6) on a silica gel thin layer plate, although dehydrodolichol (lane 1) had a little greater mobility than dolichol (lane 5). To confirm that these compounds are aldehydes, they were treated with NaBH4 or LiAlH4. Both compounds were reduced to dehydrodolichol (lanes 3 and 4) and dolichol (lanes 7 and 8). These authentic compounds on a silica gel plate also turned blue-violet on addition of a Schiff's reagent, indicating that the two compounds obtained by the treatment with MnO2 and pyridinium dichromate are in fact dehydrodolichal and dolichal, respectively. To see their separation dependent on the carbon chain length, we compared these aldehydes with each other on a reverse-phase silica gel plate (Fig. 4B). Dehydrodolichol (lane 3) migrated with almost the same R value as dehydrodolichal (lane 4). A similar observation was made with dolichol (lane 5) and dolichal (lane 6). When dehydrodolichol and its corresponding dolichol are compared, dehydrodolichol (lane 1) moved faster than dolichol (lane 2). A similar relation was also observed in the case of dehydrodolichal (lane 7) and dolichal (lane 8). In order to search for dehydrodolichal, which is expected to occur in enzymatic products, the portion of the first silica gel plate on which radioactive nonpolar products had been developed was subjected to the second reverse-phase chromatography. As shown in Fig. 5, two new polyprenyl families indicated by arrows 2 and 3 were observed in addition to dehydrodolichol and dolichol families (arrows 4 and 5), respectively. The faint radioactivity family spots (arrow 3) were in good agreement to those of the authentic dehydrodolichal family. Further, the radioactivity family spots (arrow 2) comigrated with authentic dolichal. Their migrations were also confirmed by another two-plate silica gel chromatography using a different solvent system, toluene:ethyl acetate (9:1). These results indicate that not only dehydrodolichal but also dolichal is formed in considerable amounts in these in vitro experiments. We examined the time-dependent formation of dehydrodolichol, dehydrodolichal, dolichal, dolichol, and squalene in the in vitro system (Table 1). In the case of assays with NADP+, the formation of dehydrodolichal and dolichal preceded that of dolichol. It is suggested that the formation of squalene as well as dolichol is dependent on NADPH synthesized from exogenous NADP+ by the action of an endogenous NADPH-generating system, although dialyzed enzyme preparations were used. In the case of assays with NADPH, dolichal and dolichol were predominantly synthesized over dehydrodolichal.Table 1 Open table in a new tab Since NADP+/NADPH-dependent oxidoreduction seemed to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway from dehydrodolichol to dehydrodolichal, dolichal, and dolichol, we examined the effects of pH on the formation of these products and squalene in the presence of both NADP+ and NADPH (Table 2). While the synthesis of dolichol was optimal at pH 7-8, that of dolichal was optimal at pH 8-9.Table 2 Open table in a new tab To establish whether dolichol is formed from dehydrodolichol directly or via intermediates such as dehydrodolichal and dolichal, we performed double-labeled experiments with [1-14C]isopentenyl-P2 as a single precursor in the presence of the [4B-3H]NADPH-generating system. Table 3 shows the radioactivity of 3H and 14C in dehydrodolichol, dehydrodolichal, dolichal, dolichol, and squalene fractions on the two-plate thin layer chromatogram. All the detectable compounds contained 3H-derived radioactivity. Assuming that one hydride from NADPH is incorporated into one molecule of dolichal or dolichol, the ratio of 3H- to 14C-derived radioactivity is calculated to be 18 for each compound. Based on this value, the specific activities of NADPH utilized in the syntheses of dolichal and dolichol were estimated to be about 2- and 12-fold diluted, respectively. The dilution of NADPH in the case of dolichol synthesis was in good agreement to that in the case of squalene synthesis. These results indicate that the site for biosynthesis of dolichal is different from that of dolichol and that there is no direct interconversion between dolichal and dolichol.Table 3 Open table in a new tab To determine whether enzyme preparations of a wild type yeast as well as mutant no. 149 have also the ability to synthesize dehydrodolichal and dolichal in addition to dehydrodolichol and dolichol, we analyzed the enzymatic products. Dolichal, dehydrodolichol, and dolichol were formed. The formation of dehydrodolichal was too small to detect. The radioactive dolichal fraction was converted 89% to dolichol by treatment of LiAlH4. No chemical oxidation of dehydrodolichol or dolichol into dehydrodolichal or dolichal was observed in experiments (23 or 50°C, pH 9 or 10, overnight incubation). Further, we also analyzed naturally occurring nonpolar polyprenyl compounds of a wild type yeast. Dolichol was easily detected, but dehydrodolichol, dehydrodolichal, or dolichal were not detected. We have found unknown compounds which migrated faster than dolichal on normal-phase silica gel thin layer chromatography and which were separated into a family with respect to carbon chain length on reverse-phase C18 silica gel thin layer chromatography. This compound was resistant to mild alkaline hydrolysis. We have previously demonstrated the formation of dolichol from dehydrodolichol by a NADPH-dependent reductase localized in microsomes of mammalian liver and testis(13.Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10109-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the reductase activity for dehydrodolichol was extremely low, and even in an assay using a combination of isopentenyl-P2 and farnesyl-P2 did not yield sufficient amounts of dolichol for further studies. We therefore employed yeast cells instead of mammalian tissue and found that yeast enzyme preparations had a much higher specific activity than mammalian enzyme preparations. More than 10 mg of protein/ml were required in the assay to detect the mammalian activity for dolichol synthesis from isopentenyl-P2 and farnesyl-P2, whereas 2.5 mg of protein/ml were sufficient for the detection of the same activity in the case of yeast enzyme. We tried to examine whether the yeast enzyme activity was high enough to utilize exogenous dehydrodolichol as a precursor for the reductase. However, dehydrodolichol was not effectively utilized as a substrate in the yeast system, even under conditions where the compound was solubilized with Tween 80 and unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Because of the difficulty in employing dehydrodolichol as a substrate for the yeast enzymes, we decided to improve the assay method by replacing the alcohol substrate with a combination of isopentenyl-P2 and farnesyl-P2. We first applied this assay to measure the enzyme activities of several yeast mutants that have been identified to be defective in the accumulation of oligosaccharyl-P2-dolichol. We were particularly interested in the possibility that one or more of these mutants might contain a temperature sensitive enzyme involved in the reduction of dehydrodolichol. However, we could not detect temperature-sensitivity as far as the dolichol biosynthetic pathway was concerned. Instead, we made the surprising finding that all the mutants except mutant no. 283 had much higher activities for dolichol synthesis than the wild type strain. The mechanism of this change is not known. Perhaps the induction of enzymes responsible for dolichol biosynthesis might result from compensation for the reduced levels of dolichyl-P or oligosaccharyl-P2-dolichol. To elucidate the stereochemistry of the hydride transfer from NADPH in dolichol biosynthesis, we prepared [4B-3H]NADPH and [4A-3H]NADPH. However, the yields of both radioactive forms of NADPH thus obtained were too low to satisfy even the minimum concentration of NADPH established for the yeast enzyme assay. Therefore, we employed an NADPH-generating system for elucidation of the stereochemistry of NADPH reduction. The crude enzyme preparation was dialyzed sufficiently to remove at least free glucose 6-phosphate, because it was found that dolichol was formed with crude nondialyzed enzymes without addition of exogenous glucose 6-phosphate. In the reaction with the dialyzed enzymes, the formation of dolichol was increased with increasing concentration of exogenous glucose 6-phosphate. The activity with the NADPH-generating system containing NADP+, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was much higher than that with NADPH alone. These puzzling results were readily reproduced. This observation raised the possibility that dolichol is not synthesized directly from dehydrodolichol by the action of NADPH-dependent reductase. If NADP+ and NADPH are both necessary to form dolichol from dehydrodolichol, it could be postulated that dehydrodolichol is first oxidized to dehydrodolichal by an NADP+-dependent dehydogenase, and then the dehydrodolichal is reduced to dolichol by an NADPH-dependent reductase. In a preliminary doubly-labeled experiment, we found that the dolichol fraction contained 3H-derived radioactivity from [4B-3H]NADPH. To our surprise, the dehydrodolichol fraction also contained a small but significant amount of 3H-derived radioactivity. This finding led us to search for a new polyprenyl compound such as dehydrodolichal. As shown in Fig. 5, nonpolar products were separated into dehydrodolichol, dehydrodolichal, dolichal, and dolichol in addition to squalene. We assumed the biosynthetic pathway of these polyprenyl products as follows, dehydrodolichol → dehydrodolichal [arrow] dolichal [arrow] dolichol. The involvement of these intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway to dolichol from dehydrodolichol was attractive, because the hydride transfer onto the β-carbon of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups is well known. However, experiments concerning time-dependent and pH-dependent formation of these compounds revealed that these new products and dolichol differed from each other in the biosynthetic pathway from dehydrodolichol. Double-labeled experiments also showed a different biosynthetic pathway to dolichol from to dolichal. On the basis that one 4B-hydride of NADPH is incorporated into one molecule of squalene, the numbers of 4B-hydride incorporated into dolichol and dolichal are estimated to be one and six, respectively. However, it is difficult to explain the large difference in hydride incorporation between dolichol and dolichal. One possible reason is that the biosynthetic site for dolichal formation might be more accessible to exogenous NADPH than that for dolichol formation. Therefore, at present we propose that dolichal is synthesized from dehydrodolichol via dehydrodolichal and that dolichol is formed directly from dehydrodolichol (Fig. 6). However, we do not exclude the possibility that dolichol is formed from dehydrodolichal, because in a preliminary study the addition of NADP+ to an assay mixture containing NADPH enhanced the activity of dolichol synthesis. Steen et al.(22.Steen L. Van Dessel G. De Wolf M. Lagrou A. Hilderson H.J. De Keukeleire D. Pinkse F.A. Fokkens R.H. Dierick W.S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 796: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have reported the identification of dolichyl dolichoate in bovine thyroid. The formation of dehydrodolichal is well understood as being involved in the biosynthesis of the dolichoate. Thus, the dolichoate pathway might be different from the dolichol pathway, which is responsible for the formation of dolichyl-P, a sugar carrier lipid in N-linked glycoproteins and glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol-anchored proteins."

Z-DNA conformation in the d(CG)n sequences was assayed by (i) a band shift assay using the Z-DNA-specific Z22 monoclonal antibody (ZIBS assay); (ii) an S1 nuclease cleavage-primer extension assay to map B-Z junctions; and (iii) a BssHII restriction inhibition assay. Using the ZIBS assay on plasmids purified from E. coli, the transition from B-DNA to Z-DNA occurred from d(CG)4 to d(CG)5, with 20% of d(CG)4 and 90% of d(CG)5 in Z-DNA conformation. These findings were consistent with the results of S1 nuclease cleavage observed at B-Z junctions flanking d(CG)4 and d(CG)5 sequences. Resistance to BssHII restriction endonuclease digestion was observed only in supercoiled plasmids containing d(CG)8 or longer sequences, indicating that shorter d(CG)n sequences are in dynamic equilibrium between B- and Z-DNA conformations. When a plasmid containing d(CG)4 was isolated from a topA mutant of E. coli, it contained 25% greater linking deficiency and 40% greater Z-DNA conformation in the alternating d(CG) region. In plasmids purified from H. halobium, which showed 30% greater linking deficiency than from E. coli, 20-40% greater Z-DNA formation was found in d(CG)4-6 sequences. Surprisingly, no significant difference in Z-DNA formation could be detected in d(CG)3-17 sequences in plasmids from either E. coli or H. halobium in the NaCl concentration range of 0.1-4 M.

Surprisingly, no significant difference in Z-DNA formation could be detected in d(CG)3-17 sequences in plasmids from either E. coli or H. halobium in the NaCl concentration range of 0.1-4 M. Experiments in the early 1970s showed that exposure of poly(d(CG)) DNA sequences to high salt concentrations resulted in inversion of the circular dichroism spectrum due to the formation of an unusual DNA structure(1.Pohl F.M. Jovin T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Subsequently, detailed structural analysis of a d(GC) hexamer in 4 M NaCl by x-ray crystallography (2.Wang A.H.-J. Quigley G.J. Kolpak F.J. Crawford J.L. van Boom J.H. van der Marel G. Rich A. Nature. 1979; 282: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) showed that the DNA forms a left-handed helical conformation, with alternating glycosidic bonds in anti and syn conformation and zigzag tracking of the phosphate backbone (hence, the name, Z-DNA). Since these initial studies, many other investigations have confirmed the occurrence of left-handed Z-DNA using a variety of approaches, including immunological(3.Nordheim A. Lafer E.M. Peck L.J. Wang J.C. Stollar B.D. Rich A. Cell. 1982; 31: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), enzymatic(4.Singleton C.K. Klysik J. Stirdivant S.M. Wells R.D. Nature. 1982; 299: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), chemical(5.Johnston B.H. Rich A.

Biochem. 1984; 53: 791-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar)). The factors that influence the equilibrium between B- and Z-DNA in vitro have also been studied. The nucleotide sequence is important for Z-DNA formation(7.Nordheim A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8.Peck L.J. Wang J.C.

A. 1986; 83: 5884-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); Z-DNA is generally adopted by alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences. Among these sequences, the d(CG) repeat has been shown to be the most favorable, the d(CA) repeat is intermediate, and the d(AT) repeat is the least favorable sequence for Z-DNA formation. Negative supercoiling of DNA is also important for Z-DNA formation(4.Singleton C.K. Klysik J. Stirdivant S.M. Wells R.D. Nature. 1982; 299: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 10.Stirdivant S.M. Klysik J. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Suppl. 1984; 1: 21-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as the higher energy status of negatively supercoiled DNA may be relieved by opposite handed helix formation. Under high superhelical density, some sequences with imperfect purine-pyrimidine repeats adopt Z-DNA conformation(9.McLean M.J. Blaho J.A. Kilpatrick M.W. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5884-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12.Ellison M.J. Kelleher III, R.J. Wang A.H.-J. Habener J.F. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8320-8324Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The presence of salts and some small molecules also affects Z-DNA formation (1.Pohl F.M. Jovin T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). High salt concentration is thought to stabilize Z-DNA conformation by shielding the repulsion of negatively charged phosphate groups, which are closer in Z-DNA than in B-DNA. Finally, chemical modifications such as methylation (13.Klysik J. Stirdivant S.M. Singleton C.K. Zacharias W. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and bromination (14.Moller A. Nordheim A. Kozlowsk S.A. Patel D.J. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) also affect Z-DNA formation due to steric effects. Studies directed at in vivo Z-DNA formation have provided evidence for left-handed DNA in the genomes of a variety of organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms(15.Kilpatrick M.W. Klysik J. Singleton C.K. Zarling D.A. Jovin T.M. Henau L.H. Erlanger B.F. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7268-7274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Hoheisel J.D. Pohl F.M. J.

No studies, however, have been directed at the genome of extremely halophilic microorganisms, for example Halobacterium halobium, which are classified as archaea and which grow at 3-5 M NaCl. It seemed likely that H. halobium may harbor a significant fraction of Z-DNA in its genome since its cytoplasm contains nearly 5 M salts. Moreover, its genomic DNA has a high GC content, 67%, and therefore, a high statistical likelihood of alternating d(CG) repeat sequences(23.Moore R.L. McCarthy B.J. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 248-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found, as part of this study, that plasmid DNA in H. halobium has a greater linking deficiency (and presumably negative supercoiling) than in Escherichia coli(24.Yang C.-F. Kim J.-M. Molinari E. DasSarma S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These three factors together suggested that Z-DNA in the H. halobium genome may be quite prevalent and perhaps provides significant challenges and opportunities to normal genetic processes. As an initial step in evaluating this hypothesis, we constructed a plasmid series containing short d(CG) repeats and capable of replicating in H. halobium and E. coli, and we systematically studied the importance of d(CG) repeat length, superhelical density, and NaCl concentration in Z-DNA formation. As documented in this report, increasing the length of d(CG) repeats and DNA supercoiling, but surprisingly not salt concentration, were found to promote Z-DNA formation. E. coli strain DH5α was employed for most constructions and amplifications of plasmids. For isolation of plasmids with differing superhelical densities, E. coli strains JTT (topA+) and RS2 (topA−) (gifts of Dr. K. Drlica, Public Health Research Institute, New York) were used(25.Pruss G.J. Manes S.H. Drlica K. Cell. 1982; 31: 35-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Culturing and transformation with Ca2+ were done by standard procedures(26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). H. halobium NRC-1, a wild-type strain, was cultured in a medium containing 4.5 M NaCl at 37°C with illumination and shaking at 200 rpm(27.DasSarma S. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transformation of H. halobium was done by the polyethylene glycol-EDTA procedure of Cline and Doolittle(28.Cline S.W. Doolittle W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by plating on agar plates containing 10 μg/ml mevinolin (a gift of Merck, Sharp, and Dohme Research Laboratory, Rahway, NJ). Mevinolin was added at the same concentration for growth in liquid culture. Polydeoxyribonucleotide d(CG)n (Sigma) was partially digested with BssHII restriction endonuclease (which cleaves at the recognition sequence G′CGCGC) (restriction enzymes and polymerases were purchased from New England Biolabs or Bethesda Research Laboratories), and the 5′-overhanging ends were then converted to blunt ends by filling in with the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of dGTP and dCTP. After ligation with SmaI-digested pUC12, E. coli strain DH5α was transformed with the reaction mixture. Plasmids purified from transformants were digested with HindIII and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, and the approximate sizes of inserts were estimated by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Several plasmids containing d(CG) inserts of different sizes were chosen for further analysis by DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was carried out using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with the universal sequencing primer and dITP label mix to determine the exact length of the d(CG) stretch present in inserts. Plasmids containing various sizes of d(CG)n stretches from n = 5 to 17 were obtained (29.Kim, J.-M. 1995 Left-handed Z-DNA in Halobacterium halobium. Ph.D. thesis, University of Massachusetts, AmherstGoogle Scholar) and designated as pJKCGn, with n representing the number of d(CG) repeats. To construct a shorter d(CG) length insert, pJKCG5 was digested with BssHII, treated with S1 nuclease, and self-ligated to form pJKCG3, and pJKCG8 was digested with BssHII, and the larger fragment was self-ligated to form pJKCG4. Plasmid DNAs were isolated by the alkaline lysis method followed by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation in the presence of ethidium bromide(26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For construction of E. coli-H. halobium shuttle vectors containing d(CG)n sequences, pUC12 and pJKCGn (n = 3-7) plasmids were digested with HindIII, and the 5′-overhanging ends were filled in by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I followed by SalI digestion. The 2.65-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pair(s)ZIBSZ-DNA immunoband shiftbpbase pair(s). fragments were isolated by electroelution after electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, ligated with SmaI-XhoI-digested pCY3(24.Yang C.-F. Kim J.-M. Molinari E. DasSarma S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Plasmids isolated from E. coli transformants were analyzed by restriction mapping and transformed into H. halobium. Plasmids were purified from H. halobium by a previously published procedure(30.DasSarma S. Fleischmann E.M. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Halophiles. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). These plasmids were designated as pJKSUC and pJKSCG3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described in Sambrook et al.(26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). kilobase pair(s) Z-DNA immunoband shift base pair(s). This assay utilized the well characterized Z22 monoclonal antibody to detect left-handed Z-DNA (a gift of Prof. B. D. Stollar, Tufts University Medical School, Boston)(31.Lafer E.M. Moller A. Nordheim A. Stollar B.D. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3546-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The standard procedure involved incubation of plasmid (0.1 μg) with 0.2 μg of Z22 antibody for 2 h at 37°C in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 M NaCl. After sequential addition of 2.25 μl of formaldehyde and 2 μl of glutaraldehyde (32.Krishna P. Morgan A.R. van de Sande J.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 711-719Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and incubation on ice for 15 min each, the reaction mixture was passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column and lyophilized to remove aldehydes. The DNA-antibody complex was incubated with 10 units of HinfI in a 20-μl reaction volume at 37°C for 2 h. The 3′-recessed ends were labeled by the addition of 10 μl of 1 nmol of dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP; 1 pmol of [α-32P]dATP (10 mCi/ml, 3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.); and 0.2 unit of Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the labeled restriction fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography on x-ray film. The bands containing Z-DNA were shifted mostly to the origin of the gel, and the decrease of band intensity was used as the criterion for Z-DNA formation. Band intensity was quantified using a PDI densitometry system (Huntington Station, NY) running on a SUN Sparcstation IPC (Mountain View, CA). These results were confirmed in duplicate or triplicate. For S1 nuclease assays, plasmid DNAs (1 μg) were treated with 0.1 unit of S1 nuclease in 20-μl reactions containing 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM zinc acetate at 37°C for 10 min. After extraction with phenol twice and with chloroform once, DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. DNA was dissolved in 10 μl of deionized water, denatured by the addition of 10 μl of 0.8 M NaOH and incubation at room temperature for 10 min, neutralized by the addition of sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to 0.45 M, and precipitated with ethanol. Primer extension was carried out at 37°C for 1 h in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 0.5 pmol of primer (either the forward universal primer or the reverse primer, previously labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP), 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.05 mM dNTPs, and 0.5 unit of Klenow fragment. Reaction products were fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide, 8.3 M urea gels and subjected to autoradiography. For the standard restriction inhibition assay, 1.5 μg of pJKCGn plasmid was incubated with 6 units of BssHII restriction endonuclease at 37°C in a 50-μl reaction volume. Aliquots were removed at various time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mM EDTA and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The digestion mixtures were fractionated by electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide(26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The intensity of supercoiled DNA bands was quantitated using the PDI densitometry system. DNA supercoiling assays were carried out using pCY1, a 5.3-kb plasmid that had been constructed by ligation of two fragments, the mev gene fragment obtained from pNGMEV100 as a 3.5-kb BamHI fragment (33.Ng W.-L. DasSarma S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4584-4586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the SalI fragment of a 1.8-kb Halobacterium plasmid pGRB1(34.Hackett N.R. Krebs M.P. DasSarma S. Goebel W. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and transformation of H. halobium. Plasmid DNA was first purified by CsCl ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation and agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmid topoisomers were generated by treatment of pCY1 with wheat germ topoisomerase I (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of ethidium bromide. The reactions contained 4 μg of pCY1, 4 units of topoisomerase I, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0-12 μg/ml ethidium bromide and incubated for 6 h at 30°C. The reaction mixtures were extracted three times with (10 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA saturated with phenol and twice with chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in H2O. Plasmid was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels containing 0-6 μM chloroquine(35.Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4876-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 36.Singleton C.K. Wells R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out for 6-18 h at 3-4 volts/cm with circulation of buffer (0.1 mM Tris •base, 0.1 M boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA), and gels were stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and destained before photography under uv illumination. For quantitative analysis of Z-DNA formation within alternating d(CG) sequences, a plasmid series containing d(CG)n stretches of various lengths was examined by the ZIBS assay. For this assay, plasmids were incubated with Z22 monoclonal antibody specific for Z-DNA, and antibody-DNA complexes were cross-linked by treatment with aldehydes. The plasmids were then digested with HinfI restriction endonuclease, end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP, and electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels. If there was Z-DNA formation in d(CG) stretches, antibody-HinfI fragments of 218 ± d(CG)n-bp size complexes were shifted up to the origin of the gel. Reduction of band intensity was quantified by densitometry, and the change was used as a criterion for Z-DNA formation. Intensities of unshifted restriction fragments were used as controls for quantitation. Using the ZIBS assay, we examined Z-DNA formation in d(CG)n stretches in plasmids isolated from E. coli DH5α (Fig. 1). No differences were observed for the 218-bp HinfI fragment containing the multiple cloning site of pUC12 and the corresponding fragment of pJKCG3 (lanes 3 and 4, respectively), indicating no Z-DNA formation in the d(CG)3 sequence. For pJKCG4 (lane 5), about a 20% decrease in intensity of the d(CG)-containing band relative to the corresponding band of pJKCG3 was observed, indicating that about 20% of the d(CG)4 sequence in pJKCG4 is in the Z-DNA conformation. For pJKCG5, a decrease of about 90% band intensity was found (lane 6), indicating that the corresponding portion of the d(CG)5 sequence is nearly completely in Z-DNA conformation in the supercoiled plasmid. Similarly, complete Z-DNA formation was observed in plasmids containing alternating d(CG) sequences greater than 10 bp in length, including d(CG)7 and d(CG)13 (lanes 7, 8, and data not shown). No band shift was observed in linear pJKCG13 (lane 9), showing the requirement of supercoiling for Z-DNA formation in these short d(CG) stretches. This result indicated that the transition from B-DNA to Z-DNA conformation occurs from d(CG)4 to d(CG)5 in supercoiled plasmids isolated from E. coli DH5α. To rule out the possibility that Z22 antibody is promoting Z-DNA formation (37.Revet B. Zarling D.A. Jovin T.M. Delain E. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3353-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38.Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Rich A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in the ZIBS assay, we utilized an independent method involving S1 nuclease. S1 nuclease is known to cleave at single-stranded regions occurring at B-Z junctions(4.Singleton C.K. Klysik J. Stirdivant S.M. Wells R.D. Nature. 1982; 299: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and the site of cleavage can be mapped at the nucleotide level by primer extension analysis. S1 nuclease-treated pJKCGn plasmid DNAs were denatured, annealed with 32P-labeled sequencing primer (or reverse sequencing primer; data not shown), and then primers were extended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and dNTPs (Fig. 2). Synthesized cDNAs were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with sequencing reaction mixtures generated using the same primers. S1 cleavage was detectable at the ends of d(CG)n sequences in pJKCG4 and to a greater extent in pJKCG5 and pJKCG6 (lanes 3-5), reflecting Z-DNA formation. The degree of Z-DNA formation in the S1 nuclease-primer extension experiment was consistent with the ZIBS assay result, confirming that a d(CG)4 stretch is the minimum length required for Z-DNA formation and that the Z-DNA formation observed in the ZIBS assay is not a result of induction or stabilization of left-handed conformation by antibody. Activities of several restriction and modification enzymes are known to be sensitive to DNA conformation(39.Azorin F. Hahn R. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5714-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40.Lesnik E.A. Bes'chetnikova Z.A. Maslova R.N. Varshavsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It was shown that BssHII cleavage of a d(CG)7 sequence is inhibited when present on a highly negatively supercoiled plasmid but not when relaxed(39.Azorin F. Hahn R. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5714-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that BssHII is sensitive to DNA conformation. Z-DNA formation in the pJKCGn plasmid series was examined by an inhibition assay using BssHII. For the standard restriction inhibition assay, 1.5 μg of pJKCGn plasmids containing different lengths of d(CG) segments were incubated with 6 units of BssHII. Aliquots were taken after various time periods and electrophoresed in an agarose gel (data not shown). The amount of supercoiled molecules remaining was quantitated by densitometry and plotted as a function of time (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, pJKCG4 and pJKCG5 were both completely cleaved, but pJKCG4 was cleaved more slowly (30 min) than pJKCG5 (15 min). Partial resistance to cleavage was observed for pJKCG6, and the inhibition of BssHII cleavage increased for plasmids with increasing d(CG)n length. Plasmids containing d(CG)8 or longer stretches were cleaved only partially even when excess enzyme was present (10 units/μg of DNA, 2 h; data not shown). For 50% cleavage of supercoiled plasmids, pJKCG5 required 5 min, pJKCG6 required 10 min, and pJKCG8 required about 2 h, indicating greater Z-DNA conformation in longer d(CG) stretches. Earlier studies showed that high salt concentration induced B-Z transition in poly d(CG) nucleotides (1.Pohl F.M. Jovin T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) and plasmids containing long stretches of d(CG) sequences(10.Stirdivant S.M. Klysik J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10159-10165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Klysik J. Stirdivant S.M. Larson J.E. Hart P.A. Wells R.D. Nature. 1981; 290: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of NaCl on shorter stretches of d(CG) repeats, we treated plasmids that in the absence of salt were not in Z-DNA form (pJKCG3), or only partially (20%) in Z-DNA form (pJKCG4), with various concentrations of NaCl (0.1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 M) and carried out the ZIBS assay. The result in Fig. 4A showed that no detectable change in Z-DNA formation could be observed with increasing NaCl concentrations in either plasmid (lanes 1-10). The possibility of an inhibitory effect of salt on Z22 antibody binding was ruled out by the lack of reduction in antibody binding to pJKCG11 (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-5) (and also in pJKCG5 and pJKCG7; data not shown) at the higher NaCl concentrations. The effect of NaCl on more negatively supercoiled DNA isolated from the E. coli topA− mutant strain also showed no distinguishable salt effect on Z-DNA formation (see below). These results indicate that NaCl does not have a measurable effect on Z-DNA formation in plasmids at the superhelical densities occurring in E. coli. To examine the effect of salt on d(CG) repeats in linear DNA fragments, pJKCGn plasmids were digested with HinfI before antibody binding, incubated with various concentrations of NaCl, and then assayed for Z-DNA formation using the band shift assay (Fig. 4B). None of the d(CG)n sequences up to n = 17, including the d(CG)11 sequence in pJKCG11 (lanes 6-10), showed Z-DNA formation in the 0.1-4 M NaCl concentration range. These results showed that high salt concentrations cannot stabilize Z-DNA in short d(CG)n sequences flanked by large regions of B-DNA segments in linear molecules. Plasmid DNA of different superhelical densities were obtained from an E. coli topA+ strain, JTT, and an isogenic topA− strain, RS2(25.Pruss G.J. Manes S.H. Drlica K. Cell. 1982; 31: 35-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 42.Sternglanz R. DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Becherer K. Zumstein L. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 1992; 89: 8784-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Differences in linking deficiency of plasmids were observed in agarose gel electrophoresis containing 5 μM chloroquine, indicating that plasmids isolated from the topA RS2 strain were 25% more negatively supercoiled than from the JTT strain (Fig. 5C). Plasmids pUC12 and pJKCG3 isolated from each strain showed no difference by the ZIBS assay (data not shown); however, 40% more Z-DNA formation was observed in pJKCG4 isolated from RS2 (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 5-8) than JTT (lanes 1-4). These results confirmed the importance of DNA supercoiling on Z-DNA formation. However, the addition of NaCl up to 4.5 M concentration (lanes 4 and 8) did not promote the formation of Z-DNA in either pJKCG3 or pJKCG4, indicating that salt does not affect the B-Z equilibrium. The effect of supercoiling on Z-DNA formation in the pJKCGn plasmids was also analyzed by BssHII restriction inhibition analysis. Plasmids isolated from E. coli JTT (topA+) and RS2 (topA−) strains were treated with BssHII, and the intensity of supercoiled plasmid DNA was plotted against time (Fig. 6). Plasmids isolated from the topA− RS2 strain showed more resistance to cleavage than the same plasmids isolated from the topA+ JTT strain. Plasmid pJKCG4 isolated from the topA− strain showed a similar level of restriction inhibition as pJKCG6 isolated from the topA+ strain. Restriction inhibition of pJKCG5 from the topA− strain was inhibited to an extent similar to that of pJKCG8 isolated from the topA+ strain(29.Kim, J.-M. 1995 Left-handed Z-DNA in Halobacterium halobium. Ph.D. thesis, University of Massachusetts, AmherstGoogle Scholar). The linking deficiency of plasmids was previously shown to be much more negative in H. halobium than in E. coli on average, but in several cases individual topoisomers were not resolved due to the large sizes of these plasmids(24.Yang C.-F. Kim J.-M. Molinari E. DasSarma S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 840-845Cro"
https://openalex.org/W2071754818,"The mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (p120Ras-GAP) interacts with activated members of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins to accelerate their deactivation by sharply increasing their rates of GTP hydrolysis. Among the Ras-family proteins interacting with p120Ras-GAP is Rap1A/Krev1, whose activity is not affected by p120Ras-GAP but which competes with Ras for p120Ras-GAP. A second protein that interacts with p120Ras-GAP is p190Rac-GAP, which activates the GTPase of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the Rho family (including Rac1 and Rac2). Both these p120Ras-GAP-binding proteins are of interest in connection with the regulation of the respiratory burst oxidase, Rap1A/Krev1 because it copurifies with cytochrome b558, and p190Rac-GAP because it inhibits the Rac2-dependent activation of the respiratory burst oxidase in a cell-free system. Using an 18-mer antisense oligonucleotide, we were able to decrease the expression of p120Ras-GAP in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes. Under conditions where p120Ras-GAP expression was significantly depressed by antisense oligonucleotides, we observed a 40% increase in protein kinase C-dependent but not receptor-dependent O2⋅¯ production. In contrast, sense and scrambled oligonucleotides had no effect on either p120Ras-GAP expression or O2⋅¯ production. Our results suggest a role for p120Ras-GAP as a negative regulator in the protein kinase C-mediated activation of the respiratory burst oxidase.

The products of the mammalian N-, K-, and Ha-ras genes are 21-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that possess a low intrinsic GTPase activity(1.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev.

The activity of Ras depends on the ratio of bound GTP to GDP, a value that is determined by certain regulatory proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as Sos (8.Puil L. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 275-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and Vav(9.Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), which activate Ras by catalyzing the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, and GTPase-activating proteins such as the NF-1 gene product (10.De Clue J.E.

Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1281-1283PubMed Google Scholar). p120Ras-GAP is a monomeric 120-kDa cytosolic protein that greatly accelerates the conversion of p21Ras•GTP to the conformationally inactive GDP-bound form(12.McCormick F.

Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Accordingly, p120Ras-GAP has been proposed as a negative regulator of Ras in cellular processes. This proposal is consistent with the finding that overexpression of p120Ras-GAP blocks oncogenic transformation (14.Nori M. Vogel U.S. Gibbs J.B. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2812-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15.DeClue J.E. Zhang K. Redford P. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, since the site of interaction of p21Ras•GTP with p120Ras-GAP overlaps the effector region of Ras, it has been proposed that p120Ras-GAP may also serve as an effector protein of active Ras(17.Adari H. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Der C.J. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 240: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18.Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. D'Alonzo J.S. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4725-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). p120Ras-GAP consists of a C-terminal domain that interacts with Ras and an N-terminal portion containing two Src homology (SH2) domains and one intervening SH3 domain (reviewed in (19.Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar)). The p21Ras•GTP-p120Ras-GAP complex may interact with downstream effectors via these Src-homology domains. SH2 domains bind phosphotyrosine residues and have been implicated in the interactions of tyrosine kinases of the Src family with their effector proteins(20.Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 21.Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (e.g. c-Src and Lck) have been shown to associate with and phosphorylate p120Ras-GAP(22.Park S. Liu X. Pawson T. Jove R. J. Biol.

In fibroblasts transformed by cytoplasmic and receptor-like tyrosine kinases(25.Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), p120Ras-GAP forms complexes with two phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, p62 and p190Rac-GAP. The complex with p62 appears to involve the SH2 domains of p120Ras-GAP(26.Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the formation of the p120Ras-GAP-p190Rac-GAP complex is dependent on phosphorylation(28.Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that it too involves the p120Ras-GAP SH2 domains. The complex itself has diminished p120Ras-GAP activity in vitro(28.Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 and p190Rac-GAP have been detected in anti-p120Ras-GAP immunoprecipitates from various activated or transformed B- and T-cell lines(30.Gold M.R. Crowley M.T. Martin G.A.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 895-901PubMed Google Scholar), and were proposed to participate in signal transduction in these cells. The p120Ras-GAP-associated p190Rac-GAP stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac1 and Rac2, which are Rho family guanine nucleotide-binding proteins(32.Settlemen J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In human phagocytes, Rac2 plays a significant role in the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase(33.Dorseuil O.

The human oxidase consists of two membrane-bound components (gp91phox and p22phox) and at least three cytosolic components (p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2) that after cellular activation assemble to form the active enzyme (reviewed in (36.Chanock S.J.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-p47phox or p67phox antibodies raised against peptide sequences of these proteins were used as described previously(29.Park J-W. El Benna J. Scott K.E. Christensen B.L.

Pansorbin (dried protein A-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Cowan I strain), GF109203X (GFX; a relatively specific inhibitor of protein kinase C), ionomycin (a Ca2+ ionophore), and horseradish peroxidase were from Calbiochem. Protein G-agarose beads (protein G-Sepharose) were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Tran35S-label was from ICN (Irvine, CA). The human EBV-transformed B lymphocyte cell line EW was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Newburger (University of Massachusetts School of Medicine). Cultures were maintained under subconfluent conditions in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (55°C, 30 min) fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and fungizone. Cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C under 6% CO2. Viability of the lymphoblastoid cells was routinely >90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. An 18-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide sequence complementary to a sequence spanning the published ATG initiation region of the human p120Ras-GAP message (43.Trahey G. Wong G. Halenbeck R. Rubinfeld R. Martin G.A. Ladner M. Long C.M. Crosier W.J. Watt K. Koths K. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 242: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) was designed with the help of the OLIGO program (45.Paterson B.M. Roberts B.E. Kuff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4370-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) to optimize for sites with maximum melting temperature with minimum self-complementarity and minimum dimer formation. Unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides with the antisense sequence 5′-GCCATCATGTTGAAGCCG-3′, the corresponding sense sequence 5′-CGGCTTCAACATGATGGC-3′, and a scrambled sequence designed using a random number generator (5′-CACGTACGGCTAAGTGCT-3′) were synthesized in the core lab facility of The Scripps Research Institute and purified by twice precipitating them from 0.5 M NaCl with ethanol. Their purity was routinely checked by analytical reversed phase HPLC (C8 column, 0.1-50% acetonitrile in 100 mM triethylammonium acetate, pH 7.0), detecting at 260 nm. Analytical 19% urea-PAGE (44.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) showed that >90% of the oligonucleotides were full length. Low passage cells 2High passage cells were refractory to the effects of the antisense nucleotide. were washed 3 times in Opti-MEM and then incubated with 0.1 mM oligonucleotides for 24 h in serum-free Opti-MEM at a starting cell density of 4 × 105/ml. The cells were then washed once in HBSS and used either for immunoblotting or for the measurement of O2⋅¯ production. The stability of the oligonucleotides under the chosen incubation conditions in the presence and absence of cells was evaluated by HPLC. For this purpose, 50 μM oligonucleotide was incubated at 37°C in serum-free Opti-MEM medium with or without 5 × 105 EBV-transformed lymphocytes under tissue culture conditions. At the times indicated, 0.5-ml portions of incubation mixture were withdrawn, and DNA was purified by extracting twice with phenol/chloroform. After washing twice with ether, 0.2-ml portions of the aqueous layers were analyzed by HPLC as described above. The quantity of oligonucleotide was determined from the peak height. In every case, the mobility of the extracted oligonucleotide was identical to that of the unincubated oligonucleotide. After culture for 24 h in the presence of oligonucleotide, the cells were isolated by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 30 s at room temperature) and then lysed by incubation for 15 min on ice in Triton lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were assayed for protein content using the micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce). p120Ras-GAP was isolated from supernatants containing equal quantities of protein either by acetone precipitation (2 volumes of acetone (2-4 h at −20°C) followed by centrifugation) or by immunoprecipitation (monoclonal anti-p120Ras-GAP antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads, washing the immunoprecipitates 3 times with Triton lysis buffer before release from the beads). The precipitated proteins were dissolved by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel, Laemmli buffer) and subjected to immunoblotting to detect p120Ras-GAP (monoclonal anti-p120Ras-GAP at 1:2000 dilution) and oxidase subunits (rabbit polyclonal anti-p47phox at 1:5000 dilution and anti-p67phox at 1:1000 dilution), using the oxidase subunits as standards for protein loading. The proteins were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as phosphatase substrate. Experiments in which antisense p120Ras-GAP levels were not diminished as compared with sense and scrambled p120Ras-GAP levels were disregarded. EBV-transformed B lymphocytes were washed 3 times in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (DMEM-) and then incubated in the same buffer supplemented with 10 mM HEPES for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then isolated by centrifugation, suspended in DMEM- plus Tran35S-label (0.2 mCi/ml), and incubated for a further 60 min at 37°C. The radiolabeled cells were then washed in complete DMEM (DMEM plus cysteine/methionine) and cultured in complete DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum. At the intervals noted, 1-ml portions of the culture were withdrawn, and the cells were isolated by centrifugation and then lysed by suspension in Triton lysis buffer. p120Ras-GAP in the lysates was immunoprecipitated as described above. The washed immune complexes were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting on nitrocellulose, the quantities of p120Ras-GAP in the different samples were established as approximately equal by immunoblotting (see above), and the amount of 35S in each p120Ras-GAP band was measured with a phosphor imager. After incubation in the presence of the oligonucleotides, the lymphoblasts were isolated by centrifugation, washed once in HBSS, and resuspended in prewarmed (37°C) HBSS containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2. Viability of the resuspended cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion was >90%, a value not different from that obtained with untreated cells. After counting the cells and determining their viability, 2 × 105 live cells from each incubation were transferred to 96-well microtiter luminescence plates (Labsystems Inc.) and prewarmed at 37°C. After 5 min, luminol (10 μM final concentration), horseradish peroxidase (50 μg/ml), and either phorbol myristate acetate (1 μg/ml), Pansorbin (Calbiochem) (1 mg/ml), or ionomycin (0.1 μg/ml) as indicated were added to each well, yielding final incubation mixtures of 250-μl volume. Chemiluminescence from each well was then recorded at 37°C over 10 consecutive 1-min intervals, using the “repeatscan” mode of a microplate luminometer (Labsystems Luminoskan RS, Helsinki, Finland) and collecting data for 0.8 s. The results were reported as relative luminescence units. Using a monoclonal antibody against human p120Ras-GAP, we were able to immunoprecipitate p120Ras-GAP, together with the associated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins p62 and p190Rac-GAP, from resting and stimulated EBV-transformed B-cells (data not shown). Blotting of cell lysates with antibodies against p120Ras-GAP and the oxidase components p47phox and p67phox showed that p120Ras-GAP could be easily detected in lysates of even small amounts of cells (<5 × 105). The t1/2 for the turnover of p120Ras-GAP was 8-12 h, as measured in pulse-chase experiments with 35S-labeled cysteine/methionine (Fig. 1). In view of this observation and reports that oligonucleotides are readily taken up by EBV-transformed B lymphocytes (33.Dorseuil O. Vazquez A. Lang P. Bertoglio J. Gacon G. Leca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20540-20542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Cheung R.K. Dosch H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8667-8670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Roth G. Curiel T. Lacy J. Blood. 1994; 84: 582-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we decided to use antisense oligonucleotides to study the effect of p120Ras-GAP on the respiratory burst oxidase activity in this cell type. Subconfluent B-cell cultures were cultured without serum for 24 h in the presence of p120Ras-GAP-specific antisense, sense, or scrambled oligonucleotides. The cells were then assayed for 1) expression of p120Ras-GAP, and 2) O2⋅¯ production. In preliminary experiments with oligonucleotides end-labeled with 32P, we showed that the added oligonucleotides were taken up by the cells in a time-dependent fashion, with maximum uptake at 4 h as previously reported (40.Cheung R.K. Dosch H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8667-8670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, we found by HPLC that the oligonucleotide was not significantly degraded after culture for 24 h in medium alone and that even when cultured in the presence of the cells ˜20% of the oligonucleotide initially added was present after 24 h (Fig. 2). When the cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of the antisense oligonucleotide, expression of p120Ras-GAP was inhibited (Fig. 3). Immunoblots of cells treated with the antisense oligonucleotide showed a substantial reduction in the level of p120Ras-GAP as compared with untreated cells or cells treated with sense or scrambled oligonucleotides. By contrast, the levels of p47phox and p67phox were not significantly altered by incubation with antisense oligonucleotide, as revealed by parallel immunostaining of blots with specific antibodies against these two proteins. These results indicated that the suppression of p120Ras-GAP expression by the antisense oligonucleotide was specific and did not affect the expression of two irrelevant proteins related to the respiratory burst oxidase in this cell type. O2⋅¯ production by EBV-transformed B-cells treated with antisense, sense, or scrambled oligonucleotides was detected by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence of cells stimulated with phorbol, Pansorbin, or ionomycin. When antisense-treated cells were stimulated with phorbol we observed a significant enhancement of O2⋅¯ release in comparison with cells preincubated with sense or scrambled sequences (Fig. 4, top). This enhancement always correlated with a reduced expression of p120Ras-GAP and was not observed in cells incubated in the presence of the oligonucleotide for 3 days, conditions under which the expression of p120Ras-GAP had returned to levels seen after incubation with sense or scrambled oligos (data not shown). At 10 min, burst enhancement averaged 147 ± 10% (S.E.) in cells treated with 0.1 mM antisense oligonucleotide. When O2⋅¯ formation was triggered by Pansorbin, however, which acts through the cell's surface immunoglobulin receptors, the burst-enhancing effect of antisense oligonucleotides was not seen (Fig. 4, middle). O2⋅¯ production by Pansorbin-treated cells was much lower than that of phorbol-treated cells. To determine whether the difference in the effect of antisense oligonucleotides on phorbol-stimulated versus Pansorbin-stimulated cells was due to the weakness of the latter stimulus, antisense experiments were carried out on cells treated with ionomycin, another weak stimulus. Experiments with the protein kinase C inhibitor GFX showed that ionomycin, like phorbol but unlike Pansorbin, activated O2⋅¯ production by EBV-transformed B lymphocytes through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism (Fig. 5). Although levels of O2⋅¯ production in response to ionomycin were similar to those seen with Pansorbin, enhanced O2⋅¯ production in response to ionomycin was increased to 133 ± 8% (S.E.) of control by the antisense oligonucleotide. p120Ras-GAP has been connected to tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways, where it is thought to function downstream of activated Src-like protein tyrosine kinases or growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases(49.Lazarus A.H. Kawandri K. Rapoport M.J. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 778: 1765-1769Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 56.Pronk G.J. Polakis P. Wong G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Bos J. McCormick F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar). In T-cells, p120Ras-GAP is bound to Lck and becomes specifically phosphorylated by this Src-like tyrosine kinase(23.Amrein K.E. Flint N. Panholzer B. Burn P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3343-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since Lck has been reported to play a significant role in EBV-induced growth of transformed B lymphocytes(40.Cheung R.K. Dosch H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8667-8670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and since antisense oligonucleotides against Lck inhibited the growth of EBV-transformed B-cells, we examined the effects of the p120Ras-GAP antisense oligonucleotide on this parameter. We found that when p120Ras-GAP expression was significantly reduced, the cell count after 24 h was low (Fig. 6). Despite this decrease in cell proliferation, O2⋅¯ production was increased in cells incubated with the antisense oligonucleotide. Antisense strategy is a useful approach for elucidating the role of different proteins in signal transduction(46.Stein C.A. Cheng Y.-C. Science. 1993; 261: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Using an 18-mer antisense oligonucleotide spanning the start codon of the p120Ras-GAP message, we examined the function of p120Ras-GAP in the control of respiratory burst oxidase activity in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes. In agreement with Cheung and Dosch(40.Cheung R.K. Dosch H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8667-8670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that these cells took up oligonucleotides in a time-dependent fashion and that the antisense oligonucleotide, but not the sense or scrambled oligonucleotide, was able to reduce the expression of p120Ras-GAP. When p120Ras-GAP expression was reduced, O2⋅¯ production by phorbol-and ionomycin-stimulated lymphocytes increased, although O2⋅¯ production by protein A (Pansorbin)-stimulated cells remained unchanged. Both phorbol- and ionomycin-stimulated O2⋅¯ production, but not the Pansorbin-triggered burst, appear to be dependent on the activation of protein kinase C, as indicated by results obtained with GFX. The antisense results, therefore, point to a specific role for p120Ras-GAP in the protein kinase C-dependent activation of the respiratory burst oxidase in EBV-transformed B-cells. Several laboratories have presented evidence showing a link between p120Ras-GAP and protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathways. In T-cells, an increase in the amount of active p21Ras that was induced by phorbol but not by receptor-dependent stimuli has been related to a protein kinase C-mediated inactivation of p120Ras-GAP(7.Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, overexpression of p120Ras-GAP inhibited the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by phorbol but not by receptor-dependent stimuli(16.Nori M. L'Allemain G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), presumably by causing a selective blockade of signals from activated protein kinase C due to the inactivation of p21Ras. Thus, for both cell types, p120Ras-GAP has been proposed as a negative regulator in a protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway. Our results point to a similar role for p120Ras-GAP as a down-regulator of a protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway leading to an activated NADPH-oxidase. Among the factors that regulate the activity of small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins is p190Rac-GAP, a 190-kDa protein that accelerates the deactivation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the Rho class(32.Settlemen J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). p190Rac-GAP is of interest in regard to oxidase activation because Rac2, one of its targets, is known to participate in the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase both in the cell-free system (47.Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in whole cells(33.Dorseuil O. Vazquez A. Lang P. Bertoglio J. Gacon G. Leca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20540-20542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In accord with this idea, p190Rac-GAP was shown to inhibit Rac2-dependent oxidase activation in the cell-free system (37.Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Settlemen J. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 49.Lazarus A.H. Kawandri K. Rapoport M.J. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 778: 1765-1769Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). p190Rac-GAP is known to associate with p120Ras-GAP in many cell types (25.Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 26.Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 30.Gold M.R. Crowley M.T. Martin G.A. McCormick F. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Lazarus A.H. Kawandri K. Rapoport M.J. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 778: 1765-1769Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we found a phosphorylated 190-kDa protein, which could be identified as p190Rac-GAP, in immunoprecipitates of p120Ras-GAP from EBV-transformed B lymphocytes (data not shown). The possibility therefore exists that the deficiency of p120Ras-GAP induced by the antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a deficiency of p190Rac-GAP, leading to persistent oxidase activity due to a delay in the deactivation of Rac2. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect p190Rac-GAP on Western blots of extracts from oligonucleotide-treated cells, so we have no direct evidence as to the effect of the antisense oligonucleotide on p190Rac-GAP concentrations in the transformed lymphocytes. However, our finding that phorbol-dependent but not receptor- (i.e. Pansorbin-) dependent oxidase activation is affected by the antisense oligonucleotide is difficult to explain on the basis of an indirect effect of p120Ras-GAP mediated through p190Rac-GAP, because Rac2 is involved in both phorbol- and receptor-mediated activation of the respiratory burst oxidase (33.Dorseuil O. Vazquez A. Lang P. Bertoglio J. Gacon G. Leca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20540-20542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so that an effect occurring via p190Rac-GAP should have involved both phorbol-activated and receptor-activated O2⋅¯ production. The results therefore suggest a direct effect of p120Ras-GAP on the oxidase activation cascade. Rap1A is a member of the Ras superfamily of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Its participation in the regulation of oxidase activity is suggested by its copurification with cytochrome b558(50.Quinn M.T. Mullen M.L. Jesaitis A.J. Linner J.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by the finding that overexpression of Rap1A mutants fixed in either the active or inactive conformation decrease oxidase activity in transfected B lymphocytes(51.Maly F.E. Quilliam L.A. Dorseuil O. Der C.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18743-18746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since p120Ras-GAP has been shown to interact with the putative effector region of rap1A in vitro(52.Polakis P.G. Rubinfeld B. Evans T. McCormick F. Biochemistry. 1991; 88: 239-243Google Scholar), p120Ras-GAP could participate in the physiological regulation of Rap1A by competitively interfering with its deactivation by Rap1-GAP, an 85-95-kDa Rap1-specific GTPase-activating protein (53.Kazlauskas A. Ellis C. Pawson T. Cooper J.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Accelerated deactivation of Rap1A in the p120Ras-GAP-depleted cell could therefore account for the effect of the antisense oligonucleotide on oxidase activity. Whether a mechanism based on Rap1A deactivation could account for the difference between phorbol-activated and receptor-activated cells remains to be determined. A third alternative is presented by the interactions between the N-terminal SH2 domain of p120Ras-GAP and various proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosines(19.Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 25.Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 54.Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 55.Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The inhibition in the growth of EBV-transformed B-cells by the p120Ras-GAP antisense oligonucleotide could result from interactions between p120Ras-GAP and proteins other than p190Rac-GAP or p62, the two proteins that are commonly found in p120Ras-GAP immunoprecipitates. The Src-like tyrosine kinase Lck is a candidate of particular interest, since Lck forms a complex in vitro with the phosphorylated N-terminal SH2 domain of p120Ras-GAP(23.Amrein K.E. Flint N. Panholzer B. Burn P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3343-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is thought to play a significant role in the transformation of EBV-transformed B lymphocytes(40.Cheung R.K. Dosch H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8667-8670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of cell growth caused by p120Ras-GAP antisense oligonucleotides might somehow be connected to the interaction between p120Ras-GAP and Lck."
