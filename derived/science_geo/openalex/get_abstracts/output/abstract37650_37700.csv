https://openalex.org/W2072140252,"The neu oncogene, which is frequently activated in neuro- and glloblastomas of BDIX rats, was originally identified in the NIH 3T3 focus-forming assay. cDNA clones of the normal and transforming alleles of neu have been isolated. When these clones are inserted into the expression vector pSV2, they direct the synthesis of p185, the neu gene product. The transforming cDNA clone yields foci when transfected onto a NIH 3T3 monolayer, but the normal cDNA does not. The construction of in vitro recombinants between the normal and transforming cDNAs has allowed the determination of the mutation responsible for the activation of the neu proto-oncogene. A single point mutation changes a valine in the transmembrane domain of the predicted protein product insert to a glutamic acid. The DNAs from four independent cell lines containing activated neu oncogenes contain the identical mutation at this position."
https://openalex.org/W2064378491,A biologically active complementary DNA clone of a transforming gene present in a human colon carcinoma contains gene sequences of both tropomyosin and a previously unknown protein tyrosine kinase. The predicted protein (641 amino acids) encoded by this oncogene seems to have been formed by a somatic rearrangement that replaced the extracellular domain of a putative transmembrane receptor by the first 221 amino acids of a non-muscle tropomyosin molecule.
https://openalex.org/W2046196550,"Earlier studies showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) exerts a mitogenic effect in human diploid fibroblasts. Here we demonstrate that purified E. coliderived recombinant human TNF inhibits encephalomyocarditis virus replication in “aged” human fibroblasts. Addition of neutralizing antibodies to human beta interferon (IFN-β) blocked the antiviral action of TNF, indicating that this action is mediated by the generation of IFN-β. We also show that antiserum to IFN-β enhanced the mitogenic effect of TNF in confluent, serum-starved human fibroblasts, suggesting that induction of IFN-β by TNF represents a physiological negative feedback mechanism regulating cell proliferation. Blot hybridization analysis of cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA showed that TNF induced IFN-β2 mRNA, whereas no induction of IFN-β1 mRNA could be demonstrated. The results suggest that IFN-β2 has biological functions distinct from the other interferons."
https://openalex.org/W1599662080,"It is found that both the inward and outward transport of cystine and glutamate through the plasma membrane of cultured human fibroblasts is mediated mostly by a single transport system. Cystine and glutamate at one side of the membrane stimulate the passage of these amino acids present at the other side of the membrane. When the concentration of intracellular glutamate is reduced to near zero, cystine hardly enters the cell, and likewise the release of glutamate from the cell ceases when cystine is absent in the medium. Homocysteate and alpha-aminoadipate share this transport system and, when added, similarly participate in the transport process. Since the intracellular pool of cystine is negligibly small whereas that of glutamate is very large, the physiologic flows via this system are the entry of cystine and the exodus of glutamate coupled together. Measurements of the rate of uptake of cystine into the cells and the rate of release of glutamate from the cells indicate that the entry of cystine and the exodus of glutamate occur at a ratio close to 1:1. Since cystine is known to behave as an anionic form in this transport, it is concluded that the transport system for cystine and glutamate in plasma membrane of human fibroblasts is a kind of an anion-exchanging agency."
https://openalex.org/W2061120858,"Transcription of the Escherichia coli glnALG operon, whose products are glutamine synthetase and the regulatory proteins NRII and NRI, is activated by nitrogen deprivation. Initiation of transcription at the nitrogen-regulated promoter glnAp2 requires sigma 60, the product of rpoN (glnF, ntrA), and NRI, the product of glnG (ntrC). We have now shown that the ability of this promoter to be activated by a low intracellular concentration of NRI depends on two binding sites for NRI located approximately 110 and 140 bp, respectively, upstream of the start of transcription. Moving these binding sites more than 1000 bp does not diminish the ability of NRI to stimulate transcription at glnAp2. Thus, the NRI binding sites resemble enhancers in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136287764,"Two novel early B lymphocyte precursor populations have been identified by their capacity to differentiate in Whitlock-Witte bone marrow cultures. Cells expressing neither the B lineage antigen B220 nor Thy-1 contain committed B cell precursors which differentiate in short-term culture into pre-B and B cells. The other population expresses low levels of Thy-1, and lacks B220 as well as the T cell markers L3T4 and Lyt-2. The Thy-1+ cells which initiate long-term B cell cultures contain clonogenic B cell precursors at a frequency of 1 in 11, a 100-fold enrichment over unseparated bone marrow. Thy-1+ cells are also highly enriched for myeloid-erythroid precursors (CFU-S). Thy-1+ cells allow long-term survival of lethally irradiated mice and fully reconstitute the hematopoietic system, including T and B lymphocyte compartments. These results indicate that this population (approximately 0.1% of bone marrow) may contain the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell."
https://openalex.org/W1566921440,"An atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) receptor from rat lung was solubilized with Lubrol-PX and purified by sequential chromatographic steps on GTP-agarose, DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-agarose, and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The ANF receptor was enriched 19,000-fold. The purified receptor has a binding profile and properties that correspond to the affinity and specificity found in membranes and crude detergent extracts. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified preparation in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol showed the presence of one major protein band with a molecular mass of 120,000 daltons. When purified preparations were incubated with 125I-ANF, then cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate, the 120,000-dalton protein was specifically radiolabeled. This high affinity binding site for ANF co-purified with particulate guanylate cyclase. Particulate guanylate cyclase was purified to a specific activity of 19 mumol cyclic GMP produced/min/mg of protein utilizing Mn-GTP as substrate. This represented a 15,000-fold purification compared to the initial lung membrane preparation with Lubrol-PX. Gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography and glycerol density gradient sedimentation studies of the purified preparation also resulted in co-migration of specific ANF binding and guanylate cyclase activities. The co-purification of these activities suggests that both ANF binding and guanylate cyclase activities reside in the same macromolecular complex. Presumably ANF binding occurs at the external membrane surface and cyclic GMP synthesis at the internal membrane surface of this transmembrane glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2105149671,"The regulation of the intermediary steps of the catecholamine-stimulated GTPase cycle by beta-adrenergic agonists and Mg2+ was investigated using unilamellar phosphatidylethanolamine-phosphatidylserine vesicles that contained purified beta-adrenergic receptor and the stimulatory GTP-binding protein of the adenylate cyclase system, Gs. The steady-state turnover number of the agonist-stimulated GTPase, normalized according to the receptor-responsive pool of Gs, was 0.8 min-1 for untreated vesicles and 1.7 min-1 for vesicles that had been treated with dithiothreitol to activate the receptors. The binding and release of [alpha-32P]GTP, [3H] GTP, and [gamma-32P]GTP were used to measure the binding and hydrolysis of GTP and the release of GDP. Agonist-liganded receptor stimulated both the binding of GTP and the release of the GDP product, and GDP release per se did not appear to be the mechanism by which receptor stimulated the binding of GTP. Both processes displayed apparent first order rate constants of about 0.5 min-1 for untreated vesicles and both rates increased about 5-fold after dithiothreitol treatment. Both processes were formally catalytic with respect to receptor, in that several (up to 8) molecules of Gs were stimulated per molecule of receptor. The hydrolysis of Gs X GTP to Gs X GDP was unaltered by agonist and occurred with a rate constant of about 4 min-1. The rates of these partial reactions were consistent with the overall rate of steady-state hydrolysis and with the ability of the agonist-liganded receptor to promote the formation of sufficient Gs X GTP to fully stimulate adenylate cyclase in a native membrane. The Mg2+ dependence of agonist-stimulated, steady-state GTPase activity appeared to consist of at least two, distinct Mg2+-requiring processes. Very low concentrations of Mg2+ (approximately 20 nM) were required for hydrolysis of Gs X GTP, and 10 microM Mg2+ was required to maximize the initial rate of agonist-stimulated [alpha-32P] GTP binding."
https://openalex.org/W1604249157,"Bovine aortic and cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and cultured segments of canine common carotid artery possess functional receptors for the nonapeptide bradykinin which mediate a rapid increase in the formation of [3H]inositol 1-phosphate, [3H]inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate from cell membranes containing isotopically labeled myo-inositol. Bradykinin stimulated the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates from cells in culture or tissues at threshold concentrations of 0.1 nM and 1 nM, and with a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.6-1.0 nM and 30 nM, respectively. In cultured cells, the formation of [3H]inositol trisphosphate and [3H]inositol bisphosphate preceded the formation of [3H]inositol monophosphate. Similarly, [3H]inositol phosphate formation was not inhibited by addition of calcium channel blockers, a calcium chelator, or an intracellular calcium antagonist. Calcium ionophore A23187 did not promote [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. The receptor selectivity of the bradykinin response in cultured cells was most compatible with a type-2 mediated response. Kallidin stimulated with the same potency as bradykinin but was more potent than methionyl-lysyl-bradykinin or des-Arg9-bradykinin. The B1 receptor antagonists des-Arg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin and des-Arg10-[Leu9]-kallidin were without effect. The rapidity of the inositol phosphate response as well as the close correspondence between the bradykinin type-2 receptor mediated hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides and changes in prostacyclin synthesis, vessel dilation, and permeability suggests that breakdown products of inositol lipids serve as second messengers mediating the effects of bradykinin on the vascular endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1674580118,"Clathrin-coated vesicles contain a proton translocating ATPase which is insensitive to azide but inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. The ATP hydrolytic subunit of this proton pump has been solubilized, partially purified, and reconstituted into H+-ATPase-depleted coated vesicle membranes (Xie, X.-S., Stone, D.K., and Racker, E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11676-11678). In this communication we report that the entire proton transporting complex has been solubilized and purified 200-fold. The complex, when reconstituted into brain lipid liposomes, catalyzes azide-resistant, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive H+ transport manifested as both generation of a pH gradient and an electrical gradient. The complex has an apparent molecular mass of 530 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1662761325,"Mixed-function oxidation of glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli causes loss of catalytic activity. The inactivation correlates with the loss of 1 of 16 histidine residues/subunit (Levine, R.L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11823-11827). A cyanogen bromide peptide containing the oxidizable histidine has been isolated. Within the protein, the sequence is Met-His-Cys-His-Met. This hydrophilic sequence likely forms one of the divalent metal-binding sites of glutamine synthetase. Binding of Fe2+ to this site permits generation of an activated oxygen species which reacts with a nearby histidine residue. This site-specific free radical mechanism accounts for the specificity of the mixed-function oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2056694609,"Amplified DNA can be found in arrays of large repeated units, with each repeat unit containing a marker gene and surrounding DNA sequences. Amplified DNA sequences from established cell lines were assessed for the presence of repeat units in the form of inverted duplications. Inverted duplicated DNA was detected by virtue of its concentration-independent resistance to S1 hydrolysis after denaturation and rapid renaturation. Using this assay, inverted duplications were detected in amplified DNA (both DM and HSR configurations) containing the myc gene (16–50 copies/cell) in four human tumor cell lines and in amplified DNA containing the CAD gene (30–200 copies/cell) in three PALA-resistant BHK cell lines. The widespread association of inverted duplications with amplified DNA must bear on the amplification mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2049927057,"The adrenergic control of glucose homeostasis is mediated in part through variations in the release of pancreatic hormones. In this study, purified pancreatic A and B cells were used to identify the recognition and messenger units involved in the adrenergic regulation of glucagon and insulin release. Catecholamines induced beta-adrenergic receptor activity in A cells and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor activity in B cells. The two recognition units provoked opposite variations in the production of cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, the beta-adrenergic unit enhancing the nucleotide's permissive effect on amino acid-induced glucagon release and the alpha 2-adrenergic unit inhibiting that upon glucose-induced insulin release. In both cell types, catecholamines interact powerfully with the synergistic control of hormone release by nutrient- and (neuro)hormone-driven messenger systems."
https://openalex.org/W2044902565,"The calcium hypothesis of synaptic transmission has been challenged by experimental results using the crayfish neuromuscular junction that suggest that presynaptic depolarization can trigger transmitter release directly without calcium influx. Results from electrophysiological experiments using the same preparation do not support this voltage hypothesis, but are consistent with the calcium hypothesis. Voltage may modulate, but not elicit, transmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W1602399609,"The construction and isolation of three recombinant DNAs complementary to different mouse L-cell Mr = 68,000 heat shock protein (hsp68) mRNAs is described. cDNA libraries derived from heat-shocked mouse L-cell poly(A)+ RNA by the vector-linked primer strategy of cDNA synthesis and cloning of Okayama and Berg (Okayama, H., and Berg, P. (1982) Mol. Cell. Biol. 2, 161-170) were screened first with a Drosophila hsp70 heterologous probe and subsequently with a cDNA probe isolated from the first screening. Positive clones were assigned to one of three sets based on their restriction map, and the largest member of each group was chosen for further analysis. All three cDNAs hybrid-select mRNA for the mouse major heat shock protein (hsp68) as assayed by in vitro translation and hybridize preferentially to two heat shock-induced hsp68 mRNAs on Northern blots. The coding regions of the cDNAs are almost identical and closely resemble other HSP70 genes but the 3' untranslated regions diverge considerably. Differences in the lengths of the untranslated regions are responsible for the two different sized induced hsp68 mRNAs in mouse L-cells. The physical maps of these cDNA clones and the limited number of mouse genomic DNA fragments detected on Southern blots suggest that there are at least three closely related heat shock-inducible members of the mouse HSP70 gene family. None of the cloned cDNAs are derived from the two related cognate genes known to be present in the mouse genome."
https://openalex.org/W1603328068,"We here report the isolation and nucleotide sequencing of a full-length 3.3-kilobase cDNA for the cytoplasmic form of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, a regulated enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The cDNA was isolated from UT-1 cells, a compactin-resistant line of Chinese hamster ovary cells. UT-1 cells produce large amounts of mRNA for HMG-CoA synthase and the next enzyme in the pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, as a result of growth in the presence of compactin, a competitive inhibitor of the reductase. The identity of the cDNA for HMG-CoA synthase was confirmed through comparison of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA with that determined chemically from the purified enzyme. Anti-peptide antibodies directed against the amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA precipitated HMG-CoA synthase activity from liver cytoplasm. The feeding of cholesterol to hamsters led to a decrease of more than 85% in the amount of mRNA for HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase in hamster liver. These data indicate that the mRNAs for cytoplasmic HMG-CoA synthase and for HMG-CoA reductase, two sequential enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, are coordinately regulated by cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1582484725,"Screening of a rat liver cDNA expression library constructed in the vector lambda gt11 with an affinity purified antiserum to rat phenylalanine hydroxylase has resulted in the isolation of two clones which contain the complete coding region (1362 base pairs) of phenylalanine hydroxylase and the entire 3'-untranslated region (562 base pairs). From the nucleotide sequence we deduced the amino acid sequence of the enzyme. The molecular weight is 51,632 (452 amino acids). The rat enzyme is highly homologous to human phenylalanine hydroxylase. The two proteins differ in only 36 amino acids (92% homology), many of which are conservative changes. A dot matrix computer program was used to analyze regions of homology with the amino acid sequence of rat tyrosine hydroxylase. Considerable homology was detected from amino acid 140 in the rat enzyme to the C terminus, but little or no homology was apparent in the N-terminal region. The cDNA clone was used to determine the levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA in rat tissues using RNA blot hybridization. Two mRNA species were detected, with approximate lengths of 2,000 and 2,400 nucleotides, which appear to derive from use of alternate polyadenylation signals. No difference in mRNA size was found in rats which have different phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles. The kidney was found to contain about 10% of the mRNA found in the liver, and no phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA was detected in rat brain. Reuber H4 hepatoma cells were also analyzed for phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA. The parental cells contained mRNA species of the same sizes as in rat liver. Incubation in 10(-6) M hydrocortisone for 24 h resulted in an 18-fold increase in the mRNA level. Mutant hepatoma cells which express very little phenylalanine hydroxylase contained less than 5% of the parental mRNA, but the gene still responded to hydrocortisone."
https://openalex.org/W1513043585,"The modification of both beta-Tyr-368 and beta-His-427 can be correlated with the loss of activity observed when the bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase is inactivated with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl[3H]adenosine ([3H]FSBA). At pH 8.0, where the rate of inactivation is fast, beta-Tyr-368 is modified predominantly, while at pH 6.0, where the rate of inactivation is slow, beta-His-427 is modified predominantly. At pH 7.0, the 2 residues are modified with about equal efficiency. When the F1-ATPase was inactivated by 80% at pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5, the sum of radioactivity incorporated into beta-Tyr-368 and beta-His-427 was 1.99, 1.87, and 1.82 mol of label incorporated per mol of enzyme, respectively. Examination of the rate of inactivation of the enzyme by FSBA as a function of pH revealed two pKa values, one of about 7.6 associated with the modification of beta-Tyr-368 and the other of about 5.8 associated with the modification of beta-His-427. The inactivation of the F1-ATPase by FSBA exhibited an initial fast rate followed by a slower rate in triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.0. In contrast, only a single rate, equivalent to the fast phase of inactivation in the absence of phosphate, was observed in 0.2 M phosphate, pH 7.0. The dependence of this stimulation on phosphate concentration is sigmoidal with half-maximal stimulation occurring at approximately 160 mM. The ratio of 3H incorporated into beta-Tyr-368 to that incorporated into beta-His-427 was approximately the same during the fast and slow phases of inactivation in triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.0. Approximately the same ratio was observed when the enzyme was modified during the single phase of inactivation exhibited in the presence of 0.2 M phosphate, pH 7.0. The sum of the 3H incorporated into beta-Tyr-368 and beta-His-427 during inactivation of the F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria by [3H]FSBA in the presence and absence of phosphate was linear and extrapolated to a value of about 2.6 residues modified on complete inactivation of the enzyme. From these data, it is concluded that FSBA binds to a single binding site on the beta subunits of the enzyme where it reacts with either beta-Tyr-368 or beta-His-427 in mutually exclusive reactions. All three beta subunits must be modified in this manner for complete inactivation to be observed."
https://openalex.org/W1589562115,"It was shown that somatostatin (SRIF) inhibited cAMP-dependent vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-stimulated prolactin (PRL) release by a GH3 clonal strain of rat pituitary tumor cells and decreased basal PRL secretion and inhibited PRL release in response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) whose action was independent of prior synthesis of cAMP. Pretreatment of these cells with pertussis toxin prevented SRIF's inhibitory effects on basal and TRH-stimulated hormone secretion as well as its VIP-stimulated responses. The blockade of SRIF's inhibitory effect on the actions of TRH or VIP was dependent on both the duration of preincubation and concentration of the toxin and was correlated with the ability of the toxin to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of the 39,000-Da membrane protein. It is likely that this pertussis toxin substrate is involved in signal transduction of SRIF on cAMP-dependent actions of VIP and cAMP-independent action of TRH. However, the mechanism of SRIF's action on TRH is not clear, since SRIF did not affect the intracellular responses by TRH, neither intracellular Ca2+ mobilization nor the increase of 1,2-diacylglycerol formation following the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides."
https://openalex.org/W1499496491,"In Dictyostelium discoideum cells, extracellular cAMP induces the rapid (within 2 s) activation of guanylate cyclase, which is followed by complete desensitization after about 10 s. cAMP binding to these cells is heterogeneous, showing a subclass of fast dissociating sites coupled to adenylate cyclase (A-sites) and a subclass of slowly dissociating sites coupled to guanylate cyclase (B-sites). The kinetics of the B-sites were further investigated on a seconds time scale. Statistical analysis of the association of [3H]cAMP to the B-sites and dissociation of the complex revealed that the receptor can exist in three states which interconvert according to the following scheme. (formula; see text). cAMP binds to the BF-state (off-rate 2.5 s) which rapidly (t1/2 = 3 s) converts to the BS-state (off-rate 15 s) and subsequently (without a detectable delay) into the BSS-state (off-rate 150 s). In membranes, both the BS- and BSS-states are converted to the BF-state by GTP and GDP, suggesting the involvement of a G-protein. Densensitized cells show a 80% reduction of the formation of the BSS-state, but no reduction of the BF- or BS-state. These data are combined into a model in which the transitions of the B-sites are mediated by a G-protein; activation of the G-protein and guanylate cyclase is associated with the transition of the BS- to the BSS-state of the receptor, whereas desensitization is associated with the inhibition of this transition."
https://openalex.org/W1526372681,"At low concentrations, diethylstilbestrol (DES) is shown to be a potent F0-directed inhibitor of the F0F1-ATPase of rat liver mitochondria. In analogy to other F0-directed inhibitors, DES inhibits both the ATPase and ATP-dependent proton-translocation activities of the purified and membrane bound enzyme. When added at low concentrations with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a covalent inhibitor, DES acts synergistically to inhibit ATPase activity of the complex. At higher concentrations, DES restores DCCD-inhibited ATPase activity. However, there is no restoration of ATP-dependent proton translocation. Under these conditions DCCD remains covalently bound to the F0F1-ATPase complex and F1 remains bound to Fo. Significantly, when the F0F1-ATPase is inhibited by the Fo-directed inhibitor venturicidin rather than DCCD, DES is also able to restore ATPase activity. In contrast, DES is unable to restore ATPase activity to F0F1 preparations inhibited by the Fo-directed inhibitors oligomycin or tricyclohexyltin. However, combinations of [DES + DCCD] or [DES + venturicidin] can restore ATPase activity to F0F1 preparations inhibited by either oligomycin or tricyclohexyltin. Results presented here indicate that the F0 moiety of the rat liver mitochondrial proton ATPase contains a distinct binding site for DES. In addition, they suggest that at saturating concentrations simultaneous occupancy of the DES binding site and sites for either DCCD or venturicidin promote uncoupled ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1574809776,"Dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyzes the third step in eukaryotic de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. In mammalian cells, this enzyme activity is carried by a large chimeric protein, CAD, that also catalyzes the first two steps in the pathway: glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase) and aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase). Controlled elastase cleavage of CAD released a 44,000 +/- 2,000-dalton proteolytic fragment which catalyzed only the dihydroorotase reaction. We have devised a rapid and simple method for the isolation of the DHO domain from elastase digests. The domain, which was obtained in 36% yield, was found to be homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The domain was also characterized by amino acid analysis and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography peptide mapping. The amino terminus of both the DHO domain and intact CAD was blocked suggesting that this domain is located at the extreme amino terminus of the CAD polypeptide, a result consistent with the suspected juxtaposition of domains as DHO-CPS-ATC. The isoelectric point of the DHO domain was 5.1, while that of the ATC domain was 9.4, so that the ends of the CAD polypeptide are oppositely charged at physiological pH. Immunoblotting with DHO domain-specific antibodies showed that a 47-kDa species was generated in the early stages of controlled proteolysis of CAD. Thus there are two elastase cleavage sites within a 3-kDa connecting region that links the DHO and CPS domains. The domain was shown by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and by isolating a 65Zn-containing DHO domain from mammalian cells grown in the presence of the radionuclide to contain 1 g eq of tightly bound zinc in each polypeptide chain. Zinc was not found in any other CAD domain. Chelating agents inhibit dihydroorotase activity of the isolated domain supporting the conclusion, based on studies of intact CAD by others, that zinc participates in catalysis. At moderate protein concentrations the DHO domain was a 88,000 dimer with a Stokes radius of 37.6 A, a S20,w = 5.1 X 10(-13) s, a diffusion coefficient of 3.17 X 10(-7) cm2 s-1, and a frictional ratio of 1.26. On dilution the dimer dissociated and was in rapid concentration-dependent equilibrium with a 43,500 monomer. The hydrodynamic parameters of the monomer have also been estimated (Stokes radius of 29.8 A, D20,w = 4.11 X 10(-7) cm2 s-1, and f/f0 1.21).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1482607235,"Two classes of ADP binding sites at 20 degrees C have been characterized in the F1-ATPase from the thermophilic bacterium, PS3 (TF1). One class is comprised of three sites which saturate with [3H]ADP in less than 10 s with a Kd of 10 microM which, once filled, exchange rapidly with medium ADP. The binding of ADP to these sites is dependent on Mg2+. [3H]ADP bound to these sites is removed by repeated gel filtrations on centrifuge columns equilibrated with ADP free medium. The other class is comprised of a single site which saturates with [3H]ADP in 30 min with a Kd of 30 microM. [3H]ADP bound to this site does not exchange with medium ADP nor does it dissociate on gel filtration through centrifuge columns equilibrated with ADP free medium. Binding of [3H]ADP to this site is weaker in the presence of Mg2+ where the Kd for ADP is about 100 microM. [3H]ADP dissociated from this site when ATP plus Mg2+ was added to the complex while it remained bound in the presence of ATP alone or in the presence of ADP, Pi, or ADP plus Pi with or without added Mg2+. Significant amounts of ADP in the 1:1 TF1.ADP complex were converted to ATP in the presence of Pi, Mg2+, and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide. Enzyme-bound ATP synthesis was abolished by chemical modification of a specific glutamic acid residue by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but not by modification of a specific tyrosine residue with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzofurazan. Difference circular dichroism spectra revealed that the three Mg2+ -dependent, high affinity ADP binding sites that were not stable to gel filtration were on the alpha subunits and that the single ADP binding site that was stable to gel filtration was on one of the three beta subunits. It has also been demonstrated that enzyme-bound ATP is formed when the TF0.F1 complex containing bound ADP was incubated with Pi, Mg2+, and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1599371161,"The driving forces for L-glutamate transport were determined in purified canalicular (cLPM) and basolateral (i.e. sinusoidal and lateral; blLPM) rat liver plasma membrane vesicles. Initial rates of L-glutamate uptake in cLPM vesicles were stimulated by a Na+ gradient (Na+o greater than Na+i), but not by a K+ gradient. Stimulation of L-glutamate uptake was specific for Na+, temperature sensitive, and independent of nonspecific binding. Sodium-dependent L-glutamate uptake into cLPM vesicles exhibited saturation kinetics with an apparent Km of 24 microM, and a Vmax of 21 pmol/mg X min at an extravesicular sodium concentration of 100 mM. Specific anionic amino acids inhibited L-[3H]glutamate uptake and accelerated the exchange diffusion of L-[3H]glutamate. An outwardly directed K+ gradient (K+i greater than K+o) further increased the Na+ gradient (Na+o greater than Na+i)-dependent uptake of L-glutamate in cLPM vesicles, resulting in a transient accumulation of L-glutamate above equilibrium values (overshoot). The K+ effect had an absolute requirement for Na+. In contrast, in blLPM the initial rates of L-glutamate uptake were only minimally stimulated by a Na+ gradient, an effect that could be accounted for by contamination of the blLPM vesicles with cLPM vesicles. These results indicate that hepatic Na+ gradient-dependent transport of L-glutamate occurs at the canalicular domain of the plasma membrane, whereas transport of L-glutamate across sinusoidal membranes results mainly from passive diffusion. These findings provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the ability of various in vitro liver preparations to transport glutamate and suggest that a canalicular glutamate transport system may serve to reabsorb this amino acid from bile."
https://openalex.org/W1650077776,"In cultures of dermal fibroblasts, procollagen and the intermediates pC- and pN-collagen accumulated in the culture medium with little further processing to collagen. When polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other neutral polymers were added to fibroblast culture medium, no collagen or procollagen was found in the medium, but all the collagen was associated with the cell layer. The type I procollagen was fully processed to collagen with an initial transient accumulation of pN-collagen, and the processed collagen formed covalently cross-linked dimers. The presence of pepsin-sensitive COOH-terminal telopeptides and the accumulation of pN-collagen in PEG-treated cultures of dermatosparactic fibroblasts indicated that it was likely that processing occurred via the correct in vivo propeptidase activities. At the levels used in this study, PEG did not have any toxic effect during the incubation period on the fibroblasts in culture, since the amount of total protein synthesis was not altered by addition of PEG to cultures. However, the level of collagen production was reduced to about half, indicating that there was increased degradation or that the released collagen propeptides or the accumulation of processed collagen in association with the cells exerted a feedback regulation on collagen synthesis. Addition of neutral polymers to the culture medium provided a simple means of achieving complete and accurate processing of procollagen which more closely resembled the in vivo process."
https://openalex.org/W2005479792,A glutamine synthetase gene from alfalfa (Medicago sativa) has been expressed in Escherichia coli after fusion of bacterial transcription and translation signals to a complete alfalfa glutamine synthetase coding sequence. Synthesis of the alfalfa glutamine synthetase enzyme in Escherichia coli was demonstrated by functional genetic complementation of a glutamine synthetase-deficient mutant and by immunoblotting analysis. These results should facilitate protein engineering and structure-function analysis of the plant enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1599576575,"The plasma membrane H+-ATPase from bakers' yeast was purified and reconstituted with phosphatidylserine. The steady state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the H+-ATPase were studied over a wide range of Mg2+ and ATP concentrations. Whereas MgATP was the substrate hydrolyzed, excess concentrations of either Mg2+ or ATP were inhibitory. The dependence of the steady state initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis on the concentration of MgATP at a fixed concentration of Mg2+ was sigmoidal rather than hyperbolic. This precluded mechanisms involving only activation and inhibition by Mg2+ and competitive inhibition by ATP. Two alternative interpretations of these results are: 1) the enzyme possesses multiple catalytic sites which interact cooperatively; or 2) the enzyme can exist in multiple conformational states which catalyze MgATP hydrolysis by parallel pathways. The rate laws for both mechanisms are identical so that the two mechanisms cannot be distinguished on the basis of the kinetic data. The data are well fit by the rate law for these mechanisms with the inclusion of competitive inhibition by Mg2+ and ATP and an independent inhibition site for Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1511395291,"Cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase and microsomal HMG-CoA reductase are sequential enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway; both are negatively regulated by cholesterol. In this paper, we report the isolation of overlapping bacteriophage lambda clones that encompass the gene for hamster cytoplasmic HMG-CoA synthase. The gene spans 20 kilobases and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. Under conditions of high-level expression in cultured hamster cells and hamster liver, approximately 50% of the mRNAs contain two introns in the region of the gene corresponding to the 5' untranslated region. The remaining 50% contain only one intron as a result of the direct splicing of exon 1 to exon 3. The optional exon (exon 2) in the 5' untranslated region contains a 26-nucleotide sequence that is homologous to the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA for HMG-CoA reductase. Approximately 350 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site, the HMG-CoA synthase gene contains a sequence that is strongly homologous to the 72-base pair enhancer region of the SV40 virus. Approximately 125 nucleotides downstream of this region, the sequence CCGCCC, or its inverse complement GGGCGG, is repeated four times. Multiple copies of this sequence are present in the SV40 promoter and in the 5' flanking region of HMG-CoA reductase and several other cellular housekeeping genes. The availability of cloned genes for two consecutive negatively regulated enzymes of the cholesterol synthetic pathway should allow elucidation of the mechanism for this coordinate expression."

Transport studies, at short time periods, in recently isolated chromaffin cells have Vmax = 15 pmol/10(6) cells/min and Km = 1.1 microM in ATP-depleted cells. Endogenous levels of the various purine nucleosides and bases were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, with adenosine (3 +/- 1 nmol/10(6) cells), inosine (5.3 +/- 1.2 nmol/10(6) cells), and hypoxanthine (2.1 +/- 0.8 nmol/10(6) cells) being the purine metabolites found in the highest concentration. Taking into account the intracellular water, endogenous levels of 2.1, 3.8, and 1.5 mM, respectively, were obtained. Radioactively labeled adenosine inside the cell underwent enzymatic transformations, producing inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and nucleotides, with their appearance and distribution being a function of the incubation time. When nicotine was used as a secretagogue, the adenosine transformed into the nucleotide pool was released, reaching 18 +/- 8% of the total adenosine found in the nucleotides. Dipyridamole, extensively used clinically, was a strong inhibitor for the adenosine uptake into these cells, with Ki = 5 +/- 0.5 nM and noncompetitive kinetically."

Immunoreactive somatostatin within the anterior pituitaries was found exclusively within gonadotrophs. Similarly, a metallothionein-human growth-hormone fusion gene was also expressed selectively in gonadotrophs. It is proposed that sequences common to the two fusion genes are responsible for the gonadotroph-specific expression."
https://openalex.org/W1498851222,"The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused phosphorylation of phosphoproteins of 56-kDa which co-migrated with and had identical pI values to subunits of tyrosine hydroxylase. The phosphorylation was closely correlated with an increase of [3H]3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) production which is a reflection of increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Only those phorbol esters which activate protein kinase C induced phosphorylation of the 56-kDa proteins and increased [3H]DOPA production. Neither TPA-induced phosphorylation of the 56-kDa proteins nor TPA-induced enhancement of [3H] DOPA production required extracellular Ca2+. TPA caused increases in phosphorylation of the 56-kDa proteins and increases in [3H]DOPA production over similar concentration ranges (10-1000 nM). TPA did not increase cellular cAMP. The data suggest that phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine hydroxylase, possibly by protein kinase C, results in increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2149466700,"Resact, a peptide obtained from eggs, causes a change in the Mr, and a loss of 32P from a plasma membrane protein identified as guanylate cyclase. Here, a resact analog (125I-[Tyr1, Ser8] resact) was synthesized and shown to bind to isolated sperm membranes. Resact, but not speract, competed with the radiolabeled ligand for binding. When membranes were prepared under appropriate conditions, guanylate cyclase remained at Mr 160,000; the incubation of membranes with γ-32P-ATP resulted in the formation of 32P-labeled guanylate cyclase. The addition of resact to the membranes caused a shift in the Mr, a complete loss of 32P, and a 70% reduction in guanylate cyclase activity within 1 min; resact had an ED 50 at 100 nM concentration. Speract failed to cause any of these effects. This represents the first demonstration of receptor-mediated responses of isolated sperm membranes identical to those seen in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W31396097,"We have obtained 53 mg of 99% pure dihydroorotase from 10.9 g of frozen Escherichia coli pyrC plasmid-containing E. coli cells using a 4-step 16-fold purification procedure, a yield of 60%. We characterize the enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (a dimer of subunit molecular weight 38,300 +/- 2,900), high performance liquid chromatography gel sieving, amino acid analysis, amino terminus determination (blocked), and specific activity. The isolated enzyme contains 1 tightly bound essential zinc atom/subunit, and readily but loosely binds 2 additional Zn(II) or Co(II) ions/subunit which modulate catalytic activity; treatment of crude extracts with weak chelators suggests that the enzyme contains 3 zinc atoms/subunit in vivo. Two of the 6 thiol groups/subunit react rapidly with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) when 1 Zn/subunit enzyme is used, but slowly when 3 Zn/subunit enzyme is used. The 2 weakly bound Zn(II) ions/subunit protect against the reversible air oxidation which lowers the specific activity of the enzyme and renders it unreactive with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate). The dilution activation observed in the presence of substrate, the dilution inactivation observed in the absence of substrate, and the transient activation by the metal chelator oxalate are interpreted as evidence for an unstable, hyperactive monomer."
https://openalex.org/W2138586736,"Abstract Mutant genes for the beta subunit of H+-translocating ATPase (F0F1) were cloned from Escherichia coli strains isolated in this laboratory. Determination of their nucleotide sequence revealed four missense mutations (strain KF39, Glu-41----Lys; strain KF16 and KF42, Glu-185----Lys; strain KF48, Gly-223----Asp; KF26 and 4 other strains, Ser-292----Phe). Two nonsense mutants (strain KF40, Gln-361----end; strain KF20, Gln-397----end) were also identified. Glu-41, Glu-185, and Ser-292 are conserved in the amino acid sequences of the beta subunits so far studied, and Gly-223, Gln-361, and Gln-397 are conserved in beta subunits from bacteria and mitochondria, but not in those from chloroplasts. The amounts of F1 subunits in the membranes of these strains were studied by immunochemical assay and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In the mutants studied, the amounts of alpha and beta subunits in the membranes were 69-21 and 46-2%, respectively, of the amounts in wild-type membranes, the amount depending on the strain. No delta and epsilon subunits were detected in membranes of a missense mutant KF16, although reduced amounts of alpha and beta subunits could be detected, suggesting that the F1 portion may not be connected to F0 through the delta and epsilon subunits. The altered residues in missense mutants or missing domains in nonsense mutants may be important for the subunit-subunit interactions or assembly of the entire complex. Genetic experiments on introduction of suppressor tRNA into strains KF40 and KF20 suggested that F1 could be active even when residue 361 or 397 was replaced by a Ser, Leu, or Tyr residue."
https://openalex.org/W2150358192,"When the particulate fraction from a rat liver homogenate was incubated with [3H]putrescine and calcium, the radioactive amine was incorporated into the membranes via a transglutaminase-mediated reaction. Fractionation of the membranes by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation revealed that the radioactive label was coincident with the 5'-nucleotidase and transglutaminase activities which serve as markers for the plasma membrane (Slife, C. W., Dorsett, M. D., Bouquett, G. T., Register, A., Taylor, E., and Conroy, S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 241, 329-336). If the labeled membranes were treated with digitonin and fractionated, the radioactivity and the plasma membrane enzyme activities coincidentally shifted to a greater density. Examination of the [3H]putrescine-labeled membranes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography showed that the largest amount of radioactivity was associated with a large molecular weight material that did not enter the acrylamide gel. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the large aggregate already was present in the native membrane, or that it was formed very rapidly during the putrescine incubation. The complex did not result from putrescine cross-linking between proteins since dansylcadaverine and [3H]histamine were also selectively incorporated into it. These data show that there are protein substrates in the plasma membrane which are accessible to the membrane-associated transglutaminase and that the substrates form a large molecular weight aggregate which is not dissociated by sodium dodecyl sulfate and disulfide reducing agents."
https://openalex.org/W1485156961,"Levels of preprorelaxin mRNA in the rat ovary during pregnancy were determined by cell-free translation and by hybridization analyses with cloned preprorelaxin cDNA. Translation of poly(A+) RNA from rat ovaries taken at different stages of pregnancy resulted in the incorporation of [35S]cysteine into two peptides, of Mr 17,500 and 20,500, that were specifically bound by anti-relaxin IgG. Both peptides also were demonstrated by translation of ovarian poly(A+) RNA that was hybrid-selected with cloned preprorelaxin cDNA, the sequence of which corresponds to the Mr 20,500 peptide. The origin of the Mr 17,500 putative precursor is not presently known. Preprorelaxin mRNA translational activities corresponded to previously reported concentrations of relaxin in rat ovaries during pregnancy. The results of hybridization analyses, both by Northern blotting of poly(A+) RNA and dot blotting of unfractionated RNA, agreed with those of translation assays. Preprorelaxin mRNA activity/concentration was low in early pregnancy, rose markedly and reached a plateau on days 15-20 (about 1-2% of total translation activity), and then fell to low levels again by day 23, the time of parturition. These findings indicate that the concentration of relaxin in the rat ovary is directly dependent on preprorelaxin mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1595828216,"The nontumorigenic ARL-15C1 and tumorigenic gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-containing ARL-16T2 cell lines were found to contain approximately equal amounts of glutathione, cysteine, and cystine, 65.6, 3.5, and 5 nmol/mg of protein for ARL-16C1, and 61.5, 3, and 3 nmol/mg of protein for ARL-16T2, respectively. The half-life for glutathione in these cell lines was 3.2 and 3.8 h in the ARL-15C1 and 16T2, respectively. In ARL-15C1 cells, the cysteine half-life was 0.2 h and that of cystine 2.0 h compared to 2.0 h and 0.5 h, respectively, in the ARL-16T2. The turnover of glutathione in the ARL-15C1 could be accounted for by efflux into the medium whereas only 10% of the glutathione expected from ARL-16T2 cells appeared in the medium. The ARL-16T2 cells appear to support glutathione synthesis by conservation and recycling of cysteine residues. Inhibition of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by AT-125 (acivicin) caused extensive loss of intracellular glutathione from ARL-16T2 cells but produced no effect on GSH levels in ARL-15C1 cells. No metabolism of medium glutathione by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was detected, independent of AT-125 treatment. AT-125 treatment caused a transient increase in intracellular GSH in the ARL-16T2 but not the ARL-15C1, further suggesting that the enzyme catalyzes intracellular GSH recycling to supply cysteine for cellular functions in the tumorigenic ARL-16T2 cell line. Transport of cysteine, cystine, and methionine was not altered by AT-125 treatment. These data are consistent with an intracellular orientation of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in this cell line and not participation in extracellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1589962900,"The peptide somatostatin (SRIF) is secreted by delta cells of the endocrine pancreas and inhibits the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. We have previously shown that [125I-Tyr11]SRIF binds to specific, high affinity receptors on RINm5F insulinoma cells and that these receptors mediate the action of SRIF to inhibit insulin release. In the present study we investigated the processing of receptor-bound [125I-Tyr11]SRIF in this clonal cell line. Surface-bound and internalized peptides were distinguished by the ability of an acid/salt solution (0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2.5) to dissociate only exposed ligand-receptor complexes. Surprisingly, greater than 80% of saturably bound [125I-Tyr11]SRIF was removed by this acid wash independent of the time or temperature of the binding incubation. In contrast, the processing of receptor-bound [125I]EGF (epidermal growth factor) in RINm5F cells was markedly temperature-dependent. Although over 90% of saturably bound [125I]EGF was dissociated by acid after a 4 degrees C binding incubation, less than 10% was removed by acid treatment after 37 degrees C binding. The radioactivity released upon dissociation of receptor-bound [125I-Tyr11]SRIF was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and shown to consist of a mixture of intact peptide (40%) and [125I]tyrosine (60%). However, neither the rate of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF dissociation nor its degradation were affected by NH4Cl, methylamine, or leupeptin at concentrations which inhibited the lysosomal degradation of [125I] EGF. Of 11 other protease inhibitors tested, only the metalloendoprotease inhibitor, phosphoramidon, substantially reduced the degradation of receptor-bound [125I-Tyr11]SRIF. These data indicate that, unlike [125I] EGF, receptor-bound [125I-Tyr11]SRIF is not rapidly internalized by RINm5F cells and is degraded by a nonlysosomal process which may involve a metalloendoprotease."
https://openalex.org/W1605112378,"Abstract We have developed an in vitro translation system from heat-shocked and normal Drosophila cultured cells. The lysates retain regulation of translation typical of the whole cells from which they were prepared, both when programmed by endogenous mRNA and when RNA-dependent. These systems have been used to investigate the mechanism of shutdown of normal protein synthesis and selection of heat shock mRNAs for translation in heat shock in Drosophila. Supplementation of intact RNA-dependent lysates with separated ribosome or supernatant fractions from normal or heat-shocked translation systems showed the normal supernatant fraction could rescue normal protein synthesis in a heat shock lysate. Normal ribosomes had no rescuing activity and neither heat shock fraction affected translation in normal lysates. Reconstitution of the system from separated ribosomes and supernatant in normal and mixed combinations showed heat shock and normal ribosomes were both competent to support normal protein synthesis with normal supernatant. Heat shock supernatant did not support normal protein synthesis with ribosomes from either source. We conclude that the factors regulating translation in heat-shocked Drosophila cells are soluble factors in the lysate and that the soluble factors present in the normal lysate are dominant."
https://openalex.org/W1579363325,"Circular dichroism was used as a probe for competitive binding of two opioid peptides, dynorphin-(1-13) and beta-endorphin, with cerebroside sulfate, a membrane lipid thought to be part of the morphine receptor complex. The rationale was that bound beta-endorphin is partially helical but bound dynorphin-(1-13) remains unordered, thus making it possible to detect the degree of binding of beta-endorphin. The addition of dynorphin-(1-13) to a cerebroside sulfate solution of beta-endorphin invariably displaced beta-endorphin from the peptide-lipid complex, but the addition of beta-endorphin had little effect on dynorphin-(1-13) bound to the lipid. Similar results were obtained for competitive binding of the two peptides with two other amphiphiles, sodium dodecyl and decyl sulfate. The maximum number of binding sites on dynorphin-(1-13) and beta-endorphin was between five and six, which coincides with the five positively charged side chains plus an alpha NH+3 group at the NH2 terminus on both peptide molecules. The results support our working hypothesis that dynorphin-(1-13) may displace beta-endorphin bound to the receptor, which in turn can account for the inhibition of beta-endorphin-induced analgesia by dynorphin-(1-13)."
https://openalex.org/W1586825189,"Beef heart mitochondrial ATPase (F1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the ATP analog adenyl-5-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). The reaction products are inorganic phosphate and adenyl-5-yl phosphoramidate (AMP-PN) as determined by HPLC analysis. The hydrolysis occurs in both the presence and absence of added divalent metal ions and is stimulated by potassium. The kinetic properties of the hydrolytic reaction depend markedly on the identity of the added divalent metal. GMP-PNP and AMP-CPP are also hydrolyzed, while AMP-PCP is not. Adenyl-5-yl phosphoramidate is a potent effect of beef heart mitochondrial ATPase activity. Based on these data, a reinterpretation of work based on the assumption that AMP-PNP is not hydrolyzed is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1485335314,"Thirteen stable hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies specific for asparagine synthetase were established and one monoclonal antibody was chosen to produce an immunoaffinity resin for the purification of asparagine synthetase. Bovine pancreatic asparagine synthetase was purified to a specific activity of 395 nmol of Asn produced/min/mg. Electrophoresis of the affinity-purified enzyme in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels resulted in a single Mr = 54,000 polypeptide. Prior cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate resulted in a band at Mr = 52,500 (monomer) and two additional bands at Mr = 97,000 and 98,000 (dimers), suggesting the possibility of a heterogeneous enzyme population with slight differences in subunit composition. The ratio of Gln-dependent and NH3-dependent asparagine synthetase activities was constant for immunoaffinity-purified enzyme, but the ratios of glutaminase activity to synthetase activities varied, suggesting separate aspartate and glutamine binding sites. The monoclonal antibodies were tested as inhibitors of the Gln-dependent and NH3-dependent asparagine synthetase activities as well as for inhibition of the glutaminase activity of the enzyme. Two antibodies inhibited Gln- and NH3-dependent synthesis of asparagine, but did not affect the glutaminase activity of immunoaffinity-purified asparagine synthetase. A third monoclonal antibody inhibited Gln-dependent synthesis of asparagine and glutaminase activity, but activated NH3-dependent asparagine synthetase activity. These data are discussed in terms of multiple substrate binding domains within the asparagine synthetase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1606053818,"The effect of aurovertin on the binding parameters of ADP and ATP to native F1 from beef heart mitochondria in the presence of EDTA has been explored. Three exchangeable sites per F1 were titrated by ADP and ATP in the absence or presence of aurovertin. Curvilinear Scatchard plots for the binding of both ADP and ATP were obtained in the absence of aurovertin, indicating one high affinity site (Kd for ADP = 0.6-0.8 microM; Kd for ATP = 0.3-0.5 microM) and two lower affinity sites (Kd for ADP = 8-10 microM; Kd for ATP = 7-10 microM). With a saturating concentration of aurovertin capable of filling the three beta subunits of F1, the curvilinearity of the Scatchard plots was decreased for ATP binding and abolished for ADP binding, indicating homogeneity of ADP binding sites in the F1-aurovertin complex (Kd for ADP = 2 microM). When only the high affinity aurovertin site was occupied, maximal enhancement of the fluorescence of the F1-aurovertin complex was attained with 1 mol of ADP bound per mol of F1 and maximal quenching for 1 mol of ATP bound per mol of F1. When the F1-aurovertin complex was incubated with [3H]ADP followed by [14C]ATP, full fluorescence quenching was attained when ATP had displaced the previously bound ADP. In the case of the isolated beta subunit, both ADP and ATP enhanced the fluorescence of the beta subunit-aurovertin complex. The Kd values for ADP and ATP in the presence of EDTA were 0.6 mM and 3.7 mM, respectively; MgCl2 decreased the Kd values to 0.1 mM for both ADP and ATP. It is postulated that native F1 possesses three equivalent interacting nucleotide binding sites and exists in two conformations which are in equilibrium and recognize either ATP (T conformation) or ADP (D conformation). The negative interactions between the nucleotide binding sites of F1 are strongest in the D conformation. Upon addition of aurovertin, the site-site cooperativity between the beta subunits of F1 is decreased or even abolished."

DNA from the E. coli unc operon, which codes for the ATPase, was used in hybridization experiments to probe for homologous DNA in the Gram-positive sporulating bacterium Bacillus megaterium. Such DNA was identified and subsequently cloned into pBR322. In an E. coli in vitro transcription-translation system, the resultant plasmid directed the synthesis of a 52,000 Mr polypeptide which could be precipitated with antiserum to the E. coli F1-ATPase. This plasmid was also capable of complementing E. coli uncA and uncD mutants, defective in the alpha and beta subunits of the ATPase, respectively. Therefore, the cloned B. megaterium DNA carries the genes for the alpha and beta subunits, and perhaps for other subunits, of the proton-translocating ATPase of B. megaterium. These bacillus subunits can be synthesized and assembled in vivo into a functional hybrid E. coli-B. megaterium ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1486811280,"Demineralized bone (bone matrix) has a well-characterized ability to evoke the re-differentiation of cells derived from skeletal muscle into chondrocytes. Recent investigations in this laboratory have shown that muscle-specific (alpha) actin synthesis continues throughout redifferentiation. Conversely, expression of the cartilage phenotype is associated with repression of muscle-specific enzyme synthesis. The present experiments were undertaken to determine the mode of genomic regulation responsible for control of these muscle-specific syntheses. As part of these experiments, we investigated the ability of embryonic and adult RNA to direct translation in vitro. The results indicate that unfractionated (total) RNA is capable of directing the efficient synthesis of actin, but not myosin heavy or light chains. Decreased abundance of polyadenylated mRNA cannot account for lack of myosin synthesis. Polyadenylated mRNA, however, directed synthesis of actin and myosin with an efficiency greater than that of total RNA. This data suggested that embryonic total RNA was subject to translational control. Dot blot hybridization against cDNA probes for alpha-actin, myosin heavy chain, and fast light chains demonstrated that myogenic cells were subject to a pattern of mixed transcriptional and translational control. It is hypothesized that full expression of the muscle phenotype involves sequential release of transcriptional, and subsequently, the translational controls. We have also observed that cultures of skeletal muscle on bone matrix contain mRNA for muscle-specific proteins, even through the period normally characterized by chondrogenesis. In the absence of concurrent enzyme protein synthesis, it appears that one action of bone matrix is to continue genomic controls that in the source skeletal muscle maintain the genome in an embryonic (translationally repressed) state."
https://openalex.org/W1510829178,"[15N]Aspartate and 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAriboside) were used to evaluate the contribution of the purine nucleotide cycle to ammonia production in renal tubules isolated from control and chronically acidotic rats. Addition of 1 mM AICAriboside to incubation medium containing 2.5 mM [15N] aspartate significantly stimulated production of 15NH3 and 15N in the 6-amino group of adenine nucleotides during a 30-min incubation. In tubules from both control and acidotic animals, the levels of ATP, AMP, and NH3 were increased. In contrast, 5 mM AICAriboside inhibited 15NH3 production and reduced the total purine nucleotide content. In tubules from acidotic rats, enrichment in 15NH3 exceeded that in the 6-amino group of the adenine nucleotides, indicating that no precursor-product relationship existed between the purine nucleotide cycle and ammonia. Conversely, in tubules from control rats, 15N enrichment in the 6-amino group of the adenine nucleotides exceeded that in NH3. This relationship obtained whether or not AICAriboside was included in the incubation mixture. The current investigations show that the metabolism of aspartate through the purine nucleotide cycle is lower in renal tubules obtained from chronically acidotic rats than in control tubules. The observations indicate that AICAriboside has a biphasic effect on renal ammoniagenesis and adenine nucleotide synthesis, and suggest a possible clinical use of AICAriboside in cases of impaired ammonia formation in renal failure."
https://openalex.org/W1605832352,"High-resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy at 300 MHz has been used to investigate the aromatic residues of a series of homologous polypeptides from sea anemones: anthopleurin-A from Anthopleura xanthogrammica and toxins I and II from Anemonia sulcata. Using two-dimensional NMR techniques, specific assignments to individual protons have been made for all aromatic resonances in the spectra of these molecules. In all three polypeptides the resonances from the two conserved Trp residues, 23 and 33, are shifted significantly from their random coil values, and the indole NH resonance of Trp-23 is not observed. These shift perturbations are due in part to a mutual interaction of the two indole rings, which is also indicated by the observation of nuclear Overhauser enhancements between protons of the two rings. Several other nonpolar side chains also interact with these two Trp residues, forming a hydrophobic region, the overall structure of which is conserved throughout the series. The other aromatic residues in these polypeptides appear not to participate in this structural region."
