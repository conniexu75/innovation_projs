https://openalex.org/W2037454778,"TRAF6 is a signal transducer in the NF-kappaB pathway that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) in response to proinflammatory cytokines. We have purified a heterodimeric protein complex that links TRAF6 to IKK activation. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis reveals that this complex is composed of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and the Ubc-like protein Uev1A. We find that TRAF6, a RING domain protein, functions together with Ubc13/Uev1A to catalyze the synthesis of unique polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine-63 (K63) of ubiquitin. Blockade of this polyubiquitin chain synthesis, but not inhibition of the proteasome, prevents the activation of IKK by TRAF6. These results unveil a new regulatory function for ubiquitin, in which IKK is activated through the assembly of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains."

https://openalex.org/W1973918329,"Endothelial cells express two related vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR (kinase-insert domain containing receptor, or VEGFR-2) and Flt-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase, or VEGFR-1). Although considerable experimental evidence links KDR activation to endothelial cell mitogenesis, there is still significant uncertainty concerning the role of individual VEGF receptors for other biological effects such as vascular permeability. VEGF mutants that bind to either KDR or Flt-1 with high selectivity were used to determine which of the two receptors serves to mediate different VEGF functions. In addition to mediating mitogenic signaling, selective KDR activation was sufficient for the activation of intracellular signaling pathways implicated in cell migration. KDR stimulation caused tyrosine phosphorylation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ in primary endothelial cells and stimulated cell migration. KDR-selective VEGF was also able to induce angiogenesis in the rat cornea to an extent indistinguishable from wild type VEGF. We also demonstrate that KDR, but not Flt-1, stimulation is responsible for the induction of vascular permeability by VEGF.

Inhibition of VEGF activity using various inhibitors results in suppression of tumor growth in vivo (3Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N.

VEGF is also up-regulated in ischemic tissues and has been implicated as a potential therapy for peripheral and myocardial ischemia (7Ferrara N. Alitalo K. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). VEGF is expressed as at least four different splice isoforms (1Ferrara N. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 794-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The most abundantly expressed variant is VEGF165, which contains a heparin-binding domain. Two VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), are expressed on proliferating and quiescent endothelial cells (8Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Although Flt-1 exhibits higher affinity for VEGF165, its function in the adult vasculature is still poorly understood. Mice lacking the complete Flt-1 gene display an increased number of endothelial progenitors and vascular disorganization and die in utero at embryonic day 9 (9Fong G.H. Zhang L. Bryce D.M. Peng J. Development. 1999; 126: 3015-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). However, animals homozygous for a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain are fertile and do not display any obvious defects (11Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 4: 9349-9354Crossref Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Mice in which the flk-1/KDR gene has been inactivated also die at embryonic day 9. They are deficient in vasculogenesis and also lack blood island formation (12Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). Placenta growth factor (PlGF) shares 53% identity with the platelet-derived growth factor-like domain of VEGF (13Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). It binds Flt-1 with high affinity but is unable to interact with KDR (14Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PlGF exerts minimal effects on cell growth and migration, suggesting that binding to Flt-1 alone is not sufficient to mediate these activities. In some instances, however, effects of PlGF on mitogenicity and MAP kinase activation have been reported (15Landgren E. Schiller P. Cao Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In recent studies, the effects of PlGF on endothelial cells have been compared with those of another VEGF-like molecule, VEGForf. Members of the VEGForf gene family have been isolated from the Orf parapoxyvirus, and the encoded proteins bind to KDR but not Flt-1 (16Wise L.M. Veikkola T. Mercer A.A. Savory L.J. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Vitali A. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3071-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,17Meyer M. Clauss M. Lepple-Wienhues A.

VEGForf mediates migration of KDR-expressing PAE cells and corneal angiogenesis to an extent that is comparable with VEGF (17Meyer M. Clauss M. Lepple-Wienhues A. Waltenberger J. Augustin H.G. Ziche M. Lanz C. Buttner M. Rziha H.J. Dehio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar,18Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, the residues mediating VEGForf binding to KDR are unknown because the three basic amino acids comprising the major determinants of VEGF binding to the KDR receptor are absent in VEGForf. In addition, VEGForf does not possess the heparin-binding domain found on VEGF. These differences may complicate conclusions about VEGF function, drawn from studies using VEGForf proteins. VEGF binding to KDR leads to receptor phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3K and PLCγ. Although Flt-1 becomes phosphorylated and can activate several signaling molecules when expressed in heterologous cells (19Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether these signaling events also occur in endothelial cells in response to Flt-1 engagement. Recent studies have shown that KDR signaling results in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase up-regulation and activation (20Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33057-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide plays a critical role in the VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as increased vascular permeability, hypotension, and angiogenesis in vivo(21Fujii E.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF stimulates the formation of vasodilator prostaglandins, which have been implicated as mediators of VEGF-induced vascular permeability but not new blood vessel formation (21Fujii E. Irie K. Ohba K. Ogawa A. Yoshioka T. Yamakawa M. Muraki T. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M. Bauters C. Masuda H. Kalka C. Kearney M. Chen D. Symes J.F. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that a VEGF mutant chimeric protein that is unable to trigger KDR activation can cause vascular permeability to an extent that is similar to that of wild type VEGF (26Stacker S.A. Vitali A. Caesar C. Domagala T. Groenen L.C. Nice E. Achen M.G. Wilks A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34884-34892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This led the authors to conclude that either Flt-1 or another as yet unknown receptor is responsible for the increase in vascular permeability in response to VEGF administration. We sought to address these issues using novel, highly selective, VEGF mutants generated by phage-display technology (27Li B. Fuh G. Meng G. Xin X. Gerritsen M.E. Cunningham B. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29823-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have demonstrated that VEGF interacts differently with its cognate receptors KDR and Flt-1. Hence, it has been possible to generate VEGF mutants that show a strong preference for binding either one or the other receptor. Compared with an earlier generation of receptor specific mutants (28Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the novel mutants display a substantially increased selectivity and thus are more likely to yield relevant results pertaining to the function of each individual VEGF receptor. By selectively activating Flt-1 or KDR in primary endothelial cells, we have studied the involvement of each individual receptor in mediating VEGF signaling and cell migration. KDR activation alone is sufficient for the activation of signal transducers involved in mitogenesis and cell migration. Selective KDR engagement also inducesin vivo angiogenesis and vascular permeability. HUVEC were purchased from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA). LY 294002 was purchased from Biomol. The construction and characterization of Flt-1- and KDR-selective VEGF are described by Liet al. (27Li B. Fuh G. Meng G. Xin X. Gerritsen M.E. Cunningham B. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29823-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mutations are as follows: KDR-selective VEGF D63S/G65M/L66R and Flt-selective VEGF I43A/I46A/Q79A/I83A. The mutations were introduced into VEGF165 and wild type VEGF, and the receptor-selective mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (28Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The endotoxin content of the purified material did not exceed 0.2 Eu/mg. The determination of binding affinities of the receptor-selective VEGF mutants was carried in solution as described (29Cunningham B.C. Lowe D.G. Li B. Bennett B.D. Wells J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) utilizing soluble IgG-Fc fusions of KDR and Flt-1 (14Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the activities of the Flt-sel mutant,125I-VEGF binding assays were performed in PAE cells transfected with the mutant Flt-1 receptor Flt(ANGG), as described previously (30Gille H. Kowalski J., Yu, L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 15: 4064-4073Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The PAE cell line lacks endogenous VEGF receptors (31Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KDR phosphorylation was analyzed in CHO cells stably expressing KDR with a C-terminal epitope tag. Kinase receptor activation assay assays were performed as described recently (32Sadick M.D. Intintoli A. Quarmby V. McCoy A. Canova-Davis E. Ling V. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Passage 4–7 HUVEC were maintained in CS-C medium (Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and growth factors on gelatin-coated dishes and made quiescent by 14 h of starvation in 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated as indicated and washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were lysed in 0.5–1 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 μm okadaic acid, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche MB 1836145). Culture of PAE cells was performed as described previously (30Gille H. Kowalski J., Yu, L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 15: 4064-4073Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A/G beads (Pierce) were blocked for nonspecific protein binding in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml ovalbumin for 30 min. Antibodies were precoupled in the same buffer for 1 h at 4 °C with head-over-end rotation, and beads were washed three times in lysis buffer. Beads were added to the lysates and rotated overnight. Beads were washed sequentially in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmCaCl2; 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2; and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2. Beads were resuspended in 2× sample buffer and boiled. Supernatants were applied directly to 4–12% Tris-glycine gradient gels (Novex). Anti-phospho-ERK antiserum was purchased fromPromega. Anti-phospho-p38 antibodies were from New England Biolabs. p85 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies from Transduction Labs (P13020) and Neomarkers (MS 424-P). A monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. was used for the immunoprecipitation of PLCγ. The phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 or E120H from Transduction Labs were used. Migration assays were performed essentially as described previously (30Gille H. Kowalski J., Yu, L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 15: 4064-4073Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Falcon 8.0-μm filter inserts (Falcon 3097) were coated with type 1 collagen (VITROGEN, COHESION). PAE clones were grown in Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.25 mg/ml G418. HUVEC (obtained from Cell Systems, <p8) were grown in Cell Systems complete medium (4ZO-500) with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were trypsinized and transferred to endothelial basal medium (Clonetics) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for the assay. Cells were plated at 5 × 104/upper chamber. Growth factors were placed in the lower chamber, and inhibitors were in the upper chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate at 37 °C for 14–16 h. For the LY294002 inhibitor experiments, cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min prior to addition of the inhibitor. 20 min after inhibitor addition, VEGF was added to the bottom well, and the assay was allowed to proceed for only 4 h to avoid the occurrence of apoptosis associated with the treatment of these primary cells with LY294002. Cells were removed from the upper side of the membrane by scraping with a polyurethane swab, and then the remaining cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed with methanol. Cells were stained with Yo-Pro Iodide nuclear stain (Molecular Probes) and counted under low power fluorescence using an Image-Pro cell recognition program. Assays were performed as described previously (33Polverini P.J. Bouck N.P. Rastinejad F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats are anesthetized using a gas (isoflurane)/injectable ketamine (80 mg/kg) xylazine (15 mg/kg) combination. The eyes are gently proptosed and secured in place using nontraumatic forceps. With a number 15 blade, a 1.5-mm incision was made slightly below the center of the cornea. Using a microspatula (ST80017, ASSI), the incision was carefully blunt-dissected through the stroma toward the outer canthus of the eye. A hydron-coated pellet (2 × 2 mm) containing growth factor (200 ng), methylcellulose, and aluminum sucralfate (100 μg) was inserted into the base of the pocket. After surgery the eyes were coated with gentamicin ointment. At day 6 the animals were injected with high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran and euthanized to allow for visualization of the vasculature. Corneal whole mounts were made of the enucleated eyes and measurements of neovascular area completed using computer-assisted image analysis (Image-Pro Plus). Vascular permeability was assessed using a modified Miles assay described previously (21Fujii E. Irie K. Ohba K. Ogawa A. Yoshioka T. Yamakawa M. Muraki T. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.

Hairless guinea pigs (600–800 g) were anesthetized by intramuscular administration of xylazine (5 mg/kg) and ketamine (75 mg/kg). The animals then received an intracardiac injection of 1 ml of 1% Evans blue dye. Sixty minutes later, intradermal injections (0.1 ml) of VEGF or the appropriate VEGF mutant were made in a grid, which allowed us to construct a dose-response curve for each compound (n = 4/molecule). VEGF165 was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and used at doses of 0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 ng/site. The dose of all other proteins was adjusted to inject equimolar amounts of protein. Sixty minutes after injections were made, animals were euthanized with pentobarbital (160 mg/kg IV), and their skin was removed, cleaned from connective tissues, and photographed. Quantification of the dye extravasation area was carried out on the pictures using an image analysis software (NIH Image®). For each dose, measurements were made in triplicate and averaged to minimize measurement errors. We set out to determine the different contributions of KDR and Flt-1 to VEGF signaling in primary endothelial cells. Because endothelial cells express both VEGF receptors, we made use of two novel VEGF mutants engineered by the use of a phage display selection process to bind selectively to either KDR or Flt-1 (27Li B. Fuh G. Meng G. Xin X. Gerritsen M.E. Cunningham B. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29823-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These mutations were introduced into the VEGF165 cDNA and recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli. The full-length VEGF mutant proteins were analyzed for their ability to bind to either Flt-1 or KDR in solution. Fig. 1 A demonstrates the relative inability of the Flt-1-selective VEGF mutant (Flt-sel) to compete efficiently with wild type 125I-VEGF for binding to KDR. The reduction of binding of the KDR-selective mutant (KDR-sel2) to Flt-1 is shown in Fig. 1 B. TableI summarizes the K dvalues and relative affinities of the individual mutants to Flt-1 and KDR. Binding of the KDR-selective variant to Flt-1 is reduced by a factor of 2000-fold, whereas Flt-selective VEGF binds KDR 128-fold less well. To further characterize the specificity of the mutants, we tested them with respect to their ability to induce KDR phosphorylation in intact cells (Fig. 1 C). KDR-selective VEGF was essentially as potent and effective as wild type VEGF. Surprisingly, the ability of Flt-sel VEGF to induce KDR phosphorylation was reduced by at least 4 orders of magnitude. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1 D, Flt-sel VEGF was fully capable of competing for 125I-VEGF binding to the Flt-1 receptor even in the context of intact cells and was as potent and effective as VEGF165 in promoting motility of PAE cells expressing Flt(ANGG). Unlike wild type Flt-1, this receptor mutant is able to mediate a KDR-like motility response to VEGF because of the removal of a repressor motif in the juxtamembrane region (30Gille H. Kowalski J., Yu, L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 15: 4064-4073Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings argue against the possibility that the inability of Flt-sel VEGF to induce KDR phosphorylation may be due to inherent instability and/or lack of activity of the mutant protein.Table IThe Kd values and relative binding affinities of wild type VEGF and receptor-selective VEGF mutantsMutantsKDR bindingFLT-1 bindingK dRelative to VEGF165K dRelative to VEGF165pmpmV165971371KDR-sel2100187,0002,000Flt-sel12,416128982.6 Open table in a new tab Earlier work by this and other laboratories has generally shown that PlGF binding to Flt-1 is not able to cause marked mitogenesis in endothelial cells (14Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), although evidence to the contrary has also been reported in transfected cell lines (15Landgren E. Schiller P. Cao Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether KDR-selective VEGF was capable of mediating mitogenic signaling. As expected, activation by KDR-selective VEGF triggered phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in HUVEC (Fig. 2 A). The extent of phosphorylation was indistinguishable from that obtained using wild type VEGF. Flt-1-selective VEGF at the highest concentration used resulted in minimal phosphorylation of ERK2. The homodimeric VEGF mutants utilized in this study are not expected to promote receptor heterodimer formation. Hence Flt-1 does not contribute to MAP kinase activation. VEGF has been reported to stimulate the stress-activated p38 MAP kinase (37Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 38Yu Y. Sato J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine which VEGF receptor is involved, the phosphorylation status of p38 was analyzed after stimulation with wild type Flt- and KDR-selective VEGF. Fig. 2 B demonstrates that only KDR-selective VEGF was able to stimulate p38 phosphorylation. However, as above indicated, Flt-selective VEGF was as effective as wild type VEGF165 in inducing migration of PAE cells expressing Flt(ANGG), demonstrating that this mutant is biologically active. Furthermore, in agreement with a previous report that implicates Flt-1 activation in metalloproteinase release (39Wang H. Keiser J.A. Circulation Res. 1998; 83: 832-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), Flt-selective VEGF stimulated the release of increased amounts of matrix metalloprotease-9 proteolytic activity from human vascular smooth muscle cells (27Li B.

To determine which VEGF receptor(s) are involved in PLCγ activation in primary endothelial cells, HUVEC were treated with VEGF or VEGF receptor-selective mutants, and PLCγ phosphorylation was assessed after immunoprecipitation (Fig.3 A). Both wild type and KDR-selective VEGF were able to stimulate PLCγ phosphorylation to a similar extent. Flt-selective VEGF did not increase PLCγ phosphorylation over background levels, arguing against a role for Flt-1 in PLCγ activation in HUVEC. PI3K has been demonstrated to transmit survival signals through the activation of Akt in several cell types (44Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). VEGF also acts as a survival factor for endothelial cells, and this signal requires PI3K and Akt kinase activity (45Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (30343): 30366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In a variety of cell types, PI3K activity has been demonstrated to be involved in cytoskeletal changes following growth factor stimulation as well as cell migration (46Wennstrom S. Hawkins P.

Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of the VEGF proteins to cause phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K was assessed after immunoprecipitation. Only wild type and KDR-selective VEGF were capable of causing phosphorylation the PI3K regulatory subunit (Fig.3 B). One of the central aspects of VEGF action on endothelial cells is its ability to act as a chemoattractant and stimulate the migration of endothelial cells. Fig.4 A shows the effect of receptor-selective VEGF on HUVEC in a modified Boyden chamber assay. In several independent experiments, VEGF caused a 4–5-fold increase in HUVEC migration. KDR-selective VEGF is as effective as wild type VEGF in the promotion of HUVEC migration. Flt-selective VEGF is unable to increase cell migration over background levels. To determine the contribution of PI3K to endothelial cell migration, different concentrations of the inhibitor LY 294002 were added to the assay after the cells had been allowed to attach to the membrane. Because of the deleterious effects of PI3K inhibition on endothelial cell survival a short-term assay was performed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4 B shows that at its highest concentration, and LY 294002 caused a 56% inhibition of HUVEC migration. Thus, PI3K activity contributes significantly to endothelial cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W1523269786,"The vertebrate organizer can induce a complete body axis when transplanted to the ventral side of a host embryo by virtue of its distinct head and trunk inducing properties. Wingless/Wnt antagonists secreted by the organizer have been identified as head inducers. Their ectopic expression can promote head formation, whereas ectopic activation of Wnt signalling during early gastrulation blocks head formation. These observations suggest that the ability of head inducers to inhibit Wnt signalling during formation of anterior structures is what distinguishes them from trunk inducers that permit the operation of posteriorizing Wnt signals. Here we describe the zebrafish headless (hdl) mutant and show that its severe head defects are due to a mutation in T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), a member of the Tcf/Lef family. Loss of Tcf3 function in the hdl mutant reveals that hdl represses Wnt target genes. We provide genetic evidence that a component of the Wnt signalling pathway is essential in vertebrate head formation and patterning."

https://openalex.org/W2022614681,"Mdm2 acts as a major regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 by targeting its destruction. Here, we show that the mdm2 gene is also regulated by the Ras-driven Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway, in a p53-independent manner. Mdm2 induced by activated Raf degrades p53 in the absence of the Mdm2 inhibitor p19ARF. This regulatory pathway accounts for the observation that cells transformed by oncogenic Ras are more resistant to p53-dependent apoptosis following exposure to DNA damage. Activation of the Ras-induced Raf/MEK/MAP kinase may therefore play a key role in suppressing p53 during tumor development and treatment. In primary cells, Raf also activates the Mdm2 inhibitor p19ARF. Levels of p53 are therefore determined by opposing effects of Raf-induced p19ARF and Mdm2."

HEp-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 1 × 105 cells per well were seeded into 12-well dishes and serum-starved 24 h later. For preparative purposes, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish and were serum-starved 2 days later for another 20 h prior to lysis. For [32P] or [33P]orthophosphate labeling, cells were incubated in phosphate-free medium in the presence of 12.5 μ Ci/ml32Pi for preparative or 25 μ Ci/ml32Pi or 100 μ Ci/ml 33Pifor analytical purposes for 3 h prior to lysis. For transfection experiments, HEp-2 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 per well into 6-well dishes 20 h before transfection. Cells were incubated for 4 h in 1.0 ml of serum-free medium containing 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1.5 to 1.7 μg of total DNA per well. The transfection mixture was supplemented with 1 ml of medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and cells were lysed 20 h later. Cell lysis was performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% SDS, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 150 units/ml benzonase plus additives (1 mmEDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoprecipitations, lysis buffer contained 50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol plus additives. Both buffers solubilized stathmin to the same extent. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing was performed using linear 11-cm immobilized pH 4–7 gradient drystrips on an IPGphor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For preparative purposes, the final focusing step was at 8000 V for 4 h. Fourteen 10-cm dishes of serum-starved and 32Pi-labeled HEp-2 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 7 min and lysed (350 μl per dish). Lysates were precleared, supplemented with 80 μl of 20% SDS and 120 μl of 87% glycerol per ml, and the sample containing about 30 mg of total protein was loaded on the Model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). Preparative gel electrophoresis was performed utilizing a 11% separating gel. Aliquots containing proteins in the 19,000- to 23,000-dalton range were precipitated and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of silver-stained gels (10Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). The 21,000-dalton phosphoprotein of interest, which was found in two fractions, was dried to one-tenth of its original volume, precipitated, and subjected to preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The protein spot of interest was visualized by Coomassie staining and excised, and the gel fragment was washed in water. The gel piece was allowed to shrink in 100 μl of acetonitrile/water (1:1) (both Baker HPLC Analyzed, Mallinckrodt Baker B.V., Deventer, The Netherlands) for 30 min and dried in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 0.05 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) was added followed by ammonium bicarbonate buffer to submerge the gel piece. Digestion proceeded overnight at 37 °C and was stopped by acidification. The supernatant was removed from the gel pieces and a fraction (10%) was purified/concentrated on added Poros® 50 R2 beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and used for direct MALDI-MS peptide mass fingerprint analysis (11Gevaert K.

The remainder of the digestion mixture was separated on a RP-HPLC column; eluting peptides were automatically collected on Poros R2 beads and used for MALDI-PSD measurements (12Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J. Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed on a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) operating in the reflectron mode. RP-HPLC fractions were first scanned in the reflectron mode, and candidate peptides were selected and their PSD spectra recorded (12Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J. Houthaeve T.

Rac interacts with numerous cellular targets including at least three families of Ser/Thr kinases, p65PAK, MLK, and p70S6kinase. To identify phosphorylation events controlled by Rac, metabolically labeled HEp-2 cells were pretreated with either clostridial toxin B1470, which inactivates Rac, R-ras, Rap1, Ral and, to a lesser extent, Cdc42, or with toxin B10463, which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (14Wagenknecht-Wiesner A.

Cells were then stimulated with EGF, a known activator of Rac, for 7 min and cell lysates were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The increase in intensity of only 2 of about 20 EGF-stimulated phosphoproteins was blocked by both toxins (Fig.1 A). One was isolated from a preparative two-dimensional gel and subjected to MALDI-MS post-source decay analysis. The excised protein was identified as stathmin. As shown in Fig. 1 B, EGF treatment resulted in the appearance of two new forms of stathmin and a significant increase in the intensity of at least one other form. Stathmin has been shown to be phosphorylated on four distinct serines: 16, 25, 38, and 63, resulting in a variety of migration patterns on two-dimensional gels (Fig.1 C and Refs. 7Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 16Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify which residues are phosphorylated in response to EGF, antibodies specific for three phosphorylated forms (serines 16, 25, and 38) were used on Western blots (7Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 D, EGF induces a dramatic increase in phosphorylation at Ser-16 and Ser-25. Ser-38 is phosphorylated in control cells and does not increase significantly upon EGF addition. The lack of a significant change in the P3 isoform at 19 kDa (Refs. 25Wadsworth P. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1999; 42: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38, 63 and Fig. 1 D) coupled with the strong increase in the P3 isoform at 23 kDa (16Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wadsworth P. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1999; 42: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38) suggests that very little phosphorylation is induced at Ser-63 by EGF. To identify which phosphorylation event is mediated by Rho GTPases, phosphospecific antibodies were used to analyze Western blots of one-dimensional gels of lysates from cells treated with the two clostridial toxins. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, 160 ng/ml toxin B1470 results in a complete inhibition of EGF-induced phosphorylation of Ser-16 although at even 10-fold higher concentrations, the toxin does not inhibit EGF-induced phosphorylation at Ser-25. Ser-25 has been reported to be phosphorylated by ERK MAP kinases and the EGF-stimulated activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was not changed by toxin treatment (Fig.2 A, bottom left and Ref. 17Marklund U. Brattsand G. Shingler V. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15039-15049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Toxin B10463 gave similar results (data not shown). The basal levels of phosphorylated Ser-38 were unaffected by both toxins. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from Escherichia coli activates all members of the Rho family and when added to HEp-2 cells results in increased phosphorylation of stathmin only on Ser-16 (Fig. 2 B and Ref.18Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 496-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that EGF-induced phosphorylation at Ser-16 of stathmin is mediated by Rac and/or Cdc42. To confirm that Rac and Cdc42 can induce phosphorylation at Ser-16, HEp-2 cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged stathmin expression vector either alone or with dominant-negative Rac (N17Rac1) or Cdc42 (N17Cdc42) and treated 24 h later with EGF. Inhibition of Rac almost completely prevented phosphorylation on Ser-16, whereas inhibition of Cdc42 inhibited phosphorylation by around 50% (Fig.3 A). Next, stathmin was cotransfected with constitutively activated GTPases. L61Rac and L61Cdc42, but not L63Rho, induced phosphorylation specifically at Ser-16 (Fig. 3 B). Three isoforms (1, 2, and 3) of the Ser/Thr kinase p65PAK interact directly with Rac and Cdc42 leading to a variety of cellular effects (8Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To determine whether p65PAK mediates Ser-16 phosphorylation, HEp-2 cells were transfected with stathmin along with an autoinhibitory fragment (residues 83–149) derived from p65PAK (8Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.4, A and B, inhibition of p65PAK completely prevented EGF-, L61Rac-, and L61Cdc42-induced phosphorylation on Ser-16. In conclusion, we have show that the addition of EGF to HEp-2 cells leads to a Rac/Cdc42 and p65PAK-dependent phosphorylation of stathmin at Ser-16. Whether p65PAK directly phosphorylates stathmin or whether it activates another downstream kinase is not currently known. Two kinases have been reported to phosphorylate stathmin at Ser-16, the cAMP-dependent kinase A and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase isoforms, CaMK IV/Gr and CaMKII (5Gradin H.M. Marklund U. Larsson N. Chatila T.A. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol.

The cAMP-dependent kinase A is unlikely to be involved because it preferentially phosphorylates Ser-63, and pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with EGTA to block Ca2+ influx had no effect, suggesting that CaM kinases are not involved (data not shown). Stathmin plays an important role in controlling microtubule dynamic either by sequestering α/β tubulin heterodimers or by increasing catastrophe frequency at the plus ends of microtubules or both (21Curmi P.A.

Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As a result, stathmin causes destabilization of growing microtubules and phosphorylation at Ser-16 appears to block this activity (5Gradin H.M. Marklund U. Larsson N. Chatila T.A. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Gradin H.M. Larrson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 131-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 regulate actin polymerization and form membrane protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells and neuronal growth cones. The results described here suggest, therefore, that Rac and Cdc42 might control both F-actin and microtubule dynamics in localized regions associated with cell protrusions (24Waterman-Storer C.M.

https://openalex.org/W1513073511,"The Eocene/Oligocene boundary, at about 33.7 Myr ago, marks one of the largest extinctions of marine invertebrates in the Cenozoic period. For example, turnover of mollusc species in the US Gulf coastal plain was over 90% at this time. A temperature change across this boundary--from warm Eocene climates to cooler conditions in the Oligocene--has been suggested as a cause of this extinction event, but climate reconstructions have not provided support for this hypothesis. Here we report stable oxygen isotope measurements of aragonite in fish otoliths--ear stones--collected across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. Palaeo-temperatures reconstructed from mean otolith oxygen isotope values show little change through this interval, in agreement with previous studies. From incremental microsampling of otoliths, however, we can resolve the seasonal variation in temperature, recorded as the otoliths continue to accrete new material over the life of the fish. These seasonal data suggest that winters became about 4 degrees C colder across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. We suggest that temperature variability, rather than change in mean annual temperature, helped to cause faunal turnover during this transition."
https://openalex.org/W2062222285,"We have characterized the strongly homologous GPP1/RHR2 and GPP2/HOR2 genes, encoding isoforms of glycerol 3-phosphatase. Mutants lacking bothGPP1 and GPP2 are devoid of glycerol 3-phosphatase activity and produce only a small amount of glycerol, confirming the essential role for this enzyme in glycerol biosynthesis. Overproduction of Gpp1p and Gpp2p did not significantly enhance glycerol production, indicating that glycerol phosphatase is not rate-limiting for glycerol production. Previous studies have shown that expression of both GPP1 and GPP2 is induced under hyperosmotic stress and that induction partially depends on the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) pathway. We here show that expression ofGPP1 is strongly decreased in strains having low protein kinase A activity, although it is still responsive to osmotic stress. The gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ double mutant is hypersensitive to high osmolarity, whereas the single mutants remain unaffected, indicating GPP1 and GPP2 substitute well for each other. Transfer to anaerobic conditions does not affect expression of GPP2, whereas GPP1 is transiently induced, and mutants lacking GPP1 show poor anaerobic growth. All gpp mutants show increased levels of glycerol 3-phosphate, which is especially pronounced when gpp1Δ and gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ mutants are transferred to anaerobic conditions. The addition of acetaldehyde, a strong oxidizer of NADH, leads to decreased glycerol 3-phosphate levels and restored anaerobic growth of the gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ mutant, indicating that the anaerobic accumulation of NADH causes glycerol 3-phosphate to reach growth-inhibiting levels. We also found thegpp1Δ/gpp2Δ mutant is hypersensitive to the superoxide anion generator, paraquat. Consistent with a role for glycerol 3-phosphatase in protection against oxidative stress, expression of GPP2 is induced in the presence of paraquat. This induction was only marginally affected by the general stress-response transcriptional factors Msn2p/4p or protein kinase A activity. We conclude that glycerol metabolism plays multiple roles in yeast adaptation to altered growth conditions, explaining the complex regulation of glycerol biosynthesis genes. We have characterized the strongly homologous GPP1/RHR2 and GPP2/HOR2 genes, encoding isoforms of glycerol 3-phosphatase. Mutants lacking bothGPP1 and GPP2 are devoid of glycerol 3-phosphatase activity and produce only a small amount of glycerol, confirming the essential role for this enzyme in glycerol biosynthesis. Overproduction of Gpp1p and Gpp2p did not significantly enhance glycerol production, indicating that glycerol phosphatase is not rate-limiting for glycerol production. Previous studies have shown that expression of both GPP1 and GPP2 is induced under hyperosmotic stress and that induction partially depends on the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) pathway. We here show that expression ofGPP1 is strongly decreased in strains having low protein kinase A activity, although it is still responsive to osmotic stress. The gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ double mutant is hypersensitive to high osmolarity, whereas the single mutants remain unaffected, indicating GPP1 and GPP2 substitute well for each other. Transfer to anaerobic conditions does not affect expression of GPP2, whereas GPP1 is transiently induced, and mutants lacking GPP1 show poor anaerobic growth. All gpp mutants show increased levels of glycerol 3-phosphate, which is especially pronounced when gpp1Δ and gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ mutants are transferred to anaerobic conditions. The addition of acetaldehyde, a strong oxidizer of NADH, leads to decreased glycerol 3-phosphate levels and restored anaerobic growth of the gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ mutant, indicating that the anaerobic accumulation of NADH causes glycerol 3-phosphate to reach growth-inhibiting levels. We also found thegpp1Δ/gpp2Δ mutant is hypersensitive to the superoxide anion generator, paraquat. Consistent with a role for glycerol 3-phosphatase in protection against oxidative stress, expression of GPP2 is induced in the presence of paraquat. This induction was only marginally affected by the general stress-response transcriptional factors Msn2p/4p or protein kinase A activity. We conclude that glycerol metabolism plays multiple roles in yeast adaptation to altered growth conditions, explaining the complex regulation of glycerol biosynthesis genes. high osmolarity glycerol pathway polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mitogen activated protein kinase protein kinase A -2p, NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase -2p, glycerol 3-phosphatase glycerol kinase FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2p, dihydroxyacetone kinase (20Norbeck J.

Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). At high external osmolarity, yeast cells compensate for the loss of water by increased glycerol production (2Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This adaptive response is regulated, at least in part, by an osmosensing and signaling system called the HOG1 (high osmolarity glycerol) MAPK pathway (3Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Two putative osmosensors encoded bySLN1 (1Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H.

Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), which communicate with a MAPK module involving the MAPK Hog1p and its activator Pbs2p, control the HOG pathway (3Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Cells that are transferred from aerobic to anaerobic conditions are faced with the problem of catabolizing substrate molecules into a balanced blend of oxidized and reduced end-products, to maintain intracellular redox balance. Fermentation of glucose to ethanol is a redox inert process in the sense that the NADH produced in glycolysis is reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to ethanol and CO2. However, the assimilation of sugar to biomass generates excess NADH, which is re-oxidized by diversion of part of the sugar substrate to the more reduced end product, glycerol (4Van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 32: 199-225Crossref Google Scholar, 5Nordström K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1966; 20: 1016-1025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Microbiology. Research Signpost, India1998: 253-279Google Scholar). Glycerol production is essential for S. cerevisiae to dispose of surplus reducing power under anaerobic conditions, because mutants with a blocked glycerol production abruptly stop glucose catabolism when shifted to anoxic conditions (7Björkqvist S. Ansell R. Adler L. Lidén G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 128-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Glycerol is produced by reduction of the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) followed by a dephosphorylation of G3P to glycerol. The first step is catalyzed by NAD-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), which is encoded by the two isogenes GPD1 and GPD2. GPD1 encodes the major isoform in aerobically growing cells. The expression of this isogene, which is required for growth at high osmolarity (9Larsson K. Eriksson P. Ansell R. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), is induced by hyperosmotic stress and is a target gene for the HOG pathway (10Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The second isogene, GPD2, is required for glycerol production in the absence of oxygen, and its expression is stimulated under these conditions (8Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Hence, the twoGPD genes have defined physiological roles in the adaptation of S. cerevisiae to high osmolarity and anoxic conditions. We previously reported the purification and characterization of two isoforms of a glycerol 3-phosphatase (11Norbeck J. Påhlmann A.K. Akhtar N. Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In this work we have studied the expression of the corresponding genes, GPP1(RHR2) and GPP2 (HOR2) and the phenotype of the deletion mutants. We report that the GPP isogenes are differentially expressed under conditions of osmotic and anaerobic stress and that the expression of GPP1 is under strong influence of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. We also show that the two isogenes have interchangeable functions under osmotic stress but that deletion of GPP1 results in an anaerobic growth defect. This study also reveals a role for glycerol metabolism in oxidative stress protection, because thegpp1Δ/gpp2Δ deletion mutant is hypersensitive not only to osmotic stress and anoxic conditions but also to the oxidant paraquat. S. cerevisiae strains and genotypes are listed in TableI. Cells were routinely grown at 30 °C in either YPD medium supplemented with 120 μg/ml adenine or in a synthetic yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium (Difco) supplemented with 2% glucose and necessary amino acids and nucleotides, to a final concentration of 120 μg/ml for each. Liquid cultures were grown in 250-ml E flasks on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and were inoculated with 1% (v/v) from an overnight YNB culture. Media used for anaerobic incubations were supplemented with ergosterol (10 mg/liter) and Tween 80 (420 mg/liter) (12Andreasen A.A. Stier T.J.B. J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1953; 41: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 13Andreasen A.A. Stier T.J.B. J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1954; 43: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anaerobic growth in liquid medium was performed either in 100-ml serum flasks (Bellco Glass Inc.) equipped with rubber stoppers that were tightened with aluminum or screw cap sealing. Prior to anaerobic incubation, culture media were flushed for 10 min with nitrogen gas (AGA plus, Sweden) containing less than 5 ppm of oxygen. Alternatively, anaerobic growth was followed in 125-ml sealed E flasks containing 25 ml of medium that was continually flushed with nitrogen gas. Anaerobic incubation of diluted cell suspensions spotted to agar plates were conducted in anaerobic jars made anoxic by developing hydrogen gas in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Cell density was estimated by measuring optical density at 610 nm in 1-cm cuvettes (OD610), using a Novaspec II photometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). Standard yeast genetic methods were used throughout (14Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Open table in a new tab Escherichia coli DH5α (16Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 577-580Crossref Scopus (8170) Google Scholar) was used for cloning and amplification of DNA. Bacterial cultures were grown in 2 × LB medium (17Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1973Google Scholar). The GPP2 gene was isolated from the S. cerevisiae lambda clone 6592 (GenBank™ accession number U188139). A 2574-bpBam HI/Spe I fragment encompassing the 753-bp ORF plus 1118 bp upstream of the translational start was isolated and integrated into the Bam HI/Xba I site of the pRS316 vector. The GPP1 gene was isolated from a yeast genomic library in the pCS19 vector (18Sengstag C. Gene. 1993; 124: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 19Sengstag C. Hinnen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) by colony hybridization using standard techniques and the GPP1-specific 5′-TGT GGT CAA AGG CAT TGC GAT GG-3′ oligonucleotide (20Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) as a probe. The 2815-bpXba I/Sal I fragment covering the 753-bpGPP1 ORF and 1199 bp upstream of the translational start was cloned into the pRS316 vector. For multicopy expressionNot I/Sal I (GPP1) orNot I/ClaI (GPP2) fragments were transferred from the centromeric pRS316 to the 2μ vector pRS326. Deletion of the GPP1 gene was accomplished by the long flanking homology PCR-targeting technique (21Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 22Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 15: 259-265Crossref Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In the first step, a set of primers (5′-TGTGTGAGTTCCTCTTTTCTT-3′ and 5′-TCAAAGGCATTGCGATGGTT-3′) was used to amplify 263 bp of genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae W303, upstream from the third codon in the GPP1 ORF. A second set (5′-CGCTAAGGATGACTTGTTGA-3′ and 5′-CTCTAACTTCTCGTCGTACT-3′) was used to amplify a 358-bp fragment from the ninth codon in the GPP1 ORF upstream the stop codon. The 5′-end of the primers adjacent to the insertion site carried 25 nucleotide extensions homologous to the 5′ and 3′ regions of thehis GMX6 or kan MX4 disruption cassette of plasmid pFA6a-his GMX6 and pFA6-kan MX4 (21Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In the second PCR reaction, pFA6a-his GMX6 and pFA6-kan MX4 were used as templates and the 5′ and 3′ homologous regions of the first PCR reaction were fused to the disruption cassette by serving as primers together with the upstream forward and downstream reverse primers of the flanking regions, thus producing the ORF targeting cassette. This cassette was transformed into a haploid S. cerevisiae W303 strain, and independent transformants were selected for verification ofGPP1 replacement. Using a set of primers (forward: 5′-CAAGCAGGAAATCCGTATCA-3′ and reverse 5′-TCATATGGAGCAATCCCACT-3′) hybridizing upstream and downstream, respectively, of the disruption cassette chromosomal DNA was amplified. The length of the PCR products was verified by agarose-gel electrophoresis. The GPP2 ORF was disrupted in a similar way using a set of primers (5′-CAAGTGAGGACTTTTCGGAT-3′ and 5′-GTAGTCAATCCCATTCCGAA-3′) to amplify a 346-bp fragment upstream from the fourth codon in the ORF. The second set (5′-GGACGATCTGTTGAAATGGT-3′ and 5′-CCTGTCCACTTTCAAGTTGCT-3′) was used to amplify a 287-bp fragment from the seventh codon in theGPP2 ORF downstream the stop codon. Correct integration of the disruption modules into the GPP1 and GPP2 alleles was verified by PCR. The gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ double mutant was constructed by crossing of the single mutants. Tetrads gave rise to viable double mutants on aerobic incubation in complete medium. GPD1 and GPD2 were overexpressed from their own promoters in the YEplac112 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar) multicopy plasmid, transformed into thegpd1Δ/gpd2Δ mutant. Total RNA was isolated by standard procedures at indicated time points from cultures treated as described in the figure legends. RNA samples were screened on ethidium bromide agarose gels and quantified by spectrophotometry, using the Beckman DU65 (Beckman Instruments) nucleic acid program. Samples containing 15 μg of total RNA were denatured and run on low formaldehyde (2.5% v/v) agarose gels at 10 V/cm for 75 min, tested for quality at 254 nm on thin-layer chromatography plates, and blotted to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche) by capillary transfer, using 10× SSC as transfer buffer. Blotted filters were cross-linked by 1-min exposure to low wavelength UV and baked at 80 °C for 2 h. Prehybridization was performed for 3–4 h at 55 °C in 5× SSC, 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 10 × Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed at 55 °C for 18–20 h using the same solution supplemented with 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 and having labeled oligonucleotides added at 5 ng/ml. The filters were washed twice in 1 × SSC/1% SDS, for 20 min at room temperature and once for 15 min at the hybridization temperature. Membranes were stripped for rehybridization by shaking in sterile water at 80 °C for 10 min. To quantify transcript levels, signal intensity was quantified with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and normalized to that forACT1 or IPP1 mRNA. For most experiments two or more independent RNA blot analyses were performed for each growth condition and transcript examined. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-labeled with 25 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 units of polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 50 ng of probe, left at 37 °C for 30 min. Unincorporated ATP was displaced using a Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) mini column. Sequences of oligonucleotides used were: 5′-TGTGGTCAAAGGCATTGCGATGG-3′ to probe for GPP1 mRNA, and 5′-CTTGCTCATTGATCGGATATCCTAA-3′ to assay for GPP2 mRNA. Oligonucleotides used to probe for ACT1 and IPP1 were 5′-ATCGATTCTCAAAATGGCGTGAGG-3′ and 5′-TGT CTG GTA GTG TAG GTC ATT AGT-3′, respectively. The specificities of the oligonucleotides used for probing GPP1 and GPP2 mRNA were controlled using the gpp1Δ and gpp2Δ strains. Sampled cell suspensions of 1 ml were analyzed for total (intra- plus extracellular) glycerol by boiling for 10 min followed by centrifugation and enzymatic determination of the glycerol content of the supernatant using a commercial glycerol analysis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For glycerol 3-phosphate analysis, cells from 10-ml samples were collected by filtration (0.45 μm, Millipore). Filters were transferred to 0.5m trichloroacetic acid containing 17 mmEDTA and kept on ice for 15 min. The trichloroacetic acid was removed by repeated extraction with 4 ml of water-saturated diethylether. Residual diethylether was removed by percolation with water-saturated nitrogen gas for 10 min (24Gustafsson L. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 120: 15-23Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The extract was cleared by centrifugation, and the glycerol 3-phosphate content was determined by the enzymatic method described by Bergmeyer (25Bergmeyer, H. U. (ed) (1974) Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, 2nd English Ed., Vol. 3, Verlag Chemie, WeinheimGoogle Scholar) using a Cobas FARA analyzer. Cells were washed twice in TRED buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5) and resuspended in the same buffer plus 1 mmdithiothreitol and a protease inhibitor mix (Complete, Roche) added in amounts as recommended by the supplier. Extracts were prepared by disruption of cells using acid-washed glass beads and subsequent centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min). The obtained supernatants were desalted by gel filtration according to procedures described previously (26André L. Nilsson A. Adler L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 669-677Google Scholar). For enzyme assays protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad), whereas metabolite levels were related to cell protein using the Lowry method for protein determination. Bovine serum albumin was used as standard for both methods. Glycerol 3-phosphatase was assayed as described previously (11Norbeck J. Påhlmann A.K. Akhtar N. Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-free extracts were incubated in 20 mm Tricine-HCl (pH 6.5), 5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mmdl-glycerol 3-phosphate in a total volume of 1.0 ml. After starting the reaction, samples of 90 μl were withdrawn at different time points and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 50% HClO4. Inorganic phosphate was analyzed according to a previous study (27Ames B.N. Neufeld E.F. Ginsburg V. Assay of Inorganic Phosphate, Total Phosphate and Phosphatases, Vol. 8, Methods Enzymol. Academic Press, New York1966: 115-117Google Scholar), and the reaction rate was calculated from the slope of a linear plot of released phosphate versus time. All glassware used was immersed overnight in 1 m HCl and rinsed thoroughly in distilled water, to eliminate phosphate contamination. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide gels at 125 V for 1.5 h using a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Hybond membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK), according to the manufacturers' protocols. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.8% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer A) supplemented with 5% blocking reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) and then for 1 h with rabbit anti-Gpp antibody diluted 1:5000 in buffer A. The Gpp antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Dunn-Coleman, Genencor International (Palo Alto, CA). Membranes were washed for 15 min followed by 2 × 5 min in buffer A. The membranes were probed for 1 h with a 1:15,000 dilution of anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) in buffer A. Blots were washed as before, and antibody detection was performed using the ECL labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Because glycerol production is strictly required by S. cerevisiae for osmoregulation and anoxic redox adjustments (8Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we examined the importance of the glycerol 3-phosphate genes GPP1 and GPP2 for growth at high osmolarity and anaerobiosis. The single ggp1Δ andggp2Δ mutants showed no obvious growth defects on aerobic incubation in YNB medium, whereas thegpp1Δ/gpp2Δ double mutant grew somewhat more slowly under these conditions (Fig.1 A). The growth of the singlegpp1Δ and gpp2Δ mutants also appeared indistinguishable from that of the wild type under NaCl stress, whereas the gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ double mutant was strongly inhibited by increased salinity (Fig. 1, A andB), or osmotically comparable concentrations of sorbitol (data not shown). Under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2,A and B) cells lacking GPP1 displayed a much prolonged lag phase and a decreased exponential growth rate, whereas gpp2Δ mutants grew like the wild type strain. Growth of the gpp1Δ/gpp2Δ mutant was severely inhibited by transfer to anaerobiosis and only on prolonged incubation growth occurred in liquid medium (Fig. 2 A). The mechanism underlying this slow adaptation to anaerobiosis is unexplored, although an involvement of the recently described dihydroxy acetone pathway (20Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) for glycerol production is possible. To clarify the role of theGPP genes in glycerol biosynthesis, we analyzed glycerol production of wild type and mutant cells following transfer to increased osmolarity or anaerobiosis (Fig.3). As expected from the growth phenotype, the two single mutants showed stimulated glycerol production much like the wild type, whereas the double mutant did not produce any significant amounts of glycerol under any conditions. Unexpectedly, thegpp1Δ mutant produced glycerol like the wild type under anoxic conditions, despite the growth defect of this mutant under these conditions (see above). We then analyzed the extent to which the observed glycerol response is associated with changes in GPP gene expression. Northern analysis (Fig. 1 C) confirmed previous reports of osmotic induction of the GPP gene expression (11Norbeck J. Påhlmann A.K. Akhtar N. Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Biol.

After shift to anaerobic conditions, the mRNA level of GPP1 showed a transient increase (Fig. 2 C), whereas that of GPP2 remained unaltered (not shown). The induction profiles of GPP1 orGPP2 in mutants carrying only one of the isogenes were similar to those observed for wild type cells (not shown), indicating that loss of one isoform does not markedly affect expression of the other.

https://openalex.org/W1813609667,"Bubonic plague is widely regarded as a disease of mainly historical importance; however, with increasing reports of incidence and the discovery of antibiotic-resistant strains of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, it is re-emerging as a significant health concerns. Here we bypass the conventional human-disease models, and propose that bubonic plague is driven by the dynamics of the disease in the rat population. Using a stochastic, spatial metapopulation model, we show that bubonic plague can persist in relatively small rodent populations from which occasional human epidemics arise, without the need for external imports. This explains why historically the plague persisted despite long disease-free periods, and how the disease re-occurred in cities with tight quarantine control. In a contemporary setting, we show that human vaccination cannot eradicate the plague, and that culling of rats may prevent or exacerbate human epidemics, depending on the timing of the cull. The existence of plague reservoirs in wild rodent populations has important public-health implications for the transmission to urban rats and the subsequent risk of human outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2081466880,"To determine how hyaluronidase increases certain cancer cell sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytotoxicity, we report here the isolation and characterization of a hyaluronidase-induced murine WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WOX1). WOX1 is composed of two N-terminal WW domains, a nuclear localization sequence, and a C-terminal alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) domain. WOX1 is mainly located in the mitochondria, and the mitochondrial targeting sequence was mapped within the ADH domain. Induction of mitochondrial permeability transition by TNF, staurosporine, and atractyloside resulted in WOX1 release from mitochondria and subsequent nuclear translocation. TNF-mediated WOX1 nuclear translocation occurred shortly after that of nuclear factor-κB nuclear translocation, whereas both were independent events. WOX1 enhanced TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells via its WW and ADH domains as determined using stable cell transfectants. In parallel with this observation, WOX1 also enhanced TRADD (TNFreceptor-associated deathdomain protein)-mediated cell death in transient expression experiments. Antisense expression of WOX1 raised TNF resistance in L929 cells. Enhancement of TNF cytotoxicity by WOX1 is due, in part, to its significant down-regulation of the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (>85%), but up-regulation of pro-apoptotic p53 (∼200%) by the ADH domain. When overexpressed, the ADH domain mediated apoptosis, probably due to modulation of expression of these proteins. The WW domains failed to modulate the expression of these proteins, but sensitized COS-7 cells to TNF killing and mediated apoptosis in various cancer cells independently of caspases. Transient cotransfection of cells with both p53 and WOX1 induced apoptosis in a synergistic manner. WOX1 colocalizes with p53 in the cytosol and binds to the proline-rich region of p53 via its WW domains. Blocking of WOX1 expression by antisense mRNA abolished p53 apoptosis. Thus, WOX1 is a mitochondrial apoptogenic protein and an essential partner of p53 in cell death.

Also, expression of hyaluronidase by tumor cells induces angiogenesis in vivo (6Liu D. Pearlman E. Diaconu E. Guo K. Mori H. Haqqi T. Markowitz S. Willson J. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The growth of murine lung carcinoma and melanoma, for example, is influenced byHyal-1, a locus determining hyaluronidase levels and polymorphism (7De Maewyer E. De Maeyer-Guignard J. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). How hyaluronidase modulates cell growth is not known. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that exogenous hyaluronidase reverses the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer cells and solid tumors by increasing their exposure to the drugs (8Croix B.S.

For example, pretreatment of murine L929 fibroblasts and human prostate LNCaP cells with hyaluronidase for at least 12 h significantly increases their sensitivity to TNF-mediated death (100–700%) (11Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chang N.-S. Carey G. Pratt N. Chu E. Ou M.

The hyaluronidase-enhanced TNF sensitivity in L929 cells is associated, in part, with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic p53 (11Chang N.-S. Am. J.

To further explore the mechanism whereby hyaluronidase enhances TNF cytotoxicity, we report here the isolation of a novel murine WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (Wox1) cDNA. Hyaluronidase increased Wox1 gene and protein expression. Ectopic expression of WOX1 in L929 cells enhanced their sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity, whereas antisense Wox1 raised TNF resistance. Thus, WOX1 is involved in the hyaluronidase-increased TNF sensitivity in various cancer cells. We produced polyclonal antibodies against WOX1, examined WOX1 cellular localization, and determined the possibility of WOX1 nuclear translocation in response to apoptotic stimuli and inducers of mitochondrial permeability transition. Overexpression of WOX1 was shown to induce cell death. We then examined whether the cell death was p53- or caspase-dependent. Since hyaluronidase up-regulates p53 expression, the role of p53 and WOX1 in mediating cell death was determined. Isolation of novel cDNAs by differential display, library screening, and functional analysis has been described previously (14Carey G.B. Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Chang N.-S. Mattison J. Cao H. Pratt N. Zhao Y. Lee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). L929 cells were treated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (200 units/ml; Sigma) for 4 h, followed by isolating total cellular RNA and performing first strand cDNA synthesis and differential display (14Carey G.B.

A hyaluronidase-induced cDNA of 300 base pairs was isolated and used to screen a λ-phage cDNA library from murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The isolated full-length cDNA insert was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (using λ-phage primers) (see Table I) and subcloned into the TA cloning site of eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Protein domain analysis was performed using the SMART Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (16Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab The full-length murine Wox1 cDNA was constructed in the pCR3.1 vector. An in vitro translation kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used to transcribe the full-length Wox1-pCR3.1 construct into mRNA via the T7 promoter and to translate into [35S]methionine-labeled WOX1 protein. Constructs, which were made with the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH), for expressing N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins are shown in Table I. These constructs were used to express the full-length coding region (construct 2), the antisense Wox1 mRNA (expressing antisense Wox1 mRNA and GFP protein; construct 3), the N-terminal WW domain region (construct 4), a partial ADH domain (amino acids 180–392; construct 5), and the potential mitochondrial targeting regions in the ADH domain (amino acids 180–273 and 209–273; constructs 6 and 7, respectively). To examine whether the large-size GFP protein (28 kDa) affects the WOX1 function, similar constructs, which were made with a small C-terminal v5 tag (5 kDa) in the pcDNA3.1.TOPO vector (Invitrogen), were used to express full-length WOX1 (construct 8), the first WW domain (construct 9), and the first and second WW domains (construct 10). A full-length p53 cDNA clone from normal human tissues was found in the expressed sequence tag data base (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AI243172 andAF307851) and obtained from Incyte Genomics (St. Louis, MO). The coding region was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/CTGFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and tagged with a GFP sequence at the C terminus (construct 11) (see Table I). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to alter several indicated sites in the Wox1 cDNA sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The aspartic acid residues of a putative caspase recognition site (DIND, amino acids 267–270) were mutated to glycine, i.e. D267G and D270G (construct 17) (see Table I). The GKRKRV sequence (amino acids 50–55) of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was also mutated to GQGTGV (construct 18) (see TableI). A WOX1 peptide (RLAFTVDDNPTKPTTRQRY, amino acids 89–107) was synthesized by Genemed Biotechnologies, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin for antibody production in rabbits using the Pierce antibody production kit. The selected WOX1 sequence is identical between human and mouse. In most cases, transfection studies were performed by our standard CaPO4 precipitation method (14Carey G.B. Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Chang N.-S. Mattison J. Cao H. Pratt N. Zhao Y. Lee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h post-transfection, the extent of cell death was measured by crystal violet staining (a measure of both necrosis and apoptosis). Additionally, DNA fragmentation assays (11Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed to determine the extent of apoptosis. To exclude the possibility of nonspecific killing of cells caused by transfection reagents or vectors alone, the observed results were repeated using liposome-based cell transfection reagents such as LipofectAMINE (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), GeneFECTOR (Venn Nova, Pompano Beach, FL), and FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and electroporation (BTX ECM830, Genetronics, San Diego, CA). Stable transfectants of L929 cells for expressing the desired proteins were established as described previously (14Carey G.B. Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Chang N.-S. Mattison J. Cao H. Pratt N. Zhao Y. Lee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Where indicated, L929 cells were electroporated with the above indicated purifiedWox1 construct DNAs (in pEGFP-C1 or pCR3.1), followed by selecting neomycin-resistant stable transfectants or cell colonies using 300 μg/ml G418, an analog of neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Functional analysis of cellular sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity was performed as described (11Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chang N.-S. Int. J.

The established stable transfectants were cultured on 96-well plates overnight, followed by exposure to recombinant human TNF (Genzyme Corp. (Boston, MA) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN)) for 16–24 h. The following cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA): murine L929 and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts; human ovarian ME180 and HeLa cells, monocytic U937 and THP-1 cells, transformed 293 fibroblasts, and Molt-4 T cells; neonatal rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes; and monkey kidney COS-7 fibroblasts. The lymphotoxin-producing L929R cells (18Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7765-7772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the human neural SK-N-SH cells, and the human breast MCF-7 cells were gifts of Dr. D. Beezhold, R. Aronstam, and J. Noti (Guthrie Research Institute), respectively. Where indicated, confocal microscopy analysis was performed to determine the colocalization of WOX1 and mitochondria. Mitochondria were stained by antibodies against cytochrome c or by the membrane potential-sensitive mitochondrial stain Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). To perform Northern hybridization, L929 cells were cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes and treated with hyaluronidase (200 units/ml) for 1–24 h. Total cellular RNAs were isolated from these cells, and Northern hybridization was carried out using 40 μg of RNA/lane (14Carey G.B. Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Chang N.-S. Mattison J. Cao H. Pratt N. Zhao Y. Lee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Antibodies used in the Western blotting were against IκBα, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, p53, a phospho-SAPK/JNK peptide, NF-κB, and α-tubulin (Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA)). Anti-GFP and anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (COX4) antibodies were from CLONTECH. Where indicated, images were analyzed by the NIH Image program. Purification of rat liver mitochondrial proteins for Western blotting was performed as described (19Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system was from Stratagene. Unlike the traditional system, which depends upon protein-protein interaction in the nucleus (20Bemis L.T. Geske F.J. Strange R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), this assay system is based on the binding of an Sos-tagged bait protein to a cell membrane-anchored target protein (tagged with a myristoylation signal) that results in activation of the Ras signaling pathway, thereby permitting mutant yeast cdc25H to grow at 37 °C using a selective agarose medium or plate containing galactose. Two constructs of Wox1 as baits (in the pSos vector) and three constructs of p53 as targets (in the pMyr vector) were made (see Table I). Binding interactions using combination of these vectors were performed. Vectors that are included in the system for positive binding interactions are pSos-MafB and pMyr-MafB (21Kelly L.M. Englmeier U. Lafon I. Sieweke M.H. Graf T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and those that are included for negative binding interactions are empty pSos and empty pMyr, pMyr and lamin C, or other vectors. To further explore the mechanism whereby hyaluronidase enhances TNF cytotoxicity, we isolated a murine Wox1 cDNA (2197 bases; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF187014) by differential display and cDNA library screening. The cDNA possesses an open reading frame, a typical Kozak sequence at the initiation site (ATG), and an upstream in-frame stop codon. The deduced murine WOX1 protein sequence (414 amino acids, 46 kDa) possesses two N-terminal WW domains (first domain, amino acids 18–47; and second domain, amino acids 59–87), an NLS (GKRKRV, amino acids 50–55), and a C-terminal short-chain ADH domain (amino acids 121–330) (Fig.1). WW domains are known to bind proteins with a particular proline motif, (A/P)PP(A/P)Y (22Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 23Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Whether the WW domains of WOX1 bind to this motif is not known. The human gene coding for WOX cDNAs (or known asWWOX or FOR) has been mapped to a fragile site on chromosome 16 (24–26). Murine WOX1 is highly homologous to full-length human WWOX (46 kDa) (24Bednarek A.K. Laflin K.J. Daniel R.L. Liao Q. Hawkins K.A. Aldaz C.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2140-2145PubMed Google Scholar) and FOR II (46.7 kDa) (25Reid K. Finnis M. Hobson L. Mangelsdorf M. Dayan S. Nancarros J.K. Woollatt E. Kremmidiotis G. Gardner A. Venter D. Baker E. Richards R.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Three alternatively spliced variants are FOR I (41.2 kDa), FOR III (21.5 kDa), and FOR IV (4.1 kDa), which possess distinct C-terminal ends (Fig. 1) (25Reid K. Finnis M. Hobson L. Mangelsdorf M. Dayan S. Nancarros J.K. Woollatt E. Kremmidiotis G. Gardner A. Venter D. Baker E. Richards R.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Two alternatively spliced variants we have identified and sequenced are human prostate WOX3 (identical to FOR III; GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AI669330 and AF187015) (Fig. 1) and FOR I-related human WOX5 (a partial clone; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AI219858), whose ADH domain, but not the N terminus, is identical to the sequence of FOR I. Murine L929 fibroblasts constitutively expressed a low level of Wox1 mRNA, as determined by Northern blotting (Fig.2 A). Exposure of L929 cells to hyaluronidase for 2–24 h resulted in increased Wox1 gene expression (∼2.3 kilobases), peaking at 8–24 h (∼150% increase) (Fig. 2 A). The induced Wox1 gene expression correlates positively with the induction of TNF sensitivity in L929 cells, which requires pretreatment with hyaluronidase for at least 10 h (11Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chang N.-S. Carey G. Pratt N. Chu E. Ou M. Cancer Lett. 1998; 132: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As predicted, in vitro translation of the full-length murineWox1 cDNA produced a protein of ∼46 kDa, as analyzed by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2 B). A 30-kDa product was also observed (Fig.2 B). This protein is most likely a degradation product of 46-kDa WOX1 since Wox1 mRNA, which is derived from the cloned full-length cDNA, is unlikely to undergo alternative splicing. WOX1 is a single chain protein and does not exist as a dimer, as determined by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A putative caspase recognition site is DIND (267). However, this site does not appear to be the proteolytic degradation site. Alteration of the DIND sequence to a non-caspase recognition sequence (GING) by site-directed mutagenesis failed to prevent WOX1 degradation (Fig.2 B). The caspase inhibitor peptide acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (aldehyde) at 100–200 μm failed to block WOX1 degradation during in vitro translation. Furthermore, the serine protease inhibitors leupeptin and leuhistin at 100 μm could not inhibit WOX1 degradation during in vitro translation. Stimulation of L929 cells with hyaluronidase induced WOX1 protein expression (Fig. 2 C). Our produced antibodies, which interacted with both human and mouse WOX1, recognized both 46- and 30-kDa WOX1 (Fig. 2 C). Whether this 30-kDa WOX1 is a degraded protein from 46-kDa WOX1 remains to be determined. Our produced antibodies are specific since the preimmune serum failed to interact with both WOX1 proteins, the synthetic WOX1 peptide blocked the binding of the antibodies to WOX1, and the antiserum also interacted with the in vitro translated WOX1 protein (data not shown). Immunostaining of COS-7 fibroblasts with anti-WOX1 and anti-cytochrome c antibodies showed the presence of WOX1 in the mitochondria and nuclei, as determined by confocal microscopy and colocalization analysis (Fig.3 A). Similar results were observed using neonatal rat heart H9c2 cells (Fig. 3 B). These results were further confirmed using human ovarian ME180 and HeLa, breast MCF-7, and neural SK-N-SH cells; isolated rat heart cardiomyocytes; and murine NIH/3T3 and L929 cells. The presence of WOX1 in the mitochondria was further confirmed by Western blotting using purified rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 3 C). COX4 was examined as a marker protein for mitochondria (Fig. 3 C). Tagging of full-length murine WOX1 with an N-terminal GFP sequence (construct 2) (Table I) and expression in COS-7 cells revealed the presence of GFP-WOX1 in the mitochondria, as determined 24 h post-transfection (Fig.3 D). Mitochondria were stained by the membrane potential-sensitive stain Mitotracker Red CMXRos. Less than 10% of the transfected cells had nuclear localization of this protein. By making successive deletion constructs (constructs 5–7) (Table I) and expressing these constructs in COS-7 cells, the mitochondrial targeting sequence in WOX1 was mapped within the ADH domain (amino acids 209–273; construct 7) (Fig. 3 D). The truncated GFP-WOX1ww protein (amino acids 1–95; construct 4), which contains only the N-terminal WW domains and NLS, was expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 3 E). Similarly, the human prostate GFP-WOX3 protein (see Fig. 1), which possesses the WW domains, the NLS, and a partial ADH domain, was expressed in the nucleus (data not shown). A time course study showed TNF-mediated GFP-WOX1 nuclear translocation (Fig. 3 F). This was determined by examining isolated nuclei by Western blotting using an established L929 cell line stably expressing the GFP-WOX1 protein (Fig. 3 F). This observation correlates with the time point of TNF-mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol in L929 cells (Fig.3 F). Similarly, time-dependent endogenous WOX1 protein nuclear translocation was also observed in COS-7 and H9c2 cells upon stimulation with TNF for 20 min (data not shown). TNF-mediated WOX1 nuclear translocation took at least 20–40 min, which occurred shortly after TNF-mediated p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation (at ∼10–15 min), as determined by immunostaining and fluorescent microscopy. Alteration of the NLS sequence (GKRKRV) to a less hydrophilic sequence (GQGTGV) by site-directed mutagenesis (construct 18) abolished the TNF-mediated nuclear translocation of this mutant protein. No nuclear translocation was observed when treating the ADH domain (GFP-WOX1adh, construct 5)-expressing cells with TNF. In parallel with the TNF-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition, treatment of COS-7 cells with atractyloside (2 mm) (27Fiore C. Trezeguet V. Le Saux A. Roux P. Schwimmer C. Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Vignais P.V. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) for 40 min to increase the opening of mitochondrial transition pores also resulted in cytochrome c release to the cytosol and WOX1 nuclear translocation (data not shown). To determine the effect of WOX1 on TNF cytotoxic functions, we established several L929 cell lines that stably expressed the above indicated GFP-WOX1"

Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which stimulate the exchange of bound GDP for GTP. We recently isolated a putative GEF, termed p190RhoGEF that binds to RhoA and, when overexpressed in neuronal cells, induces cell rounding and inhibits neurite outgrowth. Here we show that the isolated tandem Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology domain of p190RhoGEF activates RhoA in vitro, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, as determined by GDP release and protein binding assays. In contrast, full-length p190RhoGEF fails to activate RhoA in vitro. When overexpressed in intact cells, however, p190RhoGEF does activate RhoA with subsequent F-actin reorganization and serum response factor-mediated transcription. Immunofluorescence studies show that endogenous p190RhoGEF localizes to distinct RhoA-containing regions at the plasma membrane, to the cytosol and along microtubules.In vitro and in vivo binding experiments show that p190RhoGEF directly interacts with microtubules via its C-terminal region adjacent to the catalytic Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology domain. Our results indicate that p190RhoGEF is a specific activator of RhoA that requires as yet unknown binding partners to unmask its GDP/GTP exchange activity in vivo, and they suggest that p190RhoGEF may provide a link between microtubule dynamics and RhoA signaling.

In the GTP-bound state they bind to effector proteins resulting in multiple downstream responses. Among the best studied effects of Rho GTPases is the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In fibroblasts, RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 induce the formation of stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively (1Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Cell. 1995; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rho GTPases have been implicated in the control of diverse responses such as cell adhesion, motility, transcription activation, cell cycle progression, cytokinesis, and cell fate determination (4Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases are activated by the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1that stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP and are characterized by a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain is responsible for catalytic activity (5Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the PH domain is essential either for proper localization (6Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Olson M.F. Sterpetti P. Nagata K. Toksoz D. Hall A.

The Dbl family consists of more than 30 members, showing tissue-specific distribution patterns and distinct specificity for Rho, Rac, or Cdc42. Dbl family members contain various conserved structural motifs, like Ca2+-binding EF-hands,Src-homology 2 (SH2),Src-homology 3 (SH3), andPsd95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) homology domains (9Stam J.C. Collard J.G. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 51-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most of these domains presumably mediate protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions, thereby coupling GEFs to upstream regulators or downstream effectors. Some GEFs have been shown to function in specific biological processes: for example, Ect2 regulates cytokinesis (10Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) while Vav plays a role in adaptive immunity (11Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic studies have revealed the importance of GEFs in development: DRhoGEF mediates cell shape changes during gastrulation of Drosophila embryos (12Barrett K. Leptin M. Settleman J. Cell. 1997; 91: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and UNC-73A is required for cell and growth cone migration in Caenorhabditis elegans (13Steven R.

However, the biological roles of most Dbl family GEFs remain unclear. In neuronal cells, RhoA mediates neurite retraction and cell rounding in response to G protein-coupled receptor agonists such as lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin (14Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Receptor stimulation induces translocation of RhoA from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (15Kranenburg O. Poland M. Gebbink M. Oomen L. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of RhoA. RhoA activation and neurite retraction are mediated by the G12/13 subfamily of trimeric G proteins (16Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) whose (17Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

We recently isolated a novel RhoA-binding protein of 190 kDa that contains a DH/PH domain and, hence, is a putative GEF for Rho family GTPases (20Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We called this protein p190RhoGEF, and showed that it is ubiquitously expressed. When overexpressed in neuronal cells, p190RhoGEF mimics activated RhoA in stimulating cytoskeletal contraction and preventing neurite outgrowth. It remains unclear, however, to what extent the DH/PH catalytic domain of p190RhoGEF is abona fide activator of RhoA and/or other Rho family members. p190RhoGEF contains several potential regulatory motifs, including an N-terminal leucine-rich region, a cysteine-rich zinc-finger domain and a C-terminal region that may form an α-helical coiled-coil (Fig.1). In the present study, we have characterized p190RhoGEF in further biochemical and cell biological detail. We show that p190RhoGEF is a specific activator of RhoA both in vitro and in vivo. We find that full-length p190RhoGEF, unlike its isolated DH/PH domain, is inactive in vitro, indicating that additional factors are required to activate p190RhoGEF in vivo. Furthermore, we show that p190RhoGEF binds to and colocalizes with microtubules, suggesting that p190RhoGEF may provide a link between microtubule dynamics and RhoA signaling. COS-7 and N1E-115 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and antibiotics. COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method, whereas NIH3T3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies) as described by the manufacturer. For luciferase assays, transfection was stopped after 3 h by switching to culture medium containing 0.5% newborn calf serum. Cloning of full-length p190RhoGEF (bp 1–5400) and ΔNp190RhoGEF (bp 2156–5400) has been described (20Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-HA-p190RhoGEF was generated in two steps. First, a polymerase chain reaction was performed on pBSKML4 using primers gctctagaaggtaccccatggagttgagctgcagtg and T3, followed by digestion withXba I-Apa I and subcloning into pcDNA3-HA, resulting in pcDNA3-HA-ΔRhoGEF. Subsequently, anApa I-Apa I fragment of full-length p190RhoGEF (bp 625–5400) was cloned into pcDNA3-HA-ΔRhoGEF resulting in the final construct pcDNA3-HA-p190RhoGEF (bp 105–5400). Removal of a Bst EII-Not I fragment from pcDNA3-HA-p190RhoGEF generated ΔCp190RhoGEF (bp 105–4135). The p190RhoGEF-DH/PH (bp 2534–3734) deletion mutant was generated by using primers cccggtcgacttctctgtggatcgacct and ccccgcggccgcggcca. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on the full-length p190RhoGEF cDNA, followed by digestion with Sal I and Not I and subcloning into pMT2sm-HA. The Quick mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to make a single-point mutation, Y1003A, in pcDNA3-HA-p190RhoGEF using the primers cccagcgcatcacaaaggccccagtcttggtgg and ccaccaagactggggcctttgtgatgcgctggg. The GST-C terminus (bp 4189–5400) construct was prepared by subcloning aBam HI-Eco RI fragment from pcDNA3-HA-p190RhoGEF into pRP259, a derivative of pGEX-1N. The construction of pGEX-C21 (GST-C21), pGST-PAK-CD (GST-PBD), pMT2smHA-C1199Tiam1 and SRE.L-luciferase plasmids are described elsewhere (21Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

A polyclonal anti-RhoGEF serum, termed antibody 40, was made by immunizing rabbits with a GST fusion protein containing the DH/PH domain of p190RhoGEF (bp 2534–3734). This plasmid was generated by subcloning a Sal I-Eco RI fragment from pMT2smHA-DH/PH cDNA into pRP261, a derivative of pGEX-3X. Rho and Rac proteins were detected with 26C4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 23A8 (Upstate Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies. GST was detected with the 2F3 monoclonal antibody. Cytoskeletal structures were analyzed using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular probes) and monoclonal anti-tubulin antibodies (Sigma). A polyclonal anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used for immunoprecipitation. Recombinant Rho was prepared fromEscherichia coli using a bacterial expression system as described previously (25Self, A. J., and Hall, A. (1995) in Small GTPases and Their Regulators, W.E. Balch, C.J. Der, A. Hall, Pt. B, pp. 3–10, Academic Press Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Single 9-cm dishes of COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of expression plasmid encoding HA-tagged DH/PH domain. In case full-length p190RhoGEF was assayed, 20 dishes were transfected. After 48 h cells were lysed in 300 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. After clearance (13,000 rpm, 10 min), cell lysates were precleared with nonspecific mouse immunoglobulins precoupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequently incubated with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose. GDP dissociation from RhoA was assayed exactly as described (26Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using 30 μl of slurry (50% beads/buffer) per assay. Control immune complexes were prepared from mock-transfected COS-7 cells. Recombinant proteins of DH/PH domain, truncated RhoA (amino acid residues 1–181), Rac1 and Cdc42 were produced as GST fusion proteins in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (27Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fluorescent derivative of GDP, mGDP (2′,3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)guanosine 5′-diphosphate), in complex with the respective GTPases was prepared (28Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The nucleotide exchange activity of the DH/PH domain was determined on an LS50B Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer (Norwalk, CT) using 0.1 μm mGDP-bound GTPase, 20 μm GDP, and different concentration of DH/PH domain in 30 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKPO4, 3 mm dithioerythritol, pH 7.5, at 25 °C as described for Cdc25 (28Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Exponential fits to the data were done using the program Grafit (Erithacus software). Preparation of GST-C21 and GST-PBD and analysis of cellular activation of Rho and Rac was performed as described previously (21Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A.

Lysates were centrifuged to remove debris, and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose loaded with 20 μg of either GST-C21 or GST-PBD. The beads were washed three times with the Nonidet P-40 buffer and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To determine interactions between p190RhoGEF and GST-GTPases, transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C withE. coli expressed, GST-RhoA, GST-Rac, or GST-Cdc42 bound to GSH-Sepharose. Samples were washed three times in the 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer and the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Experiments testing the nucleotide dependence of the interactions were performed similarly, except that GST-RhoA was preloaded in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm of either GDP or GTPγS for 1 h at 4 °C. N1E-115 and NIH3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips. After overnight culturing in serum-free medium, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and were processed for immunofluorescence as described (15Kranenburg O. Poland M. Gebbink M. Oomen L. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 12CA5, antibody 40, or anti-RhoA antibodies as indicated. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and anti-tubulin antibody were used to stain F-actin and tubulin, respectively. Luciferase activities were measured 24 h after the start of the transfection by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. In the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases are measured sequentially from a single sample. Luminescence intensities were measured using the TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs model, Promega) counting the ratio of luminescence between the firefly and the Renilla luciferase reactions. Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in tubulin buffer (Cytoskeleton) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman airfuge. Supernatant fractions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with purified, Taxol-stabilized microtubules, which were generated using the Microtubule/Tubulin Biochem Kit from Cytoskeleton. Alternatively, purified GST fusion proteins were prepared and incubated with microtubules. Microtubules were pelleted by high-speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h) and supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HA or anti-tubulin antibodies. p190RhoGEF was expressed in COS-7 cells as described above. Two days after transfection cells were serum-starved for 1 h, labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 4 h, and then lysed in a buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. Lysates were clarified and precipitated with 12CA5 or tubulin antibodies precoupled to protein A-Sepharose. Reprecipitation was performed by boiling the immunoprecipitates for 5 min in lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS, followed by adding 9 volumes of lysis buffer and antibodies precoupled to protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed extensively, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Fig.1 shows the structural features of p190RhoGEF in comparison to other Dbl family GEFs. The DH/PH domain of p190RhoGEF is most closely related to the DH/PH domains in the Rho-specific GEFs Brx and proto-Lbc (52% identity), Lfc (50%), GEF-H1 (48%), and p115RhoGEF (25%) (22Reid T.

Aside from its DH/PH domain, p190RhoGEF contains an N-terminal leucine-rich region and a cysteine-rich domain that could form a zinc finger. C-terminal of the DH/PH domain, p190RhoGEF contains a region with high propensity to form coiled coils, as is also observed in GEF-H1. We note that p190RhoGEF lacks an apparent LH domain that can interact directly with G protein α subunits, as in p115RhoGEF (18Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). We examined whether p190RhoGEF can stimulate GDP/GTP exchange on Rho family GTPases in vitro. Specific exchange activity was determined using an assay in which the dissociation of fluorescently labeled GDP from RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 is monitored in real time (28Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the isolated DH/PH domain promotes nucleotide exchange on RhoA, but not on Rac-1 or Cdc42. The p190RhoGEF catalytic domain stimulates the rate of nucleotide exchange on RhoA about 40-fold (from 0.0048 min−1 to 0.193 min−1). We find a similar stimulation using the DH/PH domain of p115RhoGEF (data not shown), which is 4-fold higher than what has been reported for p115RhoGEF-mediated GDP/GTP exchange (29Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To examine whether p190RhoGEF acts as a Rho-specific GEF in vivo, we measured endogenous RhoA activation by affinity precipitation. In this assay, the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin (GST-C21) is used to specifically precipitate GTP-bound RhoA from cell extracts (30Reid T. Bathoorn A. Ahmadian M.R. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33587-33593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain of the Rac/Cdc42 effector protein PAK (GST-PBD) was used to pull-down activated Rac (31Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that expression of the isolated DH/PH domain of p190RhoGEF in COS-7 cells activates RhoA but not Rac1. Conversely, the Rac-specific GEF Tiam-1 (32Habets G.G.M. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) activates Rac-1 but not RhoA in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 B). Both RhoA and Rac1 appear as doublets, presumably representing differently isoprenylated forms of these GTPases (33Seabra M.C. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the catalytic domain of p190RhoGEF acts specifically on RhoA bothin vitro and in vivo. GEF-mediated stimulation of GDP/GTP exchange involves a direct interaction between GEF and the small GTPase. Although these complexes form transiently, they can be isolated from cells (5Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since p190RhoGEF shows in vitro and in vivo exchange activity toward RhoA, we examined whether the two proteins can form a complex. To this end, we precipitated full-length p190RhoGEF (HA-tagged) from COS-7 cell lysates using immobilized GST fusion proteins of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 3 A, we find that p190RhoGEF binds to RhoA but not to Rac1 or Cdc42. GEFs stimulate GDP/GTP exchange by inducing a conformational change in the GTPase, resulting in the release of bound GDP. GEFs stabilize a transition state, in which interaction occurs with nucleotide-free GTPase. Since cellular GTP levels are much higher than GDP levels, this leads to net GDP/GTP exchange on the GTPase (34Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We examined the binding of p190RhoGEF to RhoA in both nucleotide-bound and nucleotide-free states. Nucleotide was depleted from GST-RhoA by chelating magnesium from the assay buffer. Alternatively, GST-RhoA was loaded with either GDPβS or GTPγS. Fig. 3 B shows that p190RhoGEF associates with all three forms of RhoA, although it appears that there is a slight preference for binding to nucleotide-depleted RhoA. This is in agreement with previous findings on the binding of other GEFs to small GTPases (5Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Aside from the tandem DH/PH domain, p190RhoGEF contains several structural elements that may play a role in regulating its activity and/or intracellular localization. We compared thein vitro exchange activity of the full-length protein to that of the isolated catalytic DH/PH domain. Fig.4 A shows that, while the DH/PH domain promotes GDP/GTP exchange on RhoA, the full-length protein is completely inactive. About equal amounts of proteins were precipitated from the cell lysates (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). Even under conditions where the full-length protein was used in excess of the DH/PH domain, exchange activity was only detected with the isolated DH/PH domain (Fig. 4 B). Although the Rho-specific GEFs Ect-2 and GEF-H1 are active as full-length proteins (10Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 36Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the activities of most GEFs have only been tested with the isolated DH/PH domains. Of note, in fibroblast transformation assays, Lbc, Dbl, Ost, and p115RhoGEF are only active when truncated (5Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol.

Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The striking difference in in vitro activity between full-length and truncated p190RhoGEF suggests that the full-length protein contains an intrinsic autoinhibitory domain and requires cellular factors to be activated. When activated, RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 induce specific rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. In fibroblasts, RhoA induces stress fiber formation, whereas lamellipodia and filopodia are formed in response to activated Rac and Cdc42, respectively. We examined the cytoskeletal changes induced by full-length p190RhoGEF in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig.5 A, p190RhoGEF mimics active RhoA in inducing the formation of actin stress fibers, with no sign of the formation of membrane ruffles or filopodia. These findings in 3T3 cells are consistent with the observation that p190RhoGEF induces cytoskeletal contraction and inhibits neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (20Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition to their effects on the actin cytoskeleton, Rho GTPases can modulate gene transcription. In particular, activated forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 can activate the serum response factor (SRF) (40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). We examined whether p190RhoGEF could activate SRF-mediated transcription by using a reporter plasmid in which the luciferase gene is under the control of a c-Fos serum-responsive promotor element (pSRE.L). This modified SRE element depends on SRF, but not on Elk-1 activity, making it a specific reporter for signaling by Rho family GTPases (24Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with pSRE.L and full-length p190RhoGEF. As shown in Fig. 5 B, expression of p190RhoGEF results in a 5-fold activation of SRF, similar to what is observed after serum stimulation (Fig. 5 B). We also used a point mutant of p190RhoGEF in which residue Tyr10"

https://openalex.org/W2006506893,"The Drosophila eye disc is a sac of single layer epithelium with two opposing sides, the peripodial membrane (PM) and the disc proper (DP). Retinal morphogenesis is organized by Notch signaling at the dorsoventral (DV) boundary in the DP. Functions of the PM in coordinating growth and patterning of the DP are unknown. We show that the secreted proteins, Hedgehog, Wingless, and Decapentaplegic, are expressed in the PM, yet they control DP expression of Notch ligands, Delta and Serrate. Peripodial clones expressing Hedgehog induce Serrate in the DP while loss of peripodial Hedgehog disrupts disc growth. Furthermore, PM cells extend cellular processes to the DP. Therefore, peripodial signaling is critical for eye pattern formation and may be mediated by peripodial processes."

https://openalex.org/W2113058640,"Cells employ a diverse array of signaling mechanisms to establish spatial patterns during development. Nowhere is this better understood than in Drosophila, where the limbs and eyes arise from discrete epithelial sacs called imaginal discs. Molecular-genetic analyses of pattern formation have generally treated discs as single epithelial sheets. Anatomically, however, discs comprise a columnar cell monolayer covered by a squamous epithelium known as the peripodial membrane. Here we demonstrate that during development, peripodial cells signal to disc columnar cells via microtubule-based apical extensions. Ablation and targeted gene misexpression experiments demonstrate that peripodial cell signaling contributes to growth control and pattern formation in the eye and wing primordia. These findings challenge the traditional view of discs as monolayers and provide foundational evidence for peripodial cell function in Drosophila appendage development."

The functional role of type 1 chains is not known, but several studies have indicated that some of them are differentially expressed in cancer. In particular, CEA expressed in colon cancer is characterized by the absence of such chains (2Yamashita K. Totani K. Kuroki M. Matsuoka Y. Ueda I. Kobata A.

Kanai M. Kuroki M. Matsuoka Y. Kobata A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At this regard, a β1,3Gal-T activity measured using GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc as acceptor was found lower in adenocarcinomas than in normal mucosa (5Seko A. Ohkura T. Kitamura H. Yonezawa S. Sato E. Yamashita K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3468-3473PubMed Google Scholar). However, type 1 chain Lewis antigens sialyl-Lewis a (sLea) and Leb are considered tumor markers (6Hakomori S.-I. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar), and serum levels of sLea (CA19-9 antigen) are used for clinical diagnosis and follow-up of epithelial cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (7Narimatsu H.

Five β3Gal-T cDNAs are presently available. β3Gal-T1, cloned first from melanoma cells (11Sasaki, K., Sasaki, E., Kawashima, K., Hanai, N., Nishi, T., and Hasegawa, M.

Moreover, there is no evidence yet for their ability to synthesize the type 1 chain. In particular, β3Gal-T3 was very recently reported as a GalNAc transferase involved in globoside biosynthesis and renamed β3GalNAc-T1 (15Okajima, T., Nakamura, Y., Uchikawa, M., Haslam, D. B., Numata, S.-I., Furukawa, K., Urano, T., and Furukawa, K. (September 18, 2000)J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc. M006902200Google Scholar). β3Gal-T5, cloned from colon carcinoma cells, was found to direct synthesis of sLea in different cell lines, and its expression levels correlate with those of Lewis type 1 antigens in cancer cell lines from colon and pancreas (16Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol.

This enzyme was suggested to be the one previously characterized as the β1,3Gal-T active on glycolipids (17Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 630-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and GlcNAc (18Sheares B.T. Carlson D.M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and involved in the synthesis of core 3 O-glycans (20Zhou D. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The above data led to the working hypothesis that the biosynthesis of different type 1 chain oligosaccharides may depend on the expression of different and differentially regulated β3Gal-Ts. In particular, an enzyme able to act on N-glycans would be expected to be less active in cancer than in normal mucosa, whereas another active onO-glycans should be more expressed in cancer. To evaluate whether β3Gal-T5 is actually involved in the biosynthesis of a specific subset of type 1 chain oligosaccharides and expressed in a cancer-associated manner, we have transiently transfected CHO cells expressing Fuc-TIII with β3Gal-T cDNAs and compared the relative ability of enzymes to direct synthesis of Lewis type 1 antigens. We then constructed CHO clones permanently expressing Fuc-TIII and β3Gal-T5, Fuc-TIII and β3Gal-T2, or Fuc-TIII and β3Gal-T1, determined the effect of drugs affecting glycosylation on antigen expression, and characterized the oligosaccharides that became radioactive in some clones upon metabolic labeling with tritiated Gal. Moreover, we studied the substrate specificity of β3Gal-T5 by calculating the kinetic constants toward different acceptors, and measured the expression levels of the transcript in colon adenocarcinomas and surrounding normal mucosa by competitive RT-PCR. We further modified the CHO clone expressing β3Gal-T5 to make it able to stably express human CEA and investigated the presence of type 1 chains in CEA purified from such clone.

Ganglioside sialyl-lacto-N-neotetraosylceramide was purified from bovine erythrocytes using the procedure reported by Chien et al. (22Chien J.-L. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4031-4035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcNAcβ1→2Man was from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK), GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→O-methyl and GlcNAcβ1→6Manα→O-methyl were from Sigma. Anti-sLex monoclonal antibody was precipitated from the culture media of hybridoma CSLEX1 (ATCC HB-8580) by ammonium sulfate, resuspended, dialyzed, and kept at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Anti-Lea and anti-sLea monoclonal antibodies were as reported (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-CEA (clone COL-1) was from NeoMarkers (Lab Vision, Italy). CHO cells expressing Polyoma virus T antigen and Fuc-TIII (CHO-T-FT), COLO-205, and WM266-4 cells were cultured as described previously (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Human gastric adenocarcinoma MKN-45 cells (a gift of C. Ponzetto, University of Turin), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 1.0 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-Glu. For transient transfection, 2.0 × 105 CHO-T-FT cells were plated in 12-well plates 20 h before transfection, washed with serum free α-minimal essential medium, and incubated with 0.5 ml of transfection solution for 3 h under usual growing conditions. Transfection solutions, containing 1 μg/ml β3Gal-T cDNA in pcDNAI or pCDM8 vectors plus 0.065 μg/ml pcDNAI-Luc and 18 μl/ml DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were prepared and used as reported previously (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended with PBS. One-tenth of resuspended cells was processed for luciferase activity determination, using a commercial kit (Luciferase assay system, Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The remaining material was stained and analyzed by flow cytometry as previously reported (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For treating cell lines and clones with drugs affecting glycosylation, 1 × 105 cells were plated in 12-well plates and incubated overnight, and the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.1 μg/ml swainsonine (Sigma), 2 mm benzyl-α-GalNAc (Sigma), or 2 mm sodium butyrate. After 48 h, medium was replaced with fresh medium containing drugs. After additional 48 h, cells were collected, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry (19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CHO clones expressing either Fuc-TIII and β3Gal-T5 (CHO-FT-T5), Fuc-TIII and β3Gal-T2 (CHO-FT-T2), or Fuc-TIII and β3Gal-T1 (CHO-FT-T1) were obtained by the calcium phosphate transfection method (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4814) Google Scholar), using a modification of the procedure reported (24Valli M. Bardoni A. Trinchera M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA mixture (20 μg) contained 1 μg of Eco RI-linearized pSV2Neo, 10 μg of Sca I-linearized pcDNAI/ Fuc-TIII, and 10 μg ofSca I-linearized pCDM8/β3Gal-T5, or 10 μg ofKpn I-linearized pCDM8/β3Gal-T2, or 10 μg ofSca I-linearized pcDNAI/β3Gal-T1, respectively. Upon selection with 0.4 mg/ml active G418, 30 (CHO-FT-T5 and CHO-FT-T1) or 60 colonies (CHO-FT-T2) were collected using cloning cylinders, grown in tissue culture slides, stained with anti-sLea or anti-Lea antibody followed by secondary FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Two or three positive colonies were subcloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates, and several subclones were analyzed as above. sLeaand Lea expression on positive colonies was quantitated by flow cytometry. Single colonies expressing a constant level of sLea and Lea, named CHO-FT-T5, CHO-FT-T2, and CHO-FT-T1, respectively, were selected and used for further characterization and experiments. CHO cells expressing CEA (CHO-FT-T5-CEA) were obtained from clone CHO-FT-T5 by the transfection procedure described above but using 20 μg ofKpn I-linearized pCDM8-CEA and 1 μg of pHA58 plasmid in the DNA mixture, and 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for selection. pHA58 plasmid, a generous gift of P. Morandini (University of Milan), was derived from pSV72 vector and had the hygromycin B gene under the control of mouse phosphoglycerate kinase-1 promoter. Monoclonal anti-CEA antibody was used, at 1:100 dilution, for cell staining. β3Gal-T1 cloning in pcDNAI vector has been previously reported (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For β3Gal-T2, -T3, -T4, -T5, and CEA cloning, the corresponding coding sequences were amplified using single-stranded cDNA as template, obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA extracted (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) from WM266-4 (β3Gal-T2), MKN-45 (β3Gal-T3 and CEA), or COLO-205 cells (β3Gal-T4 and -T5), in a reaction mixture containing, in 40-μl volume, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1000 units/ml human placental ribonuclease inhibitor, 1 mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.4 μm oligo(dT)16 primer, 1000 units/ml avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and freshly denatured total RNA (250 μg/ml) as template. Reactions were kept for 90 min at 42 °C. Amplifications were performed in the presence of a commercially available “high fidelity” Taq polymerase (LA Taq, Takara), according to the manufacturer's protocol, using 2.5 μg/ml of each oligonucleotide primer, deduced from published sequences, and 4 μl of reverse transcription reaction for each 100 μl of amplification mixture. PCR reactions were incubated as follows: a single treatment at 94 °C for 3.5 min followed by a cycle consisting of 1.5 min at 94 °C (melting), 2.0 min at 62 °C (annealing), and 2.5 min at 72 °C (extension), repeated 30 (β3Gal-Ts) or 15 times (CEA); a final extension step was performed at 72 °C for 8 min. The amplified DNA was digested with Hin dIII and Xba I (β3Gal-T3) or ligated to Bst XI adaptors (all others), and cloned in pcDNAI (β3Gal-T3) or pCDM8 vectors (all others) using a procedure reported previously (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Direct DNA sequencing of the obtained constructs, performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using an automated procedure, indicated that the coding sequences are identical to those published. pcDNAI-Luc, expressing the luciferase gene, was constructed by removing the luciferase coding sequence from plasmid pGL3 (Promega) usingHin dIII and Xba I, and subcloning into the corresponding sites of pcDNAI vector. β3Gal-T5 and Fuc-TIII were assayed in cell clones as previously reported (19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, β3Gal-T5 was assayed upon transfection of pCDM8-β3Gal-T5 in COS-7 cells. Cells were transfected, harvested, washed, resuspended, and used as the enzyme source, as described previously (21Trinchera M. Bozzaro S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined in a reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 10 μl, 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mg/ml Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml α-lactalbumin, 5 mm CDP-choline, 0.8 mm donor UDP-[3H]Gal, specific radioactivity (10 mCi/mmol), and 0.2–1.0 mg/ml cell protein, in the presence of different acceptors at various concentrations. In the case of glycolipid acceptor, it was dissolved in chloroform/methanol, 4:1 (v/v), mixed in the reaction tube with 15 μg of Triton CF-54 dissolved in the same solvent, and dried before adding the reaction mixture. Incubations were done at 37 °C for 60 min. At the end of incubation, reaction products were assayed by Dowex chromatography (oligosaccharide acceptors) or descending paper chromatography (glycolipid acceptor) according to previously reported protocols (19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Trinchera M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15766-15769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide reaction products were identified by pooling several Dowex eluates, which were lyophilized and purified by Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography (21Trinchera M. Bozzaro S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The obtained saccharides were treated with D. pneumoniae or Xanthomonas manihotis β-galactosidases, specific for β1,4- and β1,3-linkages, respectively, and analyzed using a Bio-Gel P-2 column (19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reaction product with glycolipid acceptor, pooled from several reactions, was purified by Sep-Pack C-18 cartridge, desalted by partitioning in chloroform/methanol/water, 2:1:1 (v/v), and analyzed by HPTLC, using chloroform/methanol/water, 60:35:8 (v/v), as eluting solvent system, and visualized by fluorography (25Trinchera M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15766-15769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO clones (2.0 × 106 cells) were plated in 60-mm dishes containing 0.1 mCi of [3H]Gal (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 2.5 ml of culture medium and incubated 40 h under regular conditions. Labeled cells were harvested as for immunostaining, resuspended in PBS at a density of 4 × 106 cells/0.1 ml, and kept frozen until used. N-Glycans were released from cell suspension by N-glycanase (Glyko) digestion of the material denatured by heating in the presence of SDS, under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. ReleasedN-glycans were isolated by a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge and further purified by Sephadex G-50 chromatography, as reported (24Valli M. Bardoni A. Trinchera M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides released by endo-β-galactosidase were characterized following the procedure reported by Seuyoshi et al. (26Sueyoshi S. Tsuboi S. Sawada-Hirai R. Dang U.N. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Purified N-glycans were passed through a Bio-Gel P-4 column (0.7 × 50 cm), and only the radioactivity eluted with water as a peak close to the exclusion volume was collected, lyophilized, and used for characterization. Endo-β-galactosidase digestion was performed on radioactiveN-glycans, 10,000–20,000 cpm/μl, using the enzyme fromBacteriodes fragilis (Glyko), 0.5 milliunit/μl, in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer, for 20 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then applied to the same Bio-Gel P-4 column as above, and the radioactivity was eluted with the exclusion volume collected and referred to as the endo-β-galactosidase resistantN-glycans, whereas the radioactivity eluted as oligosaccharides was applied to a QAE-Sephadex column to separate neutral and charged sugars, according to a previous procedure (26Sueyoshi S. Tsuboi S. Sawada-Hirai R. Dang U.N. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Material collected in the flow-through was referred to as the neutral oligosaccharides, whereas that eluted with NaCl was collected, desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 column, and treated with Newcastle disease virus sialidase. Neutral and de-sialylated oligosaccharides were analyzed by a Bio-Gel P-4 column (0.7 × 100 cm), eluted with water at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, 4.5 min/fraction. The obtained peaks were collected, lyophilized, and treated with glycohydrolases for characterization. X. manihotis β-galactosidase (Glyko), almond meal α-fucosidase (Oxford Glycosystem), D. pneumoniae β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Glyko),D. pneumoniae β-galactosidase (Sigma), and Newcastle disease virus sialidase (Glyko) digestions were performed on radioactive oligosaccharides, 1000–2000 cpm/μl, according to the procedures reported (19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Sueyoshi S. Tsuboi S. Sawada-Hirai R. Dang U.N. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of Gal released by glycohydrolase treatment of endo-β-galactosidase-resistantN-glycans was determined as reported (19Valli M. Gallanti A. Bozzaro S. Trinchera M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Glycohydrolase digestions of the tetrasaccharide obtained from clone CHO-FT-T5 were analyzed using a Bio-Gel P-2 column (0.7 × 100 cm) eluted with water at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, 4.5 min/fraction, whereas those of the peaks were collected from CHO-FT-T1 using a Bio-Gel P-4 column (0.7 × 100 cm) under the same conditions. CEA was extracted and purified following a published procedure (27Matsuoka Y. Matsuo Y. Okamoto N. Kuroki M. Kuroki M. Ikehara Y. Tumour Biol. 1991; 12: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 2.5 × 107 metabolically labeled cells, prepared as above described, were diluted to 1.5 × 107 cells/ml in PBS, homogenized by vortexing 1 min, and treated with 0.1 unit/ml phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (Glyko) at 37 °C for 2 h. Total reaction was spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected, made 0.6 m with perchloric acid, and centrifuged as above. The clear supernatant was neutralized with NaOH, freeze-dried, resuspended, and loaded onto a Sepharose CL6B column equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm PBS, pH 5.2. Elution was monitored by liquid scintillation counting, and relevant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Western blotting was performed as previously reported (24Valli M. Bardoni A. Trinchera M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) using monoclonal anti-CEA (1:200), anti-sLea (1:500), and anti-sLex (1:100) antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:2000). ECL was developed with Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Homogeneous fractions were collected, lyophilized, and desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 column. Purified [3H]CEA was treated withC. perfringens sialidase and almond meal α-fucosidase, and then with endo-β-galactosidase, under the conditions reported forN-glycan digestion. The reaction mixture was then applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column (0.7 × 50 cm), eluted with water at a flow rate of 0.13 ml/min, 2.5 min/fraction. The obtained peaks, as well as the total purified CEA, were treated with β-galactosidases and analyzed by Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography as above described. For the analysis of human samples, bioptic specimens were collected at surgery, immediately frozen in dry ice, and placed in liquid nitrogen until used. For RNA extraction, 1–2 mm3 of material was homogenized with a rotary homogenizer in 0.5 ml of the lysis buffer from a Qiagen RNeasy minikit and processed in the presence of DNase according to the manufacturer's recommendations. First strand cDNA was synthesized by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously reported (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Control reactions were prepared by omitting the reverse transcriptase in the mixture. First strand cDNA was amplified in a 50-μl reaction and in the presence of 20 fg of competitor for 35 cycles (glycosyltransferases) or 5 pg of competitor for 25 cycles (β-actin), under the conditions reported (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No amplification was detected when the control reactions were used as template. Human β-actin, Fuc-TIII, FUT2, and β3Gal-T1 competitors and oligonucleotide primers used were the same as those described in a previous study (12Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). β3Gal-T2, -T3, -T4, -T5, and mouse β-actin oligonucleotide primers, as well as the restriction enzymes used for competitor preparation, are listed in TableI. Quantification of human β3Gal-T5, β3Gal-T2, β3Gal-T1, and Fuc-TIII transcripts in CHO clones was performed by the same procedure but using 60 fg of each glycosyltransferase competitor, or 20 pg of mouse β-actin competitor, in 50-μl reactions that were amplified for 30 (glycosyltransferases) or 25 cycles (β-actin).Table IOligonucleotide primers used for competitive RT-PCR analysisTarget genePrimer pairs1-aF, forward primer; R, reverse primer.PCR productsRestriction sites for competitorTargetCompetitorbpβ3Gal-T2F: 5′-GCCAAAAGGTCTCTGTTCCGCACTC-3′817556Nde I/Pst IR: 5′-GATTGGGTGCATATCCTC"
https://openalex.org/W2082496490,"RUSH proteins are SWI/SNF-related transcription factors with RING finger signatures near their COOH termini. Long suspected of mediating protein-protein interactions, the RING motif was used to clone a binding partner. The RING finger binding protein (RFBP) is a Type IV P-type ATPase, a putative phospholipid pump, with conserved sequences for two loop segments, an ATP-binding site, a phosphorylation domain, and transmembrane passes potentially involved in substrate binding and translocation. However, RFBP differs from all other Type IV P-type ATPases in three ways. It has only three of four highly conserved NH2-terminal transmembrane passes, it is located in the inner nuclear membrane, and it binds the RING domain. Topographically the orientation of the adjacent hydrophilic domains and the determinants of transport specificity are altered. As a result, the small, hydrophilic loop extends into the perinuclear space that is contiguous with the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The large, conformationally flexible loop extends into the nucleoplasm to contact euchromatin. Competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and high performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that endometrial RFBP mRNA expression is hormonally regulated. The physical association of a hormone-dependent RING finger-binding protein with transcriptionally active chromatin supports the speculation that RFBP plays a role in the subnuclear trafficking of transcription factors with RING motifs.

RING finger binding protein polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) base pair(s) high performance liquid chromatography rapid amplification cDNA ends glutathione S-transferase Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 reverse transcription RUSH is an acronym for proteins with RING finger motifs that bind to the uteroglobin promoter (1Chilton B.S. Hewetson A. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); RUSH nucleophosphoproteins contain regions of homology with members of the SWI/SNF superfamily of DNA-dependent helicases/ATPases. The expression of RUSH-1α (1005-amino acids, 113 kDa) and RUSH-1β (836 amino acids, 95 kDa) is regulated by a steroid-dependent alternative splicing mechanism (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar) in which α is the progesterone-dependent splice variant, and β is the estrogen-dependent splice variant. Thus, the acronym acknowledges that in a changing hormonal milieu transcription is bypassed by alternative splicing, and the response of individual target genes is accelerated or “RUSHed.” Sequence alignment of homologs from rabbit, human, rodent, and plant (3Devine J.H. Hewetson A. Lee V.H. Chilton B.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) showed that all RUSH proteins contain the RING finger motif (C3HC4 or RING-HC), which binds two zinc ions in a unique cross-braced system (4Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Roddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). RING fingers can be associated with other motifs to form larger, conserved domains such as the RING finger-B box-α-helical coiled-coil (RBCC) domain (4Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Roddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Some changes have occurred in the RING such that RING-H2 (C3H2C3) designates a subclass in which a histidine residue was substituted for the fourth cysteine residue. The U-box (UFD2 homology domain) is a degenerate version of the RING motif that lacks the signature metal-chelating residues (5Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar,6Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 132-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Unlike the authentic RING finger that is stabilized by binding zinc ions, it has been inferred from the PROMODII model that the U-box is maintained by a system of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (6Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 132-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the RING motif binds two zinc ions to form an integrated structural unit that mediates protein-protein interactions (4Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Roddy M.N. Freemont P.S.

The search for functional binding partners ultimately led to the demonstration that the RING domain in one protein can associate with another RING-domain to promote homo- or heterodimerization. Alternatively, the RING domain can also associate with non-RING domains (10Kentsis A. Borden K. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 49-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of the functional link between the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the RING-containing protein Cbl has attracted considerable attention (11Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 84-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although these studies support the idea that the RING motif is involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (11Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 84-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Borden (9Borden K.L.B. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) used site-directed mutagenesis to show that the RING finger motif of the promyelocytic leukemia oncoprotein PML is necessary for the formation of speckled nuclear bodies also known as promyelocytic oncogenic domains. More recently, Cao et al. (16Cao T. Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that mutations of the RING finger resulted in the retention of the RET finger protein in the cytoplasm even though the putative nuclear localization signal was intact. These studies suggest that the RING finger plays a role in nuclear targeting. When the RING motif of the RUSH gene was used to clone a RING finger-binding protein (RFBP),1 a new Type IV P-type ATPase was identified in the inner nuclear membrane. The topographical orientation of the molecule allows the large conformationally flexible loop portion of the protein to contact euchromatin. These physical affiliations support the speculation that RFBP and RUSH are functionally linked during transcription. cDNA Synthesis System Plus, cDNA cloning system-λgt11, Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit, pGEX-2TK vector, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, protein A-Sepharose™CL-4B, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the following isotope were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech: [α-35S]dATP, 1000 Ci/mmol, for sequencing. The SMART rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE) and MarathonTMcDNA amplification kits, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) MIMIC construction kit, Rabbit genomic library, TaqStart antibody, Tth Start antibody, Advantage genomic PCR kit, and Advantage Tth polymerase mix were purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). TaKaRa ExTaq enzyme and 10× LA PCR buffer were purchased from PanVera Corp. (Madison, WI). The GeneAmp RNA PCR core kit and Amplitaq gold DNA polymerase were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The vector pSCREEN-1b(+), thrombin cleavage capture kit, T7-Tag antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate, S-protein alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and BLR(DE3)pLysS cells were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The pCR™II and pCR®II-TOPO vectors are components of individual TA cloning kits, which were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). MetaPhor-agarose was purchased from BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Inc. (Rockland, ME). A 1-kb ladder was purchased from Promega(Madison, WI). The binary gradient HPLC system was purchased from Rainin Instrument Co., Inc. (Woburn, MA), and the DNASep columns containing alkylated polystyrene-divinylbenzene packing were purchased from Transgenomic, Inc. (San Jose, CA). Kodak X-Omat AR film was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Renaissance chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nitrocellulose transfer/immobilization membranes were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Tri reagent was purchased from Molecular Research Center, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). LR White resin and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 6- or 15-nm gold were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Ft. Washington, PA). Rabbit antipeptide antibodies were made to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin peptide at Research Genetics (Huntsville, Alabama). Amino acids 663–678 were selected because they displayed strong antigenicity according to the PeptideStructure program (Genetics Computer Group Software, Madison, WI), and because they are unique to RFBP. They share only 3 of 16 amino acids common to any authentic Type IV P-type ATPase in the GenBankTM data base. The antipeptide antibody titer was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with free peptide on the solid phase (1 μg/well), goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as the secondary antibody, and peroxidase dye. To reduce complications from nonspecific binding, antibodies were affinity-purified. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) synthesized all PCR primers. Dr. J. Y. Chou, Human Genetics Branch, NICHD, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD), provided HRE-H9 cells. For cloning, the RING motif was amplified from 50 ng of a 1030-bp partial RUSH cDNA clone (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar). The 50-μl PCR reaction mix contained LA PCR buffer (1X), TaKaRa ExTaq DNA polymerase (2.5 units/50 μl), TaqStart antibody (0.55 μg/50 μl), dNTPs (0.2 mm each), and primers (0.2 mm each). The forward primer (5′-GCG↓AGCT↑CA TGT GCT ATA TGC TTG G-3′) had a unique Sac I site (bold), and the reverse primer (5′-GCA↓AGCT↑TC TGC ATA AAG GGC AC-3′) had a unique Hin dIII site (bold). A four-step, hot-start PCR reaction was performed. The conditions were as follows: 45 s at 95 °C followed by 10 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 39.5 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s, 10 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 38.5 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s, 10 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s, 20 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 142-bp PCR product was cloned into pCRTMII, excised with appropriate restriction enzymes, and directionally subcloned into theSac I-Hin dIII sites of the pSCREEN-1b(+) expression vector. Insert orientation was confirmed by sequencing in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. Recombinant protein with a T7 tag, a His tag, and an S tag at its NH2 terminus was induced by exposure to isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) and purified by metal chelation chromatography. Briefly, recombinant His-tag protein was eluted under native conditions (1 mimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), dialyzed against water to remove excess salt, and lyophilized. The protein concentration (1.05 mg/ml) was determined according to Lowryet al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The leader sequence containing the T7 tag, and the His tag was removed by digestion with biotinylated thrombin. Biotinylated thrombin was separated from the remaining S-tag protein with streptavidin-agarose. A λgt11 cDNA expression library was prepared using mRNA isolated from HRE-H9 cells (18Li W.I. Chen C.L. Chou J.Y. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2862-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and screened according to Macgregor et al.(19Macgregor P.F. Abate C. Curran T. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 451-458PubMed Google Scholar) to identify protein binding partners. Nitrocellulose filter replicas were prepared from λgt11 recombinants (≈3 × 104 plaque-forming units/plate) and processed with 6m guanidine-HCL denaturation-renaturation (20Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar, 21Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) to ensure proper protein folding. The filters were then screened with the recombinant RING finger protein (1 μg/ml) with ZnSO4 (10 μm) to maintain functional conformation (22Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Keller A.D. Maniatis T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4675-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the T7-tag antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:10,000). A single, plaque-pure clone was rescreened with the thrombin-cleaved recombinant protein (1 μg/ml) in the presence of ZnSO4 (10 μm) and the S-protein alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:5,000). A positive plaque was heated at 100 °C for 10 min, then amplified in a 50-μl PCR reaction mix containing LA PCR buffer (1×), TaKaRa ExTaq DNA polymerase (2.5 units/50 μl), TaqStart antibody (0.55 μg/50 μl), dNTPs (0.2 mm each), and λgt11 primers (0.2 mm each). Forward (5′-GGT GGC GAC GAC TCC TGG AGC CCG-3′) and reverse (5′-TTG ACA CCA GAC CAA CTG GTA ATG-3′) λgt11 primers flank the insert sequence in the vector. Hot-start PCR reactions were performed with the following conditions: 120 s at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 180 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Test and control reactions were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 1584-bp PCR product was cloned into pCRTMII and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. Four different Marathon RACE reactions were performed to obtain overlapping cDNA clones as described under “Results” and in Fig. 1. Poly(A+) RNA (1 μg) from HRE-H9 cells was used in the preparation of adaptor-ligated cDNA libraries. For each PCR reaction, 5 μl of diluted cDNA library was mixed with 45 μl of a PCR reaction mix containing LA PCR buffer (1×), TaKaRa ExTaq DNA polymerase (2.5 units/50 μl), TaqStart antibody (0.55 μg/50 μl), dNTPs (0.2 mm each), and primers (0.2 mmeach). In the first reaction (Fig. 1), RACE primer pair 1 consisted of a forward gene-specific primer (5′-GTG CGT GGA CTC CCT ATG CTG TTT CCC-3′) and a reverse adaptor primer (AP1; 5′-CCA TCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC-3′). A three-step, hot-start PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 60 s at 95 °C followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 180 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 71 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 180 s, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 180 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 1151-bp PCR product (Fig. 1) was cloned into pCR®II-TOPO and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. In the second reaction (Fig. 1), RACE primer pair 2 consisted of a degenerate forward primer (5′-GAY AAR ACN GGN ACN YTN ACN-3′, Y = pyrimidine, R = purine, and N = A, T, G, or C) and a reverse gene-specific primer (5′-CGC TTT CTG CAG TGG TGC CAT ACG ACA GC-3′). A four-step, hot-start PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 240 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 240 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 55 °C for 240 s, 20 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 50 °C for 240 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 1185-bp PCR product was cloned into pCR®II-TOPO and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. The third reaction actually consisted of a primary reaction followed by a nested secondary reaction (Fig. 1). In the primary reaction, the RACE primer pair consisted of the forward AP1 primer and a reverse, gene-specific primer (5′-CAG TGT GAC AGA GAC TGA CTG C-3′). The hot-start PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 62.5 °C for 240 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. Products from this reaction were used in a nested PCR reaction with RACE primer pair 3 (Fig. 1), which consisted of forward adaptor primer 2 (AP2; 5′-ACT CAC TAT AGG GCT CGA GCG GC-3′) and a reverse gene-specific primer (5′-CCT TCT GAA GAA TCT GGT GTC GGT CC-3′). The hot start PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 66.5 °C for 240 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 992-bp PCR product was cloned into pCR®II-TOPO and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. The fourth reaction also consisted of a primary reaction followed by a nested secondary reaction (Fig. 1). In the primary reaction, the RACE primer pair consisted of forward AP1 and a reverse gene-specific primer (5′-CAA GGC CAC CAC TTC GAA CAA CAT AAA CAG G-3′). A six-step, hot start PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 150 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 69 °C for 150 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 150 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 67 °C for 150 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 66 °C for 150 s, 15 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 150 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Products from this reaction were used in a nested PCR reaction with RACE primer pair 4 (Fig. 1), which consisted of forward AP2, and a reverse gene-specific primer (5′-GTC TCA ACC AAT CTT CGT ACC CCT G-3′). A six-step, hot-start PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 67 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 66 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 64 °C for 120 s, 10 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 63 °C for 120 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 314-bp PCR product was cloned into pCR®II-TOPO and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. An amplified rabbit genomic library in the EMBL3 SP6/T7 vector was screened with the 992-bp PCR product of the third PCR reaction described above and in Fig. 1. Nitrocellulose filter replicas were prepared from λgt11 recombinants (≈3 × 104 plaque-forming units/plate) and screened with the random-prime-labeled cDNA (specific activity = 3–6 × 108 CPM/μg). A genomic clone (≈14 kb) was isolated and used as template in a PCR reaction. A region of the genomic DNA (150 ng) was amplified in a 50-μl PCR reaction containing PCR buffer (1×), magnesium acetate (1.1 mm), Tth DNA polymerase (0.1 units), TthStart antibody (0.01 μg/μl), dNTPs (0.2 mmeach), and primers (0.2 mm each). The forward (5′-CAG GGG TAC GAA GAT TGG TTG AGA C-3′) and reverse (5′-CTG TCA GCG TAC CCG TTT TAT CTG TAA ACA C-3′) primers matched sequence in the cDNA. The hot-start PCR amplification reaction was performed as follows: 30 s at 94 °C, followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 67 °C for 360 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 66 °C for 360 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 360 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 64.5 °C for 360 s, 20 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 64 °C for 360 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 742-bp PCR product was cloned into pCR®II-TOPO and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. Rabbit endometrium was homogenized (11 strokes) in 3 volumes (w/v) of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) using a Potter-Elvejhem motor-driven Teflon pestle at 4 °C. To test in vitro protein-protein interactions, Nonidet P-40 was added to an aliquot of the whole tissue homogenate to a final concentration of 1%. This detergent lysate was re-homogenized (5 strokes) and centrifuged at 2000 × g to remove cellular debris. The supernatant fraction was used as a source of protein (28.5 μg/μl) in glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. The remaining whole tissue homogenate was fractionated by centrifugation/ultracentrifugation to obtain nuclear (2000 ×g), mitochondrial (10,000 × g), microsomal (165,000 × g), and postmicrosomal supernatant fractions for Western analysis. Detergent lysates (1% Nonidet P-40) of the nuclear fraction were also prepared as a source of protein (22.5 μg/μl) in GST pull-down assays. The protein concentrations for all fractions were determined according to Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The RING motif was amplified from 50 ng of a 1030-bp partial RUSH cDNA clone (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar), as described above with a forward primer (5′-GCG↓GATC↑CG AAG AAT GTG CT-3′) that had a unique Bam HI site (bold) and a reverse primer (5′-GCG↓AATT↑CC ATG TAT ATC ATT-3′) that had a unique Eco RI site (bold). To accommodate the low melting temperature of this primer pair, a four-step touch-up PCR reaction was performed with a hot start. The conditions were as follows: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 35 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 40 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 45 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 50 °C for 120 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. A single 161-bp PCR product was cloned into pCRTMII, excised with appropriate restriction enzymes, and directionally subcloned into the Bam HI-Eco RI sites of the pGEX-2TK vector. Insert orientation was confirmed by sequencing in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. BLR(DE3)pLysS host cells were transformed with either the pGEX-2TK control or the pGEX-2TK-RING recombinant. Individual cultures were grown to an A 260 of 0.6, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h of additional growth, bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. Bacteria were resuspended in 1/10th volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), antipain (2 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm)). Bacteria were lysed on ice with mild sonication and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were discarded, and supernatants (1 ml/each) were incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (50% slurry in lysis buffer with 0.5% powdered milk) for 90 min at 4 °C. GST and GST-RING were mixed with detergent lysates containing RFBP at 4 °C for 90 min. Binding complexes were washed 3× lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 12.5% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes from Western (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar) and GST pull-down assays were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 2% powdered milk. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing affinity-purified anti-RFBP antibodies (1:50,000). Membranes were washed 3 × 30 min in TBST and incubated in TBST with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000) for 90 min at room temperature. Membranes were subsequently washed 3 × 30 min in TBST. Specific signals were detected by chemiluminescence using Renaissance reagents. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, aliquots of whole tissue homogenates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-RFBP then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose. Proteins were fractionated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were processed exactly as for Western analysis except they were incubated with affinity-purified anti-RUSH-2 antibodies (1:100) as described (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei from endometrium of progesterone-treated rabbits were isolated ± 0.1% Triton X-100 on sucrose cushions containing protease inhibitors (24Kleis-SanFrancisco S. Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (4%) and fixed for 30 min. Nuclei were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in LR white resin (50 °C). Thin sections (600–800 Å) were mounted on nickel grids, blocked with 5% normal goat serum, and incubated in antipeptide antibody (1:100 with 5% normal goat serum) overnight at 4 °C. Grids were rinsed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 6- or 15-nm gold (1:25 with 5% normal goat serum) for 2 h at 37 °C. Grids were fixed with phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde (3%) for 5 min, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed with a Hitachi 600 electron microscope operated at 75 kV. All studies were conducted in accord with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Adult New Zealand White rabbits (6 months of age) were housed for 3 weeks before experimentation. Seventeen estrous animals were divided into two groups. For group one, endometrium from six animals was pooled, and RNA was isolated using a cold precipitation method (25Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For group two, the rabbits were used in three experimental subgroups (n = 3 animals/subgroup; 5 animals in the progesterone treatment category). Animals were injected every 24 h with hormones and killed 24 h after the last injection. Treatments (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kleis-SanFrancisco S. Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chilton B.S. Mani S.K. Bullock D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) included subcutaneous injections of progesterone (3 mg/kg/day for 5 days), prolactin (2 mg/day for 5 days), or prolactin (5 days) followed by progesterone (5 days). For group 2 animals, total RNA was isolated from individual endometrial samples in Tri-Reagent according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem."

Because oligomerization of some CAMs regulates cell adhesion and signal transduction, the correlation between GA733 oligomeric state and cell-cell adhesion was investigated. Sedimentation equilibrium studies showed that full-length (-FL) GA733 exists as dimers and tetramers in solution, whereas the GA733 extracellular domain (-EC) is a monomer. The K d of GA733-FL is less than 10 nmfor the monomer-dimer association, whereas the dimer-tetramer association is about 1000-fold weaker (K d ∼10 μm). Chemical cross-linking of purified GA733-FL in solution resulted in a major product corresponding to GA733 dimers, and minor amounts of trimers and tetramers. However, GA733-EC cross-linked under the same conditions was consistently a monomer. Chemical cross-linking of dissociated colon carcinoma cells produced predominantly GA733 dimers, whereas cross-linking of cells in monolayers yielded some tetramers as well. GA733-FL retained its cell-cell adhesion function as shown by inhibition of cell aggregation, whereas monomeric GA733-EC was inactive. These data show that GA733 exists predominantly as high affinity noncovalentcis-dimers in solution and on dissociated colon carcinoma cells. The lower affinity association of dimers to form tetramers is most likely the head-to-head interaction between GA733cis-dimers on opposing cells that represents its cell-cell adhesion activity.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and GA733 mAb (2Herlyn D. Herlyn M. Ross A.H. Ernst C. Atkinson B. Koprowski H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 73: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown to function as a Ca2+-independent homotypic cell adhesion molecule (CAM) (3Litvinov S.V. Velders M.P. Bakker H.A. Fleuren G.J. Warnaar S.O. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, it appears to belong to a novel class of CAMs distinct, by its structural features, from the four known superfamilies of CAMs (immunoglobulin-type, selectins, cadherins, and integrins) (for review see Refs. 4Chothia C. Jones E.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 823-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar and 5Litvinov S.V. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechn. 1995; 7: 375-384Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The sequence of GA733-2 indicates no significant homology with other known proteins except with GA733-1 (Trop-2), previously cloned by Linnenbach et al. (6Linnenbach A.J. Wojcierowski J. Wu S. Pyrc J.J. Ross A.H. Dietzschold B. Speicher D. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of GA733-2 and GA733-1 are ∼50% identical. GA733-2 (referred to hereafter as GA733) is synthesized as a 32.8-kDa nonglycosylated precursor, but migrates in SDS-PAGE gels as a 40-kDa band. The extracellular portion of GA733 contains three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites and consists of a cysteine-rich N-terminal region followed by a cysteine-poor region. GA733 has a short transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail of 26 amino acids with potential sites of phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine residues. GA733 is present in most epithelial cells and is overexpressed in the vast majority of gastrointestinal tumors (7Ross A.H. Herlyn D. Ilioupoulos D. Koprowski H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Gottlinger H.G. Funke I. Johnson J.P. Gokel J.M. Riethmüller G. Int. J.

Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, emerging evidence correlates the increase of GA733 expression with other types of cancer lesions, notably in cervical squamous epithelia (11Litvinov S.V. Van Driel W. Van Rhijn C.M. Bakker H.A.M. Van Krieken H. Fleuren G.J. Warnaar S.O. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 865-875PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of cell proliferation in cervical squamous epithelia, which are normally GA733-negative, correlates with the expression of GA733. An increase of the number of positive cells as well as in levels of GA733 protein was observed during progression of cervical lesions from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I to grade III (11Litvinov S.V. Van Driel W. Van Rhijn C.M. Bakker H.A.M. Van Krieken H. Fleuren G.J. Warnaar S.O. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 865-875PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of increased GA733 expression in cancer lesions remains mysterious. Surprisingly, a recent study from our group showed that GA733 inhibits invasion of tumor cells in vitro when transfected into CT-26 mouse colon carcinoma cells (12Basak S. Speicher D. Eck S. Wunner W. Maul G. Simmons M.S. Herlyn D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the same study, the mouse homologue of GA733, mEGP (a homotypic CAM with 82% amino acid sequence identity with GA733) expressed by transfected mouse CT-26 cells (that are mEGP-negative) significantly decreases cell growth in vitro and inhibits metastasis in vivo. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for these two phenomena remain unclear, the strong intercellular adhesion profile of CT-26-mEGP cells (clumping and clustering observed in vitro) may inhibit cell dispersion and limit their migration capacity (12Basak S. Speicher D. Eck S. Wunner W. Maul G. Simmons M.S. Herlyn D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The same mechanism was proposed to explain decreased metastases in nude mice by human breast carcinoma cells overproducing another homotypic adhesion molecule, E-cadherin (13Mbalaviele G. Dunstan C.R. Sasaki A. Williams P.J. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4063-4070PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the decrease of cell growth may be due to the activation of certain mEGP-associated signal transduction pathways that down-regulate cell proliferation, when activated by increased homotypic engagement of mEGP. Although very little is known about the biochemical properties of GA733 and its murine homologue, mEGP, other than their role as homotypic CAMs, it is likely that they participate in “inside-out” and “outside-in” cell signaling pathways controlling cell growth and adhesion. This hypothesis is supported by a recent report showing that GA733-1 (Trop-2) is a calcium signal transducer (14Ripani E. Sacchetti A. Corda D. Alberti S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Several clinical trials targeting GA733 by anti-idiotypic antibodies and recombinant protein vaccines have shown induction of humoral and cellular immunity in colorectal cancer patients (15Herlyn D. Wettendorff M. Schmoll E. Ilioupoulos D. Schedel I. Dreikhausen U. Raab R. Ross A.H. Jaksche H. Scribe M. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(2000)Int. J. Cancer, in pressGoogle Scholar). More importantly, CO17-1A mAb against GA733 enhances survival of patients with colon carcinoma in a phase II randomized control study (21Riethmüller G. Schneider-Gädicke E. Schlimok G. Schmiegel W. Raab R. Höffken K. Gruber R. Pichlmaier H. Hirche H. Pichlmaier R. Buggisch P. Witte J.

Furthermore, a recombinant adenovirus expressing GA733 significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing established CT-26-GA733 tumors (23Li W. Berencsi K. Basak S. Somasundaram R. Ricciardi R.P. Gonczol E. Zaloudik J. Linnenbach A. Maruyama H. Miniou P. Herlyn D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 763-769PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of GA733 on cancer cell growth and invasion, its increased expression in human cancer lesions, and the beneficial treatment with mAbs against GA733 in experimental animals and patients appear to be paradoxical. Clearly, further characterization of the biochemical and functional properties of this protein and its role in tumor progression is needed. Recent studies have suggested that, in addition to mediating homotypic associations between opposing cell membranes, cisinteractions between some types of receptors on the same cell surface can play an important role in regulating cell adhesion, signal transduction, and migration (24Porter J.C. Hogg N. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 390-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that C-CAM (25Hunter I. Sawa H. Edlund M. Orrink B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), PECAM-1 (26Newton J.P. Hunter A.P. Simmons D.L. Buckely C.D. Harvey D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and ICAM-1 (27Reilly P.L. Woska J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J.

Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) exist ascis-dimers in the cell membrane. Furthermore, dimeric forms of recombinant soluble ICAM-1 have significantly higher affinities for its purified ligand, LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), whereas the monomeric form shows no binding (27Reilly P.L. Woska J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar, 28Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), illustrating the central role CAM oligomerization can play in cell-cell adhesion. The molecular organization of GA733 within normal epithelia and colon carcinoma cells remains unknown, despite its use with some success as a target for passive and active immunotherapy of colon cancer in human clinical trials (15Herlyn D.

Elucidating thecis-oligomerization of GA733 on the cell membrane and the mechanism of GA733-mediated cell adhesion should contribute to a better understanding of GA733 function and may lead to substantial improvements of GA733 targeting in immunotherapy of colon cancer. In this study, we investigated the oligomeric state of membrane-associated and soluble forms of GA733 and their ability to block cell-cell adhesion. We show that GA733-FL, which inhibits cell aggregation, self-associates to form high affinitycis-dimers in solution and in intact colon carcinoma cell membranes, whereas the soluble recombinant extracellular domain (GA733-EC) is a monomer and does not inhibit cell aggregation. Chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The membrane-impermeable bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) and membrane-permeable disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) cross-linkers were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). GA733 mAb, which recognizes the extracellular segment of GA733 (2Herlyn D. Herlyn M. Ross A.H. Ernst C. Atkinson B. Koprowski H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 73: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was produced and affinity-purified using a protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (29Trebak M. Chong J.M. Herlyn D. Speicher D.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 230: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GA733 polyclonal antibody (GA733 pAb) was obtained from rabbits immunized with GA733-EC and purified on a Protein A-Sepharose column. Recombinant GA733-FL and GA733-EC were produced in insect cells using the baculovirus system as described previously (30Strassburg C.P. Kasai Y. Seng B.A. Miniou P. Zaloudik J. Herlyn D. Koprowski H. Linnenbach A.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 815-821PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zaloudik J. Basak S. Nesbit M. Speicher D.W. Wunner W.H. Miller E. Ernst-Grotkowski C. Kennedy R. Bergsagel L.P. Koido T. Herlyn D. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GA733-FL was essentially produced as described for GA733-EC (31Zaloudik J. Basak S. Nesbit M. Speicher D.W. Wunner W.H. Miller E. Ernst-Grotkowski C. Kennedy R. Bergsagel L.P. Koido T. Herlyn D. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), except that a full-length GA733 cDNA was used (32Szala S. Froehlich M. Scollon M. Kasai Y. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Linnenbach A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3542-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). All purification steps were performed at 0–4 °C. For recombinant GA733-FL, typically 500 ml of baculovirus-transfected Sf9 insect cells (∼12 × 108 cells) were harvested by centrifugation at 48-h post-infection, and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 μl/106 cells) containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% Triton X-100, 40 mm sodium chloride, 0.15 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 mm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4. The lysate was sonicated, centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and loaded onto a column containing 30 mg of affinity-purified GA733 mAb coupled to Sepharose CL-4B by CNBr activation. The column was washed with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm PMSF, 2 mm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin, washed with the same buffer without detergent and bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The pH of the peak fractions was immediately neutralized, followed by dialysis against PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.15 mm PMSF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide. The quality of purifications was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the GA733 mAb. During the purification process, some covalent cross-linking of GA733 occurs presumably due to the activity of insect cell transglutaminases, enzymes that catalyze the formation of γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine bonds. Oligomers of GA733 (up to tetramers, but primarily dimers) could be detected by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels and on Western blots. Maintaining 100 mm Tris, with 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm EGTA throughout the washes, substantially minimized this artifactual cross-linking and was used in most purifications. Alternatively, we were able to completely eliminate this artifactual cross-linking by using 0.5% Triton X-100 in the wash and elution buffers. However, such preparations were used only for chemical cross-linking experiments, because Triton X-100 could not be efficiently removed by dialysis and attempts to use ion-exchange chromatography to remove the detergent were unsuccessful, making these preparations unsuitable for either cell aggregation assays or analytical ultracentrifugation studies. The secreted GA733-EC was purified from the culture supernatant of baculovirus-infected Hi Five insect cells using a GA733 mAb-Sepharose affinity column. The column was washed with PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5, purchased from Pierce. Protein samples were concentrated using Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). GA733-EC was concentrated in PBS, whereas GA733-FL was concentrated in PBS containing either 0.5 mm octyloxyethylene dodecyl ether (C12E8) or 10 mm pentaoxyethylene octyl ether (C8E5) (Sigma). GA733-FL protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). The concentration of GA733-EC was determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm in a 1-cm path length using an extinction coefficient of 0.926 (mg/ml)−1 calculated from the GA733-EC sequence according to Pace et al. (33Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). For analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, recombinant proteins were further purified by HPLC gel filtration to remove trace contaminants and aggregates. GA733-EC was concentrated as described previously, injected into two TSK columns, G3000SWXL and G2000SWXL (Toso-Haas, Japan), connected in series, and separated at 0.8 ml/min using PBS. GA733-FL was concentrated in PBS containing 0.5 mmC12E8 and chromatographed on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.5 ml/min using PBS containing 0.15 mm PMSF and 0.5 mmC12E8. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was carried out on a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Recombinant protein solutions (2 μl) were mixed 1:1 with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 33% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and allowed to air dry on the sample target before analysis. Several 2-fold serial dilutions of the protein samples were tested, and protein A was used as an external and internal standard. Experiments were performed in an Optima XL-I analytical centrifuge. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed with three initial concentrations of the protein sample. Absorbance or fringe displacement data was collected every 4–6 h until equilibrium was reached, as determined by comparison of successive scans using the MATCH program. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using either the interference optics (for GA733-EC) or the absorbance optics (for GA733-FL) to measure the protein concentration gradient. For experiments with GA733-EC, three cells were assembled with double-sector 12-mm centerpieces and sapphire windows. The cells were loaded with 110 μl of HPLC gel filtration buffer as the reference, and 110 μl of sample at concentrations of 2.0, 1.0, or 0.5 mg/ml. A blank scan of distilled water was taken before the run, to correct for the effects of window distortion on the fringe displacement data (34Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 4 °C or 30 °C, at 23,000–30,000 rpm. Fringe displacement data was collected every 4–6 h until equilibrium was reached. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments on GA733-FL were performed in the presence of either C8E5 or C12E8 nonionic detergents. For experiments using C8E5, affinity-purified GA733-FL was concentrated in PBS containing 0.15 mm PMSF and 10 mm C8E5 and dialyzed against the same buffer for 24 h at 4 °C. For experiments in the presence of C12E8, GA733-FL was chromatographed using HPLC gel filtration as described above. Fractions containing purified GA733-FL were then concentrated to 0.1–0.4 mg/ml and dialyzed for at least 24 h at 4 °C against PBS containing 0.15 mmPMSF and 0.5 mm C12E8 in 22% D2O (v/v). In the presence of detergent, the protein is part of a protein-detergent complex that has a buoyant molecular mass,M c(1 − φ′ρ), containing contributions from the protein and the bound detergent (35Casassa E.F. Eisenberg H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 287-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 36Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4467-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar),Mc(1−φ′ρ)=MP(1−ῡPρ)+δDet(1−ῡDetρ)Equation 1 where M P is the molecular weight of the protein, ῡP and ῡDet are the partial specific volumes of the protein and detergent respectively, δDet is the number of grams of detergent bound per gram of protein, and ρ is the density of the solvent. Because the partial specific volume of C12E8 is known (0.973 cm3/g (37Steele J.C.H. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)), the density of the solvent can be adjusted to 1/ῡDet with D2O. In this case the second term of the equation equals zero, effectively removing the contribution of the bound detergent. The density of the dialysis buffer described above was calculated to be 1.0278 g/cm3 at 20 °C using the SEDNTERP program. For experiments on GA733-FL, three cells were assembled with double-sector 12-mm centerpieces and quartz windows, and loaded with 110 μl of dialysis buffer as the reference, and 110 μl of sample at three protein concentrations (typically 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 mg/ml). Experiments were performed at 4 or 20 °C at speeds between 14,000 and 23,000 rpm. Absorbance data at 280 or 230 nm was collected every 4–6 h until equilibrium was reached. For each scan, data were acquired every 0.001 cm with up to nine replicates in continuous scan mode. For all experiments, attainment of sedimentation equilibrium was determined by comparison of successive scans using the MATCH v.7 program, and the data were edited using the REEDIT v.9 program (both programs kindly provided by David Yphantis). Nonlinear regression fitting of the sedimentation equilibrium data with various models was performed using the NONLIN program (38Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The reduced molecular weight, ς of a protein is defined as: ς = M(1 −ῡρ)ω2/RT, where M and ῡ are the molecular weight and the partial specific volume of the protein, respectively, R is the gas contant T is temperature in Kelvin, and ρ the density of the solvent (34Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). The program SEDNTERP was used to calculate ῡ of GA733-EC and GA733-FL, using the known amino acid sequence of the proteins and an estimate of the amount of carbohydrate determined from MALDI mass analysis, which was treated as mannose groups for calculation purposes of ῡ. At least three data sets from different loading concentrations and/or rotor speeds were fitted simultaneously. Goodness of fit was determined by examination of the residuals and minimization of the variance. The association constants returned by NONLIN from self-association models were converted to the molar scale using the calculated molar extinction coefficient of the protein. The colon carcinoma cell lines Caco-2 (clone C2BBe1) and Colo-205 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.01 mg/ml human transferrin, and 10% of fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Colo-205 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC) adjusted to contain 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1.5 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. All media were antibiotic/antimycotic free. Cells at 80–90% confluence were subcultured every 7 days. Caco-2 cells were dissociated with 0.2 g/liter EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.01% trypsin, whereas Colo-205 cells were dissociated with EDTA only. Prior to cross-linking, the cells were washed twice with PBS. Adherent or detached Caco-2 and Colo-205 cells were overlaid with PBS, and cross-linking was initiated by the addition of either DSG or BS3 at different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm). After 5 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched for 15 min with Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, at a final concentration of 50 mm. Cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 g/liter deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 40 mm sodium chloride, 0.15 mm PMSF, 2 mm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4. Cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g, the pellets were discarded, and the supernatants were saved for immunoprecipitations, SDS-PAGE, and Western blots. For purified proteins, cross-linking was performed using 16 μg of GA733-FL or GA733-EC in 100 μl of PBS containing different detergents (i.e. 0.1% or 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmC12E8, 10 mmC8E5, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% CHAPS, 1%n-octyl glucoside) with 0.1 mm BS3or DSG for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, for 15 min, samples were frozen on dry ice, lyophilized, and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were visualized using Coomassie Blue R-250. GA733 was immunoprecipitated from supernatants of cell lysates using GA733 mAb-Sepharose. The supernatants were first precleared for 1 h with a bovine serum albumin-Sepharose resin, and proteins we"

Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 523: 339-351Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Exchange activity is regulated by Ca2+-dependent and Na+-dependent processes; cytosolic Ca2+ activates exchange activity by binding to high affinity regulatory sites located within a large (546 residues) hydrophilic domain situated between the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments of the exchanger (4Nicoll D.A.

Cytosolic Na+ is thought to induce the time-dependent formation of an inactive state (Na+-dependent inactivation) after it binds to the Na+ translocation sites on the exchanger (6Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Na+-dependent inactivation can be antagonized by ATP-dependent synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, by elevated concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+ and by certain mutations within the “regulatory” hydrophilic domain of the exchanger (6Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen.

(1998) Internet Association for Biomedical Sciences 98: 5th Internet World Congress on Biomedical Sciences at McMaster Unversity.Google Scholar). In intact cells, the K d for Ca2+-dependent activation of the exchanger is ∼50 nm (11Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C50-C55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noda M. Shepherd R.N. Gadsby D.C. Biophys. J. 1988; 53 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar, 13Miura Y. Kimura J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 1129-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), suggesting that the exchanger may be nearly fully activated under “resting” conditions. The low cytosolic Na+ concentration and the high levels of ATP and phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate in healthy cells preclude a major role for Na+-dependent inactivation in regulating exchange activity under physiological conditions. Indeed, there is no direct evidence that Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity is in fact regulated in functioning cardiac myocytes. The present report addresses the possibility that sphingolipids such as ceramide and sphingosine serve as physiological regulators of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity.Ceramide is a central component of the sphingomyelin cycle, a stress-activated signaling pathway that participates in the induction of apoptosis and growth arrest. The activating or inhibiting effects of ceramide on a host of intracellular signaling pathways have been described in several recent reviews (14Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 16Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ceramide can also be converted to sphingosine and sphingosine phosphate, two other signaling lipids with important regulatory effects of their own.Here we show that short chain ceramide analogs and sphingosine inhibit Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1cells expressing the bovine or canine cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Similar effects were noted when the cells were treated for 60 min with an inhibitor of endogenous ceramide metabolism. The differential effects of ceramide on exchanger mutants defective in Na+- or Ca2+-dependent regulation suggest that ceramide blocks the conformational transitions associated with Ca2+-dependent activation of exchange activity. We propose that in functioning cardiac myocytes, sphingolipids and diastolic Ca2+ levels interact to control the distribution of exchangers between the Ca2+-activated and nonactivated forms.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrate that short chain ceramide analogs inhibited both the Ca2+ influx and Ca2+efflux modes of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). A biologically inactive ceramide analog, in which the essential double bond in the sphingosine moiety is hydrogenated, had only minor effects on exchange activity (Fig. 2). Moreover, certain mutant exchangers that are defective in their regulatory behavior were not inhibited by ceramide (Figs. 4 and 5). These data suggest that the effects of ceramide are not simply due to a generalized membrane perturbation but that ceramide acts in a biologically relevant manner and specifically targets the mechanisms that regulate exchange activity. Recent results indicate that 15 μm C2-ceramide also inhibits Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents in cardiac myocytes but does not inhibit either Na+ or Ca2+ channel activity. 2N. Shepherd, personal communication.Ceramide is a central component of the sphingomyelin signaling pathway and plays a critical role in the activation of the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis (14Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev.

In cardiac myocytes, ceramide and sphingosine levels increase following ischemia/reperfusion (36Hernandez O.M. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 37Bielawska A.E. Shapiro J.P. Jiang L. Melkonyan H.S. Piot C. Wolfe C.L. Tomei L.D. Hannun Y.A. Umansky S.R. Am. J.

Ceramide induces a multitude of cellular responses, including induction of the stress-activated protein kinase pathway, activation or inhibition of various individual protein kinases, activation of protein phosphatase 2A, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, activation of cytochromec release from mitochondria, and inhibition of phospholipase D (reviewed in Refs. 14Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, ceramide can be rapidly converted to ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, signaling lipids that have multiple effects of their own. The rapid time course of sphingolipid-induced inhibition of exchange activity in the present study suggests that these agents exert their effects directly on the exchanger rather than through one of the above signal transduction pathways. This conclusion is strongly supported by the recent finding that both sphingosine and C2-ceramide inhibit exchange activity when applied to excised patches from cardiac myocytes. 3D. Hilgemann, personal communication.Short chain ceramide analogs sometimes induce effects that are not mimicked by increases in endogenous ceramide (reviewed in Ref. 39Ghidoni R. Sala G. Giuliani A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 17-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the short chain analogs may themselves bring about alterations in endogenous ceramide and/or sphingosine levels (35Lepple-Wienhues A. Belka C. Laun T. Jekle A. Walter B. Wieland U. Welz M.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we preincubated the cells for 60 min with PPMP, an agent that blocks conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide and has been used to elevate endogenous ceramide levels in several different cell types (30Negishi T. Chik C.L. Ho A.K. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5691-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31de Chaves E.I.P. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1998; 359: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, treatment with PPMP mimicked the effects of the short chain ceramide analogs on Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. We conclude that exchange activity is inhibited by increased endogenous ceramide and/or sphingosine as well as by the exogenous analogs.Ceramide and sphingosine did not inhibit exchange activity in certain regulatory-deficient mutants, and we therefore conclude that the sphingolipids target one of the mechanisms that regulate exchange activity. The best characterized regulatory mechanisms involve two time-dependent processes that promote inactive states of the exchanger (6Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The first process is called “Na+-dependent inactivation” and is observed in excised patches as an exponential decay of current to a steady-state value following application of cytosolic Na+. Na+-dependent inactivation is counteracted by the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (42Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), by high concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+ (6Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and by mutations involving key basic residues or tyrosines in the XIP region (24Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Pan Y. Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Nakamura T.Y. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C393-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second regulatory process involves the interaction of Ca2+ with high affinity regulatory sites within the central hydrophilic domain of the exchanger (7Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 44Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); the binding of Ca2+ to these regulatory sites appears to be required for all modes of exchanger operation (1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 9Reeves J.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Na+-dependent inactivation does not appear to be involved in the effects of sphingolipids, because the XIPA mutant was as sensitive to inhibition by ceramide as the wild type (Fig.4 B); this mutant does not display Na+-dependent inactivation because of the alteration of critical basic residues in the XIP region. Moreover, ceramide inhibited wild-type exchange activity equally well at high (95 mm) and low (9 mm) Na+concentrations (data not shown). Because Na+-dependent inactivation requires high concentrations of cytosolic Na+ (6Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), these results provide another indication that ceramide does not promote this inactivation process.The findings with the various exchanger mutants and the effects of alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis suggest that sphingolipids interfere with the regulatory activation of the exchanger by Ca2+. C2-ceramide did not inhibit the activities of the deletion mutants Δ(680–685) and Δ(241–680) (Figs. 4 and 5), which are defective in both Ca2+-dependent activation and Na+-dependent inactivation. As mentioned above, C2-ceramide did inhibit the activity of the XIPA mutant (Fig.4 B), in which regulatory Ca2+ activation is intact, but Na+-dependent inactivation does not occur (24Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 45Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): 253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, ceramide inhibited the activity of exchangers that display Ca2+-dependent activation but not in exchanger mutants in which this regulatory mechanism was defective.Experimental conditions that altered Ca2+ homeostatic processes also affected the response of exchange activity to ceramide. For example, the effects of ceramide developed slowly in cells with filled Ca2+ stores, as shown by the time-dependent decline in the rate of Ba2+influx in the presence of C2-ceramide (Fig. 1 A). When internal Ca2+ stores were depleted by prior treatment of the cells with thapsigargin or ionomycin, the development of the inhibition of ceramide was accelerated, and the traces for Ba2+ influx no longer displayed a downward curvature (Figs.2 and 6 A). The results suggest that there is a link between the filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores and the susceptibility of the exchanger to ceramide inhibition. The basis for this observation is not known; perhaps filled Ca2+ stores generate local gradients of elevated [Ca2+]i in the vicinity of the exchanger, and this antagonizes ceramide inhibition. For PPMP-treated cells, inhibition of exchange activity in the absence of thapsigargin was immediate (Table I) and did not increase with time following Ba2+ addition (data not shown). This observation is entirely consistent with the observations described above, because internal Ca2+ stores in the PPMP-treated cells were already depleted, presumably because of an inhibition of Ca2+ influx (see discussion under “Results”).In several experiments, control cells showed a time-dependent increase in the rate of Ba2+influx, as shown by the upward curvature of the traces (Figs.4 B, 6 A, 7 A, and 8, A andC, trace b. Cont). This behavior was not seen with the Δ(241–680) mutant (Figs. 4 B, 7 B, and8 B), but it was observed with the XIPA mutant (Fig.4 B). We have previously suggested that the acceleration in Ba2+ influx is due to the auto-activation of the exchanger by cytosolic Ba2+ through its interaction with the Ca2+ regulatory sites (11Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C50-C55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of ceramide or sphingosine or in PPMP-treated cells, the corresponding traces for Ba2+ influx remained linear throughout the entire time course, indicating that the sphingolipids blocked this process.These considerations suggest that ceramide/sphingosine impairs the regulatory activation of exchange activity by Ca2+. Its precise mechanism of action is not known, however. It does not seem likely that these hydrophobic lipids would interact directly with high affinity Ca2+ regulatory sites, because these are located in the hydrophilic domain of the exchanger. A more plausible possibility is that they interact with the transmembrane segments of the exchanger and stabilize the inactive conformation that is attained upon dissociation of Ca2+ from its regulatory binding sites (Fig. 9). In this way, the sphingolipids might increase the K d for Ca2+activation, slow the conformational transitions involved, or block Ca2+ activation of the exchanger altogether in a subpopulation of exchangers. In any event, it is clear that ceramide does not completely block Ca2+ activation, because exchange activity was stimulated by increasing [Ca2+]i in the ionomycin experiments, both in the presence of C2-ceramide (Fig.6 C) and in the PPMP-treated cells (Fig. 8 D and Table I).In the experiments with ionomycin-treated cells (Figs. 6 and8 C), we sought to determine whether an increase in [Ca2+]i would antagonize the inhibitory effects of ceramide or PPMP treatment, as expected if a competitive effect were involved. In both cases, however, the degree of inhibition was similar at high and low [Ca2+]i. The highest value of [Ca2+]i attained in these experiments was only ∼110 nm, however, and it will be important to re-examine this issue in an experimental system (e.g. excised patches) that permits a broader range of [Ca2+]i values to be studied. These experiments also showed that for the ceramide- or PPMP-treated cells at the elevated [Ca2+]i, the rate of Ba2+ influx declined gradually following Ba2+ addition and eventually became equal to that seen at the lower [Ca2+]i (Figs. 6 B and8 C). This behavior probably reflects the gradual reduction in regulatory activation of exchange activity because the initially high level of [Ca2+]i declined following Ba2+ addition. In the corresponding experiments with control cells, the rate of Ba2+ influx did not decline in this manner, consistent with our hypothesis that the ability of Ca2+ and/or Ba2+ to activate exchange activity is impaired by the sphingolipids.What are the physiological implications of our results? Ceramide and sphingosine are elevated in cardiac myocytes during stress. The resulting inhibition of exchange activity could be viewed as a protective measure to preserve Ca2+ stores and maintain contractile strength under stressful conditions. Alternatively, when cytosolic [Na+] is elevated, as in ischemia, inhibition of exchange activity could be a means of protecting the cell against Ca2+ overload by reducing exchange-mediated Ca2+ influx. A more interesting possibility, however, is that under nonpathological conditions endogenous sphingolipids and the exchanger work coordinately as a Ca2+-dependent feedback mechanism to control the distribution of exchangers between active and inactive states, in the manner described below.The high affinity of the exchanger for regulatory Ca2+(K d ∼50 nm) (11Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C50-C55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noda M. Shepherd R.N. Gadsby D.C. Biophys. J. 1988; 53 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar, 13Miura Y. Kimura J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 1129-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) would seem to provide no opportunity for meaningful regulation of exchange activity within a physiological range of [Ca2+]i values. In a functioning cardiac myocyte, the small fraction of exchangers that become inactive because of dissociation of regulatory Ca2+during diastole ([Ca2+]i ∼100 nm) would be rapidly reactivated by the ensuing rise in [Ca2+]i during the next systole. However, if endogenous ceramide/sphingosine were to interfere with Ca2+-dependent activation of the exchanger by any of the mechanisms suggested above (Fig. 9), a fraction of the inactive exchangers would be retained in the inactive state (I 2 in Fig. 9) despite the rise in [Ca2+]i. Over multiple contraction/relaxation cycles, the distribution of exchangers between active and inactive states would be determined by two principal factors: diastolic [Ca2+]i and endogenous levels of ceramide/sphingosine. A fall in diastolic [Ca2+]iwould increase the population of inactive exchangers, thereby reducing exchange-mediated Ca2+ efflux and eventually restoring diastolic [Ca2+]i to its normal level. An increase in endogenous ceramide or sphingosine, e.g. during stress, would have the same effect and establish a new steady-state relation between diastolic [Ca2+]i and exchange activity.This hypothesis, although speculative, provides a welcome framework for understanding the physiological role of Ca2+-dependent activation of exchange activity in light of the high affinity of the exchanger for regulatory Ca2+ (11Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C50-C55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noda M. Shepherd R.N. Gadsby D.C. Biophys. J. 1988; 53 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar, 13Miura Y. Kimura J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 1129-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In considering the physiological role of sphingolipid-exchanger interactions, it will be essential to define more precisely its effects on Ca2+-dependent activation and the influence of internal Ca2+ stores on this process. Work toward this end is currently in progress. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is the principal Ca2+ efflux mechanism in cardiac myocytes and plays a critical role in regulating the force of cardiac muscle contraction (1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Its stoichiometry is thought to be 3 Na+/Ca2+ (2Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a recent report suggests that it may have a higher, or variable, stoichiometry (3Fujioka Y. Komeda M. Matsuoka S. J.

Exchange activity is regulated by Ca2+-dependent and Na+-dependent processes; cytosolic Ca2+ activates exchange activity by binding to high affinity regulatory sites located within a large (546 residues) hydrophilic domain situated between the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments of the exchanger (4Nicoll D.A.

Cytosolic Na+ is thought to induce the time-dependent formation of an inactive state (Na+-dependent inactivation) after it binds to the Na+ translocation sites on the exchanger (6Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Na+-dependent inactivation can be antagonized by ATP-dependent synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, by elevated concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+ and by certain mutations within the “regulatory” hydrophilic domain of the exchanger (6Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen.

The physiological significance of these regulatory mechanisms is uncertain (9Reeves J.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Reeves, J. P., Condrescu, M., and Fang, Y. (1998) Internet Association for Biomedical Sciences 98: 5th Internet World Congress on Biomedical Sciences at McMaster Unversity.Google Scholar). In intact cells, the K d for Ca2+-dependent activation of the exchanger is ∼50 nm (11Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C50-C55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noda M. Shepherd R.N. Gadsby D.C. Biophys. J. 1988; 53 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar, 13Miura Y. Kimura J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 1129-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), suggesting that the exchanger may be nearly fully activated under “resting” conditions. The low cytosolic Na+ concentration and the high levels of ATP and phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate in healthy cells preclude a major role for Na+-dependent inactivation in regulating exchange activity under physiological conditions. Indeed, there is no direct evidence that Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity is in fact regulated in functioning cardiac myocytes. The present report addresses the possibility that sphingolipids such as ceramide and sphingosine serve as physiological regulators of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. Ceramide is a central component of the sphingomyelin cycle, a stress-activated signaling pathway that participates in the induction of apoptosis and growth arrest. The activating or inhibiting effects of ceramide on a host of intracellular signaling pathways have been described in several recent reviews (14Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 16Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ceramide can also be converted to sphingosine and sphingosine phosphate, two other signaling lipids with important regulatory effects of their own. Here we show that short chain ceramide analogs and sphingosine inhibit Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1cells expressing the bovine or canine cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Similar effects were noted when the cells were treated for 60 min with an inhibitor of endogenous cera"
