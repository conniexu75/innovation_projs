https://openalex.org/W2587584940,"Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa) is a highly nutritious grain identified as an important crop to improve world food security. Unfortunately, few resources are available to facilitate its genetic improvement. Here we report the assembly of a high-quality, chromosome-scale reference genome sequence for quinoa, which was produced using single-molecule real-time sequencing in combination with optical, chromosome-contact and genetic maps. We also report the sequencing of two diploids from the ancestral gene pools of quinoa, which enables the identification of sub-genomes in quinoa, and reduced-coverage genome sequences for 22 other samples of the allotetraploid goosefoot complex. The genome sequence facilitated the identification of the transcription factor likely to control the production of anti-nutritional triterpenoid saponins found in quinoa seeds, including a mutation that appears to cause alternative splicing and a premature stop codon in sweet quinoa strains. These genomic resources are an important first step towards the genetic improvement of quinoa."

https://openalex.org/W2586537166,"Malignant neoplasms evolve in response to changes in oncogenic signalling. Cancer cell plasticity in response to evolutionary pressures is fundamental to tumour progression and the development of therapeutic resistance. Here we determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cancer cell plasticity in a conditional oncogenic Kras mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy that displays considerable phenotypic diversity and morphological heterogeneity. In this model, stochastic extinction of oncogenic Kras signalling and emergence of Kras-independent escaper populations (cells that acquire oncogenic properties) are associated with de-differentiation and aggressive biological behaviour. Transcriptomic and functional analyses of Kras-independent escapers reveal the presence of Smarcb1-Myc-network-driven mesenchymal reprogramming and independence from MAPK signalling. A somatic mosaic model of PDAC, which allows time-restricted perturbation of cell fate, shows that depletion of Smarcb1 activates the Myc network, driving an anabolic switch that increases protein metabolism and adaptive activation of endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-induced survival pathways. Increased protein turnover renders mesenchymal sub-populations highly susceptible to pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the cellular proteostatic machinery and the IRE1-α-MKK4 arm of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-response pathway. Specifically, combination regimens that impair the unfolded protein responses block the emergence of aggressive mesenchymal subpopulations in mouse and patient-derived PDAC models. These molecular and biological insights inform a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting aggressive mesenchymal features of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2587248841,"WHO has set a voluntary target of 80% availability of affordable essential medicines, including generics, to treat major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), in the public and private sectors of countries by 2025. We undertook a secondary analysis of data from 30 surveys in low- and middle-income countries, conducted from 2008-2015 using the World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) medicine availability and price survey methodology, to establish a baseline for this target.Data for 49 medicines (lowest priced generics and originator brands) to treat cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and central nervous system (CNS) conditions were analysed to determine their availability in healthcare facilities and pharmacies, their affordability for those on low incomes (based on median patient prices of each medicine), and the percentage of medicines that were both available and affordable. Affordability was expressed as the number of days' wages of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker needed to purchase 30 days' supply using standard treatment regimens. Paying more than 1 days' wages was considered unaffordable.In low-income countries, 15.2% and 18.9% of lowest-priced generics met WHO's target in the public and private sectors, respectively, and 2.6% and 5.2% of originator brands. In lower-middle income countries, 23.8% and 23.2% of lowest priced generics, and 0.8% and 1.4% of originator brands, met the target in the public and private sectors, respectively. In upper-middle income countries, the situation was better for generics but still suboptimal as 36.0% and 39.4% met the target in public and private sectors, respectively. For originator brands in upper-middle income countries, none reached the target in the public sector and 13.7% in the private sector. Across the therapeutic groups for lowest priced generics, CVD medicines in low-income countries (11.9%), and CNS medicines in lower-middle (10.2%) and upper-middle income countries (33.3%), were least available and affordable in the public sector. In the private sector for lowest priced generics, CNS medicines were least available and affordable in all three country income groups (11.4%, 5.8% and 29.3% in low-, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries respectively).This data, which can act as a baseline for the WHO target, shows low availability and/or poor affordability is resulting in few essential NCD medicines meeting the target in low- and middle-income countries. In the era of Sustainable Development Goals, and as countries work to achieve Universal Health Coverage, increased commitments are needed by governments to improve the situation through the development of evidence-informed, nationally-contextualised interventions, with regular monitoring of NCD medicine availability, patient prices and affordability."
https://openalex.org/W2586502205,"The common housefly, Musca domestica, is a considerable component of nutrient recycling in the environment. Use of housefly larvae to biodegrade manure presents an opportunity to reduce waste disposal while the rapidly assimilated insect biomass can also be used as a protein rich animal feed. In this study, we examine the biodegradation of dairy cattle manure using housefly larvae, and the nutritional value of the resulting larva meal as a feed ingredient. Our results demonstrated that dairy cattle manure presents a balanced substrate for larval growth, and the spent manure showed reductions in concentration of total nitrogen (24.9%) and phosphorus (6.2%) with an overall reduction in mass. Larva yield at an optimum density was approximately 2% of manure weight. Nutritional analysis of M. domestica larva meal showed values comparable to most high protein feed ingredients. Larva meal was 60% protein with a well-balanced amino acid profile, and 20% fat with 57% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 39% saturated fatty acids. Larva meal lacked any significant amount of omega-3 fatty acids. Evaluation of micronutrients in larva meal suggested that it is a good source of calcium and phosphorus (0.5% and 1.1% respectively). The nutritional value of larva meal closely matches that of fishmeal, making it a potentially attractive alternative for use as a protein-rich feed ingredient for livestock and aquaculture operations."
https://openalex.org/W2587629324,"Astaxanthin, a carotenoid found mainly in seafood, has potential clinical applications due to its antioxidant activity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of dietary astaxanthin derived from Haematococcus pluvialis on skin photoaging in UVA-irradiated hairless mice by assessing various parameters of photoaging. After chronic ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure, a significant increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and wrinkle formation in the dorsal skin caused by UVA was observed, and dietary astaxanthin significantly suppressed these photoaging features. We found that the mRNA expression of lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor, steroid sulfatase, and aquaporin 3 in the epidermis was significantly increased by UVA irradiation for 70 days, and dietary astaxanthin significantly suppressed these increases in mRNA expression to be comparable to control levels. In the dermis, the mRNA expression of matrix metalloprotease 13 was increased by UVA irradiation and significantly suppressed by dietary astaxanthin. In addition, HPLC-PDA analysis confirmed that dietary astaxanthin reached not only the dermis but also the epidermis. Our results indicate that dietary astaxanthin accumulates in the skin and appears to prevent the effects of UVA irradiation on filaggrin metabolism and desquamation in the epidermis and the extracellular matrix in the dermis."
https://openalex.org/W2586186559,"Hypercholesterolemia is a known contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease while its role in the occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is only conjecture and far from conclusive. Altered antioxidant homeostasis and mitochondrial functions are the key mechanisms in loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) region of the midbrain in PD. Hypercholesterolemia is reported to cause oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the brain in rodents. However, the impact of hypercholesterolemia on the midbrain dopaminergic neurons in animal models of PD remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that hypercholesterolemia in MPTP model of PD would potentiate dopaminergic neuron loss in SN by disrupting mitochondrial functions and antioxidant homeostasis. It is evident from the present study that hypercholesterolemia in naïve animals caused dopamine neuronal loss in SN with subsequent reduction in striatal dopamine levels producing motor impairment. Moreover, in the MPTP model of PD, hypercholesterolemia exacerbated MPTP-induced reduction of striatal dopamine as well as dopaminergic neurons in SN with motor behavioral depreciation. Activity of mitochondrial complexes, mainly complex-I and III, was impaired severely in the nigrostriatal pathway of hypercholesterolemic animals treated with MPTP. Hypercholesterolemia caused oxidative stress in the nigrostriatal pathway with increased generation of hydroxyl radicals and enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes, which were further aggravated in the hypercholesterolemic mice with Parkinsonism. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence of increased vulnerability of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons in PD with hypercholesterolemia."
https://openalex.org/W2587408400,"Respiratory complex I couples electron transfer between NADH and ubiquinone to proton translocation across an energy-transducing membrane to support the proton-motive force that drives ATP synthesis. The proton-pumping stoichiometry of complex I (i.e. the number of protons pumped for each two electrons transferred) underpins all mechanistic proposals. However, it remains controversial and has not been determined for any of the bacterial enzymes that are exploited as model systems for the mammalian enzyme. Here, we describe a simple method for determining the proton-pumping stoichiometry of complex I in inverted membrane vesicles under steady-state ADP-phosphorylating conditions. Our method exploits the rate of ATP synthesis, driven by oxidation of NADH or succinate with different sections of the respiratory chain engaged in catalysis as a proxy for the rate of proton translocation and determines the stoichiometry of complex I by reference to the known stoichiometries of complexes III and IV. Using vesicles prepared from mammalian mitochondria (from Bos taurus) and from the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans, we show that four protons are pumped for every two electrons transferred in both cases. By confirming the four-proton stoichiometry for mammalian complex I and, for the first time, demonstrating the same value for a bacterial complex, we establish the utility of P. denitrificans complex I as a model system for the mammalian enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2587729071,"Community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analyses from very diverse environments are frequently used with the aim of characterizing the metabolic versatility of whole environmental bacterial communities. While the limitations of the methodology for the characterization of whole communities are well known, we propose that CLPP combined with high-throughput sequencing and qPCR can be utilized to identify the copiotrophic, fast-growing fraction of the bacterial community of soil environments, where oligotrophic taxa are usually dominant. In the present work we have used this approach to analyze samples of litter and soil from a coniferous forest in the Czech Republic using BIOLOG GN2 plates. Monosaccharides and amino acids were utilized significantly faster than other C substrates, such as organic acids, in both litter and soil samples. Bacterial biodiversity in CLPP wells was significantly lower than in the original community, independently of the carbon source. Bacterial communities became highly enriched in taxa that typically showed low abundance in the original soil, belonging mostly to the Gammaproteobacteria and the genus Pseudomonas, indicating that the copiotrophic strains, favoured by the high nutrient content, are rare in forest litter and soil. In contrast, taxa abundant in the original samples were rarely found to grow at sufficient rates under the CLPP conditions. Our results show that CLPP is useful to detect copiotrophic bacteria from the soil environments and that bacterial growth is substrate specific."
https://openalex.org/W2587598582,"The present study aimed to elucidate the cell death mechanism in Leishmania donovani upon treatment with KalsomeTM10, a new liposomal amphotericin B.We studied morphological alterations in promastigotes through phase contrast and scanning electron microscopy. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and disruption of mitochondrial integrity was determined by flow cytometry using annexinV-FITC, JC-1 and mitotraker, respectively. For analysing oxidative stress, generation of H2O2 (bioluminescence kit) and mitochondrial superoxide O2- (mitosox) were measured. DNA fragmentation was evaluated using terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) and DNA laddering assay. We found that KalsomeTM10 is more effective then Ambisome against the promastigote as well as intracellular amastigote forms. The mechanistic study showed that KalsomeTM10 induced several morphological alterations in promastigotes typical of apoptosis. KalsomeTM10 treatment showed a dose- and time-dependent exposure of PS in promastigotes. Further, study on mitochondrial pathway revealed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as well as disruption in mitochondrial integrity with depletion of intracellular pool of ATP. KalsomeTM10 treated promastigotes showed increased ROS production, diminished GSH levels and increased caspase-like activity. DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest was observed in KalsomeTM10 treated promastigotes. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation was also observed in KalsomeTM10 treated intracellular amastigotes. KalsomeTM10 induced generation of ROS and nitric oxide leads to the killing of the intracellular parasites. Moreover, endocytosis is indispensable for KalsomeTM10 mediated anti-leishmanial effect in host macrophage.KalsomeTM10 induces apoptotic-like cell death in L. donovani parasites to exhibit its anti-leishmanial function."
https://openalex.org/W2586591698,"We previously discovered that systemic delivery of decorin for treatment of breast carcinoma xenografts induces paternally expressed gene 3 (Peg3), an imprinted gene encoding a zinc finger transcription factor postulated to function as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that de novo expression of Peg3 increased Beclin 1 promoter activity and protein expression. This process required the full-length Peg3 as truncated mutants lacking either the N-terminal SCAN domain or the zinc fingers failed to translocate to the nucleus and promote Beclin 1 transcription. Importantly, overexpression of Peg3 in endothelial cells stimulated autophagy and concurrently inhibited endothelial cell migration and evasion from a 3D matrix. Mechanistically, we found that Peg3 induced the secretion of the powerful angiostatic glycoprotein Thrombospondin 1 independently of Beclin 1 transcriptional induction. Thus, we provide a new mechanism whereby Peg3 can simultaneously evoke autophagy in endothelial cells and attenuate angiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2587275331,"There is contradictory evidence surrounding the role of critical cues in the successful anticipation of penalty kicks in soccer. In the current study, skilled and less-skilled soccer goalkeepers were required to anticipate when viewing penalty kicks that were both spatially (full body; hip region) and temporally (-160 ms, -80 ms before, foot-ball contact) occluded. The skilled group outperformed the less-skilled group in all conditions. Participants performed better in the full body condition when compared to hip region condition. Performance in the hip only condition was significantly better than chance for the skilled group across all occlusion conditions. However, the less-skilled group were no better than chance in the hip condition for the early occlusion points when predicting direction and height. Later temporal occlusion conditions were associated with increased performance both in the correct response and correct direction analyses, but not for correct height. These data suggest that postural information solely from the hip region may be used by skilled goalkeepers to make accurate predictions of penalty kick direction, however, information from other sources are needed in order to make predictions of height. Findings demonstrate how the importance of anticipation cues evolve over time, which has implications for the design of training programs to enhance perceptual-cognitive skill."
https://openalex.org/W2586385151,"Interfaces between tendon/ligament and bone (“entheses”) are highly specialized tissues that allow for stress transfer between mechanically dissimilar materials. Entheses show very low regenerative capacity resulting in high incidences of failure after surgical repair. Tissue engineering is a promising approach to recover functionality of entheses. Here, we established a protocol to decellularize porcine entheses as scaffolds for enthesis tissue engineering. Chemical detergents as well as physical treatments were investigated with regard to their efficiency to decellularize 2 mm thick porcine Achilles tendon entheses. A two-phase approach was employed: study 1 investigated the effect of various concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and t-octylphenoxypolyethoxy-ethanol (Triton X-100) as decellularization agents. The most efficient combination of SDS and Triton was then carried forward into study 2, where different physical methods, including freeze-thaw cycles, ultrasound, perfusion, and hydrostatic washing were used to enhance the decellularization effect. Cell counts, DNA quantification, and histology showed that washing with 0.5% SDS + 1% Triton X-100 for 72 h at room temperature could remove ~ 98% cells from the interface. Further investigation of physical methods proved that washing under 200 mmHg hydrostatic pressure shortened the detergent exposing time from 72 h to 48 h. Biomechanical tensile testing showed that the biomechanical features of treated samples were preserved. Washing under 200 mmHg hydrostatic pressure with 0.5% SDS + 1% Triton X-100 for 48 h efficiently decellularized entheses with preservation of matrix structure and biomechanical features. This protocol can be used to efficiently decellularize entheses as scaffolds for tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2586583124,"Psychosocial stress is a major factor driving gastrointestinal (GI) pathophysiology and disease susceptibility in humans and animals. The mechanisms governing susceptibility to stress-induced GI disease remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the influence of chronic social stress (CSS) in pigs, induced by 7 d of chronic mixing/crowding stress, on intestinal barrier and nutrient transport function, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) signaling and immunological responses. Results from this study showed that CSS resulted in a significant impairment of ileal and colonic barrier function indicated by reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in the ileum and increased FD4 flux in the ileum (by 0.8 fold) and colon (by 0.7 fold). Ileal sodium glucose linked transporter 1 (SGLT-1) function, measured as glucose-induced changes in short-circuit current (Isc), was diminished (by 52%) in CSS pigs, associated with reduced body weight gain and feed efficiency. Although reductions in SGLT-1 function were observed in CSS pigs, mRNA expression for SGLT-1, villus heights were increased in CSS pigs. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) mRNA was upregulated (by 0.9 fold) in the ileum of CSS pigs but not in the colon. Urocortin 2 (Ucn2) mRNA was upregulated (by 1.5 fold) in the colon of CSS pigs, but not in the ileum. In CSS pigs, a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA (IL1B, TNFA, IL8, and IL6) was observed in both ileum and colon, compared with controls. In contrast CSS induced a marked upregulation of mRNA for IL10 and mast cell chymase gene (CMA1) in the ileum and colon. Together, these data demonstrate that chronic stress in pigs results in significant alterations in intestinal barrier and nutrient transport function and neuro-immune mediator and receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W2587011319,"Lactoferrin (LF) is one of the most abundant bioactive glycoproteins in human milk. Glycans attached through N-glycosidic bonds may contribute to Lactoferrin functional activities. In contrast, LF is present in trace amounts in bovine milk. Efforts to increase LF concentration in bovine milk led to alternative approaches using transgenic cows to express human lactoferrin (hLF). This study investigated and compared N-glycans in recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF), bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and human lactoferrin by Nano-LC-Chip-Q-TOF Mass Spectrometry. The results revealed a high diversity of N-glycan structures, including fucosylated and sialylated complex glycans that may contribute additional bioactivities. rhLF, bLF and hLF had 23, 27 and 18 N-glycans respectively with 8 N-glycan in common overall. rhLF shared 16 N-glycan with bLF and 9 N-glycan with hLF while bLF shared 10 N-glycan with hLF. Based on the relative abundances of N-glycan types, rhLF and hLF appeared to contain mostly neutral complex/hybrid N-glycans (81% and 52% of the total respectively) whereas bLF was characterized by high mannose glycans (65%). Interestingly, the majority of hLF N-glycans were fucosylated (88%), whereas bLF and rhLF had only 9% and 20% fucosylation, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that rhLF N-glycans share more similarities to bLF than hLF."
https://openalex.org/W2587547834,"Background The study aimed to identify the impact of non-disclosure of HIV status on the loss to follow-up (LTFU) of patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Methodology A historic cohort of HIV patients from 2 major hospitals in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo was followed from 2004 to 2012. LTFU was defined as not taking an ART refill for a period of 3 months or longer since the last attendance, and had not yet been classified as ‘dead’ or ‘transferred-out’. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to determine the probability of LTFU as a function of time as inclusive of the cohort. The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves based on determinants. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to measure predictors of LTFU from the time of treatment induction until December 15th, 2012 (the end-point). Results The median follow-up time was 3.99 years (IQR = 2.33 to 5.59). Seventy percent of patients had shared their HIV status with others (95% CI: 66.3–73.1). The proportion of LTFU was 12% (95%CI: 9.6–14.4). Patients who did not share their HIV status (Adjusted HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.46–2.29), patients who did not live in the city of Goma (Adjusted HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.02–3.77), and those who attained secondary or higher education level (Adjusted HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02–2.53) had a higher hazard of being LTFU. Conclusion This study shows the relationship between the non–disclosure HIV status and LTFU. Healthcare workers in similar settings should pay more attention to clients who have not disclosed their HIV status, and to those living far from health settings where they receive medication."
https://openalex.org/W2587185925,"Phenazines are a class of redox-active molecules produced by diverse bacteria and archaea. Many of the biological functions of phenazines, such as mediating signaling, iron acquisition, and redox homeostasis, derive from their redox activity. Although prior studies have focused on extracellular phenazine oxidation by oxygen and iron, here we report a search for reductants and catalysts of intracellular phenazine reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enzymatic assays in cell-free lysate, together with crude fractionation and chemical inhibition, indicate that P. aeruginosa contains multiple enzymes that catalyze the reduction of the endogenous phenazines pyocyanin and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid in both cytosolic and membrane fractions. We used chemical inhibitors to target general enzyme classes and found that an inhibitor of flavoproteins and heme-containing proteins, diphenyleneiodonium, effectively inhibited phenazine reduction in vitro, suggesting that most phenazine reduction derives from these enzymes. Using natively purified proteins, we demonstrate that the pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes directly catalyze phenazine reduction with pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate as electron donors. Both complexes transfer electrons to phenazines through the common subunit dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, a flavoprotein encoded by the gene lpdG. Although we were unable to co-crystallize LpdG with an endogenous phenazine, we report its X-ray crystal structure in the apo-form (refined to 1.35 A), bound to NAD+ (1.45 A), and bound to NADH (1.79 A). In contrast to the notion that phenazines support intracellular redox homeostasis by oxidizing NADH, our work suggests that phenazines may substitute for NAD+ in LpdG and other enzymes, achieving the same end by a different mechanism."

As other new oral anticoagulants, routine monitoring of rivaroxaban is not necessary, but important in some clinical circumstances. In our study a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was validated to measure rivaroxaban plasmatic concentration. Our method used a simple sample preparation, protein precipitation, and a fast chromatographic run. It was developed a precise and accurate method, with a linear range from 2 to 500 ng/mL, and a lower limit of quantification of 4 pg on column. The new method was compared to a reference method (anti-factor Xa activity) and both presented a good correlation (r = 0.98, p < 0.001). In addition, we validated hemolytic, icteric or lipemic plasma samples for rivaroxaban measurement by HPLC-MS/MS without interferences. The chromogenic and HPLC-MS/MS methods were highly correlated and should be used as clinical tools for drug monitoring. The method was applied successfully in a group of 49 real-life patients, which allowed an accurate determination of rivaroxaban in peak and trough levels."

We performed this study to investigate the clinical relevance of miR-26a expression in ESCC. miR-26a was detected by using the in situ hybridization method. To functionally analyze the role of miR-26a in ESCC cell lines in vitro, KYSE-450 and Eca109 cells were employed, whose endogenous miR-26a was artificially down- or up-regulated, respectively, by using lentiviral-based transfection. There was significant association between miR-26a expression and clinical stage (P = 0.049), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.023), tumor volume (P = 0.003), and poor overall prognosis (P = 0.026). miR-26a was able to suppress proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro Moreover, we have confirmed that miR-26a can negatively regulate MTDH in ESCC cells by using luciferase reporter assay. In addition, to investigate the role miR-26a plays in cell proliferation, we nude mice were xenografted with ESCC cells whose miR-26a was stably down- and up-regulated. Together, our results show that miR-26a is capable of suppressing the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells via negative regulation of MTDH. Moreover, miR-26a expression was clinically relevant in cancer progression and poor prognosis, which supports the idea that miR-26a acts as a tumor suppressor in ESCC.-Yang, C., Zheng, S., Liu, T., Liu, Q., Dai, F., Zhou, J., Chen, Y., Sheyhidin, I., Lu, X. Down-regulated miR-26a promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion via negative regulation of MTDH in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2586098595,"Placoderms are considered as the first jawed vertebrates and constitute a paraphyletic group in the stem-gnathostome grade. The acanthothoracid placoderms are among the phylogenetically most basal and morphologically primitive gnathostomes, but their neurocranial anatomy is poorly understood. Here we present a near-complete three-dimensional skull of Romundina stellina, a small Early Devonian acanthothoracid from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, scanned with propagation phase contrast microtomography at a 7.46 μm isotropic voxel size at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. This is the first model of an early gnathostome skull produced using this technique, and as such represents a major advance in objectivity compared to past descriptions of placoderm neurocrania on the basis of grinding series. Despite some loss of material along an oblique crack, most of the internal structures are remarkably preserved, and most of the missing structures can be reconstructed by symmetry. This virtual approach offers the possibility to connect with certainty all the external foramina to the blood and nerve canals and the central structures, and thus identify accurate homologies without destroying the specimen. The high level of detail enables description of the main arterial, venous and nerve canals of the skull, and other perichondrally ossified endocranial structures such as the palatoquadrate articulations, the endocranial cavity and the inner ear cavities. The braincase morphology appears less extreme than that of Brindabellaspis, and is in some respects more reminiscent of a basal arthrodire such as Kujdanowiaspis."
https://openalex.org/W2586385815,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a morphogen essential to the developing nervous system that continues to play an important role in adult life by contributing to cell proliferation and differentiation, maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity, and being cytoprotective against oxidative and excitotoxic stress, all features of importance in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a fatal disease characterized by selective loss of motor neurons due to poorly understood mechanisms. Evidence indicates that Shh might play an important role in ALS, and that Shh signaling might be also adversely affected in ALS. Since little is known about the functional status of Shh pathway in patients with ALS, we therefore sought to determine whether Shh protein levels or biological activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was less in ALS patients than controls, and whether these measures could be correlated with ALS disease severity and disease progression, and with other CSF analytes of biological interest in ALS. Comparing Shh levels in the CSF of normal controls (n = 13), neurological controls (n = 12), and ALS patients (n = 9) measured by ELISA, we found that CSF Shh levels were not different between controls and ALS patients. However, when assessing Shh biological activity in CSF using in vitro cell-based assays, which measure Shh activity as inducible Gli-driven luminescence, we found that in the presence of exogenous recombinant Shh or the Shh agonist, purmorphamine, the inducible activity of CSF was significantly augmented in the control groups as expected, but not in the ALS group, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor of Shh signaling in ALS CSF samples. Since purmorphamine acts on Smoothened, downstream of Shh and its receptor Patched, the inhibitory action is downstream of Smoothened. Our results also demonstrated that while the inhibitory effect of ALS CSF on Shh signaling did not correlate significantly with ALS disease characteristics, the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α did. In addition to being significantly elevated in ALS CSF, these cytokines negatively correlated with the disease duration, whereas GDF11 was a favorable predictor of ALS clinical score.

https://openalex.org/W2586716239,"Muscle atrophy is a prevalent condition in illness and aging. Identifying novel pathways that control muscle mass may lead to therapeutic advancement. We previously identified Nur77 as a transcriptional regulator of glycolysis in skeletal muscle. More recently, we showed that Nur77 expression also controls myofiber size in mice. It was unknown, however, whether Nur77’s regulation of muscle size begins during developmental myogenesis or only in adulthood. To determine the importance of Nur77 throughout muscle growth, we examined myofiber size at E18.5, 3 weeks postnatal age, and in young adult mice. Using the global Nur77-/- mice, we showed that Nur77 deficiency reduced myofiber size as early as E18.5. The reduction in myofiber size became more pronounced by 3 weeks of age. We observed comparable reduction in myofiber size in young myofiber-specific Nur77-knockout mice. These findings suggest that Nur77’s effect on muscle growth is intrinsic to its expression in differentiating myofibers, and not dependent on its expression in myogenic stem cells. To determine the importance of Nur77 expression in muscle accretion in mature mice, we generated an inducible-, muscle-specific, Nur77-deficient mouse model. We demonstrated that tamoxifen-induced deletion of Nur77 in 3-month-old mice reduced myofiber size. This change was accompanied by increased activity of Smad2 and FoxO3, two negative regulators of muscle mass. The role of Nur77 in muscle growth was further elaborated in the cardiotoxin-induced muscle regeneration model. Compared to wildtype mice, regenerated myofibers were smaller in Nur77-/- mice. However, when normalized to saline-injected muscle, the recovery of sarcoplasmic area was comparable between Nur77-/- and wildtype mice. These findings suggest that Nur77 deficiency compromises myofiber growth, but not the regenerative capacity of myogenic progenitor cells. Collectively, the findings presented here demonstrate Nur77 as an important regulator of muscle growth both during prenatal and postnatal myogenesis."

Material and methods We measured Hb concentrations in a field sample of 148 children from one to five years of age. Masimo and HemoCue were used for capillary blood samples and an automatic analyzer for venous blood samples. Regression models with no intercept were constructed to measure precision and predictability, concordance correlations to measure accuracy and precision, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement as well as hierarchical linear models to estimate variance. Results Both HemoCue and Masimo underestimated Hb concentrations compared to the gold standard. They respectively yielded the following results: regression coefficients of 0.887 and 0.876 with 98.7% and 98.6% predictability; concordance correlation coefficients of 0.183 (p<0.001) and 0.166 (p<0.001); and Bland-Altman variances of -1.51 and -1.62. With regard to Masimo specifically, the three-level Hierarchical Linear Model showed that 57.9% of total variance stemmed from random errors in repeated measures from the same subject. Conclusions HemoCue and Masimo measure lower Hb concentrations than the gold standard. Their accuracy and precision levels are comparable. It is essential to ensure proper use of devices through enhanced training of field workers."
https://openalex.org/W2586134972,"More than 900 students and teachers at many schools in Jiaxing city developed acute gastroenteritis in February 2014. An immediate epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the pathogen, infection sources and route of transmission.The probable cases and confirmed cases were defined as students or teachers with diarrhoea or vomiting present since the term began in February 2014. An active search was conducted for undiagnosed cases among students and teachers. Details such as demographic characteristics, gastrointestinal symptoms, and drinking water preference and frequency were collected via a uniform epidemiological questionnaire. A case-control study was implemented, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Rectal swabs from several patients, food handlers and barrelled water factory workers, as well as water and food samples, were collected to test for potential bacteria and viruses.A total of 924 cases fit the definition of the probable case, including 8 cases of laboratory-confirmed norovirus infection at 13 schools in Jiaxing city between February 12 and February 21, 2014. The case-control study demonstrated that barrelled water was a risk factor (OR: 20.15, 95% CI: 2.59-156.76) and that bottled water and boiled barrelled water were protective factors (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.13-0.70, and OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16-0.77). A total of 11 rectal samples and 8 barrelled water samples were detected as norovirus-positive, and the genotypes of viral strains were the same (GII). The norovirus that contaminated the barrelled water largely came from the asymptomatic workers.This acute gastroenteritis outbreak was caused by barrelled water contaminated by norovirus. The outbreak was controlled after stopping the supply of barrelled water. The barrelled water supply in China represents a potential source of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks due to the lack of surveillance and supervision. Therefore, more attention should be paid to this area."
https://openalex.org/W2586138616,"Estrogen receptor α (ER-α) is a nuclear hormone receptor that controls selected genes, thereby regulating proliferation and differentiation of target tissues, such as breast. Gene expression controlled by ER-α is modulated by Ca2+ via calmodulin (CaM). Here we present the NMR structure of Ca2+-CaM bound to two molecules of ER-α (residues 287–305). The two lobes of CaM bind to the same site on two separate ER-α molecules (residues 292, 296, 299, 302, and 303), which explains why CaM binds two molecules of ER-α in a 1:2 complex and stabilizes ER-α dimerization. Exposed glutamate residues in CaM (Glu-11, Glu-14, Glu-84, and Glu-87) form salt bridges with key lysine residues in ER-α (Lys-299, Lys-302, and Lys-303), which is likely to prevent ubiquitination at these sites and inhibit degradation of ER-α. Transfection of cells with full-length CaM slightly increased the ability of estrogen to enhance transcriptional activation by ER-α of endogenous estrogen-responsive genes. By contrast, expression of either the N- or C-lobe of CaM abrogated estrogen-stimulated transcription of the estrogen responsive genes pS2 and progesterone receptor. These data suggest that CaM-induced dimerization of ER-α is required for estrogen-stimulated transcriptional activation by the receptor.

The receptors share distinct structural and functional domains. These are the A/B regions, which contain a transactivation domain (AF1), the C region, which corresponds to the DNA-binding domain, the D region containing the hinge domain, and the E/F regions in which the ligand binding domain is located (2Thomas C. Gustafsson J.Å. The different roles of ER subtypes in cancer biology and therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Binding of 17β-estradiol (E2) to ER-α elicits effects in target tissues via the “classic” pathway or by non-genomic signaling through activation of protein kinase cascades (2Thomas C. Gustafsson J.Å.

In the classic signaling mechanism, E2 induces a conformational change in ER-α, which then dimerizes. The E2-bound receptor translocates to the nucleus where it binds to DNA at estrogen response elements (EREs) and recruits co-regulatory proteins. These co-activators and co-repressors modulate the transcriptional activation of genes by ER-α. A substantial body of evidence implicates perturbation of E2 signaling in cancer initiation, progression, and response to therapy (2Thomas C. Gustafsson J.Å.

Recent data indicate that numerous proteins influence the structure and function of ER-α, stabilize the ER-α/DNA interaction, and modulate gene expression (4Schultz-Norton J.R. Ziegler Y.S.

These proteins are involved in cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodeling, protein turnover, and cell migration. Accumulating evidence shows that a group of ER-α modifying proteins participate in cell signaling. For example, the scaffold protein IQGAP1, which integrates diverse signaling pathways (5Smith J.M.

Another signaling protein that influences ER-α is the Ca2+ modulator calmodulin (CaM). CaM is a highly conserved protein that contains 148 amino acids. Via direct interactions with numerous diverse proteins, CaM regulates several cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and cell cycle progression (8Chin D. Means A.R. Calmodulin: a prototypical calcium sensor.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). CaM binds directly to ER-α, but not to ER-β (9Li L.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which CaM produces these effects, we recently conducted structural analysis and solved the NMR structures of the individual lobes of CaM (N- and C-lobes) each bound to a functional fragment of ER-α (residues 287–305) (15Zhang Y.

These studies yielded two distinct models to describe the interaction between CaM and ER-α (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B.

Res. Commun. 2012; 419: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our data revealed that one CaM molecule binds two molecules of ER-α in a 1:2 complex (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B. Structural basis for Ca2+-induced activation and dimerization of estrogen receptor α by calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9336-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We generated a model in which each lobe of CaM is attached to a separate hinge domain of ER-α, suggesting that CaM can facilitate dimerization of ER-α. By contrast, Carlier et al. (16Carlier L. Byrne C. Miclet E. Bourgoin-Voillard S. Nicaise M. Tabet J.C. Desmadril M. Leclercq G. Lequin O. Jacquot Y. Biophysical studies of the interaction between calmodulin and the R(2)(8)(7)-T(3)(1)(1) region of human estrogen receptor α reveals an atypical binding process.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 419: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) put forward a scheme in which the two lobes of CaM interact allosterically and CaM undergoes a concerted conformational change when binding ER-α. To reconcile these conflicting models and determine the correct mode of binding, we analyzed the structure of full-length CaM bound to two ER-α peptides. The data presented here reveal that this structure is identical to the structures of the separate CaM lobes each bound to ER-α. Thus, the two ER-α binding sites on CaM are completely independent. In addition, analysis of ER-α transcriptional activity in human cells transfected with separate lobes of CaM provides in vivo evidence that bolsters our model. Previously we solved NMR structures of individual CaM lobes (CaM-N and CaM-C) each bound to a peptide fragment of ER-α (residues 287–305, called ER(287–305)) (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B. Structural basis for Ca2+-induced activation and dimerization of estrogen receptor α by calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9336-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half (CaM-N, amino acids 1–74) and the C-terminal half (CaM-C, amino acids 75–148) of calmodulin each bound to one ER-α with nearly the same affinity as full-length CaM (CaM-F) binds to two ER-α (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B. Structural basis for Ca2+-induced activation and dimerization of estrogen receptor α by calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9336-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the two CaM lobes bind independently to two separate ER-α molecules, suggesting that CaM may stabilize dimerization of ER-α. In the current study, we present a NMR structural analysis of full-length CaM bound to two molecules of ER(287–305). The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled CaM bound to two molecules of ER(287–305) (Fig. 1A) looks similar to the NMR spectra of CaM-N (cyan in Fig. 1A) and CaM-C (magenta in Fig. 1A) each bound to one molecule of ER(287–305). This spectral similarity demonstrates that in the full-length protein both CaM lobes are independently folded and each lobe binds independently to a separate ER-α molecule. The constant time 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of 13C-labeled CaM bound to two molecules of unlabeled ER(287–305) also matches quite well to both spectra of the individual lobes (Fig. 1B). The agreement of the methyl chemical shifts in 1H-13C HSQC spectra (of CaM-F versus CaM-N and CaM-C) demonstrates that the structural environment of side chain methyl groups in the exposed hydrophobic core of both lobes that contact ER(287–305) must be unchanged in full-length CaM. Therefore, the structure of the individual lobes bound to ER-α determined previously (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B. Structural basis for Ca2+-induced activation and dimerization of estrogen receptor α by calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9336-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) must have a similar structure in full-length CaM bound to two ER-α molecules. To further test this hypothesis, we solved the NMR structure of full-length CaM bound to two ER(287–305) molecules. An NMR-derived structural model of full-length CaM bound to two molecules of ER(287–305) is shown in Fig. 2. Three-dimensional protein structures derived from the NMR assignments were calculated on the basis of NOE data, chemical shift analysis, 3JNHα spin-spin coupling constants, and residual dipolar coupling restraints as described previously (15Zhang Y.

The root mean square deviation is <0.6 Å when comparing the main chain atoms of the full-length CaM N-lobe versus CaM-N. The EF-hand interhelical angles for the full-length CaM N-lobe (bound to ER(287–305) are 84° for EF1 and 90° for EF2, which are lower than those for free CaM (EF1, 103.8° and EF2, 101°). Exposed hydrophobic side chains in the full-length CaM N-lobe (Met-51, Val-55, Ile-63, and Met-72) interact with the aromatic side chain of Trp-292 from ER(287–305) (Fig. 2B). Also noteworthy are exposed glutamate side chains in full-length CaM N-lobe (Glu-11 and Glu-14) that form salt bridges with lysine residues in ER-α (Lys-299 and Lys-303). The main chain structure of the C-lobe in full-length CaM bound to ER(287–305) (Fig. 2) looks similar to the structure of CaM-C bound to ER(287–305) (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B.

The root mean square deviation is <0.8 Å when comparing the main chain atoms of the full-length CaM C-lobe versus CaM-C. The EF-hand interhelical angles for the full-length CaM C-lobe bound to ER-α (103 °C for EF3 and 94 °C for EF4) are close to those for free CaM. Exposed hydrophobic residues in CaM (Ile-100, Leu-105, Val-108, Met-124, and Ile-125) form close contacts with the aromatic side chain of Trp-292 from ER(287–305) (Fig. 2C). Two lysine residues in ER-α (Lys-299 and Lys-303) form salt bridges with Glu-84 and Glu-87 in CaM. Analysis was conducted to determine whether CaM-N and CaM-C could bind endogenous ER-α in a normal cell milieu. To evaluate this interaction, we wanted to transfect cells with the individual lobes of CaM and examine ER-α binding. Although expression of intact full-length CaM in cells was readily achieved, we encountered considerable difficulty expressing the isolated lobes of CaM in mammalian cells. After numerous attempts with several different plasmids that express the N- or C-terminal half of CaM, we were eventually successful with GFP-tagged constructs. We generated GFP-tagged constructs of full-length CaM and the two halves; the N-terminal half, amino acids 1–74, and the C-terminal half, amino acids 75–148. Transfection of HEK-293 or MCF-7 cells with each plasmid yielded clear, and reproducible, protein expression as detected with anti-GFP antibody (Figs. 3A, 4C, 5C, and 6C). Each protein migrated to its expected position on SDS-PAGE.FIGURE 4CaM alters ER-α function.

A representative experiment of 4 is shown. **, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine binding, we transfected GFP-tagged CaM-F, CaM-N, and CaM-C into HEK-293 cells, isolated the proteins with GFP-Trap_A agarose, and then incubated them with MCF-7 cell lysates. GFP-tagged full-length CaM bound to endogenous ER-α in MCF-7 cell lysates (Fig. 3A). These findings are congruent with our prior documentation that endogenous ER-α co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous untagged CaM from MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. Calmodulin enhances the stability of the estrogen receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consistent with the in vitro data generated with pure CaM-N, CaM-C, and the fragment of ER-α (287–305) (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B. Structural basis for Ca2+-induced activation and dimerization of estrogen receptor α by calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9336-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we observed that the individual lobes of CaM could precipitate endogenous ER-α from cell lysates (Fig. 3A). Moreover, in keeping with the stoichiometry data, the amount of ER-α bound to CaM-F is considerably greater than that bound to CaM-N or CaM-C. No ER-α is present in samples containing GFP alone (Fig. 3A), validating the specificity of the interaction with the CaM constructs. Probing the blots for GFP showed similar amounts of each CaM construct (Fig. 3A, lower panel). These data reveal that the N- and C-halves of CaM independently bind ER-α in cell lysates. To determine whether CaM-N and CaM-C are capable of binding other targets, we examined IQGAP1, which contains four IQ motifs that interact with CaM (17Li Z. Sacks D.B. Elucidation of the interaction of calmodulin with the IQ motifs of IQGAP1.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4347-4352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We tagged CaM-F, CaM-N, and CaM-C with GST, expressed the proteins in Escherichia coli (Fig. 3B, lower panel) and incubated each with equal amounts of MCF-7 cell lysate. GST-tagged full-length CaM bound to IQGAP1 in cell lysates (Fig. 3B). Similarly, CaM-N and CaM-C each bind to endogenous IQGAP1. Thus, the individual lobes of CaM can bind to at least two targets that have different modes of association with CaM. If full-length CaM binds two molecules of ER-α, thus promoting receptor dimerization and facilitating ER-α transcriptional activity, one would anticipate that the individual lobes of CaM would elicit a different effect. In this situation, each lobe of CaM would bind to a separate molecule of ER-α, but the separate CaM lobes would not be able to induce receptor dimerization and ER-α transcriptional activity would therefore not be increased. The strategy we adopted to test this hypothesis was to transfect cells with the individual lobes of CaM and examine ER-α function. The effect of the CaM constructs on ER-α function was evaluated by assessing the ability of ER-α to activate selected endogenous estrogen responsive genes. E2 promotes an increase of pS2 hnRNA in HEK-293 cells that were transfected with ER-α (Fig. 4A, left panel). (HEK-293 cells do not contain endogenous ER-α (data not shown).) Transfection of GFP-tagged full-length CaM slightly enhanced the ability of E2 to stimulate pS2 RNA. By contrast, expression of either CaM-N or CaM-C abrogated the effect of E2 on the transcriptional activation by ER-α (Fig. 4A, right panel). To extend these findings, we examined the effect of CaM on the ability of ER-α to activate progesterone receptor (PR), which is another endogenous estrogen-responsive gene. Analysis showed that either CaM-N or CaM-C blocked the increase in PR elicited by E2 (Fig. 4B). Western blotting of protein lysates confirmed that the cells expressed equivalent amounts of each CaM construct and had the same level of ER-α (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the expression of GFP-tagged CaM-N or CaM-C can interfere with E2 stimulation of endogenous ER-α, MCF-7 were transfected with these constructs and transcription of pS2 and PR hnRNA was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. E2 stimulated transcription of pS2 by ER-α in MCF-7 cells transfected with GFP-tagged CaM-F (Fig. 5A). Analogous to the observations in HEK-293 cells, E2 was unable to increase pS2 transcription in MCF-7 cells transfected with CaM-N or CaM-C. Similarly, the ability of E2 to increase PR in MCF-7 cells was abrogated in the presence of CaM-N or CaM-C (Fig. 5B). The level of expression of each CaM construct was equivalent (Fig. 5C). To ascertain whether the individual lobes of CaM could interfere with the effects of full-length CaM, we co-transfected full-length CaM with either CaM-N or CaM-C and examined E2-stimulated transcriptional activation. In HEK-293 cells transfected with full-length CaM and empty vector, E2 significantly stimulated the transcriptional activation of pS2 RNA (Fig. 6A). However, when cells were co-transfected with full-length CaM and CaM-N, E2 was unable to promote transcriptional activation of pS2 RNA. Similarly, transfecting CaM-C together with full-length CaM into cells completely prevented E2 from enhancing transcriptional activation of pS2 RNA (Fig. 6A). Essentially identical results were observed with PR. Expression of either CaM-N or CaM-C with full-length CaM abrogated the transcriptional activation of PR induced by E2 (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that the individual lobes of CaM competitively inhibit full-length CaM. Western blotting of cell lysates verified the expression of equivalent levels of ER-α and the CaM constructs (Fig. 6C). Collectively these data indicate that the separate lobes of CaM are able to bind to ER-α, but they are unable to induce dimerization and promote activation of the receptor. It is noteworthy that binding of a single lobe of CaM, either the N- or C-lobe, to ER-α completely prevents E2 from stimulating transcriptional activation of the target genes we investigated. Previously, we solved the NMR structures of individual CaM lobes (CaM-N and CaM-C) each of which binds to the same site on ER-α (15Zhang Y. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Ames J.B. Structural basis for Ca2+-induc"
https://openalex.org/W2586735555,"The hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-modulated ion channel (HCN) drives the pacemaker activity in the heart, and its malfunction can result in heart disorders. One such disorder, familial sinus bradycardia, is caused by the S672R mutation in HCN, whose electrophysiological phenotypes include a negative shift in the channel activation voltage and an accelerated HCN deactivation. The outcomes of these changes are abnormally low resting heart rates. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these electrophysiological changes is currently not fully understood. Crystallographic investigations indicate that the S672R mutation causes limited changes in the structure of the HCN intracellular gating tetramer, but its effects on protein dynamics are unknown. Here, we utilize comparative S672R versus WT NMR analyses to show that the S672R mutation results in extensive perturbations of the dynamics in both apo- and holo-forms of the HCN4 isoform, reflecting how S672R remodels the free energy landscape for the modulation of HCN4 by cAMP, i.e. the primary cyclic nucleotide modulator of HCN channels. We show that the S672R mutation results in a constitutive shift of the dynamic auto-inhibitory equilibrium toward inactive states of HCN4 and broadens the free-energy well of the apo-form, enhancing the millisecond to microsecond dynamics of the holo-form at sites critical for gating cAMP binding. These S672R-induced variations in dynamics provide a molecular basis for the electrophysiological phenotypes of this mutation and demonstrate that the pathogenic effects of the S672R mutation can be rationalized primarily in terms of modulations of protein dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2587362899,"Elucidating protective immunity against HCV is important for the development of a preventative vaccine. We hypothesize that spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection offers clue to protective immune responses, and that DAA therapy affects the quality and quantity of HCV-specific T cell responses. To test these hypotheses, we performed T cell epitope mapping in 111 HCV-infected individuals including 61 chronically HCV-1b (CHC-1b) infected, 24 chronically HCV-2a (CHC-2a) infected and 26 spontaneously recovered (SPR) patients with 376 overlapping peptides covering the entire HCV polyprotein. Selected T cell epitopes were then used to evaluate T cell responses in another 22 chronically HCV-1b infected patients on DAA therapy. Results showed that SPR had better HCV-specific T cell responses than CHC, as manifested by higher response rate, greater magnitude and broader epitope coverage. In addition, SPR recognized novel epitopes in Core, E1, E2, NS4B, NS5A regions that were not present in the CHC. Furthermore, during the first 24 weeks of DAA therapy, there was no functional immune reconstitution of HCV-specific T cells. These results indicate that T cell responses may be a correlate of protection. Therefore, effective preventative vaccines should elicit a robust T cell response. Although various DAA regimens efficiently cleared viruses from the blood of HCV-infected patients, there was no contemporaneous early T cell immune reconstitution, suggesting that early treatment is needed for preserving the functions of HCV-specific T cells."

However, there are few studies of the N mineralization characteristics of paddy soils in Mollisols area of Northeast China.The soils were sampled from the counties of Qingan and Huachuan, which were located in Mollisols area of Northeast China. The sample soil was incubated under waterlogged at 30°C in a controlled temperature cabinet for 161 days (a 2: 1 water: soil ratio was maintained during incubation). Three models, i.e. the single first-order kinetics model, the double first-order kinetics model and the mixed first-order and zero-order kinetics model were used to simulate the cumulative mineralised N (NH4+-N and TSN) in the laboratory and waterlogged incubation.During 161 days of waterlogged incubation, the average cumulative total soluble N (TSN), ammonium N (NH4+-N), and soluble organic N (SON) was 122.2 mg kg-1, 85.9 mg kg-1, and 36.3 mg kg-1, respectively. Cumulative NH4+-N was significantly (P < 0.05) positively correlated with organic carbon (OC), total N (TN), pH, and exchangeable calcium (Ca), and cumulative TSN was significantly (P < 0.05) positively correlated with OC, TN, and exchangeable Ca, but was not significantly (P > 0.05) correlated with C/N ratio, cation exchange capacity (CEC), extractable iron (Fe), clay, and sand. When the cumulative NH4+-N and TSN were simulated, the single first-order kinetics model provided the least accurate simulation. The parameter of the double first-order kinetics model also did not represent the actual data well, but the mixed first-order and zero-order kinetics model provided the most accurate simulation, as demonstrated by the estimated standard error, F statistic values, parameter accuracy, and fitting effect.Overall, the results showed that SON was involved with N mineralization process, and the mixed first-order and zero-order kinetics model accurately simulates the N mineralization process of paddy soil in Mollisols area of Northeast China under waterlogged incubation."
https://openalex.org/W2586832018,"Child health interventions were drastically scaled up in the period leading up to 2015 as countries aimed at meeting the 2015 target of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). MDGs were defined in terms of achieving improvements in average health. Significant improvements in average child health are documented, but evidence also points to rising inequality. It is important to investigate factors that drive the increasing disparities in order to inform the post-2015 development agenda of reducing inequality, as captured in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We investigated changes in socioeconomic inequality in stunting and fever in Zambia in 2007 and 2014. Unlike the huge literature that seeks to quantify the contribution of different determinants on the observed inequality at any given time, we quantify determinants of changes in inequality.Data from the 2007 and 2014 waves of the Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were utilized. Our sample consisted of children aged 0-5 years (n = 5,616 in 2007 and n = 12,714 in 2014). We employed multilevel models to assess the determinants of stunting and fever, which are two important child health indicators. The concentration index (CI) was used to measure the magnitude of inequality. Changes in inequality of stunting and fever were investigated using Oaxaca-type decomposition of the CI. In this approach, the change in the CI for stunting/fever is decomposed into changes in CI for each determinant and changes in the effect-measured as an elasticity-of each determinant on stunting/fever.While average rates of stunting reduced in 2014 socioeconomic inequality in stunting increased significantly. Inequality in fever incidence also increased significantly, but average rates of fever did not reduce. The increase in the inequality (CI) of determinants accounted for the largest part (42.5%) of the increase in inequality of stunting, while the increase in the effect of determinants explained 35% of the increase. The determinants with the greatest total contribution (change in CI plus change in effect) to the increase in inequality of stunting were mother's height and weight, wealth, birth order, facility delivery, duration of breastfeeding, and maternal education. For fever, almost all (86%) the increase in inequality was accounted for by the increase in the effect of determinants of fever, while the distribution of determinants mattered less. The determinants with the greatest total contribution to the increase in inequality of fever were wealth, maternal education, birth order and breastfeeding duration. In the multilevel model, we found that the likelihood of a child being stunted or experiencing fever depends on the community in which they live.To curb the increase in inequality of stunting and fever, policy may focus on improving levels of, and reducing inequality in, access to facility deliveries, maternal nutrition (which may be related to maternal weight and height), complementary feeding (for breastfed children), wealth, maternal education, and child care (related to birth order effects). Improving overall levels of these determinants contribute to the persistence of inequality if these determinants are unequally concentrated on the well off to begin with."

We performed a prospective quasi-experimental controlled study measuring the effect of these two approaches on patient satisfaction.Patient satisfaction was measured using the Picker questionnaire (PiQ). Results are expressed in problematic percentage scores scaled from 0 = best-100 = worst. During three months, 3 wards of a 6 ward medical rehabilitation division implemented BsP and 3 control wards kept their usual organization of rounds. In total, 90 patients of each group were included in the study and completed the PiQ.Socio-clinical characteristics were similar in both groups: mean age = 67 years (SD = 13), mean Charlson comorbidity index = 8.6 (2.4); mean length of stay = 22 days (12). During their stay, patients in the BsP units had a mean of 14.3 (8) BsP rounds and 0.5 (0.8) OsPR; control patients had a mean of 0.9 (0.7) BsP and 14.8 (7.3) OsPR (p<0.0001). Patients in BsP units reported lower problematic scores regarding coordination of care (39% vs 45%, p = 0.029), involvement of family/friends (29 vs 41%, p = 0.006) and continuity/transition (44% vs 54%, p = 0.020); two questions of the PiQ had worse scores in the BsP: trust in nurses (46.7% vs 30 %, p = 0.021) and recommendation of the institution (61.1% vs 44.4%. p = 0.025).

https://openalex.org/W2951627794,"The role of Golgi apparatus during phagocytic uptake by macrophages has been ruled out in the past. Notably, all such reports were limited to Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we unravel a highly devolved mechanism for recruitment of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles during phagosome biogenesis, which was important for uptake of most cargos, except the IgG-coated ones. We report recruitment of mannosidase-II-positive Golgi-derived vesicles during uptake of diverse targets, including latex beads, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human and mouse macrophages. The recruitment of mannosidase-II vesicles was an early event mediated by focal exocytosis and coincided with the recruitment of transferrin receptor, VAMP3, and dynamin-2. Brefeldin A treatment inhibited mannosidase-II recruitment and phagocytic uptake of serum-coated or -uncoated latex beads and E. coli. However, consistent with previous studies, brefeldin A treatment did not affect uptake of IgG-coated latex beads. Mechanistically, recruitment of mannosidase-II vesicles during phagocytic uptake required Ca2+ from both extra- and intracellular sources apart from PI3K, microtubules, and dynamin-2. Extracellular Ca2+ via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels established a Ca2+-dependent local phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate gradient, which guides the focal movement of Golgi-derived vesicles to the site of uptake. We confirmed Golgi-derived vesicles recruited during phagocytosis were secretory vesicles as their recruitment was sensitive to depletion of VAMP2 or NCS1, whereas recruitment of the recycling endosome marker VAMP3 was unaffected. Depletion of both VAMP2 and NCS1 individually resulted in the reduced uptake by macrophages. Together, the study provides a previously unprecedented role of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles in phagocytic uptake, the key innate defense function."
https://openalex.org/W2586902276,"Maternal influenza immunization has gained traction as a strategy to diminish maternal and neonatal mortality. However, efforts to vaccinate pregnant women against influenza in developing countries will require substantial investment. We present cost-effectiveness estimates of maternal influenza immunization based on clinical trial data from Bamako, Mali.We parameterized a decision-tree model using prospectively collected trial data on influenza incidence, vaccine efficacy, and direct and indirect influenza-related healthcare expenditures. Since clinical trial participants likely had better access to care than the general Malian population, we also simulated scenarios with poor access to care, including decreased healthcare resource utilization and worse influenza-related outcomes.Under base-case assumptions, a maternal influenza immunization program in Mali would cost $857 (95% UI: $188-$2358) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) saved. Adjusting for poor access to care yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of $486 (95% UI: $105-$1425) per DALY saved. Cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to changes in the cost of a maternal vaccination program and to the proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza among infants warranting hospitalization. Mean cost-effectiveness estimates fell below Mali's GDP per capita when the cost per pregnant woman vaccinated was $1.00 or less with no adjustment for access to care or $1.67 for those with poor access to care. Healthcare expenditures for lab-confirmed influenza were not significantly different than the cost of influenza-like illness.Maternal influenza immunization in Mali would be cost-effective in most settings if vaccine can be obtained, managed, and administered for ≤$1.00 per pregnant woman."
https://openalex.org/W2587059426,"Aphananthe is a small genus of five species showing an intriguing amphi-Pacific distribution in eastern, southern and southeastern Asia, Australia, and Mexico, also with one species in Madagascar. The phylogenetic relationships of Aphananthe were reconstructed with two nuclear (ITS & ETS) and two plastid (psbA-trnH & trnL-trnF) regions. Clade divergence times were estimated with a Bayesian approach, and the ancestral areas were inferred using the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis and Bayesian Binary MCMC analyses. Aphananthe was supported to be monophyletic, with the eastern Asian A. aspera resolved as sister to a clade of the remaining four species. Aphananthe was inferred to have originated in the Late Cretaceous (71.5 mya, with 95% HPD: 66.6–81.3 mya), and the crown age of the genus was dated to be in the early Miocene (19.1 mya, with 95% HPD: 12.4–28.9 mya). The fossil record indicates that Aphananthe was present in the high latitude thermophilic forests in the early Tertiary, and experienced extinctions from the middle Tertiary onwards. Aphananthe originated in Europe based on the inference that included fossil and extant species, but eastern Asia was estimated to be the ancestral area of the clade of the extant species of Aphananthe. Both the West Gondwanan vicariance hypothesis and the boreotropics hypothesis could be excluded as explanation for its amphi-Pacific distribution.

https://openalex.org/W2587614615,"High-risk neuroblastoma is characterized by undifferentiated neuroblasts and low schwannian stroma content. The tumor stroma contributes to the suppression of tumor growth by releasing soluble factors that promote neuroblast differentiation. Here we identify heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like growth factor (HBEGF) as a potent prodifferentiating factor in neuroblastoma. HBEGF mRNA expression is decreased in human neuroblastoma tumors compared with benign tumors, with loss correlating with decreased survival. HBEGF protein is expressed only in stromal compartments of human neuroblastoma specimens, with tissue from high-stage disease containing very little stroma or HBEGF expression. In 3 human neuroblastoma cell lines (SK-N-AS, SK-N-BE2, and SH-SY5Y), soluble HBEGF is sufficient to promote neuroblast differentiation and decrease proliferation. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans and heparin derivatives further enhance HBEGF-induced differentiation by forming a complex with the epidermal growth factor receptor, leading to activation of the ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways and up-regulation of the inhibitor of DNA binding transcription factor.

https://openalex.org/W2587726310,"The Turing instability in the reaction-diffusion system is a widely recognized mechanism of the morphogen gradient self-organization during the embryonic development. One of the essential conditions for such self-organization is sharp difference in the diffusion rates of the reacting substances (morphogens). In classical models this condition is satisfied only for significantly different values of diffusion coefficients which cannot hold for morphogens of similar molecular size. One of the most realistic explanations of the difference in diffusion rate is the difference between adsorption of morphogens to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Basing on this assumption we develop a novel mathematical model and demonstrate its effectiveness in describing several well-known examples of biological patterning. Our model consisting of three reaction-diffusion equations has the Turing-type instability and includes two elements with equal diffusivity and immobile binding sites as the third reaction substance. The model is an extension of the classical Gierer-Meinhardt two-components model and can be reduced to it under certain conditions. Incorporation of ECM in the model system allows us to validate the model for available experimental parameters. According to our model introduction of binding sites gradient, which is frequently observed in embryonic tissues, allows one to generate more types of different spatial patterns than can be obtained with two-components models. Thus, besides providing an essential condition for the Turing instability for the system of morphogen with close values of the diffusion coefficients, the morphogen adsorption on ECM may be important as a factor that increases the variability of self-organizing structures."

The aim of the study was to compare the usefulness of BSK-H (a commercial medium produced by HiMedia, India) and MKP medium. MKP and BSK-H media were prepared in accordance with the relevant protocols. Borrelia strains and skin culture biopsies were simultaneously inoculated into both media, incubated and checked for growth. Borrelial growth characteristics, isolation rates and characteristics of the isolated borreliae were analysed and compared. Initially, numbers of spirochaetes were higher in BSK-H than in MKP; however, in comparison with MKP, the strains subcultured in BSK-H medium were more frequently irregular, thin and non-motile, and rapidly died. In addition, the borrelial isolation rate from erythema migrans skin samples was higher in MKP than in BSK-H medium (108/171, 63.2% versus 70/171, 40.9%; p<0.0001). The far most frequently isolated species was Borrelia afzelii (92.9% and 97.2% strains isolated from BSK-H and MKP, respectively). Comparison of strains cultured from individual patients in both media showed differences in plasmid contents in 9/46 (19.6%) strain pairs, and protein profiles differed in 30/43 (69.8%) strain pairs, most often in the expression of OspC (in 27/28 patients OspC was expressed only in strains growing in MKP). BSK-H medium supports the growth of borrelial strains but MKP is superior with regard to the isolation rate, morphology and motility of strains. BSK-H medium supports fast initial growth of borreliae but this is followed by rapid deformation and death of the spirochaetes."

Design Data were collected from 18–59 year-old respondents to the French Gay Press surveys Enquêtes Presse Gay, conducted repeatedly between 1991 and 2011 (N = 32,196) using self-administered questionnaires distributed in gay magazines and over the internet. Methods Trends in unprotected anal intercourse (i.e. condomless anal sex) with casual partners of unknown or different HIV serostatus (hereafter “UAId” in this manuscript) were studied. Responses were analysed according to year and then reorganised for age-cohort analyses by generation, based on the year respondents turned 18. Results UAId rates fell from 1991 to 1997, and then rose from 13.4% in 1997 to 25.5% in 2011 among seronegative respondents, and from 24.8% to 63.3%, respectively, among seropositive respondents. Both in seropositive and seronegative respondents, UAId increased over time for all generations, indicative of a strong period effect. Conclusion Analyses of data from several generations of MSM who started their sexual lives at different time points in the HIV epidemic, revealed very similar trends in UAId between generations, among both seropositive and seronegative respondents. This strong period effect suggests that sexual behaviours in MSM are influenced more by contextual than generational factors. The fact that prevention practices are simultaneously observed in different generations and that there are most likely underlying prevention norms among MSM, suggests that PrEP could become widely accepted by all generations of MSM exposed to the risk of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2586329388,"Obesity-induced chronic inflammation is known to increase the risk of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and colorectal cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that leptin and insulin are key molecules linking obesity with diseases of the lower intestine. Here, we identified serum phenotype-associated genes in the colon of diet-induced obese mice as early biomarkers of obesity-associated colonic diseases. C57BL/6J mice were fed with either normal diet (ND, 15% of fat calories) or high-fat diet (HFD, 45% of fat calories) for 8 weeks. Serum concentrations of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), leptin, and adiponectin were measured as obesity-related phenotypic markers. Genome-wide gene expression profiles of colon tissue were determined, followed by statistical analyses to detect differentially expressed and serum phenotype-associated genes. HFD-fed mice showed higher serum concentrations of leptin (P < 0.001) and insulin (P < 0.01) than those in the ND group, whereas serum IGF-1 and adiponectin concentrations did not differ between the two dietary groups. Among differentially expressed genes affected by HFD, 135, 128, 110, and 341 genes were associated with serum levels of leptin, insulin, IGF-1, and adiponectin, respectively. We identified 17 leptin-associated genes and 4 insulin-associated genes that inversely responded to HFD and ND. Among these, leptin-associated Peli3 (Pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3), Creb1 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1), and Enpp2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2, autotaxin) and insulin-associated Centg1 (AGAP2, ArfGAP with GTPase domain) are reported to play a role either in obesity or colonic diseases. mRNA expression of these genes was validated by RT-qPCR. Our data suggest Peli3, Creb1, Enpp2, and Centg1 as potential early biomarker candidates for obesity-induced pathophysiological changes in the colon. Future studies verifying the function of these candidates are needed for the prevention, early detection, and treatment of colon diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2586996195,"Genetic interaction mapping is useful for understanding the molecular basis of cellular decision making, but elucidating interactions genome-wide is challenging due to the massive number of gene combinations that must be tested. Here, we demonstrate a simple approach to thoroughly map genetic interactions in bacteria using microfluidic-based single cell sequencing. Using single cell PCR in droplets, we link distinct genetic information into single DNA sequences that can be decoded by next generation sequencing. Our approach is scalable and theoretically enables the pooling of entire interaction libraries to interrogate multiple pairwise genetic interactions in a single culture. The speed, ease, and low-cost of our approach makes genetic interaction mapping viable for routine characterization, allowing the interaction network to be used as a universal read out for a variety of biology experiments, and for the elucidation of interaction networks in non-model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2586185217,"Reduced immune activation or immunosuppression is seen in patients withneurological diseases. Urinary and respiratory infections mainly manifested as septicemia and pneumonia are the most frequent complications following spinal cord injuries and they account for the majority of deaths. The underlying reason of these losses is believed to arise due to impaired immune responses to pathogens. Here, we hypothesized that susceptibility to infections of chronic spinal cord injured (SCI) patients might be due to impairment in recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns and subsequently declining innate and adaptive immune responses that lead to immune dysfunction. We tested our hypothesis on healthy and chronic SCI patients with a level of injury above T-6. Donor PBMCs were isolated and stimulated with different toll like receptor ligands and T-cell inducers aiming to investigate whether chronic SCI patients display differential immune activation to multiple innate and adaptive immune cell stimulants. We demonstrate that SCI patients' B-cell and plasmacytoid dendritic cells retain their functionality in response to TLR7 and TLR9 ligand stimulation as they secreted similar levels of IL6 and IFNα. The immune dysfunction is not probably due to impaired T-cell function, since neither CD4+ T-cell dependent IFNγ producing cell number nor IL10 producing regulatory T-cells resulted different outcomes in response to PMA-Ionomycin and PHA-LPS stimulation, respectively. We showed that TLR7 dependent IFNγ and IP10 levels and TLR9 mediated APC function reduced substantially in SCI patients compared to healthy subjects. More importantly, IP10 producing monocytes were significantly fewer compared to healthy subjects in response to TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation of SCI PBMCs. When taken together this work implicated that these defects could contribute to persistent complications due to increased susceptibility to infections of chronic SCI patients."
https://openalex.org/W2587000529,"Glycine receptors (GlyR) belong to the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) superfamily and mediate fast inhibitory transmission in the vertebrate CNS. Disruption of glycinergic transmission by inherited mutations produces startle disease in man. Many startle mutations are in GlyRs and provide useful clues to the function of the channel domains. E103K is one of few startle mutations found in the extracellular agonist binding site of the channel, in loop A of the principal side of the subunit interface. Homology modeling shows that the side chain of Glu-103 is close to that of Arg-131, in loop E of the complementary side of the binding site, and may form a salt bridge at the back of the binding site, constraining its size. We investigated this hypothesis in recombinant human α1 GlyR by site-directed mutagenesis and functional measurements of agonist efficacy and potency by whole cell patch clamp and single channel recording. Despite its position near the binding site, E103K causes hyperekplexia by impairing the efficacy of glycine, its ability to gate the channel once bound, which is very high in wild type GlyR. Mutating Glu-103 and Arg-131 caused various degrees of loss-of-function in the action of glycine, whereas mutations in Arg-131 enhanced the efficacy of the slightly bigger partial agonist sarcosine (N-methylglycine). The effects of the single charge-swapping mutations of these two residues were largely rescued in the double mutant, supporting the possibility that they interact via a salt bridge that normally constrains the efficacy of larger agonist molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2586356129,"The precise signaling mechanisms by which type II IFN receptors control expression of unique genes to induce biological responses remain to be established. We provide evidence that Sin1, a known element of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), is required for IFNγ-induced phosphorylation and activation of AKT and that such activation mediates downstream regulation of mTORC1 and its effectors. These events play important roles in the assembly of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) and mRNA translation of IFN-stimulated genes. Interestingly, IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is reduced in cells with targeted disruption of Sin1, leading to decreased transcription of several IFNγ-inducible genes in an mTORC2-independent manner. Additionally, our studies establish that Sin1 is essential for generation of type II IFN-dependent antiviral effects and antiproliferative responses in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Together, our findings establish an important role for Sin1 in both transcription and translation of IFN-stimulated genes and type II IFN-mediated biological responses, involving both mTORC2-dependent and -independent functions.

Because mTORC2 is a critical regulator of AKT, a kinase that is often activated in cancer cells and mediates survival signals, this mTOR complex has become a target for cancer therapy and has led to efforts to develop catalytic mTOR inhibitors that block the mTOR kinase (24Beauchamp E.M.

In efforts to map and define the roles of different mTORC2-driven elements in the induction of IFNγ responses, we evaluated the role of Sin1 in the IFNγ system. Our studies demonstrate that Sin1 is required for IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of AKT and that Sin1-mediated AKT activation mediates downstream regulation of mTORC1 effectors to control mRNA translation of ISGs. Remarkably, IFNγ-induced STAT1 activation and subsequent transcription of several ISGs is diminished in cells with targeted disruption of Sin1, demonstrating the existence of an mTORC2-independent function of Sin1 as a regulator of Jak-Stat pathways. In initial studies, we compared type II IFN-dependent mTORC2 phosphorylation of AKT in wild type (Sin1+/+) versus Sin1 knock-out (Sin1−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). IFNγ treatment induced phosphorylation of AKT on Thr-450, Ser-473, and Thr-308 in Sin1+/+ MEFs but not in Sin1−/− MEFs (Fig. 1, A–C, respectively), thus establishing a requirement for Sin1 in induction of AKT activity. This result is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that mTORC2 activation is required for phosphorylation of the turn motif in AKT on Thr-450 and of the hydrophobic motif on Ser-473 and that this phosphorylation is required for enabling PDK1 to phosphorylate AKT at Thr-308 (45Jacinto E.

Similarly, the absence of Sin1 resulted in decreased IFN-inducible phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2481 (Fig. 1D) and Ser-2448 (Fig. 1E), possibly reflecting reduced mTORC2 and mTORC1 catalytic activity, respectively (50Copp J. Manning G. Hunter T. TORC-specific phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR): phospho-Ser2481 is a marker for intact mTOR signaling complex 2.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The defective type II IFN-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR at Ser-2448, taken together with our previous findings implicating AKT upstream of mTORC1 in IFNγ signaling, led us to examine mTORC1 effectors in the type II IFN system. IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Thr-37/46 (Fig. 1F) and S6K on Thr-389 (Fig. 1G) was reduced in Sin1−/− MEFs compared with Sin1+/+ MEFs. As expected, IFNγ treatment resulted in induction of phosphorylation of the downstream effectors of S6K, rpS6, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) (Fig. 1, H and I), but these phosphorylation levels were decreased in Sin1−/− MEFs. We also examined whether transient knockdown of Sin1 by specific siRNA-mediated targeting in malignant hematopoietic cells also results in reduced type II IFN-dependent mTOR activity. IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, 4E-BP1, and S6K were impaired in U937 cells where Sin1 was selectively knocked down (Fig. 1, J–N), consistent with the findings in Sin1−/− MEFs. We subsequently sought to determine whether engagement of Sin1 in IFNγ signaling regulates expression of IFNγ-inducible proteins. For this purpose, Sin+/+ and Sin1−/− MEFs were incubated in the presence or absence of mouse IFNγ, and cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-IP10 and DAPK1 antibodies. The expression of IP10 (CXCL10), an IFN-induced chemokine that has diverse roles in infectious diseases and induces apoptosis and cell growth inhibition (51Liu M. Guo S. Stiles J.K. The emerging role of CXCL10 in cancer.Oncol. Lett. 2011; 2: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), was defective in Sin1−/− MEFs (Fig. 2A). We also examined whether Sin1 is required for the expression of DAPK1, a tumor suppressor protein (52Shiloh R. Bialik S. Kimchi A. The DAPK family: a structure-function analysis.Apoptosis. 2014; 19: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 53Gade P. Ramachandran G. Maachani U.B. Rizzo M.A. Okada T. Prywes R. Cross A.S.

However, the role of Nur77 in tumor microenvironment remains elusive. Results showed that deletion of Nur77 strikingly enhanced tumor metastasis compared to WT mice. Additionally, compared to the conditioned media derived from Nur77+/+ peritoneal macrophages (CM1), the conditioned media derived from Nur77-/- peritoneal macrophages (CM2) significantly promoted the EMT of cancer cells, and greatly enhanced the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells. Moreover, studies using TNF-α blocking antibody demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α was indispensable in supporting CM2-induced EMT to drive cancer cells migration and invasion. Furthermore, we found that Nur77 promoted the expression of CSF-1R, a novel downstream target gene of Nur77, and subsequently enhanced the migration of inflammatory cells. Notably, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the tumors of Nur77-/- mice was markedly abrogated compared to Nur77+/+ mice. Collectively, these results revealed that host Nur77 expression was pivotal in antitumor immune response, and in inhibiting tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2586944627,"Initial antimicrobial treatment of patients with deep seated or invasive infections is typically empiric. Usually, cultures of specimens obtained from the suspected source of infection are performed to identify pathogens and guide continued antimicrobial treatment. When patients present with signs and symptoms of infection, but sterile body fluid or tissue specimens cannot be obtained in a timely fashion, growth of bacterial pathogens in culture may be inhibited following initiation of empiric antibiotic treatment. To address this clinical dilemma, we performed a prospective evaluation of conventional culture vs. PCR coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on sterile body fluids and tissues submitted to the diagnostic microbiology lab following initiation of empiric antibiotic treatment for patients with suspected infection. In this series of surgical samples, PCR/ESI-MS identified bacterial pathogen(s) in 56% (49/87) of patients with non-diagnostic cultures. Examination of patients stratified by antibiotic treatment duration demonstrated that PCR/ESI-MS sustains high rates of bacterial DNA detection over time by generalized estimating equation models (p<0.0001)."

Strength index determination, ash content detection, FTIR characterization and SEM observation were performed on prepared handsheets. The results showed that with 0.6% Al2(SO4)3 and 0.2% carrageenan as additives, the tensile index increased by 13.53% and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) retention increased by 57.06%. With 0.6% Al2(SO4)3, 0.2% carrageenan and 0.03% CPAM as additives, PCC retention increased by 121% while the tensile index did not fall compared to handsheets without additives, indicating that carrageenan could enhance the strength of handsheets and be used as an anionic dry strength agent."
https://openalex.org/W2586239965,"Background Others have described a relationship between hemoglobin A levels and gestational age, gender and ethnicity. However, studies are needed to determine normal cut-off points considering these factors. To address this issue we designed a study to determine the percentiles of normality of neonatal hemoglobin A levels taking these factors into account. Methods This cross-sectional study involved 16,025 samples for sickle cell disease screening in the province of Alicante, Spain, which has a high immigration rate. The primary variable was hemoglobin A, and the secondary variables were gender, gestational age (preterm and full term) and maternal origin (Spain, the rest of Europe, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia). Percentiles of normality (1 and 99) were obtained by origin, gender and gestational age using quantile regression models and bootstrap samples. The association between these percentiles of normality and altered levels (≥1%) of hemoglobin E was analyzed. We obtained the percentiles of normality (1 and 99) for each maternal origin, gender and gestational age. Results Of a total of 88 possible E carriers, 65 had above-normal hemoglobin A levels (74%). The levels of normality for hemoglobin A varied greatly according to the maternal origin and gestational age. Conclusion With the levels of normality that we established it is possible to discard samples with unrecorded blood transfusions. Our methodology could be applied to other diseases in the neonatal screening."
https://openalex.org/W2587533032,"Southern right whales (SRWs, Eubalena australis) are polymorphic for an X-linked pigmentation pattern known as grey morphism. Most SRWs have completely black skin with white patches on their bellies and occasionally on their backs; these patches remain white as the whale ages. Grey morphs (previously referred to as partial albinos) appear mostly white at birth, with a splattering of rounded black marks; but as the whales age, the white skin gradually changes to a brownish grey color. The cellular and developmental bases of grey morphism are not understood. Here we describe cellular and ultrastructural features of grey-morph skin in relation to that of normal, wild-type skin. Melanocytes were identified histologically and counted, and melanosomes were measured using transmission electron microscopy. Grey-morph skin had fewer melanocytes when compared to wild-type skin, suggesting reduced melanocyte survival, migration, or proliferation in these whales. Grey-morph melanocytes had smaller melanosomes relative to wild-type skin, normal transport of melanosomes to surrounding keratinocytes, and normal localization of melanin granules above the keratinocyte nuclei. These findings indicate that SRW grey-morph pigmentation patterns are caused by reduced numbers of melanocytes in the skin, as well as by reduced amounts of melanin production and/or reduced sizes of mature melanosomes. Grey morphism is distinct from piebaldism and albinism found in other species, which are genetic pigmentation conditions resulting from the local absence of melanocytes, or the inability to synthesize melanin, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2586938135,"Environmental factors during childhood are thought to play a role in the aetiology of Crohn's Disease (CD). In South Africa, recently published work based on an investigation of 14 childhood environmental exposures during 3 age intervals (0-5, 6-10 and 11-18 years) has provided insight into the role of timing of exposure in the future development of CD. The 'overlapping' contribution of the investigated variables however, remains unclear. The aim of this study was to perform a post hoc analysis using this data and investigate the extent to which each variable contributes to the subsequent development of CD relative to each aforementioned age interval, based on a score analysis approach.Three methods were used for the score analysis. Two methods employed the subgrouping of one or more (similar) variables (methods A and B), with each subgroup assigned a score value weighting equal to one. For comparison, the third approach (method 0) involved no grouping of the 14 variables. Thus, each variable held a score value of one.Results of the score analysis (Method 0) for the environmental exposures during 3 age intervals (0-5, 6-10 and 11-18 years) revealed no significant difference between the case and control groups. By contrast, results from Method A and Method B revealed a significant difference during all 3 age intervals between the case and control groups, with cases having significantly lower exposure scores (approximately 30% and 40% lower, respectively).Results from the score analysis provide insight into the 'compound' effects from multiple environmental exposures in the aetiology of CD."
https://openalex.org/W2587028738,"A considerable amount of surplus nitrogen (N), which primarily takes the form of nitrate, accumulates in the soil profile after harvesting crops from an intensive production system in the North China Plain. The residual soil nitrate (RSN) is a key factor that is included in the N recommendation algorithm. Quantifying the utilization and losses of RSN is a fundamental necessity for optimizing crop N management, improving N use efficiency, and reducing the impact derived from farmland N losses on the environment. In this study, a 15N-labeling method was introduced to study the fate of the RSN quantitatively during the winter wheat growing season by 15N tracer technique combined with a soil column study. A soil column with a 2 m height was vertically divided into 10 20-cm layers, and the RSN in each layer was individually labeled with a 15N tracer before the wheat was sown. The results indicated that approximately 17.68% of the crop N derived from RSN was located in the 0-2 m soil profile prior to wheat sowing. The wheat recovery proportions of RSN at various layers ranged from 0.21% to 33.46%. The percentages that still remained in the soil profile after the wheat harvest ranged from 47.08% to 75.44%, and 19.46-32.64% of the RSN was unaccounted for. Upward and downward movements in the RSN were observed, and the maximum upward and downward distances were 40 cm and 100 cm, respectively. In general, the 15N-labeling method contributes to a deeper understanding of the fates of the RSN. Considering the low crop recovery of the RSN from deep soil layers, water and N saving practices should be adopted during crop production."
