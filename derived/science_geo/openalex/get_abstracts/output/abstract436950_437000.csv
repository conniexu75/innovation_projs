https://openalex.org/W2019865481,"Costs of Conservation In 2010, world governments agreed to a strategic plan for biodiversity conservation, including 20 targets to be met by 2020, through the Convention on Biological Diversity. Discussions on financing the plan have still not been resolved, partly because there is little information on the likely costs of meeting the targets. McCarthy et al. (p. 946 , published online 11 October) estimate the financial costs for two of the targets relating to protected areas and preventing extinctions. Using data from birds, they develop models that can be extrapolated to the costs for biodiversity more broadly. Reducing extinction risk for all species is estimated to require in the region of U.S. $4 billion annually, while the projected costs of establishing and maintaining protected areas may be as much as U.S. $58 billion—although both sums are small, relative to the economic costs of ecosystem losses."

https://openalex.org/W1963489221,"Push Me, Release, Pull You In eukaryotic cells, nearly all long-distance transport of cargos is carried out by the microtubule-based motors kinesin and dynein. These opposite-polarity motors move cargos bidirectionally so that they reach their cellular destinations with spatial and temporal specificity. To understand transport by motor ensembles, Derr et al. (p. 662 , published online 11 October; see the Persective by Diehl ) used a DNA scaffold for building an artificial cargo that could be programmed to bind different numbers and types of molecular motors with defined geometry. A cargo with multiple copies of the same motor was transported with minimal interference, suggesting that similar-polarity motors can coordinate without the need for additional cellular factors. However, ensembles of opposite-polarity motors frequently engaged in a sort of “tug of war,” which could only be resolved by releasing one motor from the microtubule track. Thus, within the cell, it is likely that regulation is required for bidirectional transport."
https://openalex.org/W2009908021,"Embryonic Cell Sorting and Movement Differential cell adhesion has long been thought to drive cell sorting. Maître et al. (p. 253 , published online 23 August) show that cell sorting in zebrafish gastrulation is triggered by differences in the ability of cells to modulate cortex tension at cell-cell contacts, thereby controlling contact expansion. Cell adhesion functions in this process by mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells at their contacts, allowing cortex tension to control contact expansion. In zebrafish epiboly the enveloping cell layer (EVL)—a surface epithelium formed at the animal pole of the gastrula—gradually spreads over the entire yolk cell to engulf it at the end of gastrulation. Behrndt et al. (p. 257 ) show that an actomyosin ring connected to the epithelial margin triggers EVL spreading both by contracting around its circumference and by generating a pulling force through resistance against retrograde actomyosin flow."

The silencing of TNFα in myeloid cells reduces NASH progression.Increase of TNFα-producing Kupffer cells is crucial for triggering NASH via monocyte recruitment.Myeloid cells-targeted silencing of TNFα might be a tenable therapeutic approach. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by lipid deposits within hepatocytes (steatosis), is associated with hepatic injury and inflammation and leads to the development of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma. However, the pathogenic mechanism of NASH is not well understood. To determine the role of distinct innate myeloid subsets in the development of NASH, we examined the contribution of liver resident macrophages (i.e. Kupffer cells) and blood-derived monocytes in triggering liver inflammation and hepatic damage. Employing a murine model of NASH, we discovered a previously unappreciated role for TNFα and Kupffer cells in the initiation and progression of NASH. Sequential depletion of Kupffer cells reduced the incidence of liver injury, steatosis, and proinflammatory monocyte infiltration. Furthermore, our data show a differential contribution of Kupffer cells and blood monocytes during the development of NASH; Kupffer cells increased their production of TNFα, followed by infiltration of CD11b(int)Ly6C(hi) monocytes, 2 and 10 days, respectively, after starting the methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Importantly, targeted knockdown of TNFα expression in myeloid cells decreased the incidence of NASH development by decreasing steatosis, liver damage, monocyte infiltration, and the production of inflammatory chemokines. Our findings suggest that the increase of TNFα-producing Kupffer cells in the liver is crucial for the early phase of NASH development by promoting blood monocyte infiltration through the production of IP-10 and MCP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2030243703,"There has been a long-standing quest to observe chemical reactions at low temperatures where reaction rates and pathways are governed by quantum mechanical effects. So far this field of Quantum Chemistry has been dominated by theory. The difficulty has been to realize in the laboratory low enough collisional velocities between neutral reactants, so that the quantum wave nature could be observed. We report here the first realization of merged neutral supersonic beams, and the observation of clear quantum effects in the resulting reactions. We observe orbiting resonances in the Penning ionization reaction of argon and molecular hydrogen with metastable helium leading to a sharp increase in the absolute reaction rate in the energy range corresponding to a few degrees kelvin down to 10 mK. Our method is widely applicable to many canonical chemical reactions, and will enable a breakthrough in the experimental study of Quantum Chemistry."

https://openalex.org/W2101675947,"Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is rate-limiting for the initial step of triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolysis, generating diacylglycerol (DAG) and fatty acids. DAG exists in three stereochemical isoforms. Here we show that ATGL exhibits a strong preference for the hydrolysis of long-chain fatty acid esters at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. The selectivity of ATGL broadens to the sn-1 position upon stimulation of the enzyme by its co-activator CGI-58. sn-1,3 DAG is the preferred substrate for the consecutive hydrolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase. Interestingly, diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase 2, present at the endoplasmic reticulum and on lipid droplets, preferentially esterifies sn-1,3 DAG. This suggests that ATGL and diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase 2 act coordinately in the hydrolysis/re-esterification cycle of TAGs on lipid droplets. Because ATGL preferentially generates sn-1,3 and sn-2,3, it suggests that TAG-derived DAG cannot directly enter phospholipid synthesis or activate protein kinase C without prior isomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2075281761,"A key process underlying an innate immune response to pathogens or cellular stress is activation of members of the NOD-like receptor family, such as NLRP3, to assemble caspase-1-activating inflammasome complexes. Activated caspase-1 processes proinflammatory cytokines into active forms that mediate inflammation. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is also associated with common diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and Alzheimer disease. However, the molecular details of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly are not established. The adaptor protein ASC plays a key role in inflammasome assembly. It is composed of an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain, which are protein interaction domains of the death fold superfamily. ASC interacts with NLRP3 via a homotypic PYD interaction and recruits procaspase-1 via a homotypic caspase recruitment domain interaction. Here we demonstrate that ASC PYD contains two distinct binding sites important for self-association and interaction with NLRP3 and the modulatory protein POP1. Modeling of the homodimeric ASC PYD complex formed via an asymmetric interaction using both sites resembles a type I interaction found in other death fold domain complexes. This interaction mode also permits assembly of ASC PYDs into filaments. Furthermore, a type I binding mode is likely conserved in interactions with NLRP3 and POP1, because residues critical for interaction of ASC PYD are conserved in these PYDs. We also demonstrate that ASC PYD can simultaneously self-associate and interact with NLRP3, rationalizing the model whereby ASC self-association upon recruitment to NLRP3 promotes clustering and activation of procaspase-1.

https://openalex.org/W2023373446,"Using a knock-in strategy to ablate a Cdk5-targeted serine phosphorylation site on residue 478 of the TrkB receptor, the authors demonstrate the role of this phosphorylation in activity-dependent functional and structural plasticity, as well as in learning and memory. They further show that TIAM1 and Rac1 act downstream of TrkB S478 phosphorylation during spine remodeling. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB participate in diverse neuronal functions, including activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that is crucial for learning and memory. On binding to BDNF, TrkB is not only autophosphorylated at tyrosine residues but also undergoes serine phosphorylation at S478 by the serine/threonine kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). However, the in vivo function of this serine phosphorylation remains unknown. We generated knock-in mice lacking this serine phosphorylation (TrkbS478A/S478A mice) and found that the TrkB phosphorylation–deficient mice displayed impaired spatial memory and compromised hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). S478 phosphorylation of TrkB regulates its interaction with the Rac1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor TIAM1, leading to activation of Rac1 and phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein during activity-dependent dendritic spine remodeling. These findings reveal the importance of Cdk5-mediated S478 phosphorylation of TrkB in activity-dependent structural plasticity, which is crucial for LTP and spatial memory formation."

https://openalex.org/W2068278990,"The endocycle is a variant cell cycle consisting of successive DNA synthesis and gap phases that yield highly polyploid cells. Although essential for metazoan development, relatively little is known about its control or physiologic role in mammals. Using lineage-specific cre mice we identified two opposing arms of the E2F program, one driven by canonical transcription activation (E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3) and the other by atypical repression (E2F7 and E2F8), that converge on the regulation of endocycles in vivo. Ablation of canonical activators in the two endocycling tissues of mammals, trophoblast giant cells in the placenta and hepatocytes in the liver, augmented genome ploidy, whereas ablation of atypical repressors diminished ploidy. These two antagonistic arms coordinate the expression of a unique G2/M transcriptional program that is critical for mitosis, karyokinesis and cytokinesis. These results provide in vivo evidence for a direct role of E2F family members in regulating non-traditional cell cycles in mammals. In mammals, polyploidy is only seen in liver hepatocytes and in trophoblast giant cells in the placenta. Leone and colleagues now show that ploidy is controlled in an antagonistic fashion by canonical E2F transcriptional activators and atypical E2F7 and E2F8 repressors, through the control of G2/M-associated genes."
https://openalex.org/W2068989744,"The yeast Orm1/2 proteins regulate ceramide biosynthesis.Depletion of the mammalian Orm1/2 homologues, ORMDL1-3, eliminates the negative feedback of exogenous ceramide on ceramide biosynthesis in HeLa cells.ORMDL proteins are the primary regulators of ceramide biosynthesis in mammalian cells.Therapeutically manipulating levels of the pro-death lipid, ceramide, requires a molecular understanding of its regulation. The mammalian ORMDL proteins are orthologues of the yeast Orm proteins (Orm1/2), which are regulators of ceramide biosynthesis. In mammalian cells, ceramide is a proapoptotic signaling sphingolipid, but it is also an obligate precursor to essential higher order sphingolipids. Therefore levels of ceramide are expected to be tightly controlled. We tested the three ORMDL isoforms for their role in homeostatically regulating ceramide biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Treatment of cells with a short chain (C6) ceramide or sphingosine resulted in a dramatic inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis. This inhibition was almost completely eliminated by ORMDL knockdown. This establishes that the ORMDL proteins mediate the feedback regulation of ceramide biosynthesis in mammalian cells. The ORMDL proteins are functionally redundant. Knockdown of all three isoforms simultaneously was required to alleviate the sphingolipid-mediated inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis. The lipid sensed by the ORMDL-mediated feedback mechanism is medium or long chain ceramide or a higher order sphingolipid. Treatment of permeabilized cells with C6-ceramide resulted in ORMDL-mediated inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase. This indicates that C6-ceramide inhibition requires only membrane-bound elements and does not involve diffusible proteins or small molecules. We also tested the atypical sphingomyelin synthase isoform, SMSr, for its role in the regulation of ceramide biosynthesis. This unusual enzyme has been reported to regulate ceramide levels in the endoplasmic reticulum. We were unable to detect a role for SMSr in regulating ceramide biosynthesis. We suggest that the role of SMSr may be in the regulation of downstream metabolism of ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W2012195444,"Plants are particularly prone to photo-oxidative damage caused by excess light. Photoprotection is essential for photosynthesis to proceed in oxygenic environments either by scavenging harmful reactive intermediates or preventing their accumulation to avoid photoinhibition. Carotenoids play a key role in protecting photosynthesis from the toxic effect of over-excitation; under excess light conditions, plants accumulate a specific carotenoid, zeaxanthin, that was shown to increase photoprotection. In this work we genetically dissected different components of zeaxanthin-dependent photoprotection. By using time-resolved differential spectroscopy in vivo, we identified a zeaxanthin-dependent optical signal characterized by a red shift in the carotenoid peak of the triplet-minus-singlet spectrum of leaves and pigment-binding proteins. By fractionating thylakoids into their component pigment binding complexes, the signal was found to originate from the monomeric Lhcb4-6 antenna components of Photosystem II and the Lhca1-4 subunits of Photosystem I. By analyzing mutants based on their sensitivity to excess light, the red-shifted triplet-minus-singlet signal was tightly correlated with photoprotection in the chloroplasts, suggesting the signal implies an increased efficiency of zeaxanthin in controlling chlorophyll triplet formation. Fluorescence-detected magnetic resonance analysis showed a decrease in the amplitude of signals assigned to chlorophyll triplets belonging to the monomeric antenna complexes of Photosystem II upon zeaxanthin binding; however, the amplitude of carotenoid triplet signal does not increase correspondingly. Results show that the high light-induced binding of zeaxanthin to specific proteins plays a major role in enhancing photoprotection by modulating the yield of potentially dangerous chlorophyll-excited states in vivo and preventing the production of singlet oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2023169579,"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) often express the oncoprotein NPM-ALK. This study shows that the activator protein 1 family members JUN and JUNB promote lymphoma development through platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB). Inhibition of PDGFRB prolonged survival of NPM-ALK transgenic mice and increased the efficacy of an ALK-specific inhibitor against transplanted NPM-ALK tumors. Inhibition of PDGFR in a patient with ALCL also resulted in rapid, complete and sustained remission. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma found in children and young adults. ALCLs frequently carry a chromosomal translocation that results in expression of the oncoprotein nucleophosmin–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK). The key molecular downstream events required for NPM-ALK–triggered lymphoma growth have been only partly unveiled. Here we show that the activator protein 1 family members JUN and JUNB promote lymphoma development and tumor dissemination through transcriptional regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB) in a mouse model of NPM-ALK–triggered lymphomagenesis. Therapeutic inhibition of PDGFRB markedly prolonged survival of NPM-ALK transgenic mice and increased the efficacy of an ALK-specific inhibitor in transplanted NPM-ALK tumors. Notably, inhibition of PDGFRA and PDGFRB in a patient with refractory late-stage NPM-ALK+ ALCL resulted in rapid, complete and sustained remission. Together, our data identify PDGFRB as a previously unknown JUN and JUNB target that could be a highly effective therapy for ALCL."
https://openalex.org/W2037404289,"Free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3 (FFA2 and FFA3) are G protein-coupled receptors for short chain free fatty acids (SCFAs). They respond to the same set of endogenous ligands but with distinct rank-order of potency such that acetate (C2) has been described as FFA2-selective, whereas propionate (C3) is non-selective. Although C2 was confirmed to be selective for human FFA2 over FFA3, this ligand was not selective between the mouse orthologs. Moreover, although C3 was indeed not selective between the human orthologs, it displayed clear selectivity for mouse FFA3 over mouse FFA2. This altered selectivity to C2 and C3 resulted from broad differences in SCFAs potency at the mouse orthologs. In studies to define the molecular basis for these observations, marked variation in ligand-independent constitutive activity was identified using a [(35)S]GTPγS assay. The orthologs with higher potency for the SCFAs, human FFA2 and mouse FFA3, displayed high constitutive activity in this assay, whereas the orthologs with lower potency for the agonist ligands, mouse FFA2 and human FFA3, did not. Sequence alignments of the second extracellular loop identified single negatively charged residues in FFA2 and FFA3 not conserved between species and predicted to form ionic lock interactions with arginine residues within the FFA2 or FFA3 agonist binding pocket to regulate constitutive activity and SCFA potency. Reciprocal mutation of these residues between species orthologs resulted in the induction (or repression) of constitutive activity and in most cases also yielded corresponding changes in SCFA potency."
https://openalex.org/W1972286147,"Allergic asthma is a complex disease characterized by eosinophilic pulmonary inflammation, mucus production and reversible airway obstruction. Exposure to indoor allergens is a risk factor for asthma, but this disease is also associated with high household levels of total and particularly Gram-negative bacteria. The ability of bacterial products to act as adjuvants suggests they might promote asthma by priming allergic sensitization to inhaled allergens. In support of this idea, house dust extracts (HDEs) can activate antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and promote allergic sensitization to inhaled innocuous proteins in vivo. It is unknown which microbial products provide most of the adjuvant activity in HDEs. A screen for adjuvant activity of microbial products revealed that the bacterial protein flagellin (FLA) stimulated strong allergic airway responses to an innocuous inhaled protein, ovalbumin (OVA). Moreover, Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), the mammalian receptor for FLA, was required for priming strong allergic responses to natural indoor allergens present in HDEs. In addition, individuals with asthma have higher serum levels of FLA-specific antibodies as compared to nonasthmatic individuals. Together, these findings suggest that household FLA promotes the development of allergic asthma by TLR5-dependent priming of allergic responses to indoor allergens."

Grabovskij et al. (p. 232 ) used mechanical strain to control the splitting between the energy levels of TLSs formed in the disordered barrier of the Josephson junction in a superconducting qubit. For some of the detected TLSs, the splitting exhibited the predicted minimum as a function of strain, verifying the TLS model of disordered solids."

Manuscript flows among journals revealed a modular submission network, with high-impact journals preferentially attracting submissions. However, about 75% of published articles were submitted first to the journal that would publish them, and high-impact journals published proportionally more articles that had been resubmitted from another journal.

Abnormal function of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is believed to contribute to the deficits in these processes that are observed in many neuropsychiatric diseases. The orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR88 is robustly expressed in MSNs and is regulated by neuropharmacological drugs, but its contribution to MSN physiology and behavior is unclear. We found that, in the absence of GPR88, MSNs showed increased glutamatergic excitation and reduced GABAergic inhibition, which promoted enhanced firing rates in vivo, resulting in hyperactivity, poor motor coordination and impaired cue-based learning in mice. Targeted viral expression of GPR88 in MSNs rescued the molecular and electrophysiological properties and normalized behavior, suggesting that aberrant MSN activation in the absence of GPR88 underlies behavioral deficits and its dysfunction may contribute to behaviors observed in neuropsychiatric disease."
https://openalex.org/W1963821042,"Mammalian ferritin is predominantly in the cytosol, with a minor portion found in plasma. In most insects, including Drosophila melanogaster, ferritin belongs to the secretory type. The functional role of secretory ferritin in iron homeostasis remains poorly understood in insects as well as in mammalians. Here we used Drosophila to dissect the involvement of ferritin in insect iron metabolism. Midgut-specific knockdown of ferritin resulted in iron accumulation in the gut but systemic iron deficiency (37% control), accompanied by retarded development and reduced survival (3% survival), and was rescued by dietary iron supplementation (50% survival) or exacerbated by iron depletion (0% survival). These results suggest an essential role of ferritin in removing iron from enterocytes across the basolateral membrane. Expression of wild-type ferritin in the midgut, especially in the iron cell region, could significantly rescue ferritin-null mutants (first-instar larvae rescued up to early adults), indicating iron deficiency as the major cause of early death for ferritin flies. In many nonintestinal tissues, tissue-specific ferritin knockdown also caused local iron accumulation (100% increase) and resulted in severe tissue damage, as evidenced by cell loss. Overall, our study demonstrated Drosophila ferritin is essential to two key aspects of iron homeostasis: dietary iron absorption and tissue iron detoxification."

Adamalysin-like metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS-5) is a major aggrecan-degrading enzyme in cartilage, but there is no clear correlation between ADAMTS-5 mRNA levels and OA progression. Here, we report that post-translational endocytosis of ADAMTS-5 by chondrocytes regulates its extracellular activity. We found 2- to 3-fold reduced aggrecanase activity when ADAMTS-5 was incubated with live porcine cartilage, resulting from its rapid endocytic clearance. Studies using receptor-associated protein (RAP), a ligand-binding antagonist for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRPs), and siRNA-mediated gene silencing revealed that the receptor responsible for ADAMTS-5 clearance is LRP-1. Domain-deletion mutagenesis of ADAMTS-5 identified that the noncatalytic first thrombospondin and spacer domains mediate its endocytosis. The addition of RAP to porcine cartilage explants in culture increased the basal level of aggrecan degradation, as well as ADAMTS-5-induced aggrecan degradation. Notably, LRP-1-mediated endocytosis of ADAMTS-5 is impaired in chondrocytes of OA cartilage, with ∼90% reduction in protein levels of LRP-1 without changes in its mRNA levels. Thus, LRP-1 dictates physiological and pathological catabolism of aggrecan in cartilage as a key modulator of the extracellular activity of ADAMTS-5."

Unlike most other asteroids, which are fragments of once larger bodies, Vesta is thought to have survived as a protoplanet since its formation at the beginning of the solar system (see the Perspective by Binzel , published online 20 September). Based on data obtained with the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector aboard the Dawn spacecraft, Prettyman et al.

Observations of pitted terrain on Vesta obtained by Dawn's Framing Camera and analyzed by Denevi et al.

Melting of surrounding rocks as the magma rises likely withdraws material and causes the subsidence."

Their motifs are similar to the outcomes of physical processes generic to condensed, chemically excitable, viscoelastic materials, although the embryonic mechanisms that generate them are typically much more complex.

Punctate PPKs are characterized by circumscribed hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles with considerable heterogeneity. In 18 families with autosomal dominant punctate PPK, we report heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in AAGAB, encoding α- and γ-adaptin-binding protein p34, located at a previously linked locus at 15q22. α- and γ-adaptin-binding protein p34, a cytosolic protein with a Rab-like GTPase domain, was shown to bind both clathrin adaptor protein complexes, indicating a role in membrane trafficking. Ultrastructurally, lesional epidermis showed abnormalities in intracellular vesicle biology. Immunohistochemistry showed hyperproliferation within the punctate lesions. Knockdown of AAGAB in keratinocytes led to increased cell division, which was linked to greatly elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation. We hypothesize that p34 deficiency may impair endocytic recycling of growth factor receptors such as EGFR, leading to increased signaling and cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2025505237,"Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Hxk2 induced by glucose levels has been reported recently. Here we present evidence that indicates that Hxk2 nucleocytoplasmic traffic is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at serine 14. Moreover, we identified the protein kinase Snf1 and the protein phosphatase Glc7-Reg1 as novel regulatory partners for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Hxk2. Functional studies revealed that, in contrast to the wild-type protein, the dephosphorylation-mimicking mutant of Hxk2 retains its nuclear localization in low glucose conditions, and the phosphomimetic mutant of Hxk2 retains its cytoplasmic localization in high glucose conditions. Interaction experiments of Hxk2 with Kap60 and Xpo1 indicated that nuclear import of the S14D mutant of Hxk2 is severely decreased but that the export is significantly enhanced. Conversely, nuclear import of the S14A mutant of Hxk2 was significantly enhanced, although the export was severely decreased. The interaction of Hxk2 with Kap60 and Xpo1 was found to occur in the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states of the protein, respectively. In addition, we found that Hxk2 is a substrate for Snf1. Mutational analysis indicated that serine 14 is a major in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation site for Snf1. We also provide evidence that dephosphorylation of Hxk2 at serine 14 is a protein phosphatase Glc7-Reg1-dependent process. Taken together, this study establishes a functional link between Hxk2, Reg1, and Snf1 signaling, which involves the regulation of Hxk2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of serine 14."
https://openalex.org/W1576177409,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) tone is regulated by the state of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which is in turn regulated by the balance between MLC kinase and MLC phosphatase (MLCP) activities. RhoA activates Rho kinase, which phosphorylates the regulatory subunit of MLC phosphatase, thereby inhibiting MLC phosphatase activity and increasing contraction and vascular tone. Nitric oxide is an important mediator of VSMC relaxation and vasodilation, which acts by increasing cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels in VSMC, thereby activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα (PKGIα). PKGI is known to phosphorylate Rho kinase, preventing Rho-mediated inhibition of MLC phosphatase, promoting vasorelaxation, although the molecular mechanisms that mediate this are unclear. Here we identify RhoA as a target of activated PKGIα and show further that PKGIα binds directly to RhoA, inhibiting its activation and translocation. In protein pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments, binding of RhoA and PKGIα was demonstrated via a direct interaction between the amino terminus of RhoA (residues 1-44), containing the switch I domain of RhoA, and the amino terminus of PKGIα (residues 1-59), which includes a leucine zipper heptad repeat motif. Affinity assays using cGMP-immobilized agarose showed that only activated PKGIα binds RhoA, and a leucine zipper mutant PKGIα was unable to bind RhoA even if activated. Furthermore, a catalytically inactive mutant of PKGIα bound RhoA but did not prevent RhoA activation and translocation. Collectively, these results support that RhoA is a PKGIα target and that direct binding of activated PKGIα to RhoA is central to cGMP-mediated inhibition of the VSMC Rho kinase contractile pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2033509933,"Gα-interacting vesicle-associated protein (GIV) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that modulates key signaling pathways during a diverse set of biological processes, e.g. wound healing, macrophage chemotaxis, tumor angiogenesis, vascular repair, and cancer invasion/metastasis. We recently demonstrated that GIV is a metastasis-related protein, which serves both as a therapeutic target and as a biomarker for prognostication in cancer patients. Here we report the discovery that GIV is a direct target of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), which is commonly known as a central regulator of tumor metastasis. We identified a single STAT3-binding site on the GIV promoter that was necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activation of GIV during wound healing and cancer invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast carcinomas showed significant correlation between STAT3 activation and elevated GIV expression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that GIV positively autoregulates its own transcription by enhancing STAT3 activation via its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how STAT3 activation is directly integrated with the receptor tyrosine kinase-GIV-G protein signaling axis. The forward feedback regulation we describe here between GIV and STAT3 may have profound therapeutic implications for cancer and epithelial regeneration/repair and could help invent novel approaches in treating and prognosticating cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2058383984,"Phototropin (phot) is a light-regulated protein kinase that mediates a variety of photoresponses in plants, such as phototropism, chloroplast positioning, and stomata opening. Arabidopsis has two homologues, phot1 and phot2, that share physiological functions depending on light intensity. A phot molecule has two photoreceptive light oxygen voltage-sensing domains, LOV1 and LOV2, and a Ser/Thr kinase domain. The LOV domains undergo a photocycle upon blue light (BL) stimulation, including transient adduct formation between the chromophore and a conserved cysteine (S390 intermediate) that leads to activation of the kinase. To uncover the mechanism underlying the photoactivation of the kinase, we have introduced a kinase assay system composed of a phot1 LOV2-linker-kinase polypeptide as a light-regulated kinase and its N-terminal polypeptide as an artificial substrate (Okajima, K., Matsuoka, D., and Tokutomi, S. (2011) LOV2-linker-kinase phosphorylates LOV1-containing N-terminal polypeptide substrate via photoreaction of LOV2 in Arabidopsis phototropin1. FEBS Lett. 585, 3391-3395). In the present study, we extended the assay system to phot2 and compared the photochemistry and kinase activation by BL between phot1 and phot2 to gain insight into the molecular basis for the different photosensitivities of phot1 and phot2. Photosensitivity of kinase activation by BL and the lifetime of S390 of phot1 were 10 times higher and longer, respectively, than those of phot2. This correlation was confirmed by an amino acid substitution experiment with phot1 to shorten the lifetime of S390. The present results demonstrated that the photosensitivity of kinase activation in phot involves the lifetime of S390 in LOV2, suggesting that the lifetime is one of the key factors for the different photosensitivities observed for phot1 and phot2."

The mechanism of sugar uptake by enterobacterial channels, such as Escherichia coli LamB (maltoporin), has been characterized in great detail. In pseudomonads and related organisms, sugar uptake is not mediated by LamB but by OprB channels. Beyond the notion that OprB channels seem to prefer monosaccharides as substrates, very little is known about OprB-mediated sugar uptake. Here I report the X-ray crystal structure of an OprB channel from Pseudomonas putida F1. The structure shows that OprB forms a monomeric, 16-stranded β-barrel with a constriction formed by extracellular loops L2 and L3. The side chains of two highly conserved arginine residues (Arg83 and Arg110) and a conserved glutamate (Glu106) line the channel constriction and interact with a bound glucose molecule. Liposome swelling uptake assays show a strong preference for monosaccharide transport over disaccharides. Moreover, substrates with a net negative charge are disfavored by the channel, probably due to the negatively charged character of the constriction. The architecture of the eyelet and the absence of a greasy slide provide an explanation for the observed specificity of OprB for monosaccharides rather than the oligosaccharides preferred by LamB and related enterobacterial channels.

https://openalex.org/W2004589561,"Neuritin is a new neurotrophic factor discovered in a screen to identify genes involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Neuritin also plays multiple roles in the process of neural development and synaptic plasticity. The receptors for binding neuritin and its downstream signaling effectors, however, remain unclear. Here, we report that neuritin specifically increases the densities of transient outward K(+) currents (I(A)) in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Neuritin-induced amplification of I(A) is mediated by increased mRNA and protein expression of Kv4.2, the main α-subunit of I(A). Exposure of CGNs to neuritin markedly induces phosphorylation of ERK (pERK), Akt (pAkt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (pmTOR). Neuritin-induced I(A) and increased expression of Kv4.2 are attenuated by ERK, Akt, or mTOR inhibitors. Unexpectedly, pharmacological blockade of insulin receptor, but not the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, abrogates the effect of neuritin on I(A) amplification and Kv4.2 induction. Indeed, neuritin activates downstream signaling effectors of the insulin receptor in CGNs and HeLa. Our data reveal, for the first time, an unanticipated role of the insulin receptor in previously unrecognized neuritin-mediated signaling."

However, the roles of SFKs in G protein-coupled receptor-mediated platelet activation and the molecular mechanisms whereby SFKs are activated by G protein-coupled receptor stimulation are not fully understood. Here we show that the thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor 4 agonist peptide AYPGKF elicited SFK phosphorylation in P2Y12 deficient platelets but stimulated minimal SFK phosphorylation in platelets lacking Gq. We have previously shown that thrombin-induced SFK phosphorylation was inhibited by the calcium chelator 5,5′-dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (dimethyl-BAPTA). The calcium ionophore A23187 induced SFK phosphorylation in both wild-type and Gq deficient platelets. Together, these results indicate that SFK phosphorylation in response to thrombin receptor stimulation is downstream from Gq/Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, A23187-induced thromboxane A2 synthesis, platelet aggregation, and secretion were inhibited by preincubation of platelets with a selective SFK inhibitor, PP2. AYPGKF-induced thromboxane A2 production in wild-type and P2Y12 deficient platelets was abolished by PP2, and AYPGKF-mediated P-selectin expression, integrin αIIbβ3 activation, and aggregation of P2Y12 deficient platelets were partially inhibited by the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220, PP2, dimethyl-BAPTA, or LY294002, but were abolished by Ro-31-8220 plus PP2, dimethyl-BAPTA, or LY294002.

https://openalex.org/W2081940606,"Rad9 as part of the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex is known to participate in cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA repair. However, Rad9 can act as a sequence-specific transcription factor, modulating expression of a number of genes. Importantly, Rad9 is up-regulated in prostate cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. Its expression correlates positively with advanced stage tumors and its down-regulation reduces tumor burden in mice. We show here that transient down-regulation of Rad9 by RNA interference reduces DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival in vitro. In addition, transient or stable down-regulation of Rad9 impairs migration and invasion of the cells. Moreover, stable reduction of Rad9 renders DU145 cell growth anchorage-dependent. It also decreases expression of integrin β1 protein and sensitizes DU145 and LNCaP cells to anoikis and impairs Akt activation. On the other hand, stable expression of Mrad9, the mouse homolog, in DU145/shRNA Rad9 cells restores migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth, integrin β1 expression, and anoikis resistance with a concomitant elevation of Akt activation. We thus demonstrate for the first time that Rad9 contributes to prostate tumorigenesis by increasing not only tumor proliferation and survival but also tumor migration and invasion, anoikis resistance, and anchorage-independent growth.

Prostate cancer is the most prevalent non-cutaneous type of cancer in men (1.Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Molecular genetics of prostate cancer. New prospects for old challenges.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1967-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Despite successes in treating localized primary prostate tumors, metastatic prostate cancer poses a real challenge and remains essentially incurable. As in most types of solid cancers, metastasis is the major morbidity and mortality factor for patients with prostate cancer. During progression to metastasis, tumor cells acquire multiple traits, including detachment from the extracellular matrix, anoikis resistance, migration and invasion through the basement membrane, intravasation to blood and lymphatic vessels, extravasation from the circulation to distant sites, the ability to stimulate angiogenesis, and, finally, formation of macroscopic metastases (2.Valastyan S. Weinberg R.A. Tumor metastasis. Molecular insights and evolving paradigms.Cell. 2011; 147: 275-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). An integral part of the metastatic process is the integrins. These molecules are heterodimeric αβ transmembrane receptors that connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton (3.Hynes R.O. Integrins. Bidirectional, allosteric signaling machines.Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6870) Google Scholar) and play important roles in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance (4.Margadant C. Monsuur H.N. Norman J.C. Sonnenberg A. Mechanisms of integrin activation and trafficking.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In particular, β1 integrin (ITGB1) is known to confer higher survival and metastatic capacity to a number of cancer cells, including those of prostate origin (5.Hood J.D. Cheresh D.A. Role of integrins in cell invasion and migration.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar, 6.Zeng Z.Z. Jia Y. Hahn N.J. Markwart S.M. Rockwood K.F. Livant D.L.

Integrin β1 is crucial for insulin-like growth factor I receptor-mediated prostate cancer cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth (7.Goel H.L. Breen M. Zhang J. Das I. Aznavoorian-Cheshire S. Greenberg N.M. Elgavish A. Languino L.R. β1A integrin expression is required for type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor mitogenic and transforming activities and localization to focal contacts.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6692-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt is a downstream effector of PI3K and an important regulator of various cellular functions including cell metabolism, transcription, survival, and proliferation (8.Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. AKT/PKB signaling. Navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4710) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the Akt kinase signaling pathway is frequently observed in prostate cancer. Akt is activated by phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 in response to mitogenic stimulation as well as by integrin attachment to the extracellular matrix (9.Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Advances in protein kinase B signalling. AKTion on multiple fronts.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Cancer cells rely heavily on active Akt to survive from a number of insults such as genotoxic stress, growth factor depletion, and anoikis, a form of apoptotic cell death when cells lose contact with the extracellular matrix (10.Sakamoto S. Kyprianou N. Targeting anoikis resistance in prostate cancer metastasis.Mol. Aspects Med. 2010; 31 (26.): 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Rad9 is a protein with an established role in the DNA damage response and DNA repair. As part of the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex, it acts as a sensor of DNA damage that enables ATR kinase, independently recruited to the site of damage, to phosphorylate and activate its downstream effector Chk1 (11.Lieberman H.B. Bernstock J.D. Broustas C.G. Hopkins K.M. Leloup C. Zhu A. The role of RAD9 in tumorigenesis.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 3: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, Rad9 can interact with several other proteins outside the context of the 9-1-1 complex and checkpoint functions (12.Broustas C.G. Lieberman H.B. Contributions of RAD9 to tumorigenesis.J. Cell Biochem. 2012; 113: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rad9 can act independently of its partners Hus1 and Rad1 to transactivate a number of genes including p21waf1/cip1 (13.Yin Y. Zhu A. Jin Y.J. Liu Y.X. Zhang X. Hopkins K.M. Lieberman H.B. Human RAD9 checkpoint control/proapoptotic protein can activate transcription of p21.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8864-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Aberrant Rad9 expression has been associated with prostate, breast, lung, skin, thyroid, and gastric cancers (12.Broustas C.G. Lieberman H.B. Contributions of RAD9 to tumorigenesis.J. Cell Biochem. 2012; 113: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Rad9 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer specimens as well as prostate cancer cell lines (14.Zhu A. Zhang C.X. Lieberman H.B. Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Experiments designed to assess the contribution of Rad9 to prostate tumor growth revealed that down-regulation of Rad9 in PC3 and DU145 human tumor cell line xenografts impairs growth in nude mice. Importantly, ectopic expression of Rad9 in an immortalized, nontumorigenic, prostate cell line (PWR-1E) conferred upon them the ability to form aberrant growths in mice (14.Zhu A. Zhang C.X. Lieberman H.B. Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of normal and tumor prostate specimens showed that Rad9 expression increased along with cancer progression stages, suggesting a role for Rad9 in prostate malignant progression (14.Zhu A. Zhang C.X. Lieberman H.B. Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was two-fold: to assess the effect of Rad9 down-regulation on prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival and to investigate the impact of Rad9 down-regulation on three cellular biological traits related to metastasis (migration, invasion, and anoikis sensitivity). In this report, we propose that Rad9 may influence cell migration and invasion by controlling the abundance of integrin β1, anoikis resistance, and activation of Akt. Prostate cancer cell lines DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Cellgro). NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ITGB1 cDNA was generated by mRNA extracted from DU145 cells and reverse-transcribed with a SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified by PCR human ITGB1 gene (X07979) primers: forward, 5′-GGTACTGGATCCATGAATTTACAACCAATTTTCTGGA-3′ (BamHI underlined) and reverse, 5′-GTAGACTCGAGTCATTTTCCCTCATACTTCGGATTGA-3′ (XhoI underlined). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing and extension at 68 °C for 4 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR-amplified product was ligated into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The mouse Rad9 construct was made by inserting the mouse Rad9 ORF into the HindIII/NotI restriction sites of the pZeoSV2(+) vector (Invitrogen). The ORF was amplified using the following PCR primers: forward, 5′-TCGGTGAAGCTTACAATGAAGTGCCTGATCAC-3′ (HindIII underlined) and reverse, 5′-TTTAGAGCGGCCGCTCACCCTTCACCATCACTGTCTT-3′ (NotI underlined). For stable clones, the plasmid was transfected into DU145/shRad9 clone #2 using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml zeocin, and stable Mrad9 clones were selected 2 weeks later. Cells were routinely cultured in 100 μg/ml zeocin and 1 μg/ml puromycin. The pSUPER.retro.puro Rad9 shRNA expression vector (Oligoengine, Inc.) and viral production have been described previously (14.Zhu A. Zhang C.X. Lieberman H.B. Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Rad9 protein was assessed by Western blotting with Rad9 antibodies. The clones with the greatest reduction in Rad9 expression were used for further studies. For transient transfection experiments, the following siRNA were used: 50 nm siRad9#1, 5′-AGGCCCGCCAUCUUCACCA-3′ (sense); 25 nm siRad9#3, 5′- GUCUUUCCUGUCUGUCUUC-3′ (sense) and a commercial siRad9#2 (Ambion) at 12.5 nm; 50 nm of siLuc (luciferase control) 5′-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA-3′ (sense); and 30 nm ITGB1 siRNA 5′-AAUGUAACCAACCGUAGCA-3′ (sense). Cells at ∼30% confluence were transfected with the indicated siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and protein abundance was tested 48–72 h later. Expression levels of ITGB1 mRNA were quantified relative to control GAPDH mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. Cells were grown to ∼70% confluence, washed once with PBS, and then total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primer following the protocol of the manufacturer. Subsequently, samples were subjected to quantitative PCR in an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using Power SYBR Green PCR MasterMix, a cDNA template, and the following primers: for ITGB1, 5′-CCTACTTCTGCACGATGTGATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTTTGCTACGGTTGGTTACATT-3′ (reverse) and GAPDH, 5′-CATCTCTGCCCCCTCTGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCTCCGACGCCTGCTTCAC-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were analyzed on a 3% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. ITGB1 protein stability was assessed by incubating cells with either 50 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for the indicated times. The proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) was added to the cells at 10 μm and incubated for 4 h. Cells were lysed at the end of the incubation in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein levels were measured by Western blotting. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Fixed cells were subsequently washed in PBS once and incubated with propidium iodide/RNase staining buffer (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. Flow cytometry was performed by a FACScalibur with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To determine proliferation, cells were seeded on 6-well plates and counted at the indicated intervals with a hemocytometer. To assess clonogenic survival, cells were transiently transfected with 100 nm siRNA against Rad9 or luciferase (control), and 72 h after transfection they were trypsinized, counted, and added in triplicate to 10-cm culture dishes containing complete medium. After 14 days in culture, cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 15 min and stained with Giemsa for 30 min. Colonies containing at least 50 cells were scored. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Images were acquired with an Olympus BH-2 microscope and Olympus MicroSuite FIVE imaging software. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (4 × 104 cells/well) coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml, BD Biosciences). After a 30-min period, attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The stain was recovered by extracting with 10% acetic acid, and optical density was measured at 595 nm. Migration and invasion assays were performed using 6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm-pore-size, transwell membrane filter inserts in a 24-well tissue culture plate. For the migration assay, 40,000 cells in 150 μl of RPMI + 0.1% BSA were added to each top chamber, and the bottom chamber was filled with 500 μl of complete medium containing 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. The migration assay was performed at 37 °C for 6 h. Nonmigratory cells at the upper membrane surface were removed with several cotton swabs, and the migratory cells at the bottom of the membrane were stained with crystal violet (0.1% crystal violet in 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 9) and 20% ethanol) for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing extensively with deionized water, the stain was extracted with 10% acetic acid, and optical density was measured at 595 nm. Haptotactic migration toward fibronectin was assayed by coating the lower side of the Boyden chamber with 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin. Cells were resuspended in serum-free RPMI containing 0.1% BSA, and 40,000 cells were added to each insert. Serum-free RPMI containing 0.1% BSA was added to the bottom wells. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were treated as described above. An invasion assay was performed under the same conditions as the migration assay, with the exception that 200 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) diluted 1:3 with RPMI + 0.1% BSA, supplemented with 10 μg/ml fibronectin, was added to the top chamber. Cells were allowed to invade for 40 h. For the wound-healing migration assay, cell populations grown to confluency in 6-well plates were scratched with a sterile P200 pipette tip. For some experiments, the plates were precoated with either 2.5 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml fibronectin overnight at 4 °C. Detached cells were removed with Dulbecco's PBS. Attached cells were allowed to migrate in serum-free medium (RPMI/0.1% BSA). Photographs of the wounds were taken at 0 h, 4 h, 9 h, 24 h, 32 h, and 48 h. The wound gap was quantified by National Institutes of Health ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Cells were suspended in 500 μl of RPMI/10% FBS medium containing 0.33% agarose and plated in duplicate on top of 1 ml of solidified 0.67% agarose/RPMI/10% FBS in 12-well plates (1000 cells/well). Cells were placed in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator, and colonies were allowed to form for 2 weeks. Colonies were stained with 0.005% crystal violet for 2 h, and photographs of five fields/well were taken under the microscope. Colonies with a diameter greater than 20 μm were scored. 6-well plates were coated overnight with either 10 μg/ml fibronectin (at 4 °C) or the nonadhesive poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) (20 mg/ml at room temperature). Cells were added to the plates and incubated for the indicated time periods. Cell death was detected by trypan blue exclusion assay. In some experiments, 50 μm of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Invitrogen) was added to the cells. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 30 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche)) or in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche)) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Protein was subjected to either 8% Tris-glycine or 4–12% Bis/Tris (Invitrogen) SDS-PAGE. Quantitation of band intensity was performed with ImageJ software. To assay secreted fibronectin, cells were grown in serum-free RPMI/0.1% BSA for 24 h. Conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged to remove any floating cells, and 2 ml were concentrated with an Amicon Ultracell (Millipore) and immunoblotted for fibronectin. Attached cells were also collected, lysed, and immunoblotted with actin to ensure that conditioned medium had been collected from the same number of cells. The following antibodies were used in this study: Rad9, integrin β1, integrin β3, integrin α2, integrin αv, fibronectin monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences), β-actin, and α-tubulin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-FOXO3a (Ser-253), FOXO3a, phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9), and GSK3α/β polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). In a previous report, we assessed the contribution of Rad9 to prostate tumor growth. This investigation revealed that down-regulation of Rad9 impaired growth of PC3 and DU145 xenografts injected into nude mice (14.Zhu A. Zhang C.X. Lieberman H.B. Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Rad9 in the proliferation of these two human prostate cancer cell lines, we transiently knocked down Rad9 expression by short interfering RNA (siRad9), or used control siRNA 2The abbreviations used are: siRNAshort interfering RNAsiLucluciferaseFNfibronectin. (luciferase, siLuc) and examined the impact on cell proliferation over a period of 4 days. Transfection with 100 nm siRad9 resulted in more than 90% down-regulation of Rad9 protein levels compared with Lipofectamine-only (Lip.) or siLuc-transfected cells (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Cell proliferation was reduced in siRad9-expressing cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1A, lower panel). The reduction of cell proliferation for siRad9-expressing cells became apparent after 3 days in culture, and it was ∼2.5-fold lower compared with the siLuc-expressing cells by the end of the experiment at day 4. Similar results were obtained with another prostate cancer cell line, PC3 (supplemental Fig. S1A). Likewise, we measured cell proliferation of DU145 cells stably transfected with short hairpin RNA against Rad9 (shRad9) or insertless vector (pSUPER-retro-puro vector; shControl), or untransfected parental cells. Those stably expressing shRad9 had reduced Rad9 protein levels by ∼90% compared with the levels in either parental or shControl cells (Fig. 1B, upper panel). After day 6 in culture, the DU145/shRad9 cell number was ∼2-fold lower than the DU145/shVector or DU145/parental cell populations (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Thus, the in vitro cell proliferation assay recapitulated the in vivo xenograph studies using the same cell lines. Cell proliferation results were also verified by colony formation for both PC3 and DU145 cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). In the case of DU145 cells, treatment with siRNA sustained suppression of endogenous Rad9 levels for at least 6 days (supplemental Fig. S1C). Results showed that transient reduction of Rad9 in these cells was sufficient to permanently impair proliferation by as much as 80%. short interfering RNA luciferase fibronectin. To account for the decreased cell proliferation of DU145 and PC3 cells with knocked down Rad9 expression, we examined cell viability using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that transient down-regulation of Rad9 in DU145 cells increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1C). Quantitation of apoptotic cells 4 days post-transfection revealed an increase from 5% in control (transfected with siLuc) cells expressing normal levels Rad9 to 35% in the siRad9 cells (Fig. 1D). Likewise, Rad9 silencing in PC3 cells resulted in a 4-fold increase in apoptotic cells as compared with control (Luc) siRNA (supplemental Fig. S1C). We showed previously that Rad9 expression levels correlate with metastatic progression in prostate cancer (14.Zhu A. Zhang C.X. Lieberman H.B. Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Likewise, increased Rad9 expression has been correlated with tumor growth and local recurrence in breast cancer (16.Cheng C.K. Chow L.W. Loo W.T. Chan T.K. Chan V. The cell cycle checkpoint gene Rad9 is a novel oncogene activated by 11q13 amplification and DNA methylation in breast.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8646-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We thus examined the impact of Rad9 down-regulation on DU145 and PC3 cell migration and invasion. To investigate DU145 cells for the role of Rad9 in these activities we used two different stable clones that show ∼60–95% Rad9 down-regulation (Fig. 3A) and compared their ability to migrate toward 10% fetal bovine serum or 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Fig. 2A) or invade a Matrigel matrix supplemented with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (B). Rad9 silencing resulted in a 3-fold less migration compared with DU145 parental cells or DU145 cells stably bearing an insertless pSUPER-puro vector (shControl) as well as a 2.5-fold lower invasion capacity. A well filled with bovine serum albumin served as a negative control (no chemoattractant) and defined basal invasion. Furthermore, DU145 cell migration was generally twice as efficient toward fibronectin as compared with 10% FBS (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Rad9 regulation of DU145 cell migration and invasion. A, cell migration toward either FN or 10% FBS was performed with parental DU145 or those cells stably expressing pSUPER-puro insertless vector (shControl) or two clones with shRad9 (2, A) for 6 h using 24-well Transwell inserts. B, cell invasion was performed with Matrigel containing 10 μg/ml fibronectin. Cell invasion with parental (DU145), shRad9, or shControl were allowed to invade for 40 h using FBS (10%) as chemoattractant or 0.1% bovine serum albumin as negative control (DU145/BSA). C, DU145 cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA (siLuc), two Rad9 siRNAs (siRad9#1 and siRad9#2), or siRNA against integrin β1 (siITGB1) and assayed for migration toward fibronectin for 6 h. D, invasion of DU145 cells transiently down-regulating Rad9 (siRad9) or control (siLuc) was carried out as in C. All data are mean ± S.D. of a representative experiment of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also assessed migration and invasion by transiently down-regulating Rad9 using two non-overlapping siRNAs that were able to reduce Rad9 protein expression by ∼90% (Fig. 5A). We completed these assays with 50 nm siRad9 (siRad9#1) or 12.5 nm siRad9 (siRad9#2) within 72 h post-transfection, when cell proliferation is similar in siRad9 and control cells (Fig. 1A). As a negative control, we used siRNA against luciferase (siLuc, 50 nm), whereas an additional siRNA against integrin β1 (siITGB1, 30 nm) was used as a positive control. Integrin β1 (ITGB1), when complexed with integrin α5, is a major fibronectin receptor in these cells (17.Witkowski C.M. Rabinovitz I. Nagle R.B. Affinito K.S. Cress A.E. Characterization of integrin subunits, cellular adhesion and tumorgenicity of four human prostate cell lines.J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1993; 119: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Rad9 silencing in DU145 cells caused impaired capacity to migrate toward fibronectin (Fig. 2C) or invade through Matrigel/fibronectin (Fig. 2D). Quantitation analysis revealed a 2.5-fold decreased migration and 5-fold reduced invasion in cells with diminished levels of Rad9 compared with control cells (siLuc) expressing normal levels of Rad9. In addition to DU145 cells, Rad9 down-regulation, by transiently transfecting with a Rad9-specific siRNA, affected migration and invasion of PC3 cells when comparing migration toward 10% fetal bovine serum (chemoattractant) and invasion to Matrigel for these cells as well as siLuc-transfected controls. Rad9 down-regulation diminished migration (supplemental Fig. S2A) and invasion (supplemental Fig. S2B) of PC3 cells 2-fold compared with the control siLuc. Therefore, we conclude that Rad9 mediates tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro. To investigate whether ectopic Rad9 expression in DU145 clones with reduced endogenous Rad9 can reverse the observed phenotype of diminished migration and invasion, we stably expressed mouse Rad9 (Mrad9) in DU145/shRad9 cells. Mrad9 protein level was not affected by human shRad9 (supplemental Fig. S3A). We isolated a clone that expressed ∼3-fold more Mrad9 compared with Rad9 expression in parental DU145 (Fig. 3A). A clone with much higher levels of Mrad9 displayed signs of increased cell death. This is not surprising, as it has been reported that Rad9 can also act as a cell death inducer when overexpressed (18.Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Human homologue of S. pombe Rad9 interacts with BCL-2/BCL-xL and promotes apoptosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Stable silencing of Rad9 did not increase cell death as judged by the trypan viability assay (supplemental Fig. S3B) and, in agreement with published reports (19.Hirai I. Wang H.G.

We measured cell migration with a wound healing assay (Fig. 3B). DU145 parental cells or various clones were grown to confluency and scratched with a pipette tip (time, 0 h). Twenty-four hours later, DU145, shControl, and Mrad9-expressing cells showed an ∼80% wound closure. In contrast, clones with reduced levels of Rad9 (shRad9#A, shRad9#2, shRad9#2/pSV2zeo) displayed only 20–30% wound closure (Fig. 3C). By 48 h, cells expressing high levels of Rad9 had closed the wound completely, whereas Rad9 knockdown cells showed 60–70% wound closure (Fig. 3C). The wound healing assay was also repeated with plates that had been coated with either 10 μg/ml or 2.5 μg/ml fibronectin (FN) or left uncoated. Although migration of shRad9 was not affected by the presence of exogenous fibronectin, migration of shControl and Mrad9 cells was somewhat impaired with increasing concentration of fibronectin (supplemental Fig. S4, A–C). Although the remaining wound gap after 48 h was ∼20% in shControl and Mrad9 cells in the uncoated pl"
https://openalex.org/W1989073259,"Only two of the four glutamates in the selectivity filter of the muscle acetylcholine receptor contribute to the single-channel conductance, with side chain torsional flexibility and microenvironment properties having a previously unrecognized role. In ion channels, 'rings' of ionized side chains that decorate the walls of the permeation pathway often lower the energetic barrier to ion conduction. Using single-channel electrophysiological recordings, we studied the poorly understood ring of four glutamates (and one glutamine) that dominates this catalytic effect in the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ('the intermediate ring of charge'). We show that all four wild-type glutamate side chains are deprotonated in the range of 6.0–9.0 pH, that only two of them contribute to the size of the single-channel current, that these side chains must be able to adopt alternate conformations that either allow or prevent their negative charges from increasing the rate of cation conduction and that the location of these glutamate side chains squarely at one of the ends of the transmembrane pore is critical for their largely unshifted pKa values and for the unanticipated impact of their conformational flexibility on cation permeation."

https://openalex.org/W2095094582,"Ca(2+) dissociation from troponin causes cessation of muscle contraction by incompletely understood structural mechanisms. To investigate this process, regulatory site Ca(2+) binding in the NH(2)-lobe of subunit troponin C (TnC) was abolished by mutagenesis, and effects on cardiac troponin dynamics were mapped by hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX)-MS. The findings demonstrate the interrelationships among troponin's detailed dynamics, troponin's regulatory actions, and the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy linked to troponin mutations. Ca(2+) slowed HDX up to 2 orders of magnitude within the NH(2)-lobe and the NH(2)-lobe-associated TnI switch helix, implying that Ca(2+) greatly stabilizes this troponin regulatory region. HDX of the TnI COOH terminus indicated that its known role in regulation involves a partially folded rather than unfolded structure in the absence of Ca(2+) and actin. Ca(2+)-triggered stabilization extended beyond the known direct regulatory regions: to the start of the nearby TnI helix 1 and to the COOH terminus of the TnT-TnI coiled-coil. Ca(2+) destabilized rather than stabilized specific TnI segments within the coiled-coil and destabilized a region not previously implicated in Ca(2+)-mediated regulation: the coiled-coil's NH(2)-terminal base plus the preceding TnI loop with which the base interacts. Cardiomyopathy-linked mutations clustered almost entirely within influentially dynamic regions of troponin, and many sites were Ca(2+)-sensitive. Overall, the findings demonstrate highly selective effects of regulatory site Ca(2+), including opposite changes in protein dynamics at opposite ends of the troponin core domain. Ca(2+) release triggers an intramolecular switching mechanism that propagates extensively within the extended troponin structure, suggests specific movements of the TnI inhibitory regions, and prominently involves troponin's dynamic features."
https://openalex.org/W1999866559,"Cells respond to DNA damage by activating alternate signaling pathways that induce proliferation arrest or apoptosis. The correct balance between these two pathways is important for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing unnecessary cell death. The mechanism by which DNA-damaged cells escape from apoptosis during DNA repair is poorly understood.

Thus, Cdc7 defines an essential pro-survival signaling pathway by contributing to stabilization of Tob, thereby the viability of DNA-damaged cells being maintained. The integrity of genomic DNA is constantly under threat in every organism. DNA damage on the genome is introduced by reactive oxygen species, stochastic errors in replication or recombination, or environmental genotoxins. Two cellular strategies have evolved for coping with DNA damage: DNA damage is repaired or DNA-damaged cells are removed by apoptosis. Apparently, organisms respond differently to DNA damage depending on the type and severity of the damage (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response. Putting checkpoints in perspective.Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar, 2Clarke P.R. Allan L.A. Cell-cycle control in the face of damage. A matter of life or death.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 89-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although activation of the cell cycle checkpoint in response to mild DNA damage provides an opportunity to repair the damage, apoptosis should be suppressed to prevent unnecessary cell destruction. One of the important unresolved problems is how DNA-damaged cells undergoing DNA repair escape from apoptosis. Cdc7 is an evolutionarily conserved kinase that promotes DNA replication origin firing (3Labib K.

Aberrant DNA replication and DNA damage immediately lead to activation of the S-phase checkpoint, which suppresses late origin firing to prevent further DNA replication and stabilizes stalled replication forks to ensure proper fork restart following removal of the replication error or DNA damage. Whereas some studies have suggested that Cdc7 activity is inhibited through the dissociation of the active Cdc7 complex following DNA damage (5Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A.

These studies suggest that Cdc7 contributes to cell survival during genotoxic stress response and triggers DNA replication re-initiation. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which Cdc7 suppresses cell death and a role of Cdc7 activity before removal of DNA damage have not been elucidated.

Furthermore, proteasomal degradation of Tob, which is independent of p53, is closely associated with DNA damage-induced apoptosis (17Suzuki T. Tsuzuku J. Kawakami K. Miyasaka T. Yamamoto T.

It is important to identify molecules that regulate the Tob expression level to deepen our understanding of the mechanism for cell fate decision in response to DNA damage. In this study, we show that Cdc7 and Tob cooperate to prevent cells from undergoing DNA damage-induced apoptosis by competing with Cul4-DDB1Cdt2-dependent proteasome activity, suggesting that the Cdc7-Tob axis actively maintains survival of DNA-damaged cells to provide an opportunity to repair the damage.

Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression vector was constructed by inserting the cDNA of EGFP into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Tob point mutants (in pME18S vector or pET26b vector) were generated by polymerase chain reaction. We used TransIT-LT1 (MirusBio) when introducing expression vectors into COS7 cells. Amphotropic retrovirus packaging cells (platA cells) were transfected with the retroviral plasmid (pMX-puro) containing RNAi-resistant Tob mutants, TobF series, or His6-Cdc7 cDNA using TransIT-LT1 (MirusBio). The next day, the U2OS cells were plated. Two days after transfection, the virus-containing medium was collected, filtered (0.45 μm filter, Millipore), and supplemented with Polybrene (Sigma; 5 μg/ml). For infection, the culture medium was replaced by the virus-containing medium and cells were incubated for a further 2 days. The infected cells were selected in medium containing puromycin (Sigma; 2 μg/ml) for 4 days. Double-stranded RNA was transfected into U2OS cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The sequences of siRNAs are in supplemental Methods. Cells were irradiated with UV or treated with the indicated chemicals at 2 days post-transfection. Cells at 80% confluence were exposed to UV-C (30 J/m2 unless otherwise indicated) with a FUNA-UV-linker (FS-800; FUNAKOSHI). Cells were lysed with buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) 8 h after UV irradiation unless otherwise indicated. To inhibit proteasome-dependent degradation, cells were pretreated with MG132 (40 μm; Peptide Institute) for 2 h. Total RNA was prepared from cells with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (13Yoshida Y. Nakamura T. Komoda M. Satoh H. Suzuki T. Tsuzuku J.K. Miyasaka T. Yoshida E.H. Umemori H. Kunisaki R.K. Tani K. Ishii S.

U2OS or retrovirus-infected U2OS cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), treated with 0.1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and washed again in PBS. The cells were lysed with TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2)-conjugated agarose (Sigma) or anti-Tob antibody-conjugated Protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were submitted to immunoblotting. For glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments, in vitro phosphorylation reaction products were suspended in TNE buffer, and GST-Cdc7 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare).

After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Ubiquitinated Tob was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-Tob antibody.

The cDNAs corresponding to full-length proliferating cell nuclear antigen and MCM2 (amino acids 1–283) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the pGEX6P-1 vector. The GST-fused proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The GST portion was cleaved by Precision protease (GE Healthcare). We have previously shown that low doses of ultraviolet (UV) (20–45 J/m2: UV(l)) irradiation up-regulate the level of Tob expression and induce little apoptosis, whereas the apoptotic response to high doses of UV (>100 J/m2: UV(h)) correlates with the extent of proteasomal degradation of Tob (17Suzuki T. Tsuzuku J. Kawakami K. Miyasaka T. Yamamoto T. Proteasome-mediated degradation of Tob is pivotal for triggering UV-induced apoptosis.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with actinomycin D completely suppressed the UV(l)-induced increase in Tob, indicating that UV(l) activates transcription of the tob gene (Fig. 1A). Northern blot analysis revealed that activation of tob transcription occurred within a couple of hours after UV(l) irradiation (Fig. 1B). To clarify the underlying mechanisms, we examined the effects of several kinase inhibitors on UV(l)-induced up-regulation of Tob. Treatment of U2OS cells with CGK733, which modulates the ATM and ATR kinase pathways, largely inhibited the UV(l)-induced increase in Tob expression, whereas all other tested inhibitors including SP600125 and U0126, which target Jun N-terminal kinases and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, respectively, had no effect (Fig. 1C). Importantly, treatment of UV(l)-irradiated cells with CGK733 promoted apoptotic cell death as monitored by cleavage of PARP and nuclear condensation, supporting our previous conclusion that Tob contributes to the maintenance of cell survival (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained from experiments using etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, as a DNA-damaging reagent. Namely, Tob protein is increased through the transcriptional induction after etoposide treatment to protect cells from apoptosis, but the increase was suppressed concomitant with extensive apoptosis in the presence of CGK733 (supplemental Fig. S1). Next, we examined whether suppression of the UV(l)-induced Tob increase by CGK733 treatment was due to transcriptional repression. Northern blot analysis showed that tob mRNA was increased in both the presence and absence of CGK733 (Fig. 1D), indicating that CGK733 did not affect tob transcription. We then asked whether CGK733 affected a mechanism controlling the stability of Tob. Indeed, when we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the UV(l)-induced Tob increase was largely restored in CGK733-treated cells (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that the CGK733-induced Tob degradation results in apoptosis of DNA-damaged cells. Therefore, we speculated that the Tob protein up-regulated upon UV(l) irradiation should be protected from proteasome-dependent degradation to maintain the viability of the DNA-damaged cells. Proteasome-dependent degradation often requires a post-translational modification of target proteins called ubiquitination. The small protein ubiquitin is covalently attached to substrates by the sequential action of three enzymes, E1, E2, and E3 (23Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6897) Google Scholar). E3 ubiquitin ligases determine target specificity; therefore, we searched for an E3 ligase responsible for Tob degradation in CGK733-treated cells. Because UV irradiation induces several checkpoint responses during the cell cycle, we first examined whether multisubunit E3 ligase complexes related to cell cycle regulation, such as Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box protein (SCF) and anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), were involved. Tob degradation still occurred in CGK733-treated cells after transfecting cells with siRNAs specific to components of the SCF or APC/C E3 ligases, including Skp2, β-TrCP, Cdc4, Cdh1, and Cdc20 (Fig. 2A). We then examined whether the Cul4-DDB1 E3 ligase complexes, which regulate UV-induced responses (24O'Connell B.C. Harper J.W. Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). What can chromatin do for you?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), were involved in Tob degradation. siRNA-mediated suppression of DDB1 resulted in restoration of the UV(l)-induced Tob increase in CGK-treated cells (Fig. 2A). Because DDB1 forms a multiprotein complex with Cul4, Rbx/Roc1, and DDB1-binding WD40 repeat (DWD) proteins, which recognize specific targets (25Jackson S. Xiong Y. CRL4s. The CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 562-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the suppression of several known DWD proteins on Tob degradation. Suppression of Cdt2, but not DDB2, restored the UV(l)-induced Tob increase in CGK-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Again, restoration of the UV(l)-induced Tob increase was clearly correlated with cell viability as monitored by PARP cleavage and nuclear condensation (Fig. 2, A–C). To confirm the involvement of Cdt2 in regulating the level of Tob protein, we examined whether Tob physically interacts with Cdt2. To do so, we established U2OS cells expressing C terminally FLAG-tagged Tob (TobF), which was resistant to proteasome-dependent degradation (17Suzuki T. Tsuzuku J. Kawakami K. Miyasaka T. Yamamoto T. Proteasome-mediated degradation of Tob is pivotal for triggering UV-induced apoptosis.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When TobF was immunoprecipitated from soluble extracts of the cells, endogenous Cdt2 was co-precipitated (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that the Cul4-DDB1Cdt2 E3 complex induced ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Tob. To test this hypothesis, we purified the Cul4A-DDB1Cdt2 complex from insect cells that were co-infected with Cul4A, DDB1, Cdt2, and Rbx/Roc1-harboring baculoviruses and utilized the purified complex in an in vitro Tob ubiquitination assay. Immunoblot analysis of the reaction products showed a shift in the molecular weight of Tob corresponding to polyubiquitination in the presence of E1, E2 (UbcH5c), E3 (Cul4A-DDB1Cdt2), and ubiquitin (Fig. 2E), which indicated that Cul4A-DDB1Cdt2 specifically ubiquitinated Tob in vitro. As CGK733 is inhibitory to the ATM/ATR kinase pathway (supplemental Fig. S2A), we addressed whether, like CGK733 treatment, suppression of their downstream effector Chk1 or Chk2 (26Abraham R.T. Cell cycle checkpoint signaling through the ATM and ATR kinases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar) could antagonize the UV(l)-induced Tob increase and cause apoptotic cell death. However, unlike CGK733 treatment, suppression of Chk1 or Chk2 expression had little effect on the UV(l)-induced Tob increase and apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S3). Then to assess directly the involvement of ATM and ATR, we treated cells with siRNAs specific to ATM, ATR, or both to find that UV(l) irradiation-induced Tob was little affected by the treatment. The degree of induction of apoptosis, monitored by PARP cleavage and nuclear condensation, was little affected in the absence of ATM and ATR (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3) upon UV(l) irradiation. These data indicate that CGK733 targets not only the ATM/ATR kinases but also another unidentified molecule, which is involved in regulation of the UV(l)-induced Tob increase and apoptosis. To identify the postulated CGK733 targets, we used two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry. Lysates of U2OS cells were prepared after irradiation with UV(l) in the presence or absence of CGK733. Phosphoproteins in the lysates were enriched by column purification (see supplemental Methods for detail). Samples from cells treated with UV(l) and CGK733 together were labeled with Cy5, and those treated with UV(l) alone were labeled with Cy3. Both samples were combined and separated on the same gel. The two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis image showed several red and green spots, indicating deregulation of several molecules by CGK733 treatment in the UV(l)-induced response (Fig. 3B). Using peptide mass fingerprinting, we identified the Cdc7 and HMGB1 proteins from the spots labeled only with Cy3, indicating that these proteins were specifically suppressed in CGK-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Cdc7 is known to be required for firing of replication origins (3Labib K. How do Cdc7 and cyclin-dependent kinases trigger the initiation of chromosome replication in eukaryotic cells?.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 4Masai H. Matsumoto S. You Z. Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Oda M. Eukaryotic chromosome DNA replication. Where, when and how?.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 89-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and it has also been implicated in other chromosome transactions including DNA repair. HMGB1 is involved in the DNA damage response (27Lange S.S. Mitchell D.L. Vasquez K.M. High mobility group protein B1 enhances DNA repair and chromatin modification after DNA damage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10320-10325Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Lange S.S. Vasquez K.M. HMGB1. The jack-of-all-trades protein is a master DNA repair mechanic.Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, they may both be potential direct or downstream targets of CGK733. Consistent with this idea, CGK733 treatment suppressed phosphorylation of MCM2, one of the Cdc7 targets (supplemental Fig. S2B). To assess the involvement of Cdc7 and HMGB1 in the UV(l)-induced Tob increase, we transfected U2OS cells with siRNAs targeting Cdc7 or HMGB1, and subsequently examined Tob levels. Immunoblot analysis showed little increase in Tob expression in the cells treated with siRNAs targeting Cdc7 or HMGB1 after UV(l) irradiation (Fig. 3, C and D). As expected, apoptosis, as monitored by both PARP cleavage and nuclear condensation, was induced after UV(l) irradiation in Cdc7- or HMGB1-suppressed cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Next, we examined whether suppression of the UV(l)-induced Tob increase in the absence of Cdc7 or HMGB1 was due to facilitation of Cul4-DDB1Cdt2 complex-dependent degradation of Tob. Suppression of DDB1 (Fig. 3, C and D) or treatment of cells with MG132 (Fig. 4A) resulted in restoration of the UV(l)-induced Tob increase in Cdc7- or HMGB1-suppressed cells, suggesting that the Cul4-DDB1Cdt2 complex promoted Tob degradation when Cdc7 or HMGB1 was suppressed. The tob mRNA level was increased after UV(l) irradiation of Cdc7- or HMGB1-suppressed cells (Fig. 4B), further suggesting rapid degradation of Tob in those cells. Similar results were obtained using NUGC3, HeLa, and HT1080 cells (supplemental Fig. S4). We conclude that Cdc7 and HMGB1 are responsible for antagonizing UV-induced apoptosis through their ability to block Cul4-DDB1Cdt2 complex-dependent Tob degradation. Both Cdc7 and HMGB1 associate with chromatin during the S-phase checkpoint (8Ten"

Wild-type (WT) and Roquin transgenic (Tg) mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen (CII). Arthritis severity was evaluated by clinical score; histopathologic CIA severity; proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels; anti-CII antibody levels; and populations of Th1, Th2, germinal center B cells, and follicular helper T cells in CIA. T cell proliferation in vitro and cytokine levels were determined to assess the response to CII. Roquin Tg mice developed more severe CIA and joint destruction compared with WT mice. Production of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and pathogenic anti-collagen CII-specific IgG and IgG2a antibodies was increased in Roquin Tg mice. In addition, in vitro T cell assays showed increased proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production in response to CII as a result of enforced Roquin expression in T cells. Furthermore, the Th1/Th2 balance was altered by an increased Th1 and decreased Th2 population. These findings suggest that overexpression of Roquin exacerbates the development of CIA and that enforced expression of Roquin in T cells may promote autoimmune diseases such as CIA.

T cell activation and differentiation are regulated not only by T cell receptor recognition of the antigen-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) but also by interactions between many co-stimulatory molecules (7.Nurieva R.I. Regulation of immune and autoimmune responses by ICOS-B7h interaction.Clin. Immunol. 2005; 115: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the interactions among various immune cells are complex, optimal responses are induced by controlled and coordinated expression of T cell co-stimulatory receptors. CD28, the first co-stimulatory molecule to be identified and arguably the most important in naive T cell activation, binds to B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), which are expressed on the surface of professional antigen-presenting cells.

T cells derived from ICOS-deficient mice exhibit reduced proliferation and IL-2 production, indicating a role for ICOS in T cell activation (15.Dong C. Juedes A.E. Temann U.A. Shresta S. Allison J.P.

Regulation of immune and autoimmune responses by ICOS-B7h interaction.Clin. Immunol. 2005; 115: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Roquin was recently identified as a RING-type ubiquitin ligase family member. Roquin mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, and Roquin protein has been predicted to be intracellular. Roquin contains an N-terminal RING-1 zinc finger at residues 14–53 based on consensus sequences with the E3 ubiquitin ligase family. The C terminus of the RING finger is a highly conserved novel protein domain known as ROQ, and a zinc finger domain of the CCCH type that conforms precisely to the RNA-binding zinc finger occurs in the center of Roquin. The C terminus of the CCCH domain is a proline-rich region representing potential sites for binding the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of interacting proteins (19.Lin A.E. Mak T.W. The role of E3 ligases in autoimmunity and the regulation of autoreactive T cells.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20.Vinuesa C.G. Cook M.C.

A RING-type ubiquitin ligase family member required to repress follicular helper T cells and autoimmunity.Nature. 2005; 435: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Notably, one report identified a novel repressor of ICOS, Roquin, which is the defective gene in sanroque mice (20.Vinuesa C.G. Cook M.C. Angelucci C. Athanasopoulos V. Rui L. Hill K.M. Yu D. Domaschenz H. Whittle B. Lambe T. Roberts I.S. Copley R.R. Bell J.I. Cornall R.J. Goodnow C.C. A RING-type ubiquitin ligase family member required to repress follicular helper T cells and autoimmunity.Nature. 2005; 435: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). san/san mice have a point mutation in Roquin and are highly susceptible to autoimmunity. CD4+ T cells from san/san mice express higher levels of ICOS than do those of wild-type (WT) controls. Particularly striking are the accumulation of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and the increased size of germinal centers. However, in our previous study, Roquin overexpression induced up-regulation of CD28 expression as well as down-regulation of ICOS during T cell activation by anti-CD3/CD28. Secretion of IL-2 and proinflammatory cytokines was increased by enforced expression of Roquin in T cell activation (21.Kim H.J. Ji Y.R. Kim M.O. Yu D.H. Shin M.J. Yuh H.S. Bae K.B. Park S.J. Yi J.K. Kim N.R. Park S.J. Yoon D.H. Lee W.H. Lee S. Ryoo Z.Y. The role of Roquin overexpression in the modulation of signaling during in vitroex vivo T-cell activation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 417: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, decreased ICOS expression may repress Th cell function and prevent pathogenic immune responses. However, conflicting data on the role of ICOS in allograft survival have been reported, and ICOS blockade can exacerbate or reduce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis severity depending upon the treatment approach (15.Dong C. Juedes A.E. Temann U.A. Shresta S. Allison J.P. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A. ICOS co-stimulatory receptor is essential for T-cell activation and function.Nature. 2001; 409: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 22.Rottman J.B. Smith T. Tonra J.R. Ganley K. Bloom T. Silva R. Pierce B. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Ozkaynak E. Coyle A.J. The costimulatory molecule ICOS plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of EAE.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased CD28 may regulate T cell activation and lead to an autoimmune response. To our knowledge, there are no reports regarding the function of Roquin in RA in the literature. Therefore, we used Roquin-overexpressing mice to investigate the role of Roquin in the CIA mouse as a model of autoimmune disease. The results indicate that Roquin overexpression promoted the induction of CIA even when reinforced immunization protocols were applied. Immune cell populations, including Th cells, Tfh cells, and germinal center B cells, were unaffected by Roquin overexpression in non-immunized mice. However, Th1/Th2 balance was affected by Roquin overexpression in the CIA model. Therefore, these findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of Roquin in T cells in autoimmune diseases such as RA. Roquin transgenic mice were generated as described previously (21.Kim H.J. Ji Y.R. Kim M.O. Yu D.H. Shin M.J. Yuh H.S. Bae K.B. Park S.J. Yi J.K. Kim N.R. Park S.J. Yoon D.H. Lee W.H. Lee S. Ryoo Z.Y. The role of Roquin overexpression in the modulation of signaling during in vitroex vivo T-cell activation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 417: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Six generations of Roquin transgenic mice were backcrossed onto the DBA/1 background. All mice used in these experiments were 8–12 weeks old. All animals were raised and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. Arthritis was induced and scored in male WT and Roquin transgenic mice by immunization with bovine CII (Chondrex). Bovine CII was dissolved in cold 0.01 m acetic acid at 2.5 mg/ml. Mice were immunized by intradermal injection with 100 μg of CII emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. On day 21, the mice received a booster immunization with the same amount of CII in incomplete Freund's adjuvant into the left footpad. The incidence and severity of arthritis were evaluated by visual inspection of the paws. Each limb, except the hind foot that received the booster immunization, was assessed on a 0–4-point scale. The severity of arthritis in mice was scored in individual mice in a double blind manner with each paw assigned a separate clinical score as follows: 0, no evidence of erythema or swelling; 1, erythema and mild swelling confined to the ankle joint and toes; 2, erythema and mild swelling extending from the ankle to the midfoot; 3, erythema and severe swelling extending from the ankle to the metatarsal joints; and 4, ankle deformity with joint swelling. On day 45, the mice were killed for histological analysis. Three paws and ankles, with the exception of the hind foot that received the booster immunization, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days, decalcified in 30% citrate-buffered formic acid at 4 °C, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Thin sections (3 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological changes such as degree of synovial hyperplasia, inflammation, and pannus formation in the joints were scored on a scale from 0 to 3 as follows: 0, absent; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. The maximum possible score per mouse was 9. Spleens were prepared using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the resulting lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The protein concentrations of the clarified supernatants were determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Whole tissue lysates were fractionated by Tris-glycine-buffered 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation with an antibody to HA (Roche Applied Science) and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was determined using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). Antibodies against phospho-AKT (Ser-473), AKT, phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), ERK, phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), JNK, phospho-IκBα (Ser-32/36), and IκBα were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Single cell suspensions were prepared from the lymph nodes and spleens of mice and treated with red blood cell lysing solution (0.15 m NH4Cl and 0.1 mm Na2EDTA) for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate erythrocytes. CD4+ T cells were positively isolated using anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody-coupled magnetic cell-sorting microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) to more than 95% purity (as analyzed by flow cytometric staining with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies). Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse Tbet-PerCP Cy5.5, GATA3-AF647, CD44-FITC, CD44-PE, CD44-APC, CD4-PerCP, CXCR5-FITC, PD-1-PE, B220-PerCP, GL-7-FITC, CD95-PE, ICOS-PE, and CD28-PE antibodies and analyzed on a FACScan using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Spleen and draining lymph node cells were cultured at 2 × 106 cells/ml for up to 96 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were stimulated with graded concentrations of CII. Cell proliferation was quantified using a DNA bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay (Roche Applied Science). The amount of incorporated BrdU is a measure of the rate of DNA synthesis and thus indirectly of cell proliferation. The cell proliferation kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatants from parallel triplicate cultures were stored at −70 °C until estimation of cytokine content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum was collected on days 20 (diluted 1:5000) and 45 (diluted 1:20,000), and anti-type II collagen antibody levels (total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) were measured using ELISA kits purchased from Chondrex. Total interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 levels in supernatants were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The IL-21 levels were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (Biolegend). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The significance of differences between groups was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t test. Differences with a p value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To generate transgenic mouse lines that expressed high levels of Roquin specifically in T cells, mouse Roquin cDNA was inserted into a vector containing a human CD2 transgene cassette (21.Kim H.J. Ji Y.R. Kim M.O. Yu D.H. Shin M.J. Yuh H.S. Bae K.B. Park S.J. Yi J.K. Kim N.R. Park S.J. Yoon D.H. Lee W.H. Lee S. Ryoo Z.Y. The role of Roquin overexpression in the modulation of signaling during in vitroex vivo T-cell activation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 417: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To confirm the expression of the transgene, Western blotting was used to monitor production of the Roquin-HA fusion protein in the spleens of Roquin-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice (Fig. 1A). Co-stimulatory receptor expression was assessed by FACS analysis. CD4+/CD28+ or CD4+/ICOS+ T cell populations from the spleen were isolated using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit. Our data show decreased ICOS expression in the CD4+ T cells of the Roquin Tg mice compared with WT mice. This result is similar to that of a previous study, which demonstrated that Roquin represses ICOS expression (23.Yu D. Tan A.H. Hu X. Athanasopoulos V. Simpson N. Silva D.G. Hutloff A. Giles K.M. Leedman P.J. Lam K.P. Goodnow C.C. Vinuesa C.G. Roquin represses autoimmunity by limiting inducible T-cell co-stimulator messenger RNA.Nature. 2007; 450: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) but has no effect on CD28 expression in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the lymphocyte population in naive mice, we analyzed the lymphocyte subsets in the spleen. The percentages of Tbet+CD44highCD4+ T (Th1) and GATA3+CD44highCD4+ T (Th2) cells were not altered in the Roquin Tg mice compared with the WT mice (p = 0.33 and p = 0.10, respectively). Similarly, the percentages of B220+GL-7+CD95+ (germinal center B) and PD-1highCXCR5+CD4+ (Tfh) cells were not altered in the Roquin Tg mice (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that T cells and germinal center B cells developed normally in the spleens of the Roquin Tg mice. To assess whether T cell-specific Roquin expression affects the development of arthritis, we examined experimental CIA in Roquin Tg and WT mice. The clinical arthritis score was significantly higher in the Roquin Tg mice than in the WT mice, and arthritis arose earlier in the Roquin Tg mice relative to the WT mice (Fig. 2A). In the chronic state (i.e. after 60 days), the clinical scores of the Roquin Tg and WT mice were similar. Moreover, histological analyses of joints obtained 45 days after immunization revealed that joint inflammation and destruction were significantly accelerated in the Roquin Tg mice compared with the WT mice (Fig. 2B). Histology scores for the degree of pannus formation, synovial hyperplasia, and inflammation were higher in the Roquin Tg mice than in the WT mice on day 45 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that enforced expression of Roquin in T cells promoted inflammation and the development of CIA. Because enforced Roquin expression in T cells promoted the development of CIA, we examined whether Roquin regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. We isolated serum from mice at 20 and 45 days after immunization and then assessed the levels of various cytokines by ELISAs. In a previous study, CD28-induced IL-2 secretion was increased by Roquin overexpression in vitro (21.Kim H.J. Ji Y.R. Kim M.O. Yu D.H. Shin M.J. Yuh H.S. Bae K.B. Park S.J. Yi J.K. Kim N.R. Park S.J. Yoon D.H. Lee W.H. Lee S. Ryoo Z.Y. The role of Roquin overexpression in the modulation of signaling during in vitroex vivo T-cell activation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 417: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To confirm whether IL-2 secretion is increased in autoimmunity as it is in vivo, we performed an ELISA on serum collected from CIA mice at 20 and 45 days after immunization. IL-2 secretion was significantly increased in the Roquin Tg mice compared with the WT mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). At 20 days after immunization, the secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 was significantly elevated in Roquin Tg mice compared with WT mice. However, the levels of IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-21 were unchanged. At 45 days after immunization, the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-17 were significantly increased in the Roquin Tg mice compared with WT mice. However, the levels of IL-10 and IL-21 were unchanged (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, downstream signals of CD28, which regulates IL-2 transcription, were detected in the spleens of CIA mice at 45 days after immunization. Phosphorylation of AKT, JNK, and IκBα, but not ERK, was significantly increased in Roquin Tg mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4). These results indicate that enforced expression of Roquin in T cells increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines and that activation of AKT, JNK, and NF-κB, all downstream of signals CD28, induced IL-2 secretion in Roquin Tg mice.FIGURE 4Modulation of CD28 signaling by Roquin overexpression in mice. Downstream signals of CD28 were evaluated by Western blot analysis on day 45 in spleen lysates from Roquin Tg and WT mice after immunization.

Serum was isolated from each mouse at 20 and 45 days after immunization. CII-specific total IgG levels measured by ELISA were significantly higher in Roquin Tg mice than in WT mice. At 20 and 45 days after immunization, CII-specific IgG2a, which is associated with Th1 class switching, was higher in Roquin Tg mice, but CII-specific IgG1, which is associated with Th2 class switching, was lower in Roquin Tg mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 5). Thus, enforced expression of Roquin in T cells caused increased production and differential regulation of CII-specific IgG by B cells. We examined whether Roquin alters the immune response to CII. Spleen and draining lymph node cells were obtained from each group of mice at 20 and 45 days after CII immunization, and their ability to produce IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 or to proliferate in response to CII dose-dependently was investigated. After in vitro antigenic stimulation with CII, proliferation of spleen and draining lymph node cells was higher in Roquin Tg mice than in WT mice at 20 and 45 days after immunization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 was higher in cells from the Roquin Tg mice than in those from WT mice, whereas IL-10 secretion was lower in cells from the Roquin Tg mice than in those from WT mice in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). These data show that enforced expression of Roquin in T cells increased their proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. To evaluate the CD4+/CD28+ or CD4+/ICOS+ T cell populations, we isolated T cells from the spleens of mice with CIA using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit. Expression of ICOS in CD4+ T cells was lower in Roquin Tg mice than in WT mice, but CD28 expression in CD4+ T cells was higher in Roquin Tg mice than in WT mice (Fig. 7A). Also, to evaluate the population of lymphocytes in Roquin Tg mice with CIA after immunization, we analyzed lymphocyte subsets in the spleen. The proportion of Tbet+CD44highCD4+ T (Th1) cells was elevated in Roquin Tg mice compared with WT mice. However, that of GATA3+CD44highCD4+ T (Th2) cells decreased in Roquin Tg mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 7B). Also, the proportion of B220+GL-7+CD95+ (germinal center B) cells was higher in Roquin Tg mice, but that of PD-1highCXCR5+CD4+ (Tfh) cells was unaffected (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that enforced expression of Roquin in the T cells of mice with CIA altered lymphocyte proportions and their expression of co-stimulatory molecules after immunization. Previous studies of Roquin in autoimmunity suggested that its main role was suppression of autoimmune disease via ICOS down-regulation (23.Yu D. Tan A.H. Hu X. Athanasopoulos V. Simpson N. Silva D.G. Hutloff A. Giles K.M. Leedman P.J. Lam K.P. Goodnow C.C. Vinuesa C.G. Roquin represses autoimmunity by limiting inducible T-cell co-stimulator messenger RNA.Nature. 2007; 450: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that enforced expression of Roquin in T cells accelerates induction of CIA. Germ-line Roquin-deficient mice are perinatally lethal, so tissue-specific ablation of Roquin in T cells, B cells, and hematopoietic cells does not cause autoimmunity (24.Bertossi A. Aichinger M. Sansonetti P. Lech M. Neff F. Pal M. Wunderlich F.T. Anders H.J. Klein L. Schmidt-Supprian M. Loss of Roquin induces early death and immune deregulation but not autoimmunity.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For gain of function via Roquin overexpression, we established Roquin Tg mice. We performed FACS analysis to determine the composition of the immune cell population. The Th1, Th2, germinal center B, and Tfh cell populations were unaffected under normal, non-immunized conditions. Although ICOS expression was down-regulated in the Roquin Tg mice, immune cell development was unaffected. Roquin Tg mice may not exhibit an immune defect because ICOS, another member of the CD28 family, is not expressed by naive T cells (13.Hutloff A. Dittrich A.M. Beier K.C. Eljaschewitsch B. Kraft R. Anagnostopoulos I. Kroczek R.A. ICOS is an inducible T-cell co-stimulator structurally and functionally related to CD28.Nature. 1999; 397: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 14.Yoshinaga S.K. Whoriskey J.S.

Our data show that enforced expression of Roquin in T cells down-regulated ICOS and up-regulated CD28 expression in arthritis. Also, CD28 up-regulation and ICOS down-regulation were modulated by enforced expression of Roquin in EL-4 cells by anti-CD3/CD28 activation in our previous in vitro study (21.Kim H.J. Ji Y.R. Kim M.O. Yu D.H. Shin M.J. Yuh H.S. Bae K.B. Park S.J. Yi J.K. Kim N.R. Park S.J. Yoon D.H. Lee W.H. Lee S. Ryoo Z.Y. The role of Roquin overexpression in the modulation of signaling during in vitroex vivo T-cell activation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 417: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Both CD28 and ICOS are capable of stimulating the development of Th cells (25.Carreno B.M. Collins M. The B7 family of ligands and its receptors: new pathways for costimulation and inhibition of immune responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 29-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). However, ICOS is expressed only on T cells following activation, whereas CD28 is constitutively expressed. CD28-stimulated cells, but not ICOS-stimulated T cells, produce IL-2 (26.Salomon B. Bluestone J.A. Complexities of CD28/B7: CTLA-4 costimulatory pathways in autoimmunity and transplantation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 225-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Thus, CD28 is important in the early stages of T cell activation, whereas ICOS has a major role in its maintenance. Also, ICOS provides a stimulatory co-signal to activated T cells rather than to naive T cells. Ablation of CD28 in mice induces resistance to CIA (12.Tada Y. Nagasawa K. Ho A. Morito F. Ushiyama O. Suzuki N. Ohta H. Mak T.W. CD28-deficient mice are highly resistant to collagen-induced arthritis.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of ICOS or ICOS ligand in mice altered the number of Th cells and reduced disease activity in the CIA model of arthritis (7.Nurieva R.I. Regulation of immune and autoimmune responses by ICOS-B7h interaction.Clin. Immunol. 2005; 115: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Roquin increases the development of arthritis, further suggesting that CD28 up-regulation by Roquin may have a greater effect than ICOS down-regulation in the initiation of T cell activation. T cells stimulated by TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17 become Th1 and Th17 helper cells, whereas those stimulated by IL-4 and IL-10 develop into Th2 helper cells (27.Choy E.H. Panayi G.S. Cytokine pathways and joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar, 28.Miossec P. An update on the cytokine network in rheumatoid arthritis.Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2004; 16: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 are proinflammatory cytokines produced by T cells and are involved in diverse biological processes such as final maturation of B cells into plasma cells and T cell activation. These cytokines seem to be of pivotal importance in arthritis (29.Arend W.P. Dayer J.M. Inhibition of the production and effects of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor α in rheumatoid arthritis.Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 30.Kageyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida A. Uchijima M. Arai T. Miyamoto S. Ozeki T. Hiyoshi M. Kushida K. Inoue T. Reduced susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis in mice deficient in IFN-γ receptor.J.

Delayed onset and reduced severity of collagen-induced arthritis in interleukin-6-deficient mice.Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our results show that serum TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-17 levels were higher in Roquin Tg mice after immunization. In contrast, levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine (32.Asadullah K. Sterry W. Volk H.D. Interleukin-10 therapy—review of a new approach.Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), were lower in the serum of Roquin Tg mice after immunization. Therefore, these data suggest that Roquin Tg mice exhibit exacerbated development of CIA compared with WT mice. CIA is a well known model of Th1-mediated autoimmune disease (33.Mauri C. Williams R.O. Walmsley M. Feldmann M. Relationship between Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns and the arthritogenic response in collagen-induced arthritis.Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated a novel role of Roquin function in the initiation and development of arthritis through its influence on Th1/Th2 differentiation and balance. CD4+ T cells are classified into two major types: Th1 cells are primarily associated with cellular immunity and class switching to IgG2a, whereas Th2 cells are involved mainly in humoral immunity and class switching to IgG1 (34.Mosmann T.R. Coffman R.L. TH1 and TH2 cells: different patterns of lymphokine secretion lead to different functional properties.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 145-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (6854) Google Scholar, 35.Paul W.E. Seder R.A.

In the CIA model, immunization with CII generates a spectrum of antibodies with reactivities similar to those in human RA (4.Holmdahl R. Andersson M. Goldschmidt T.J. Gustafsson K. Jansson L. Mo J.A. Type II collagen autoimmunity in animals and provocations leading to arthritis.Immunol. Rev. 1990; 118: 193-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Also, passive transfer of serum from CII-immunized animals or purified anti-CII antibodies can cause arthritis in syngeneic recipients (18.Terato K. Hasty K.A. Reife R.A. Cremer M.A. Kang A.H.

Therefore, the production of IgG antibodies by Th1/Th2 cells plays a critical role in arthritis. Our data indicate increased IgG2a and decreased IgG1 levels in the serum of the Roquin Tg mice after CII immunization; thus, alterations in the levels of IgG2a and IgG1 may effectively alter the Th1/Th2 balance. Our data demonstrate that Roquin may enhance Th1 development, and enforced expression of Roquin in T cells may result in an elevated Th1-type response after immunization. Th cell differentiation, a crucial step in the immune response, is the result of complex cellular and molecular regulation. Recent years have seen progress in understanding the transcriptional mechanisms of Th lineage commitment and effector cytokine expression. However, how these T cell-intrinsic mechanisms are regulated by environmental stimuli such as co-stimulation by antigen-presenting cells needs further definition. In the future, downstream signals of co-stimulatory receptors will be elucidated and likely found to operate via Roquin-regulated mechanisms. Thus, Roquin may be another “double-edged sword” for the immune system that can be turned from a requirement of autoreactivity to a regulator of Th1/Th2 differentiation and balance. In conclusion, elevated expression of Roquin in T cells may promote autoimmune diseases such as CIA."

This requires access to data about science—in particular, R&D inputs and outputs such as grants, patents, publications, and data sets, to support an understanding of how R&D information is produced and what affects its availability. But there is a cacophony of R&D-related data across countries, disciplines, data providers, and sectors. Burdened with data that are inconsistently specified, researchers and policy-makers have few incentives or mechanisms to share or interlink cleaned data sets. Access to these data is limited by a patchwork of laws, regulations, and practices that are unevenly applied and interpreted ( 1 ). A Web-based infrastructure for data sharing and analysis could help. Data exchange standards are a first step. We describe administrative and technical demands and opportunities to meet them."
