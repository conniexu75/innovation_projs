This property can be exploited for the cellular delivery of heterologous proteins fused to Tat both in cell culture and in living animals. Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that cell membrane heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans act as receptors for extracellular Tat uptake. Cells genetically defective in the biosynthesis of fully sulfated HS are selectively impaired in the internalization of recombinant Tat fused to the green fluorescent protein, as evaluated by both flow cytometry and functional assays. In wild type cells, Tat uptake is competitively inhibited by soluble heparin and by treatment with glycosaminoglycan lyases specifically degrading HS chains. Cell surface HS proteoglycans also mediate physiological internalization of Tat green fluorescent protein released from neighboring producing cells. In contrast to extracellular Tat uptake, both wild type cells and cells genetically impaired in proteoglycan synthesis are equally proficient in the extracellular release of Tat, thus indicating that proteoglycans are not required for this process. The ubiquitous distribution of HS proteoglycans is consistent with the efficient intracellular delivery of heterologous proteins fused with Tat to different mammalian cell types.

Besides its interaction with cell surface receptors and the consequent activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways (41Albini A. Soldi R. Giunciuglio D. Giraudo E. Benelli R. Primo L.

Sozzani S. Luini W. Primo L. Borsatti A. Weich H. Bussolino F. Blood. 1997; 90: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), most of the activities of extracellular Tat are mediated by its unique property of being rapidly internalized by a variety of cell types, as originally shown more than 10 years ago (44Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 45Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O.

One of the consequences of Tat internalization is the activation of cellular transcription factor NF-κB; several of the pleiotropic functions of extracellular Tat could be mediated by this pathway (47Demarchi F. Gutierrez M.I. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7080-7086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The uptake, internalization, and nuclear translocation of extracellular Tat can also be exploited as a biotechnological tool for intracellular protein delivery. Chemical cross-linking of Tat peptides with heterologous proteins (51Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) or, more efficiently, production of recombinant proteins containing the protein transduction domain of Tat (52Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 53Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) facilitate the intracellular delivery of these proteins. In particular, it has been recently reported that the intraperitoneal injection of the 120-kDa β-galactosidase protein fused to 11 amino acids encompassing the arginine-rich region of Tat results in delivery of the fusion protein to virtually all tissues in mice (53Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Despite the large body of evidence available about the functions of extracellular Tat and its recent use, a biotechnological vector for protein transduction, the cellular mechanisms for Tat uptake and internalization, are still largely unexplored. Inspired by the observation that Tat can enter a variety of different cell types bothin vitro and in vivo and by the possibility of modulating several of the biological properties of extracellular Tat by soluble heparin (54Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol.

Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidences that cell membrane heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are the receptors for extracellular Tat internalization. The wild type CHO K1 and CHO K1 mutants deficient in proteoglycan biosynthesis (57Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The pgs A-745 cell line does not produce detectable levels of proteoglycans since it lacks xylosyltransferase, an enzyme necessary for the initiation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis. Mutant pgs B-618 has a defect in the galactosyltransferase-I enzyme gene and produces about 15% the amount of proteoglycans synthesized by wild type cells. Cell line pgs E-606 is partially deficient in HS N-sulfotransferase and produces an undersulfated form of HS proteoglycan. The cell line pgs D-677 has a single mutation that affects bothN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase activities, which are necessary for the polymerization of HS disaccharide chains and does not synthesize any HS proteoglycan. This mutant cell line also produces approximately three times more chondroitin sulfate than wild type cells. Finally, mutant cell line pgs C-605 has a defect in a saturable, 4-acetamido-4-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid-sensitive transport system required for sulfate uptake. Despite a dramatic reduction in 35SO4 incorporation, the mutant synthesizes sulfated heparan and chondroitin chains by using the inorganic sulfate produced from oxidative metabolism of cysteine and methionine (58Esko J.D.

The plasmid expressing GST-Tat-GFP was obtained by cloning a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment into the Bam HI andEco RI sites of the commercial vector pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fragment was obtained by the separate amplifications of HXB2 Tat using primers 5′-GTGGATCCATGGAGCCAGTAGATCCTA-3′ and 5′-CCCTTGCTCACCATAAGCTTTTCCTTCGGGCC-3′ and of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) using primers 5′-GGCCCGAAGGAAAAGCTTATGGTGAGCAAGGG-3′ and 5′-GGCGAATTCTCTAGAGTCGCGGCCGCTTTA-3′. Templates for amplification were plasmid pGEX2T-Tat (3Marzio G. Tyagi M. Gutierrez M.I. Giacca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 23: 13519-13524Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA) respectively. The two amplification products contain complementary sequences at the 3′ and 5′ regions of the coding strands of Tat and GFP, respectively. They were gel purified, mixed, annealed, and amplified with the external primers to obtain a single amplification products, which contains Bam HI andEco RI sites at the extremities. To study the kinetics of recombinant Tat internalization, HL3T1 cells were seeded in 24-well or 10-cm-diameter dishes at the density of 1–2 × 104cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, cell cultures were washed twice and incubated for an additional 24 h in fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μm chloroquine, and recombinant Tat protein. Incubation in the presence of chloroquine favors Tat uptake by modifying the pH of endolysosomal vesicles and preventing protein degradation (46Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. At the end of incubation, cells were extracted, and the amount of CAT protein present in the cell extracts was determined by the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, cells were collected and analyzed by FACS (see below). Recombinant GST-Tat was labeled with 125I (17 Ci/mg, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using iodogen (Pierce) to a specific radioactivity of 400 cpm/fmol as described previously (55Rusnati M. Tulipano G.

HL3T1 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at the density of 45,000 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, cell cultures were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in binding medium (serum-free medium containing 0.15% gelatin and 20 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.5) with the addition of 20 ng/ml [125I]GST-Tat plus 200 ng/ml unlabeled GST-Tat as a carrier and in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine. After incubation, medium was removed, cells were washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.1. Radioactivity of the cell lysates was measured, and nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled GST-Tat (4 μg/ml), was subtracted. For immunocytochemistry, HL3T1 cells were grown to about 60% confluency on glass coverslips. The GST-Tat protein (1 μg/ml) was added to the cell culture medium in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine. After different time intervals, cells were washed 6 times with PBS and fixed with a cold acetone:methanol mixture (50:50) for 15 min. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-Triton X-100) and then 5 times with PBS for 5 min each. Cells were then incubated with an anti-Tat monoclonal antibody (ADP352/NT3, obtained from the Medical Research Council repository for AIDS research) for 1 h, washed 5 times with warm PBS (25 to 28 °C), and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with warm PBS/Triton X-100 and with warm PBS for 5 min each time. For each immunostaining, one coverslip was incubated in secondary antibody alone as a negative control for background immunofluorescence. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 5 min, and coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted on glass slides. Slides were observed using Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. To analyze GFP-Tat internalization by cell cytometry, cells were washed four times with PBS, trypsinized, again washed with PBS, and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). A total of 10,000 events per sample were considered. The soluble GAGs (heparin, from porcine intestinal mucosa; chondroitin sulfate A, from bovine trachea; chondroitin sulfate B, from porcine intestinal mucosa; and chondroitin sulfate C, from shark cartilage) and dextran sulfate (molecular weight, 5000) were all purchased from Sigma. In the FACS experiments with soluble GAG analogues, 5 × 105 CHO K1 cells were incubated in fresh culture medium with the addition of 1 μg/ml GST-Tat-GFP protein, 100 μm chloroquine, and the appropriate amount of GAG dissolved in PBS. Inhibition of Tat transactivation by soluble GAGs was studied in 3 × 105 CHO K1 cells transfected with 1 μg of pBlue-LTR-CAT (containing an LTR-CAT cassette, a kind gift of B. Berkhout) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with different concentrations of GAGs along with 1 μg/ml GST-Tat-GFP and 100 μmchloroquine in fresh culture medium for 14 h. After this time period, cells were washed four times with PBS, and fresh culture medium was added. CAT assays were performed after 36 h according to standard protocols (59Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and after normalization for transfection efficiency. Each experimental point was performed in triplicate. Enzymatic treatment with GAG lyases was performed as described (60Summerford C. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 CHO K1 cells were incubated with the GAG lyases (Sigma; dissolved in PBS) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% gelatin, and 0.1% glucose for 40 min at 37 °C in a CO2incubator. Cells were then washed gently 6 times with PBS and incubated in Ham's F-10 medium without serum in the presence of 1 μg/ml GST-Tat-GFP protein and 100 μm chloroquine for 5 h. Cells were then washed 4 times with PBS, trypsinized, washed again with complete Ham's F-10 medium, resuspended, and used for FACS analysis. Each experimental point was performed in triplicate. For CAT assays, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm-diameter dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with either pBlue-LTR-CAT (1 μg) alone or together with pCDNA3-Tat-GFP (1 μg). The latter plasmid was obtained by recovering the Tat-GFP cassette of plasmid pGEX2T-Tat-GFP using Eco RI andBam HI and cloning into the respective sites of vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In this plasmid, Tat-GFP is expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. After lipofection, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh culture medium for additional 24 h. Cells transfected with pBlue-LTR-CAT alone were supplied with 1 μg/ml GST-Tat-GFP in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for additional 24 h in fresh medium. Finally, cells were scraped off the dishes using a rubber policeman, and cell extracts were used for CAT assays. Wild type CHO K1 cells, the mutated pgs A-745 clone, and HeLa cells were transfected by Lipofectin with 1 μg/ml pBlue-LTR-CAT. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and plated in equal number with CHO and A-745 cell clones expressing Tat-GFP, with the combinations reported in Fig. 7A. Cells were incubated in complete medium containing 100 μmchloroquine. Seventy-two hours later, cells were scraped off the plate with a rubber policeman, and cell lysates were analyzed for CAT activity. To explore the mechanisms of HIV-1 LTR transactivation by Tat, in the last few years we have taken advantage of the property of a GST-Tat fusion protein to enter cells when added to the cell culture medium (3Marzio G. Tyagi M. Gutierrez M.I. Giacca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 23: 13519-13524Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 48Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein contains the first 86 amino acids of Tat fused at the C terminus of the GST protein (∼34 kDa total). The kinetics of HIV-1 LTR transactivation by GST-Tat and by a fusion protein additionally containing the GFP at the C terminus (∼60 kDa total) are shown in Fig. 1 A. LTR transactivation starts to be observed a few hours after the addition of GST-Tat to the culture medium of HL3T1 cells (containing an integrated LTR-CAT reporter gene that is silent in the absence of stimulation) and peaks at 10–15 h. The kinetics of LTR transactivation by the GST-Tat-GFP protein is delayed by a few hours but still reaches the same levels after 15–20 h. These data are consistent with previous findings showing a peak of LTR-CAT mRNA expression ∼5 h after the addition of exogenous GST-Tat protein to the culture medium (48Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, LTR transactivation is already appreciable at a concentration of GST-Tat protein equal to 50 ng/ml (∼1.5 nm) and reaches a plateau at 200 ng/ml. A similar dose response curve is evident for the GST-Tat-GFP protein when considering the molar differences between the two preparations.

There is increasing evidence that butyrate, a major metabolite of intestinal bacteria and crucial energy source for gut epithelial cells, also possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Its influence on cytokine production, however, is not established. Here, we report that butyrate strongly inhibits interleukin-12 (IL-12) production by suppression of both IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 mRNA accumulation, but massively enhances IL-10 secretion in Staphylococcus aureus cell-stimulated human monocytes. The effect of butyrate on IL-12 production was irreversible upon the addition of neutralizing antibodies to IL-10 or transforming growth factor b1 and of indomethacin. In anti-CD3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, butyrate enhanced IL-10 and IL-4 secretion but reduced the release of IL-2 and interferon-g. The latter effect was in part a result of suppressed IL-12 production but also a result of inhibition of IL-12 receptor expression on T cells. These data demonstrate a novel anti-inflammatory property of butyrate that may have broad implications for the regulation of immune responses in vivo and could be exploited as new therapeutic approach in inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2142793823,"Abstract The central nervous system octapeptide, neuropeptide FF (NPFF), is believed to play a role in pain modulation and opiate tolerance. Two G protein-coupled receptors, NPFF1 and NPFF2, were isolated from human and rat central nervous system tissues. NPFF specifically bound to NPFF1 (K d = 1.13 nm) and NPFF2 (K d = 0.37 nm), and both receptors were activated by NPFF in a variety of heterologous expression systems. The localization of mRNA and binding sites of these receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the lateral hypothalamus, the spinal trigeminal nuclei, and the thalamic nuclei supports a role for NPFF in pain modulation. Among the receptors with the highest amino acid sequence homology to NPFF1 and NPFF2 are members of the orexin, NPY, and cholecystokinin families, which have been implicated in feeding. These similarities together with the finding that BIBP3226, an anorexigenic Y1 receptor ligand, also binds to NPFF1 suggest a potential role for NPFF1 in feeding. The identification of NPFF1 and NPFF2 will help delineate their roles in these and other physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1977466283,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a finite life span that is measured by the number of daughter cells an individual produces. The 20 genes known to determine yeast life span appear to function in more than one pathway, implicating a variety of physiological processes in yeast longevity. Less attention has been focused on environmental effects on yeast aging. We have examined the role that nutritional status plays in determining yeast life span. Reduction of the glucose concentration in the medium led to an increase in life span and to a delay in appearance of an aging phenotype. The increase in life span was the more extensive the lower the glucose levels. Life extension was also elicited by decreasing the amino acids content of the medium. This suggests that it is the decline in calories and not a particular nutrient that is responsible, in striking similarity to the effect on aging of caloric restriction in mammals. The caloric restriction effect did not require the induction of the retrograde response pathway, which signals the functional status of the mitochondrion and determines longevity. Furthermore, deletion of RTG3, a downstream mediator in this pathway, and caloric restriction had an additive effect, resulting in the largest increase (123%) in longevity described thus far in yeast. Thus, retrograde response and caloric restriction operate along distinct pathways in determining yeast longevity. These pathways may be exclusive, at least in part. This provides evidence for multiple mechanisms of metabolic control in yeast aging. Inasmuch as caloric restriction lowers blood glucose levels, this study raises the possibility that reduced glucose alters aging at the cellular level in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2026642794,"Recently, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) has been shown to provide a specific marker for lymphatic endothelia in certain human tissues. In this study, we have investigated the expression of VEGFR-3 and its ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D in fetal and adult tissues. VEGFR-3 was consistently detected in the endothelium of lymphatic vessels such as the thoracic duct, but fenestrated capillaries of several organs including the bone marrow, splenic and hepatic sinusoids, kidney glomeruli and endocrine glands also expressed this receptor. VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which bind both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 were expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, intense cytoplasmic staining for VEGF-C was observed in neuroendocrine cells such as the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans, prolactin secreting cells of the anterior pituitary, adrenal medullary cells, and dispersed neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract. VEGF-D was observed in the innermost zone of the adrenal cortex and in certain dispersed neuroendocrine cells. These results suggest that VEGF-C and VEGF-D have a paracrine function and perhaps a role in peptide release from secretory granules of certain neuroendocrine cells to surrounding capillaries."
https://openalex.org/W2145439554,"Lysosomal cysteine proteinases of the papain family are involved in lysosomal bulk proteolysis, major histocompatibility complex class II mediated antigen presentation, prohormone processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Cathepsin L (CTSL) is a ubiquitously expressed major representative of the papain-like family of cysteine proteinases. To investigate CTSL in vivo functions, the gene was inactivated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. CTSL-deficient mice develop periodic hair loss and epidermal hyperplasia, acanthosis, and hyperkeratosis. The hair loss is due to alterations of hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling, dilatation of hair follicle canals, and disturbed club hair formation. Hyperproliferation of hair follicle epithelial cells and basal epidermal keratinocytes-both of ectodermal origin-are the primary characteristics underlying the mutant phenotype. Pathological inflammatory responses have been excluded as a putative cause of the skin and hair disorder. The phenotype of CTSL-deficient mice is reminiscent of the spontaneous mouse mutant furless (fs). Analyses of the ctsl gene of fs mice revealed a G149R mutation inactivating the proteinase activity. CTSL is the first lysosomal proteinase shown to be essential for epidermal homeostasis and regular hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1975370063,"Apoptosis of arterial cells induced by oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL) is thought to contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. However, most data on apoptotic effects and mechanisms of OxLDL were obtained with extensively oxidized LDL unlikely to occur in early stages of atherosclerotic lesions. We now demonstrate that mildly oxidized LDL generated by incubation with oxygen radical-producing xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) induces apoptosis in primary cultures of human coronary endothelial and SMC, as determined by TUNEL technique, DNA laddering, and FACS analysis. Apoptosis was markedly reduced when X/XO-LDL was generated in the presence of different oxygen radical scavengers. Apoptotic signals were mediated by intramembrane domains of both Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors I and II. Blocking of Fas ligand (FasL) reduced apoptosis by 50% and simultaneous blocking of FasL and TNF receptors by 70%. Activation of apoptotic receptors was accompanied by an increase of proapoptotic and a decrease in antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family and resulted in marked activation of class I and II caspases. Mildly oxidized LDL also activated MAP and Jun kinases and increased p53 and other transcription factors (ATF-2, ELK-1, CREB, AP-1). Inhibitors of Map and Jun kinase significantly reduced apoptosis. Our results provide the first evidence that OxLDL-induced apoptosis involves TNF receptors and Jun activation. More important, they demonstrate that even mildly oxidized LDL formed in atherosclerotic lesions may activate a broad cascade of oxygen radical-sensitive signaling pathways affecting apoptosis and other processes influencing the evolution of plaques. Thus, we suggest that extensive oxidative modifications of LDL are not necessary to influence signal transduction and transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2135698835,"When incubated at 4 degrees C, cultured rat hepatocytes or liver endothelial cells exhibit pronounced injury and, during earlier rewarming, marked apoptosis. Both processes are mediated by reactive oxygen species, and marked protective effects of iron chelators as well as the protection provided by various other antioxidants suggest that hydroxyl radicals, formed by classical Fenton chemistry, are involved. However, when we measured the Fenton chemistry educt hydrogen peroxide and its precursor, the superoxide anion radical, formation of both had markedly decreased and steady-state levels of hydrogen peroxide did not alter during cold incubation of either liver endothelial cells or hepatocytes. Similarly, there was no evidence of an increase in O2-/H2O2 release contributing to cold-induced apoptosis occurring on rewarming. In contrast to the release/level of O2- and H2O2, cellular homeostasis of the transition metal iron is likely to play a key role during cold incubation of cultured hepatocytes: the hepatocellular pool of chelatable iron, measured on a single-cell level using laser scanning microscopy and the fluorescent indicator phen green, increased from 3.1 +/- 2.3 microM (before cold incubation) to 7.7 +/- 2.4 microM within 90 min after initiation of cold incubation. This increase in the cellular chelatable iron pool was reversible on rewarming after short periods of cold incubation. The cold-induced increase in the hepatocellular chelatable iron pool was confirmed using the calcein method. These data suggest that free radical-mediated hypothermia injury/cold-induced apoptosis is primarily evoked by alterations in the cellular iron homeostasis/a rapid increase in the cellular chelatable iron pool and not by increased formation of O2-/H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W2157086793,"Lipid and glycolipid diffusible mediators are involved in the intracellular progression and amplification of apoptotic signals. GD3 ganglioside is rapidly synthesized from accumulated ceramide after the clustering of death-inducing receptors and triggers apoptosis. Here we show that GD3 induces dissipation of DeltaPsim and swelling of isolated mitochondria, which results in the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, apoptosis inducing factor, and caspase 9. Soluble factors released from GD3-treated mitochondria are sufficient to trigger DNA fragmentation in isolated nuclei. All these effects can be blocked by cyclosporin A, suggesting that GD3 is acting at the level of the permeability transition pore complex. We found that endogenous GD3 accumulates within mitochondria of cells undergoing apoptosis after ceramide exposure. Accordingly, suppression of GD3 synthase (ST8) expression in intact cells substantially prevents ceramide-induced DeltaPsim dissipation, indicating that endogenously synthesized GD3 induces mitochondrial changes in vivo. Finally, enforced expression of bcl-2 significantly prevents GD3-induced mitochondrial changes, caspase 9 activation, and apoptosis. These results show that mitochondria are a key destination for apoptogenic GD3 ganglioside along the lipid pathway to programmed cell death and indicate that relevant GD3 targets are under bcl-2 control."
https://openalex.org/W2040130844,"Arrestins quench the signaling of a wide variety of G protein-coupled receptors by virtue of high-affinity binding to phosphorylated activated receptors. The high selectivity of arrestins for this particular functional form of receptor ensures their timely binding and dissociation. In a continuing effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for arrestin's selectivity, we used the visual arrestin model to probe the functions of its N-terminal β-strand I comprising the highly conserved hydrophobic element Val-Ile-Phe (residues 11–13) and the adjacent positively charged Lys14 and Lys15. Charge elimination and reversal in positions 14 and 15 dramatically reduce arrestin binding to phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (P-Rh*). The same mutations in the context of various constitutively active arrestin mutants (which bind to P-Rh*, dark phosphorylated rhodopsin (P-Rh), and unphosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (Rh*)) have minimum impact on P-Rh* and Rh* binding and virtually eliminate P-Rh binding. These results suggest that the two lysines “guide” receptor-attached phosphates toward the phosphorylation-sensitive trigger Arg175 and participate in phosphate binding in the active state of arrestin. The elimination of the hydrophobic side chains of residues 11–13 (triple mutation V11A, I12A, and F13A) moderately enhances arrestin binding to P-Rh and Rh*. The effects of triple mutation V11A, I12A, and F13A in the context of phosphorylation-independent mutants suggest that residues 11–13 play a dual role. They stabilize arrestin's basal conformation via interaction with hydrophobic elements in arrestin's C-tail and α-helix I as well as its active state by interactions with alternative partners. In the context of the recently solved crystal structure of arrestin's basal state, these findings allow us to propose a model of initial phosphate-driven structural rearrangements in arrestin that ultimately result in its transition into the active receptor-binding state.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). First, the same active receptor conformation that catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on G proteins is specifically phosphorylated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase. The active phosphoreceptor is then recognized by a member of the arrestin protein family, which binds tightly to it and makes G protein interaction impossible (apparently, by simple steric exclusion (2Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). In photoreceptor cells, visual arrestin dissociates after light-activated rhodopsin decays into opsin (3Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Jakes H. Ingebritsen T.S. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15770-15773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestin dissociation allows rhodopsin dephosphorylation and regeneration (3Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Jakes H.

Nonvisual arrestins bind various components of the internalization machinery of the coated pit with high affinity (4Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As a result, in other cells, the complex of nonvisual arrestins with receptors is often internalized via coated pits and can initiate signaling via mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in the process (6Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 2: 177-183Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The loss of active receptor conformation (presumably due to ligand dissociation) facilitates arrestin dissociation, rendering the phosphoreceptor accessible to protein phosphatases. The dephosphorylated receptor can then be recycled back to the plasma membrane (7Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, timely binding and dissociation of arrestin are equally important for high fidelity of this quenching mechanism in all G protein-coupled receptor-driven signaling systems. Both are ensured by a remarkable selectivity of arrestins for the phosphorylated activated form of their cognate receptors. Based on a crystal structure of the basal (inactive) state of visual arrestin (8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). There is an unusual network of buried charged residues in the fulcrum of the two-domain arrestin molecule, which we termed the “polar core” (8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 9Vishnivetsky S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

A very delicate charge balance in the polar core due to ion pairing ensures that arrestin is restrained in its basal state. These charged residues include the previously described phosphate-sensitive trigger Arg175 (Arg169 in β-arrestin; Arg170 in arrestin 3) (10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Charge-reversal mutations in the polar core, which disrupt the critical ion pair or upset the charge balance, yield arrestin with enhanced binding to unphosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (Rh*).1 On the other hand, a combination of these mutations that restores the overall charge balance of the polar core yields mutants virtually as selective for P-Rh* as wild type arrestin (8Hirsch J.A.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that when the receptor-attached phosphate moiety comes close to the polar core, it upsets the charge balance, allowing arrestin to undergo a transition into its active high-affinity receptor-binding state (8Hirsch J.A.

Here we use a visual arrestin-rhodopsin model to further explore the mechanism of arrestin's strict preference for phosphoreceptors and describe a previously unappreciated phosphate-binding element in the N terminus of arrestin. This two-residue element (Lys14, Lys15) apparently plays a key role in the process of arrestin activation, as well as in phosphate interaction in the active receptor-binding state of arrestin (i.e. after the polar core is rearranged). An adjacent structural element in the N terminus (Val11, Ile12, and Phe13) participates in intramolecular interactions stabilizing the structurally well-defined (8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) basal (inactive) conformation and presumably the quite different (14Gurevich V.V.

Together, they create an ingenious failsafe mechanism ensuring arrestin's selectivity for phosphorylated receptors. [γ-32P]ATP, [14C]leucine, and [3H]leucine were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Sepharose 2B and all other chemicals were from the sources described previously (11Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol.

Rabbit reticulocyte lysate and SP6 RNA polymerase were prepared as described previously (20Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 11-cis-Retinal was generously supplied by Dr. R. K. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Bovine visual arrestin cDNA (21Shinohara T. Dietzschold B. Craft C.M. Wistow G. Early J.J. Donoso L.A. Horwitz J. Tao R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The plasmid pARR-VSP was constructed and modified as described previously (10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

This pGEM2-based plasmid encodes bovine wild type arrestin with an “idealized” 5′-untranslated region (20Gurevich V.V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used for all further mutagenesis. All mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using an appropriate mutagenizing oligonucleotide as a forward primer and an oligonucleotide downstream from the far restriction site to be used for subcloning as a reverse primer. Resulting fragments of various lengths and an appropriate primer upstream of the near restriction site were then used as reverse and forward primers, respectively, for the second round of polymerase chain reaction. The resulting fragments were digested with EcoRI/BamHI (N terminus),BamHI/SalI (α-helix I), orBstXI/HindIII (C-tail) and subcloned into appropriately digested pARR-SC. Double and triple mutants were constructed by excising fragments with one mutation and subcloning them into an appropriately digested plasmid carrying another mutation. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with HindIII.In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (14Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

All arrestin proteins were labeled by incorporation of [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine, with the specific activity of the mix = 1.5–3 Ci/mmol, resulting in the specific activity of arrestin proteins within the range of 54–90 Ci/mmol (120–200 dpm/fmol). The translation of each of the arrestin mutants used in this study produced a single labeled protein band with the expected mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two parameters were used for the assessment of mutant stability (15Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). First, protein yields in thein vitro translation are known to correlate with stability because misfolded or denatured proteins are rapidly destroyed by proteases present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (15Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Second, denatured proteins tend to aggregate and are pelleted by centrifugation at 350,000 × g for 1 h. As an estimate of a mutant's relative stability, we used its yield multiplied by the percentage of protein remaining in the supernatant after incubation for 10 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation. This integral parameter calculated for a mutant was expressed as a percentage of that for wild type arrestin (15Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The relative stability of all mutants used in this study exceeds 55%. Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes were prepared, phosphorylated with rhodopsin kinase, and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal as described previously (14Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

The average stoichiometry of phosphorylation for the rhodopsin preparations used in these studies was 2.4 mol phosphate/mol rhodopsin. In vitrotranslated arrestins (100 fmol) were incubated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium acetate with 7.5 pmol of the various functional forms of rhodopsin in a final volume of 50 μl for 5 min at 37 °C either in the dark or in room light (14Gurevich V.V.

The samples were immediately cooled on ice and loaded (under dim red light for dark samples) onto 2 ml Sepharose 2B columns equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. Bound arrestin eluted with the rod outer segments in the void volume (between 0.5 and 1.1 ml). Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 0.3 μg of liposomes (<1% of the arrestin present in the assay) was subtracted.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All known activating mutations that do not directly affect the polar core are likely to disturb the three-element interaction that in the basal state involves β-strand I and α-helix I in the N-domain and β-strand XX in the C-tail (8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be another “hot spot” in arrestin. (Note that here and below, all structural elements are designated according to Ref. 8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To find out how structurally diverse mutations yield similar phenotypes, we combined the Δ(2–16) mutation with other activating mutations. Unexpectedly, most of the combinations demonstrated lower P-Rh* and Rh* binding than the parental mutants, with arrestinΔ(2–16)(R175E) showing the most dramatic 45- and 12-fold reduction in P-Rh* and Rh* binding, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Two aspects regarding the binding profile of the combination mutants appear most remarkable: similar to the Δ(2–16) mutant (and in sharp contrast to all other phosphorylation-independent forms of arrestin), they all demonstrate virtually no binding to P-Rh, and, if anything, they prefer Rh* over P-Rh* (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the Δ(2–16) mutation works as an “override switch,” making all combination mutants functionally similar to the Δ(2–16) mutant itself. The only exception is the combination of Δ(2–16) and R175E, where the interaction of two activating mutations yields a protein with remarkable stability (140% of wild type) but very limited propensity for transition into an active rhodopsin-binding state. Of the 15 residues eliminated by the Δ(2–16) mutation, four (12 through 15 in bovine visual arrestin) are conserved fromCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila to humans (Fig. 2). The conserved sequence includes two chemically diverse elements: a group of 2 or 3 bulky hydrophobic residues, and 2 positively charged lysines (Fig. 2). To test what part of the N terminus is responsible for the effects of the Δ(2–16) mutation, we constructed arrestins with three shorter deletions: Δ(2–6), Δ(7–10), and Δ(11–16). Not surprisingly, the region 11–16, comprising all conserved residues, appears to be largely responsible for the effects of the Δ(2–16) mutation (Fig. 3 A). The two elements in the 11–16 region play essentially opposite roles in arrestin binding (Fig. 3 B). The N3A mutation yields a phosphorylation-independent arrestin with somewhat lower potency than R175E, whereas the K14A, K15A double mutation reduces arrestin binding to P-Rh* about 10-fold. This effect cannot be explained by its reduced stability (it is about 60% of wild type, i.e. similar to that of R175E mutant). Adjacent residues Ile16 and His10 do not appear to play a significant functional role (Fig. 3 B).Figure 2Sequence alignment of the N termini of arrestins and the structure of selected mutants used in this study. Alignment between bovine visual (rod) arrestin (SWISSPROT accession number P08168), human visual (rod) arrestin (P10523), bovine β-arrestin (P17870), bovine arrestin 3 (P32120), D. melanogaster arrestins A (P15372) and B (P19107), and C. elegans arrestin (P51485).

Binding experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The means ± S.D. from two experiments (each performed in duplicate) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next we tested the role of selected individual residues within the two elements: Ile12, Lys14, and Lys15(Fig. 4). The impact of I12A mutation is minimal, although according to the crystal structure in the basal state Ile12 interacts with at least five partners in arrestin's C-tail and α-helix I (8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Apparently, either neighboring residues (Val11 and/or Phe13) can substitute for Ile12 or the stability of the complex is the result of a cooperative multiresidue interaction, as is the case for the C-tail (15Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), another participant of the three-element interaction. The effects of both K14A and K15A mutations are profound: a 2-fold and nearly 8-fold reduction in P-Rh* binding, respectively (Fig. 4 A). In fact, K15A is the most potent loss of function 1-residue mutation characterized thus far in arrestin (9Vishnivetsky S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1992005503,"The intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) belongs to a family of 15 kDa clamshell-like proteins that are found in many different tissues. So far, nine types have been identified. Their primary structures are highly conserved between species but somewhat less so among the different types. The function of these proteins, many of which are highly expressed, is not well understood. Their ability to bind lipid ligands suggests a role in lipid metabolism, but direct evidence for this idea is still lacking. We tested the hypothesis that I-FABP serves an essential role in the assimilation of dietary fatty acids by disrupting its gene (Fabpi) in the mouse. We discovered that Fabpi-/- mice are viable, but they display alterations in body weight and are hyperinsulinemic. Male Fabpi-/- mice had elevated plasma triacylglycerols and weighed more regardless of the dietary fat content. In contrast, female Fabpi-/- mice gained less weight in response to a high-fat diet. The results clearly demonstrate that I-FABP is not essential for dietary fat absorption. We propose that I-FABP functions as a lipid-sensing component of energy homeostasis that alters body weight gain in a gender-specific fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2013538303,"Endostatin is a cleavage product of collagen XVIII that strongly inhibits tumor angiogenesis. To determine if endostatin affects other angiogenic processes, we generated full-thickness excisional wounds on the back of mice that were systemically treated with recombinant murine endostatin. No macroscopic abnormalities of the wound healing process were observed. Histological analysis revealed normal wound contraction and re-epithelialization, but a slight reduction in granulation tissue formation and reduced matrix deposition at the wound edge. The blood vessel density in the wounds of endostatin-treated mice was not affected. However, ultrastructural analysis demonstrated severe abnormalities in blood vessel maturation. The wound vessels in the endostatin-treated mice were narrowed or closed with an irregular luminal surface, resulting in a severe reduction in the number of functional vessels and extravasation of erythrocytes. Endostatin treatment did not affect the expression level and localization of collagen XVIII mRNA and protein. Furthermore, the angiogenesis regulators vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-1, and angiopoietin-2 were normally expressed in the wounds of endostatin-treated mice. However, expression of the major wound matrix proteins fibronectin and collagens I and III was significantly reduced. This reduction is likely to explain the reduced density of the wound matrix. Our results demonstrate that endostatin treatment reduces the number of functional blood vessels and the matrix density in the granulation tissue, but does not significantly affect the overall wound healing process."
https://openalex.org/W2147428009,"The microarchitecture of bone is regulated by complex interactions between the bone-forming and resorbing cells, and several compounds regulate both actions. For example, vitamin D, which is required for bone mineralization, also stimulates bone resorption. Transgenic mice overexpressing the vitamin D receptor solely in mature cells of the osteoblastic bone-forming lineage were generated to test the potential therapeutic value of shifting the balance of vitamin D activity in favor of bone formation. Cortical bone was 5% wider and 15% stronger in these mice due to a doubling of periosteal mineral apposition rate without altered body weight or calcium homeostatic hormone levels. A 20% increase in trabecular bone volume in transgenic vertebrae was also observed, unexpectedly associated with a 30% reduction in resorption surface rather than greater bone formation. These findings indicate anabolic vitamin D activity in bone and identify a previously unknown pathway from mature osteoblastic cells to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, counterbalancing the known stimulatory action through immature osteoblastic cells. A therapeutic approach that both stimulates cortical anabolic and inhibits trabecular resorptive pathways would be ideal for treatment of osteoporosis and other osteopenic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2088469845,"Activation of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) transcription factor is intimately associated with its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Using the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, we demonstrate shuttling of the RELA subunit of NFκB and the inhibitory subunit IκBα between these two compartments in unstimulated cells. Determination of the kinetics of nuclear entry shows marked differences for the two components; the entry of IκBα occurs more rapidly than RELA. The shuttling is suggested to be a consequence of the cytoplasmic dissociation of the NFκB·IκB complex rather than its direct nuclear import or degradation and resynthesis of IκBα. Using previously published kinetic data, this proposition is born out by the deduction that 17% of NFκB is not complexed to IκBα in a resting cell. A numerical model is presented to validate the proposed regulation of NFκB subcellular localization consequent in part on the nuclear export function and in part on the cytoplasmic retention function of IκBα. We suggest that the non-saturated interaction of NFκB with the inhibitor may enhance the specificity of action of IκB proteins on different NFκB dimers and allow additional modes of regulation of IκB function.

The known members of this family are c-REL, RELA, RELB, p50, and p52.

The current model for NFκB function postulates that the transcription factor is anchored in the cytoplasm by association with the inhibitor in unstimulated cells (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Whereas both NFκB and IκB have nuclear localization signals, resulting in import of the free factors to the nucleus, these are mutually masked within the complex to abolish their nuclear import functions (7Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, without subsequent degradation, has also been reported to release active NFκB into the nucleus (13Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.M.

In addition to nuclear translocation, phosphorylation of NFκB may be important for its full activation (14Wang D. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol.

This phosphorylation may be induced by parallel pathways initiated by the same stimulus as that causing IκB degradation. We have previously developed quantitative green fluorescent protein-based assays to determine the activation of NFκB in single, living cells (18Carlotti F. Chapman R. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37941-37949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated activation by IL-1 to be dependent on the level of NFκB expression. In particular, as the expression level of NFκB increased, its rate of nuclear translocation saturated at approximately 60 molecules per s. The location of the rate-limiting step was proposed to lie within the signal transduction cascade. In this paper, we examine how the kinetics of activation are modified when nuclear export of NFκB/IκB is blocked using the specific inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export leptomycin B (LMB) (19Kudo N.

These data demonstrate a greater importance for nuclear export function of IκBα in maintaining a low basal activity of nuclear NFκB than has previously been supposed. We have developed a numerical model to test this mechanism of NFκB regulation against our observations. Plasmids pEGFP-RELA (18Carlotti F. Chapman R. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol.

Interleukin 1β was a gift of the Immunex Corporation, and LMB was a gift of Dr. Minoru Yoshida. Cycloheximide was obtained from Sigma, and MG132 was from Calbiochem. Monkey arterial smooth muscle cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used between transfers 9 and 13. For microscopic assays, 20,000 cells were plated in four-chamber coverslips (NUNC) 2 days prior to transfection with 2 μg of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate co-precipitation as described previously (18Carlotti F.

For studies involving IκBα·EGFP, the plasmid was co-transfected withpCMV-RELA to achieve cytoplasmic localization. 2L. Yang, F. Carlotti, and E. E. Qwarnstrom, manuscript in preparation. Co-transfection of IκBα with EGFP·RELA was not necessary because EGFP·RELA induces expression of the endogenous IκBα gene (21Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). For the ECFP·RELA/IκBα·EYFP cotransfection studies, the plasmid ratio was varied from 1:1 to 1:4 to allow the analysis of cells with high concentrations of free IκBα·EYFP. Analysis of IL-1/LMB stimulation of IL-6 production was performed on cells plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes (75% confluent, plated 48 h prior to stimulation). The concentration of IL-6 in the supernatant was determined at the end point by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quantikine, R & D Systems Inc.). EGFP·RELA and IκBα·EGFP were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics confocal laser scanning microscope with a 37 °C stage incubator. The images were analyzed as described previously (18Carlotti F. Chapman R. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37941-37949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to yield parameter values as described below. The microscopy was performed with standardized laser power (10 mW) and photomultiplier tube (667 V) settings but variable attenuation of the incident laser beam to allow on-scale recordings of both bright and faintly fluorescent cells. Fluorescence units are defined as the pixel density of the image divided by the percentage attenuation of the incident laser illumination and as such are directly proportional to EGFP fusion protein concentration. The nuclear import rate is defined as the absolute rate of increase in nuclear fluorescence during the approximately linear phase (i.e. exclusive of the initial lag and later plateau stages). The relative nuclear import rate is defined as the nuclear import rate divided by the initial cytoplasmic fluorescence; the advantage of this measure is that it is independent of the expression level when the EGFP fusion is expressed at levels that do no perturb the endogenous system. The final measurement that we use is relative fluorescent units when presenting average time courses. These are calculated by dividing each measurement for a single cell by the initial cytoplasmic fluorescence of that cell and then averaging the values for the group of cells. This method has the advantages that the cells are equally weighted in the final curve and that meaningful standard deviations can be calculated. ECFP·RELA and IκBα·EYFP were visualized using a C4743–95 12-bit Hamamatsu digital camera driven by OpenLab software (Improvision) with the specific filter sets XF114 and XF104 (Omega Optical). Note that the fluorescent units for these proteins are not identical with those obtained for EGFP, because their excitation/detection characteristics differ. Numerical modelling was performed using an iterative model developed in the Microsoft EXCEL VBA programming language (available on request). For simplicity, the model treats NFκB and IκB as a single species partitioning between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. All parameter values are entered at run time using a simple user interface. Initial parameter values were estimated according to our data and previous reports as follows. To assign NFκB concentrations, we used our previous estimate for the concentration of RELA at 60,000 molecules per cell. Because the levels of IκB are regulated by free NFκB, IκB is assumed to be present in 10% excess relative to NFκB. We use the dissociation constant (koff/kon) for the interaction of the p50/RELA dimer with IκBα (3 nm (23Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) because this is the highest affinity complex and is likely to be predominant in smooth muscle cells. The ratio of import/export rates (kimp/kexp) for IκBα was taken to be 2, because on gross overexpression of IκBα·EGFP, when it is likely to be present largely free of NFκB, it partitions with a 2:1 nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. Because grossly overexpressed EGFP·RELA is substantially nuclear, the ratio of kimp/kexp for NFκB was taken to be 50. For assignment of absolute import and export rates, we have used kon and koffvalues for the NFκB·IκB complex of 18,400,000m−1 min−1and 0.055 min−1, respectively (23Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which constrains the nuclear import rates for consistency with the observed resting partitioning of NFκB/IκB and their rates of nuclear import following LMB treatment (these rates are determined by running the model). For the purpose of testing the model, we have assumed that the direct import of NFκB·IκB into the nucleus is not significant. We have previously reported that IL-1-stimulated nuclear translocation of EGFP·RELA is impaired at high expression levels (18Carlotti F. Chapman R. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37941-37949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This impairment might be caused by overexpression or rapid resynthesis of IκBα in the transfected cells, saturation of the nuclear import machinery, or kinetic limitations of the signal transduction pathway. To explore these possibilities, we have investigated the consequences for IL-1-induced import of blocking the nuclear export pathway using the specific inhibitor LMB. Treatment of cells with LMB alone resulted in the nuclear accumulation of EGFP·RELA (Fig. 1 A), which indicates that, even in resting cells, EGFP·RELA cycles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The rate of LMB-induced nuclear translocation of EGFP·RELA is lower than that induced by IL-1 in cells expressing physiological levels of the fusion protein. Furthermore, whereas the LMB-induced translocation is almost linear during the first 60 min of treatment (Fig. 1 B) and displays minimal lag time, the IL-1-induced response has a distinct lag phase and attains a plateau. The time course of nuclear translocation in cells treated with both IL-1 and LMB also shows a plateau but at a level (6-fold above the initial cytoplasmic concentration) that is more than additive than for LMB and IL-1 alone (1.3× at 60 min and 2.5×, respectively). This level of nuclear translocation depletes approximately 70% of cytoplasmic EGFP·RELA. To clarify the difference in response to IL-1 and LMB, we determined how the rate of nuclear translocation in individual cells varies according to the expression level of EGFP·RELA (Fig. 1 C). Whereas the response to IL-1 saturates, the response to LMB is approximately linear with respect to the EGFP·RELA expression level. The maximum absolute translocation rate in response to LMB is higher than that in IL-1-stimulated cells, indicating that the limiting factor in the latter is not the import apparatus. Furthermore, the effects of IL-1 plus LMB are clearly greater than additive, indicating increased nuclear to cytoplasmic transport of EGFP·RELA following IL-1 stimulation. However, blocking the nuclear export pathway does not significantly reduce the saturability of IL-1-induced nuclear translocation of EGFP·RELA at high expression levels (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the restriction is within the signal transduction pathway. To further analyze the response to LMB, we have determined its effects on the inhibitory protein IκBα. Treatment of cells with LMB induces the nuclear translocation of IκBα·EGFP (Fig. 2 A). This is in contrast to IL-1, which induces its degradation (data not shown). However, the time dependence of IκBα·EGFP translocation is distinct from that for EGFP·RELA (Fig. 2 B); it is more rapid and distinctly nonlinear. The concentration dependence of translocation is also moderately nonlinear, being reduced in cells expressing the highest levels (Fig. 2, C and D). However, this nonlinearity is only evident in cells with translocation rates above 0.5, rates that are not attained in the EGFP·RELA-transfected cells; so it is possible that a similar nonlinearity may in principle apply for EGFP·RELA translocation. (We cannot analyze cells with higher levels of EGFP·RELA expression because these display constitutive nuclear localization.) The nuclear translocation of NFκB is intimately linked with activation of responsive genes. However, in contrast to the effects of LMB, stimuli that activate NFκB generally do so as a consequence of degradation of IκBα. Therefore, we have investigated whether the nuclear translocation induced by LMB results in activation of NFκB, using production of the NFκB-responsive cytokine IL-6 as a reporter. We find that whereas treatment with IL-1 results in marked increase of IL-6 production, there is no change following treatment with LMB (Fig. 3). Although treatment with IL-1 and LMB together results in enhanced translocation of NFκB as compared with treatment with IL-1 alone, it yields reduced activation, presumably because nuclear NFκB·IκB complexes are less susceptible to degradation than those in the cytoplasm. Thus, although LMB induces the nuclear accumulation of NFκB, this is in an inactive form. In considering the effects of LMB, we suggest that the data can be accounted for by three types of mechanism (Fig. 4). First, IκB and NFκB might enter the nucleus as a complex. Second, IκB and NFκB might dissociate within the cytoplasm, thereby exposing their nuclear import signals, be imported to the nucleus independently, and then reassociate. Finally, degradation of IκB may liberate free NFκB, which translocates into the nucleus, where it associates with newly synthesized IκB. We designed the following experiments to distinguish between these mechanisms. Upon IL-1 stimulation, IκB is degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway that is sensitive to the inhibitor MG132. To determine whether low intensity basal activation of this pathway is responsible for the shuttling of RELA and IκB, cells were treated with LMB and IL-1 in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 5, A and B). The degradation of IκBα and translocation of RELA in response to IL-1 are blocked by MG132, but their shuttling is not. Whereas this eliminates proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB, other pathways of protein degradation may be involved. Therefore, we determined whether new protein synthesis is required to sustain the cytoplasmic localization of RELA by treating cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. There was no translocation of RELA to the nucleus within the time frame of our assays (data not shown), so the degradation-resynthesis mechanism of RELA/IκB cycling can be eliminated. To distinguish between the remaining mechanisms, we examined the effect of free IκBα on the nuclear translocation of RELA in LMB-treated cells. If the basis of the translocation is dissociation, then increasing the concentration of free IκBα should reduce the rate of translocation because it will compete with the nuclear import machinery for free NFκB. It is not possible to obtain a direct measurement of free cytoplasmic IκBα, but it can be inferred from the nuclear IκBα concentration because NFκB-bound IκBα is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas free IκBα distributes between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a 2:1 ratio.2 Furthermore, by using ECFP·RELA plus IκBα·EYFP-transfected cells we can both measure the nuclear translocation rate of RELA and estimate the relative concentration of free cytoplasmic IκBα. Performing this experiment with cells expressing increasing amounts of IκBα·EYFP, we found that those cells with the highest level of nuclear IκBα expression showed a reduced rate of ECFP·RELA import (Fig. 6). We do not believe this is due to competition between IκBα and NFκB at the nuclear pore, because the expression levels are within the linear range of LMB-induced nuclear accumulation (Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore we conclude that the basis for the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling is dissociation of the NFκB·IκB dimer within the cytoplasm and independent import of the subunits into the nucleus. The theoretical validity of this dissociation/reassociation mechanism hinges on the dynamics of NFκB·IκB interactions within the cell. We have previously estimated the intracellular concentration of RELA to be 50 nm (60,000 molecules per cell; volume, 2,000 μm3) (18Carlotti F. Chapman R. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37941-37949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant of IκBα for various NFκB dimers has also been determined; the strongest interaction (3 nm) occurred with the RELA-p50 heterodimer (23Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). If we assume that NFκB is predominantly present as a RELA-p50 heterodimer and that IκBα is present in a small excess, then we predict that ∼17% of cellular NFκB is free of IκB (by substitution into the equation [NFκB]·[IκB] =Kd·[NFκB·IκB]). The presence of so much free NFκB was unexpected, so we examined how the predicted pool of free NFκB varies if the concentration and Kdestimates are modified (Fig. 7). We have previously estimated that the ratio of nuclear:cytoplasmic concentration is 1:10 and that the ratio of their volumes is also 1:10. Therefore, if the predominant function of IκBα is to retain NFκB in the cytoplasm by masking of its nuclear translocation signal, it would be necessary to have no more than 1% uncomplexed NFκB. To obtain a level of free NFκB this low, the estimated concentration/dissociation constant would have to be incorrect by at least 50-fold (Fig. 7). We have considered a simple equilibrium process above, but the actual percentage of free NFκB will be determined by the dynamic equilibrium established between the association/dissociation of NFκB·IκB complexes, the import of free subunits into the nucleus, and the export of associated complexes to the cytoplasm. We propose that rapid export of NFκB·IκB complexes from the nucleus is necessary to maintain the low nuclear concentration of NFκB due to the non-saturated interaction between NFκB and IκB. To investigate the theoretical validity of this mechanism of NFκB/IκB function and better understand the proposed dynamic regulation of NFκB distribution, we developed a model based upon it. Essentially, our model considers two processes: association and dissociation of the NFκB·IκB complexes and import and export of the individual subunits and of the complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 8). Firstly, we have investigated whether the model can account for the nuclear:cytoplasmic distribution of NFκB using the reported concentration of RELA and affinity constant for interaction with IκBα. We found that two parameters are critical, namely the rate of import of IκB and export of the NFκB·IκB complex (Fig. 9 A) and that, provided these are high enough, the model correctly simulates the distribution. Importantly, the underlying role of IκBα is in part to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NFκB and in part to facilitate its nuclear export; neither alone is sufficient. The predictions generated by the model correlate with our experimental results, with one exception; the relative translocation rate predicted at increasing NFκB expression levels is markedly more concentration-dependent than that of the experimental observations (Fig. 9 B). This difference might be explained in two ways. First, it could also be a consequence of exhaustion of the endogenous p50 subunits, resulting in the formation of lower affinity complexes of IκBα with EGFP·RELA homodimers (Kd = 82 nm (23Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). Alternatively, the off rate for the NFκB·IκB complex may be lower than the estimate we used, which would also be in accord with the ability to readily detect complexes by methods such as immunoprecipitation following cell lysis.Figure 9Modelling of parameter values.

First, the free nuclear NFκB concentration increases more gradually as IκB becomes sub-stoichiometric to NFκB, potentially facilitating graded, as opposed to on/off, activation of NFκB (Fig. 9 C). This might have implications for the expression of certain genes at low levels of NFκB activation, in particular the regulation of basal IκBα expression. Second, alterations of the dynamics of the NFκB·IκB interaction can have a pronounced impact on free nuclear NFκB levels (Fig. 9 D). This might be important in the differential regulation of NFκB by alternate members of the IκB gene family or by stimuli that modify IκBα without resulting in its degradation. Much attention is currently being focused on understanding the process of signal transduction in mammalian cells. This work has resulted in the elucidation of a number of pathways, such as the IL-1/NFκB pathway studied in this report. To fully understand how these pathways function, we believe it is necessary to develop numerical models that accurately reflect their properties, and we have therefore used modelling to examine the consistency of our data with the suggested mechanism. Currently, our model is limited to the unstimulated partitioning of NFκB/IκB, but this core can be elaborated to model their redistribution following signal-induced modification/degradation of IκB. Whereas it is true that without exact knowledge of the parameter values the model is only a “guess,” useful insights can still be gained, and the parameters needing to be measured can be better defined. One aspect common to many characterized signal transduction pathways is the involvement of sequentially acting kinases. These steps each have the potential for significant amplification, suggesting that the complete pathway may be subject to a large degree of amplification. However, our previous work has identified a modest limiting rate for nuclear translocation of EGFP·RELA that we suggested may either be due to limitations in the signal transduction pathway or the NFκB nuclear import process. The present data substantiate the conclusion that the limitation is at or upstream of IκBα degradation and not a consequence of limitations on the rate of nuclear import of free NFκB. Our experiments, in accord with other recent reports (24Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 25Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrate that the cytoplasmic localization of NFκB in resting cells is not static but instead the result of balancing fluxes into and out of the nucleus. We demonstrate that the underlying cause for basal RELA and IκBα nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling is the dissociation of IκB·NFκB complexes as opposed to their direct nuclear import or degradation and resynthesis of IκBα. This mechanism is consistent with the previously determined affinity of the IκB-NFκB interaction, which predicts sequestration of ∼83% of NFκB dimers into inactive complexes. Without the nuclear export function of IκBα, the potential activation of NFκB following IκBα degradation is approximately 6-fold. However, the combined action of IκB-dependent nuclear export and formation of inactive complexes gives much lower residual nuclear activity and hence much more stringent regulation. Because nuclear import and export are energy-dependent processes, the futile cycle of NFκB import to and export from the nucleus would appear to be energetically inefficient. Why should the system be designed in this manner when, with a higher affinity of interaction between IκB and NFκB, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling would be unnecessary? With two inhibitory steps (export and anchoring), the activity is more sensitive to small changes in the extent of interaction because the inhibition is proportional to the square of IκB-bound NFκB. If the binding between two molecules is near saturation, a small change in the affinity constant would have negligible effects on their free concentrations; however, under conditions of lower saturation, the same change can have a greater influence on the degree of interaction. This might be important in the differential interaction of the various NFκB dimers with specific IκBs. By keeping the dissociation constant high, specificity of inhibition can be better achieved. Association/dissociation of the inhibitor may also allow for alteration in the nature of the complexes under different growth conditions or following transient activation of the inflammatory response. For example, following activation of NFκB, the synthesis of IκBα is induced. Hence, shortly after inactivation there may be a predominance of inhibitory complexes containing IκBα that are subsequently displaced by other inhibitors. This change may coincide with either greater or lesser sensitivity to specific inducing agents. In addition, it has been reported that IκBα is controlled under some circumstances by tyrosine phosphorylation, which results in dissociation but not degradation (13Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed above, this mechanism is more tenable if the affinity of the complex is relatively low. Similar to the results reported here, recent analysis of the interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with DNA has demonstrated rapid exchange between bound and free pools within living cells (27McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Therefore, dynamic interactions involving transcription factors are probably common within living cells. In conclusion, we propose that the regulation of NFκB is dependent on dynamic shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that underlying this shuttling is dissociation of the transcription factor and inhibitor within the cytoplasm. The numerical model we have developed accurately simulates many aspects of the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of NFκB but identifies areas of inconsistency for future research. Whereas it is well established that IκBα expression is induced by RELA overexpression, determination of precisely how the expression level of IκBα relates to the level of RELA is important to refine our model. Elaboration of the model to consider different NFκB dimers and other IκBs is also necessary but can only be achieved following characterization of their kinetics of interaction. Finally, direct measurement of the rate of nuclear import and export of specific complexes will also be required.

https://openalex.org/W2109136931,"ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are unique metabolic sensors formed by association of Kir6.2, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel, and the sulfonylurea receptor SUR, an ATP binding cassette protein. We identified an ATPase activity in immunoprecipitates of cardiac KATP channels and in purified fusion proteins containing nucleotide binding domains NBD1 and NBD2 of the cardiac SUR2A isoform. NBD2 hydrolyzed ATP with a twofold higher rate compared to NBD1. The ATPase required Mg2+ and was insensitive to ouabain, oligomycin, thapsigargin, or levamisole. K1348A and D1469N mutations in NBD2 reduced ATPase activity and produced channels with increased sensitivity to ATP. KATP channel openers, which bind to SUR, promoted ATPase activity in purified sarcolemma. At higher concentrations, openers reduced ATPase activity, possibly through stabilization of MgADP at the channel site. K1348A and D1469N mutations attenuated the effect of openers on KATP channel activity. Opener-induced channel activation was also inhibited by the creatine kinase/creatine phosphate system that removes ADP from the channel complex. Thus, the KATP channel complex functions not only as a K+ conductance, but also as an enzyme regulating nucleotide-dependent channel gating through an intrinsic ATPase activity of the SUR subunit. Modulation of the channel ATPase activity and/or scavenging the product of the ATPase reaction provide novel means to regulate cellular functions associated with KATP channel opening."

Inhibition of macrophage homing might therefore prevent atherosclerosis. Since HDL levels are inversely correlated with cardiovascular risk, their effect on macrophage homing was assessed in apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Overexpression of human apolipoprotein AI in apoE-/- mice increased HDL levels 3-fold and reduced macrophage accumulation in an established assay of leukocyte homing to aortic root endothelium 3.2-fold (P<0.005). This was due to reduced in vivo betaVLDL oxidation, reduced betaVLDL triggered endothelial cytosolic Ca2+ signaling through PAF-like bioactivity, lower ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, and diminished ex vivo leukocyte adhesion. Adenoviral gene transfer of human PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in apoE-/- mice increased PAF-AH activity 1.5-fold (P<0.001), reduced betaVLDL-induced ex vivo macrophage adhesion 3.5-fold (P<0.01), and reduced in vivo macrophage homing 2.6-fold (P<0.02). These inhibitory effects were observed in the absence of increased HDL cholesterol levels. In conclusion, HDL reduces macrophage homing to endothelium by reducing oxidative stress via its associated PAF-AH activity. This protective mechanism is independent of the function of HDL as cholesterol acceptor. Modulation of lipoprotein oxidation by PAF-AH may prevent leukocyte recruitment to the vessel wall, a key feature in atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2166163593,"An inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity results in the Type A and B forms of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD). Using the ASM-deficient mouse model (ASMKO) of NPD, we evaluated the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of this disorder. Recombinant human ASM (rhASM) was purified from the media of overexpressing Chinese Hamster ovary cells and i.v. injected into 16 five-month-old ASMKO mice at doses of 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg every other day for 14 days (7 injections). On day 16, the animals were killed and the tissues were analyzed for their sphingomyelin (SPM) content. Notably, the SPM levels were markedly reduced in the hearts, livers, and spleens of these animals, and to a lesser degree in the lungs. Little or no substrate depletion was found in the kidneys or brains. Based on these results, three additional 5-month-old ASMKO animals were injected every other day with 5 mg/kg for 8 days (4 injections) and killed on day 10 for histological analysis. Consistent with the biochemical results, marked histological improvements were observed in the livers, spleens, and lungs, indicating a reversal of the disease pathology. A group of 10 ASMKO mice were then i.v. injected once a week with 1 mg/kg rhASM for 15 wk, starting at 3 wk of age. Although anti-rhASM antibodies were produced in these mice, the antibodies were not neutralizing and no adverse effects were observed from this treatment. Weight gain and rota-rod performance were slightly improved in the treated animals as compared with ASMKO control animals, but significant neurological deficits were still observed and their life span was not extended by ERT. In contrast with these CNS results, striking histological and biochemical improvements were found in the reticuloendothelial system organs (livers, spleens, and lungs). These studies indicate that ERT should be an effective therapeutic approach for Type B NPD, but is unlikely to prevent the severe neurodegeneration associated with Type A NPD."
https://openalex.org/W2099764109,"We demonstrate that RecQ helicase from Escherichia coli is a catalytic helicase whose activity depends on the concentration of ATP, free magnesium ion, and single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein. Helicase activity is cooperative in ATP concentration, with an apparent S0.5value for ATP of 200 μm and a Hill coefficient of 3.3 ± 0.3. Therefore, RecQ helicase utilizes multiple, interacting ATP-binding sites to mediate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) unwinding, implicating a multimer of at least three subunits as the active unwinding species. Unwinding activity is independent of dsDNA ends, indicating that RecQ helicase can unwind from both internal regions and ends of dsDNA. The KM for dsDNA is 0.5–0.9 μm base pairs; the kcatfor DNA unwinding is 2.3–2.7 base pairs/s/monomer of RecQ helicase; and unexpectedly, helicase activity is optimal at a free magnesium ion concentration of 0.05 mm. Omitting Escherichia coli SSB protein lowers the rate and extent of dsDNA unwinding, suggesting that RecQ helicase associates with the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) product. In agreement, the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity is reduced in proportion to the SSB protein concentration; in its absence, ATPase activity saturates at six nucleotides/RecQ helicase monomer and yields a kcat of 24 s−1. Thus, we conclude that SSB protein stimulates RecQ helicase-mediated unwinding by both trapping the separated ssDNA strands after unwinding and preventing the formation of non-productive enzyme-ssDNA complexes.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of Sgs1 helicase, a RecQ helicase homologue, leads to premature aging due to genetic instability at the rDNA locus (20Sinclair D.A. Mills K. Guarente L.

In humans, there are five homologues of RecQ helicase, and mutations in two of these, the WRN and BLM helicases, are responsible for Werner and Bloom syndromes, respectively (12Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 17Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). A third human homologue, RECQ4, has recently been implicated in a subset of cases of Rothmund-Thompson syndrome (14Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Miller R.W. Smithson W.A. Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 22Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Arndt C. Jalal S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 90: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A common phenotype exhibited by these diseases is pronounced genomic instability. Thus, RecQ helicase-like proteins in eukaryotes appear to be important in maintaining genomic stability (for review see Ref.23Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The role in DNA metabolism played by the majority of the RecQ helicase family members remains to be determined; however, the function of the RecQ helicase from Escherichia coli, the founding member of this family, is now becoming clear. The gene that encodes RecQ helicase, recQ, was originally identified in E. coli as a thymineless death-resistant mutant in thyAcells (24Nakayama H. Nakayama K. Nakayama R. Irino N. Nakayama Y. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The same recQ null mutation also reduced conjugal and plasmid recombination by up to 100-fold in a recB(C)sbcCD background (24Nakayama H. Nakayama K. Nakayama R. Irino N. Nakayama Y. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, loss of recQ function in the same genetic background rendered E. coli cells highly sensitive to UV irradiation and other DNA-damaging agents (25Nakayama K. Irino N. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Mendonca V.M. Klepin H.D. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results were consistent with the product of this gene being needed for homologous recombination mediated by the RecF recombination pathway (27Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recQfunction is required to suppress illegitimate recombination; E. coli cells lacking an intact copy of the recQ gene display 30–300-fold higher levels of non-homologous recombination between λ Spi− phage and the E. colichromosome (28Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The recombination functions of RecQ helicase have been examined in vitro using purified components (29Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). RecQ helicase was found to unwind a dsDNA substrate to provide a suitable ssDNA substrate for binding by RecA protein. These findings were interpreted as a clear indication that RecQ helicase acts to initiate homologous recombination mediated by the RecF recombination pathway. RecQ helicase was also capable of disrupting homologous pairing intermediates formed by RecA protein, in addition to unwinding a broad spectrum of other DNA substrates. These results suggested that RecQ helicase may antagonize illegitimate recombination by unwinding aberrantly paired DNA molecules formed at regions of limited homology. Thus, RecQ helicase is a multifunctional protein in DNA recombination, which appears to be responsible for both promoting homologous recombination and discouraging illegitimate recombination. An alternative means by which RecQ helicase may suppress illegitimate recombination events is through its functional interaction with E. coli topoisomerase III (Topo III). Together these two proteins display a strong DNA strand passage activity in vitro, which is both absent from the individual proteins and requires ATP. Fully catenated dsDNA molecules are produced by these two proteins when RecQ helicase unwinds a covalently closed dsDNA substrate to provide a preferential substrate for Topo III. A similar activity is observed with RecQ helicase and yeast Topo III from S. cerevisiae. This is consistent with the finding that yeast Topo III and SGS1 helicase interact both genetically and physically (5Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). A physical interaction between the BLM helicase and human Topo III has also been reported (30Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In both yeast and human cells, the cognate RecQ helicase homologues are needed to suppress recombination events (5Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 12Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Based on the similarities between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, it stands to reason that in E. coli the combined activities of RecQ helicase and Topo III are also important for suppressing recombination events. Earlier characterizations of RecQ helicase had assayed its helicase activity using agarose gel electrophoresis and employing DNA substrates that generally consisted of an ssDNA fragment (between 70 and 350 bp in length) annealed to either a full-length circular M13 ssDNA molecule to generate a partially dsDNA substrate or a homologous partner of the same length to make a fully dsDNA substrate (16Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Nakayama H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In these experiments, RecQ helicase was found to translocate 3′ → 5′ along the DNA strand to which it is bound. In addition, this helicase displayed the capacity to unwind both partial ssDNA and full-dsDNA substrates. Unwinding by RecQ helicase was also greatly stimulated by both E. coli SSB protein and phage T4 gene 32 protein. However, agarose gel electrophoresis assays have the limitation that unwinding is scored only when the DNA substrate is unwound (i.e. the complete dissociation of the dsDNA substrate) and, therefore, do not directly provide information concerning the initial rate of dsDNA unwinding by RecQ helicase. To characterize further the helicase activity of RecQ helicase, with respect to both its initial rate and the final extent of unwinding, we examined the activity of RecQ helicase on plasmid-length (>2 kbp) dsDNA substrates using a continuous fluorescent dye-displacement assay (32Eggleston A.K. Rahim N.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here we describe experiments that examine the effects on RecQ helicase activity of buffer components, DNA concentration and composition, enzyme concentration, and SSB protein concentration. We find that RecQ helicase is capable of fully unwinding the plasmids pUC19 and pBSKM, which are 2.7 and 2.9 kbp in length, respectively. As expected, unwinding by RecQ helicase is dependent on a hydrolyzable nucleotide cofactor and is stimulated by E. coli SSB protein. Unexpectedly, the helicase activity of RecQ helicase is sensitive to the concentration of both ATP and free magnesium ion. We also provide the first evidence that RecQ helicase functions as a multimer: the helicase activity of RecQ helicase displays a cooperative dependence on ATP concentration, which yields an apparent S0.5 value of 200 μm and a Hill coefficient of 3.3 (±0.3). A Hill coefficient of 3 or greater suggests that at least three interacting ATP-binding sites are utilized by the enzyme to mediate unwinding. RecQ helicase does not display a preference for initiating unwinding from dsDNA ends compared with internal regions of dsDNA: the kinetic parameters for DNA unwinding are similar when the helicase was provided with three separate DNA substrates that differed in the ratio of the total number of base pairs to dsDNA ends. Finally, we find that SSB protein is needed not only to trap the displaced ssDNA strands produced by RecQ helicase-mediated unwinding but is also important to prevent the formation of abortive RecQ helicase-ssDNA complexes. Chemicals were reagent grade, and all solutions were prepared using Barnstead NanoPure water. P-enolpyruvate and dATP were purchased from Sigma, and ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ATPγS was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nucleotides were dissolved as concentrated stock solutions at pH 7.5, and the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 1.54 × 104m−1 cm−1. The fluorophore, Höechst 33258 (H33258) dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), was dissolved as a concentrated stock solution in water, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 344 nm of 4.6 × 104m−1cm−1. RecQ helicase was purified, and its concentration was determined as described previously (29Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the RecQ helicase preparation used here was 2 × 105ATPase units/mg as defined by Umezu et al. (16Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and 1 × 106 helicase units/mg as defined by Roman and Kowalczykowski (33Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SSB protein was purified from E. colistrain RLM727 as described (34LeBowitz J. Biochemical Mechanisms of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage Lambda Replication. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore1985Google Scholar), and its monomer concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 3.0 × 104m−1 cm−1(35Ruyechan W.T. Wetmur J.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The restriction endonucleases HindIII and BanI were from New England Biolabs. Pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were from Sigma. Wheat germ topoisomerase I was from Promega. pUC19 scDNA was purified using alkaline lysis followed by CsCl-ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.33-1.46Google Scholar). Linear pUC19 dsDNA was produced by incubating pUC19 scDNA with either HindIII or BanI for 1 h at 37 °C under the conditions recommended by the vendor. The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation following phenol extraction. pBSKM nicked dsDNA, produced by digestion of pBSKM scDNA with the M13 gene2 protein, was the kind gift of Dr. Eugene Zaitzev (University of California, Davis). The concentration of dsDNA was determined using an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 6500 m(bp)−1 cm−1. Poly(dT) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and its concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 8520m (nts)−1cm−1. RecQ helicase-mediated unwinding was monitored using a continuous fluorescent dye-displacement assay (32Eggleston A.K. Rahim N.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The standard reaction buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 300 nmH33258 dye, 0.1 mmDTT, and an ATP regeneration system composed of 1 mmP-enolpyruvate and 25 units ml−1 pyruvate kinase. Standard conditions were reactions (300 μl total volume) having 1 mm magnesium-acetate, 1 mm ATP, 1 μm SSB protein, 2.5 μm (bp) linear dsDNA, and 100 nm RecQ helicase. When the unwinding of relaxed pUC19 dsDNA substrate was assayed, 20 units (as defined by the vendor) of wheat germ topoisomerase I were present in the reaction. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C with constant stirring. Fluorescent measurements were carried out on an SLM 8100C spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Rochester, NY) with the photomultiplier tube voltage set to 800 V, a gain setting of 1, and the excitation and emission wavelengths set to 344 and 487 nm, respectively. The bandwidths for both excitation and emission were 8 nm. The total change in fluorescent signal corresponding to 100% unwinding (ΔFT) was determined for each assay by subtracting the value for the free H33258 dye from the fluorescence obtained for the dye-dsDNA complex. This is possible since the fluorescence of the H33258 dye is not altered by ssDNA (32Eggleston A.K. Rahim N.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The extent of unwinding (i.e. the percentage of total DNA unwound) was calculated by dividing the observed change in fluorescence at the completion of unwinding (ΔFobs) by ΔFT . The initial rate of unwinding in nm (bp) s−1 was calculated by multiplying the absolute value of the initial slope of the unwinding curve by the DNA concentration in nm (bp), and then dividing this product by ΔFT . Where indicated, the concentration of free magnesium ion was determined using the CHELATOR software package (Dr. J. M. Schoenmakers, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Reactions that were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out as above, including the presence of 300 nmH33258, except that aliquots of the reaction were taken at the indicated times, and the reaction was stopped with 1% SDS and 50 mm EDTA. These samples were then loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and run in 1× TAE buffer at 1.5 V/cm for 12 h. Gels were stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in water for 1 h followed by extensive (>2 h) de-staining with water. The amount of DNA in each band was determined using ImageQuant software. Binding of RecQ helicase to the synthetic DNA substrates was analyzed using non-denaturing PAGE bandshift assays as described previously (29Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotide substrates were as follows: oligo 1, 5′-TCCTTTTGATAAGAGGTCATTTTTGCGGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTGC-3′; and oligo 2, 5′-GCAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCGCAAAAATGACCTCTTATCAAAAGGA-3′. The ssDNA substrate was oligo 1, and the 48-bp dsDNA substrate was oligo 2 annealed to oligo 1 as described previously (29Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Reactions contained RecQ helicase from 1 nm to 1.0 μm, and either the ssDNA substrate or the dsDNA substrate at a concentration of 960 nm (nts) or 960 nm (bp), respectively. Complexes were formed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 min in binding buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1.2 mm magnesium acetate, 28 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATPγS, and 14% glycerol), and then they were immediately loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Electrophoresis was carried out at 380 V for 1–1.5 h in a Tris glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried onto DEAE paper (Whatman) and visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The concentration of DNA in bands corresponding to free DNA substrate was determined using ImageQuant software. Apparent binding affinity (m−1) was calculated as the reciprocal of the RecQ helicase concentration at which half the available DNA substrate was bound. The hydrolysis of ATP by RecQ helicase was monitored spectrophotometrically as described previously (37Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol.

The standard reaction buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm P-enolpyruvate, 25 units ml−1 pyruvate kinase, 25 units ml−1 lactate dehydrogenase, 150 μm NADH, and 1 mm ATP. Reactions had the indicated concentration of RecQ helicase, and 1.0 μm (nt) heat-denatured HindIII-cut pUC19 linear DNA. SSB protein was present, where indicated, at a concentration of 1 μm. All reaction components, except for SSB protein and RecQ helicase, were incubated together at 37 °C for 2 min prior to initiation of the reaction by the addition of a mixture of SSB protein and RecQ helicase. Unwinding by RecQ helicase was monitored using a continuous fluorescent dye-displacement assay (32Eggleston A.K. Rahim N.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), previously used to monitor the unwinding of oligonucleotide-derived substrates by RecQ helicase (29Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the observation that the binding of certain fluorescent dyes, such as H33258 dye, to dsDNA results in a large increase in fluorescent signal relative to that for the dye in the presence of ssDNA (Fig.1 A). Helicase-mediated unwinding of this highly fluorescent dsDNA-H33258 dye complex results in a decrease in the fluorescent signal that is proportional to the amount of ssDNA produced (32Eggleston A.K. Rahim N.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rate and extent of helicase-mediated unwinding can be determined from the change in fluorescence that accompanies unwinding of the dsDNA-H33258 dye complex. The initial dsDNA substrate used here was the plasmid pUC19 digested with HindIII to yield a single 2.7-kbp fragment with nearly blunt dsDNA ends. The standard H33258 dye concentration of 300 nm was empirically determined by analyzing the effect of dye concentration on the unwinding activity of RecQ helicase (data not shown); this concentration of H33258 dye was chosen because the unwinding activity of RecQ helicase, as measured by DNA strand separation in agarose gel electrophoresis assays, was unaffected by the presence of the dye, and this amount of dye was sufficient to determine accurately the initial rate of unwinding (32Eggleston A.K. Rahim N.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Typical time courses for RecQ helicase-mediated unwinding of this DNA substrate (in the presence of 1 μm SSB protein) appear in Fig. 1 B. Addition of RecQ helicase to the linear pUC19 dsDNA-H33258 dye complex and subsequent unwinding results in a rapid decrease in the fluorescent signal. An incremental increase in the RecQ helicase concentration from 10 to 100 nm resulted in a higher rate of DNA unwinding (Table I). Note that the observed extent of unwinding calculated for 10 nm RecQ helicase is likely to underestimate the true extent of unwinding because the fluorescent signal at 10 nm RecQ helicase continued to decrease slowly beyond the end of the 10-min time course presented in Fig.1 B. A time-dependent inactivation of RecQ helicase was uniformly observed whenever RecQ helicase was present at low concentrations (≤10 nm). Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that RecQ helicase can rapidly unwind this 2.7-kbp linear dsDNA substrate.Table IUnwinding of pUC19 linear dsDNA by RecQ helicaseVariableInitial rateExtent1-aThe numbers in parentheses are the extents of unwinding determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (see text).nm ( bp ) s −1 (±5%)% (±5%)[RecQ] (nm) 1016851-bThis value represents an apparent extent of unwinding, since RecQ helicase progressively lost activity throughout the course of the reaction due to nonspecific inactivation of the enzyme.

In all cases, the dsDNA substrate was HindIII-cut pUC19 linear dsDNA at a concentration of 2.5 μm (bp). To confirm that the loss of fluorescent signal observed in this assay was due to dsDNA unwinding by RecQ helicase and was not simply due to dsDNA binding, similar to that observed for RecA protein (38Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 650-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the effect of nucleotide cofactor on dye displacement was determined. Previously, studies have shown that RecQ helicase requires ATP to mediate unwinding (16Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition, RecQ helicase must hydrolyze ATP to promote unwinding; ATPγS, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP, does not support RecQ helicase-mediated unwinding. In agreement, we find that RecQ helicase displays no detectable helicase activity either in the absence of ATP or when ATPγS is provided as nucleotide cofactor (Table I). These results clearly demonstrate that the helicase-dependent drop in fluorescence observed in the fluorescent dye-displacement assay is due to unwinding of the dsDNA substrate by RecQ helicase. The lack of helicase activity in the presence of ATPγS does not stem from an inability of RecQ helicase to bind this cofactor, since the addition of 1 mm ATP to a helicase assay initiated with 1 mm ATPγS does not allow RecQ helicase to unwind th"

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2819-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Following exposure of E. coli cells to DNA-damaging agents such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, induction of dinBresults in enhanced spontaneous (untargeted) mutagenesis of phage λ DNA introduced into the bacteria subsequent to irradiation (4Brotcorne-Lannoye A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3904-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Increased spontaneous mutagenesis is also observed following overexpression of dinB in cells transfected with F′lac plasmids, with the most prevalent mutations detected being −1 frameshifts (5Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13792-13797Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli DinB protein carrying a 6-histidine tag was purified and shown to be a DNA polymerase, designated DNA pol IV of E. coli, which is devoid of detectable exonuclease activity (6Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Consistent with its apparent ability to generate frameshift mutations in vivo, DNA pol IV is able to extend a misaligned primer-template in vitro, resulting in a −1 frameshift mutation (6Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). More recently, DNA pol IV has been shown to be unable to efficiently bypass an abasic site, thymine dimer, or 6-4 photoproduct in vitro (7Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been suggested that DNA pol IV is a specialized enzyme whose role is to negotiate sites of stalled or arrested DNA replication caused by structurally abnormal replication forks, such as those caused by slippage at repeated sequences (2Friedberg E.C.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Human DINB1 cDNA is predicted to encode a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 99 kDa, which shares extensive amino acid sequence homology with E. coli DNA pol IV, including proposed catalytic domains (1Gerlach V.L.

Genes Cell. 1999; 4: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As is the case for the E. coli dinB gene (5Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13792-13797Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), overexpression of the mouse Dinb1cDNA in murine cells is associated with an approximately 10-fold increase in spontaneous mutations (8Ogi T. Kato Jr., T. Kato T. Ohmori H. Genes Cell. 1999; 4: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the protein encoded by the human DINB1 gene might also function as a DNA polymerase. In the present study we have used a baculovirus expression system to express and purify a GST1-human DinB1 fusion protein from insect cells and show that the purified protein is a template-directed DNA polymerase in vitro. The enzyme has no detectable 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity and has optimal DNA polymerase activity at 37 °C and pH 6.5–7.5 (over the range 6.5–8.5) in the presence of Mg2+ cations. The enzyme is insensitive to inhibition by aphidicolin or dideoxynucleotides, and retains optimal activity in the presence of NaCl at levels ≤50 mm. We designate this polymerase activity DNA polκ. Human polκ is unable to bypass a cisplatin adduct in vitro, but has limited ability to bypass an AAF lesion in an error-prone fashion under the same conditions. Insect cell TMN-FH media was purchased from Pharmingen. The Klenow fragments of E. coliDNA polymerase I (exo+ and exo−) were obtained from New England Biolabs. Aphidicolin was from Sigma. Dideoxynucleotides were from U. S. Biochemicals. Glutathione-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.N-Acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAAF) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute. cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) was purchased from Aldrich. The human DINB1 open reading frame was amplified by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction using HeLa cell cDNA as template with primers HDinB5′ (5′-GTGGATCCGCCATGGATAGCACAAAGGAGAAGTG-3′) and HDinB3′-His6(5′-ATGGATCCGCGGTCGACTAATGGTGGTGATGATGGTGCTTAAAAAATATATCAAGGGTATG-3′) that introduce BamHI restriction sites (underlined) on both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment as well as six histidine residues on the 3′ end. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to generate pHDINB1–6His and sequenced to confirm the integrity of the coding region. The 2.6-kilobase BamHI fragment containing the human DINB1 coding region was then cloned into the same site of pAcG2T (Pharmingen) to generate an in-frame fusion with the glutathione S-transferase gene, generating plasmid pAcG2T/HDINB1–6His. The C-terminal deletion mutant was made by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction with primers HDinB5′ and HDinBΔ3′-6His (5′-ATGGATCCGCGGTCGACTAATGGTGGTGATGATGGTGAGATCTACCC-ATAAGCCTTAATCTCA-3′) that introduce a BamHI restriction site (underlined) and six histidine residues onto the 3′ end of the amplified fragment. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to give pHDINB1ΔC-6His. The D198A/E199A double mutation was introduced into pHDINB1–6His using the Tranformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) and primers GTE-MluI/HindIII (5′-GAGCTCCCAAAGCTTTGGATGCAT-3′) and HDinB-DE → AA (5′-CCATGAGTCTTGCTGCAGCCTACTTG-3′), the latter introducing a PstI restriction site (underlined) to give pHDINB1mut-6His. The BamHI fragments from pHDINB1ΔC-6His and pHDINB1mut-6His were cloned into the same site of pAcG2T to give pAcG2T/HDINB1ΔC-6His and pAcG2T/HDINB1mut-6His. These plasmids were co-transfected into SF9 cells with BaculoGold DNA using a BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen). Expression of both wild-type and mutant GST/polκ was assayed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antisera. Two rounds of amplification produced a high titer stock of recombinant virus expressing GST/polκ. The multiplicity of infection yielding optimal expression of full-length fusion proteins was determined empirically. Approximately 1 × 108 virus-infected Sf9 cells were harvested 3 days after infection and lysed in 20 ml of Lysis Buffer I (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 × protease inhibitors) by incubation on ice for 10 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation to give the cytoplasmic extract. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of Lysis Buffer I containing 500 mm NaCl, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation to generate nuclear extract. The nuclear extract was diluted 2-fold and bound in batch to 500 μl of glutathione-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was harvested by centrifugation and most of the supernatant removed. The resin was resuspended in the remaining supernatant and transferred to a 10-ml disposable column (Bio-Rad) to collect the resin by gravity. The resin was washed with 5 ml of Lysis Buffer I containing 250 mm NaCl, followed by 5 ml of Wash Buffer II (10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% IPEPAL-630, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 × protease inhibitors). Bound protein was eluted with 3.5 ml of Wash Buffer II containing 10 mmreduced glutathione, and collected in a total of 10 fractions of 350 μl each. GST/polκ-containing fractions (determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting) were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. GST/polκ DNA polymerase activity was stable to multiple rounds of freezing and thawing. The mutant fusion proteins were expressed and purified by the same procedure. The oligonucleotide derived primer-templates used as substrates in the DNA polymerase assays (24/44, 25/44, 27/44, 30/44, and 31/44) were the same as those described by Wagner et al. (6Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The 20/54 primer-template consisted of oligonucleotides P4-OX-RS (5′-GAATTCCTGCAGCCCAGGAT-3′) and T1-OX-WT (5′-ATTCCAGACTGTCAATAACACGGTGGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC-3′). Primers were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Five pmol of each primer was 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and purified on Bio-Gel P2 (Bio-Rad) spun columns equilibrated in STE (100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The various labeled primers (100 μl) were annealed to the template in a ratio of 1:1.5 (primer-template) by heating to ∼95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. A synthetic DNA oligo of the sequence 5′-TCCTTCTGTCTCTT-3′ (site of modification underlined) was purified by denaturing PAGE and desalted using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, manufacturer's instructions). 0.38 μmol of purified DNA was dissolved in TE buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.0) to a concentration of 0.2 mm and incubated with AAAF (1 mm, 10% ethanol, 37 °C, 12 h). Adducted DNA was admixed with an equal volume 8 m urea and purified by denaturing PAGE. The AAF-modified oligo has retarded gel mobility relative to the unmodified oligo, allowing efficient removal of unmodified DNA. DNA was eluted and concentrated using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The presence of the AAF-modified deoxyguanosine residue was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and by HPLC analysis of enzymatically digested DNA. HPLC separation of the enzymatic hydrolysate returned peaks corresponding to deoxycytidine, thymidine, and a strongly retained substance that co-eluted with the product of the reaction between deoxyguanosine and AAAF. HPLC analysis was conducted similarly to a previous report (9Fischhaber P.L. Reese A.W. Nguyen T. Kirchner J.J. Hustedt E.J. Robinson B.H. Hopkins P.B. Nucleosides and Nucleotides. 1997; 16: 365-377Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The ESI-MS of each of these co-eluted substances was shown to correspond to N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N-(2-acetylamino)fluorene ([M − H+]−1 = 487.2), the expected lesion. The AAF modification was assumed to be at C-8 of deoxyguanosine because AAAF is known to modify DNA preferentially at this position (10Kriek E. Miller J.A. Juhl U. Miller E.C. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Kriek E. Chemico-Biological Interact. 1969; 1: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Kriek E. Reitsema J. Chemico-Biological Interact. 1971; 3: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). No appreciable peaks were observed in the HPLC assay that could potentially be attributed to modification at other positions of deoxyguanosine or at other bases on the DNA oligo. 7.6 pmol of the AAF-modified oligo was admixed with 1.1 molar equivalents of each of the two flanking DNA sequences 5′-TTTCCCAGTCACGACG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGAGCC-3′ and approximately 0.9 equivalents of the splinting DNA oligo, 5′-CACTGAAAGAGACAGAAGGACGTCGT-3′. DNAs were heated briefly (90 °C, 1 min) and annealed by cooling to room temperature on the benchtop (5 min). Annealed DNAs were ligated with T4 DNA ligase (1 × in manufacturer's buffer, 16 °C, 12 h), ethanol precipitated, and purified by denaturing PAGE. The 53-mer product band (5′-TTTCCCAGTCACGACGTCCTTCTGTCTCTTTCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGAGCC-3′, site of AAF modification underlined) was identified by mobility relative to marker oligos and to mock-treated reactions in which one or more of the splicing components had been left out of the mixture. An unmodified 53-mer oligonucleotide of the above sequence was used as a wild-type control template. The unmodified and AAF-modified templates were annealed to either a gel-purified running start oligo, P1-PF-RS, 5′-GGCTCCGAGCTCGAATTCAC-3′ or a gel-purified standing start oligo, P2-alk-SS, 5′-GGCTCCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGAAAGAGA-3′ as described previously. A synthetic DNA oligo of the sequence 5′-TCCTTCGGTCTCTT-3′ (site of modification underlined) was purified by denaturing PAGE and desalted using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. An aqueous solution of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (1 mg/ml) was freshly prepared and preincubated in the dark (25 °C, 12 h). 0.043 μmol of purified DNA was dissolved in water to a concentration of 0.5 mm, admixed with 1 molar equivalent of cisplatin from the preincubated solution and incubated (5 h, 37 °C, wrapped in foil). Crude cisplatin-modified DNA was gel-purified. The presence of the cisplatin adduct was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry and was presumed to be a 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link based on previous reports that cisplatin modifies N-7 of purines (reviewed in Ref. 13Bruhn S.L. Toney J.H. Lippard S.J. Prog. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 38: 477-516Crossref Google Scholar). A 5′ end-labeled aliquot of the sample confirmed that the modified oligonucleotide migrated as a single band on a denaturing gel and that its mobility was distinct from unmodified DNA and a cisplatin diadduct. The purified cisplatin-modified 14-mer was ligated to flanking sequences as described above for AAF-modified DNA except that the splinting DNA in ligation reactions was composed of the sequence, 5′-CACTGAAAGAGACCGAAGGACGTCGT-3′. The 53-mer product (5′-TTTCCCAGTCACGACGTCCTTCGGTCTCTTTCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGAGCC-3′, site of cisplatin modification underlined) was purified by denaturing PAGE and identified similarly to the AAF-template. An unmodified 53-mer oligonucleotide of the above sequence was used as a wild-type control template. The unmodified and cisplatin-modified templates were annealed to the running start oligo, P1-PF-RS, as described previously. Standard polymerase reactions (10 μl) were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol with 100 μm dNTPs, 2 nm GST/polκ, and 5 nm primer-template for 5 min at 37 °C unless indicated otherwise. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, concentrated under vacuum, and resuspended in 5 μl of loading dye (90% deionized formamide, 0.1 × TBE, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanole FF). Following denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, products were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to film at room temperature. Human recombinant PCNA (provided by R. Wood, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Hertfordshire EN6 3LD, United Kingdom) and calf thymus polδ (provided by U. Hübscher, Department of Veterinary Biochemisty, University of Zurich-Irchel, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland) were prepared as described (14Biggerstaff M. Wood R.D. Henderson D.S. DNA Repair Protocols : Eukaryotic Systems. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 357-372Google Scholar, 15Schumacher S.B. Stucki M. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 620-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase assays were performed using the standard conditions described above unless indicated otherwise. To determine whether the product of the human DINB1 gene is a DNA polymerase, we expressed and purified recombinant human DinB1 protein. Expression in both E. coli and the yeast Schizosaccaromyces pombe consistently resulted in low yields and/or degraded protein (data not shown). However, we were able to express full-length hDinB1 protein fused to GST in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The recombinant GST/hDinB1 protein was purified to near physical homogeneity from nuclear extracts by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The purified GST/hDinB1 fraction contained primarily full-length fusion protein; however, some degradation products, including free GST, were observed and confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antisera (data not shown). To test for DNA polymerase activity, various 5′-32P-end labeled oligonucleotide primers were annealed to a 44-nucleotide template and used as substrates. In the presence of dNTPs and Mg2+, the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I efficiently extended the primer to generate the expected 44-nucleotide product (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Purified GST/hDinB1 protein also extended the primer, demonstrating an intrinsic DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). We therefore propose to rename the human DinB1 protein as DNA polymerase κ (polκ) and the gene encoding it, POLK, in accordance with standard nomenclature for eukaryotic DNA polymerases (16Weissbach A.

As a control, a GST/hDinB1 mutant protein in which the conserved amino acid residues Asp198 and Glu199 were changed to alanine, was purified by the same procedure (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and shown to be devoid of detectable DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3–6), indicating that the observed polymerase activity is intrinsic to the human DinB1 protein. In addition a truncated GST/hDinB1 fusion protein lacking 360 amino acids at the C terminus (GST/hDinB1ΔC) did not demonstrate DNA polymerase activity, indicating that sequences within this less highly conserved portion of the protein are required for activity (data not shown). We performed a series of experiments to determine the optimal conditions for polκ DNA polymerase activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2 A, between pH 6.5 and 8.5 GST/polκ was most active over the range 6.5–7.5 (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–5), with reactions carried out at 37 °C (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6–9). To investigate the effect of ionic strength on DNA synthesis, increasing amounts of NaCl were added to the reactions (Fig. 2 A, lanes 11–16). GST/polκ activity was relatively insensitive to NaCl concentration up to 50 mm, but was significantly inhibited at salt concentrations of 100 mm or higher. As expected, a metal cofactor was required for activity (Fig. 2 B). Either Mg2+ or Mn2+ could be utilized, with the former being preferred (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). Based on these observations, all standard DNA polymerase assays using GST/polκ were performed at pH 7.0 and 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+. The range of incomplete extension products produced by GST/polκ in the experiments described above suggested that human polκ is endowed with limited processivity, as has also been observed for the E. coli DinB protein (6Wagner J.

We therefore examined whether purified human PCNA, a sliding clamp known to stimulate the processivity of the replicative DNA polymerases polδ and polε (18Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Matthews M.B.

Chem. 1997; 378: 345-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increases the extent of DNA synthesis by GST/polκ. The ability of PCNA to stimulate the activity of polδ on short oligonucleotide-derived primer-templates has been observed previously (21Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, addition of recombinant human PCNA had no detectable effect on GST/polκ activity (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4) but could readily stimulate synthesis of full-length products by purified polδ (Fig. 3, lanes 5–7) on a slightly longer template. As was observed on the shorter template, no effect of PCNA on polκ activity was observed on the longer template nor did the PCNA possess polymerase activity of its own (data not shown). In contrast to polκ, E. coli pol IV is stimulated 3000-fold by addition of the bacterial sliding clamp β,γ complex (7Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A comprehensive study of the effects on replication factors RPA, RFC, and PCNA on polκ is currently underway. To demonstrate that GST/polκ is a template-directed DNA polymerase we performed polymerase assays in the presence of single deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) on 4 different primer-templates, each designed to test for the correct incorporation of a particular dNTP. As shown in Fig.4 A, under the single set of conditions tested GST/polκ preferentially incorporated the correct nucleotide on each template. However, in all cases significant levels of misincorporation were also observed. For example, on the 27/44 primer-template GST/polκ primarily catalyzed the accurate incorporation of dGTP as the first nucleotide, but also supported misincorporation of dATP and to a lesser extent dCTP (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–11). It can also be observed from Fig. 4 A that the level of GST/polκ activity on the 24/44 substrate was significantly and consistently lower than on the other primer-templates. The cause of this phenomenon is presently unclear, but is most likely related to the immediate sequence context and is apparently exacerbated by decreasing the dNTP concentration from 100 μm to 10 μm (compare Fig. 3 A, lane 2, and Fig. 4 A, lane 6). Poor extension of this primer-template by E. coli pol IV was also observed by Wagner et al. (6Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Given the detectable levels of nucleotide misincorporation observed in Fig. 4 A, we tested GST/polκ for 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity. Using a substrate in which the 3′ nucleotide of the primer was not base paired with the template, no shortening of the primer by GST/polκ or Klenow (exo−) enzyme was observed in the absence of dNTPs (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, Klenow (exo+) enzyme readily cleaved the primer (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). In the presence of dNTPs, the primer could be efficiently extended by Klenow (exo+) enzyme only following cleavage of the mispaired base (Fig. 4 B, lane 8). Limited extension by GST/polκ was also observed from the 3′ mispaired primer (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). The low level of primer extended by Klenow (exo−) enzyme yielded a product 45 nucleotides in length due to incorporation of an additional dATP in a template-independent fashion (22Clark J.M. Joyce C.M. Beardsley G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This nucleotide is normally removed by the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of Klenow (exo+) enzyme. The detectable levels of misincorporation together with the observed lack of a proofreading exonuclease activity suggest that polκ is endowed with a low level of fidelity during synthesis of DNA. To complete our preliminary characterization of GST/polκ we tested the sensitivity of the enzyme to aphidicolin and dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs). Aphidicolin is an inhibitor of eukaryotic DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε while polβ and -γ are sensitive to ddTTP (23Wang T.S. F Conger K.L. Copeland W.C. Arroyo M.P. Cotterill S. Eukaryotic DNA Replication: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 67-92Google Scholar). In the presense of 25 μm dNTPs GST/polκ activity was not inhibited by either aphidicolin (50 ng/μl) or up to an 8-fold molar excess of ddNTPs (data not shown). The lack of sensitivity of polκ to aphidicolin and ddNTPs is similar to that observed for human polη (24Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A number of the DNA polymerases in the UmuC/DinB superfamily have been implicated in DNA damage-induced mutagenesis and translesion synthesis (2Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We asked whether GST/polκ is able to bypass cisplatin (Fig.5) or an AAF adduct (Fig.6), lesions that have previously been shown to strongly block other DNA polymerases (reviewed in Ref.25Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair, Vol. 1: DNA Repair in Prokaryotes and Lower Eukaryotes. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 229-262Google Scholar). GST/polκ is unable to bypass d[GpG-N7(1)-N7(2)] cisplatin intrastrand cross-links, even when a 2-fold molar excess of enzyme is added to the primer-template (Fig. 5, lanes 6–9). Klenow (exo−) enzyme is also unable to bypass this lesion (Fig.5, lane 10), unless high concentrations of enzyme are added (data not shown). Both GST/polκ and Klenow (exo−) enzyme arrest one nucleotide prior to the lesion, suggesting that neither enzyme is able to efficiently insert nucleotides across from the damaged bases.Figure 6GST/polκ displays inefficient, potentially error-prone bypass of"

https://openalex.org/W2104337029,"The amyloid b-protein (Ab) deposited in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a normally secreted proteolytic product of the amyloid b-protein precursor (APP). Generation of Ab from the APP requires two sequential proteolytic events: an initial b-secretase cleavage at the amino terminus of the Ab sequence followed by g-secretase cleavage at the carboxyl terminus of Ab. We describe the development of a robust in vitro assay for g-secretase cleavage by showing de novo Ab production in vitro and establish that this assay monitors authentic gamma-secretase activity by documenting the production of a cognate g-CTF, confirming the size of the Ab produced by mass spectrometry, and inhibiting cleavage in this system with multiple inhibitors that alter g-secretase activity in living cells. Using this assay, we demonstrate that the g-secretase activity 1) is tightly associated with the membrane, 2) can be solubilized, 3) has a pH optimum of 6.8 but is active from pH 6.0 to pH >8.4, and 4) ascertain that activities of the g-40 and g-42 are indeed pharmacologically distinct. These studies should facilitate the purification of the protease or proteases that are responsible for this unusual activity, which is a major therapeutic target for the treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2080648329,"A number of recently discovered proteins that interact with the α subunits of Gi-like G proteins contain homologous repeated sequences named G protein regulatory (GPR) motifs. Activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS3), identified as an activator of the yeast pheromone pathway in the absence of the pheromone receptor, has a domain with four such repeats. To elucidate the potential mechanisms of regulation of G protein signaling by proteins containing GPR motifs, we examined the effects of the AGS3 GPR domain on the kinetics of guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis by Giα1 and transducin-α (Gtα). The AGS3 GPR domain markedly inhibited the rates of spontaneous guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) binding to Giα and rhodopsin-stimulated GTPγS binding to Gtα. The full-length AGS3 GPR domain, AGS3-(463–650), was ∼30-fold more potent than AGS3-(572–629), containing two AGS3 GPR motifs. The IC50values for the AGS3-(463–650) inhibitory effects on Giα and transducin were 0.12 and 0.15 μm, respectively. Furthermore, AGS3-(463–650) and AGS3-(572–629) effectively blocked the GDP release from Giα and rhodopsin-induced dissociation of GDP from Gtα. The potencies of AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650) to suppress the GDP dissociation rates correlated with their ability to inhibit the rates of GTPγS binding. Consistent with the inhibition of nucleotide exchange, the AGS3 GPR domain slowed the rate of steady-state GTP hydrolysis by Giα. The catalytic rate of Gtα GTP hydrolysis, measured under single turnover conditions, remained unchanged with the addition of AGS3-(463–650). Altogether, our results suggest that proteins containing GPR motifs, in addition to their potential role as G protein-coupled receptor-independent activators of Gβγ signaling pathways, act as GDP dissociation inhibitors and negatively regulate the activation of a G protein by a G protein-coupled receptor.

A novel class of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for G proteins termedregulators of G protein signaling (RGS) has been identified (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

RGS proteins share a highly conserved RGS domain, which is responsible for the GAP function. Recently, cloning of proteins critical for glial cell development resulted in the identification of the first known Drosophila RGS protein, LOCO (7Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O'Kane C.J. Klambt C. Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar). The LOCO sequence revealed significant homology to RGS12 and RGS14 within the RGS domain and three additional regions B, C, and D (7Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O'Kane C.J. Klambt C. Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using Giα as bait in an attempt to confirm the interaction of LOCO with Gα. Interestingly, the D region, rather than the RGS domain of LOCO, was found to bind Giα (7Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O'Kane C.J. Klambt C. Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the D region revealed that it contained a segment of homology with four ∼20-amino acid repeats present in the human mosaic protein, LGN. LGN has been previously identified as a Giα2-interacting protein using a yeast two-hybrid system (8Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene. 1996; 181: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). LGN is similar to the activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS3), which was isolated in a functional screen for receptor-independent activators of heterotrimeric G protein signaling (9Takesono A.

The ∼20-amino acid repeats were termed the G protein regulatory (GPR) (9Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

The GPR motif was also identified in Purkinje cell protein-2 (Pcp2) and Rap1GAP, which were identified as Goα binding partners in yeast-two hybrid screens (11Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol.

These studies suggest that GPR-containing proteins, hereafter termed GPR proteins, are likely to represent a diverse family of proteins that modulate G protein signaling. At present very little is known about the mechanisms and functions of GPR proteins. The yeast pheromone response pathway is mediated by Gβγ subunits, and its GPCR-independent activation by AGS3 suggests that it may induce release of Gβγ from G proteins (9Takesono A. Cismowski M.J.

Pcp2 protein was shown to stimulate GDP release from Goα without affecting the kcat for GTP hydrolysis, thus raising the possibility that GPR proteins may serve as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for G proteins (11Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To date, no studies on the regulation of GPCR-mediated G protein activation by GPR proteins have been reported. In this study, we examined the effects of the AGS3 GPR domain (AGS3GPR) on the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange of Giα1 and transducin-α (Gtα) and on the rhodopsin-stimulated nucleotide exchange of Gtα. Our results suggest that AGS3GPR acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and may block GPCR-dependent activation of G proteins from the Gi family.

Nathans, The Johns Hopkins University) using the following primers: ACTTAATCTAGACGACTTCTTCAACATGCTCATC and ATCTCTCTCGAGCTAGTCCACCCGCTGCTCGTCCATG. The primers were designed based on the cDNA sequence of a human homologue of AGS3 (GenBankTM accession number 5911952), identified using a Basic Local AlignmentSearch Tool search at NCBI (Bethesda, MD). In comparison to the rat AGS3-(572–629) sequence, the human sequence had a single homologous substitution, Glu-573→Asp. The polymerase chain reaction DNA fragment was digested with XbaI andXhoI and subcloned into a pGEX-KG vector (18Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal.

The sequence of an insert was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. An additional construct, GST-AGS3-(463–650), was prepared as described. 2Bernard, M. L., Peterson, Y. K., Chung, P., Jourdan, J., and Lanier, S. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, in press. The GST-AGS3-(463–650) construct consists of the last 189 amino acids of rat AGS3 and includes all four GPR motifs (GPR-I (aa 470–489), GPR-II (aa 524–542), GPR-III (aa 572–590), and GPR-IV (aa 606–624)). GST-AGS3-(572–629) and GST-AGS3-(463–650) were expressed in BL21 cells and purified using glutathione-agarose as described (20Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

Giα1 and Gtα subunits (0.5 μm) alone or Gtα mixed with 1 μm Gtβγ and uROS membranes (5 nm rhodopsin) were incubated for 3 min at 25 °C in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 130 mm NaCl and 10 mmMgSO4 (buffer A) with or without the addition of varying concentrations of AGS3-(572–629) or AGS3-(463–650). Binding reactions were started by the addition of 5 μm[35S]GTPγS (0.1 μCi). Aliquots of 10 μl were withdrawn at the indicated times and passed through Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm). The filters were then washed three times with 1 ml of the same buffer (ice-cold) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter after dissolution in 3a70B mixture. The apparent rate constant (kapp) values for the binding reactions were calculated by fitting the data to the following equation: GTPγS bound (%) = 100%·(1 −e −kt ). Giα1complexed with [α-32P]GDP (1 μm) was prepared by incubating 1 μmGiα1 with 2 μm[α-32P]GTP in buffer A for 1 h at 25 °C. Gtαβγ complexed with [α-32P]GDP was prepared by incubating 1 μm Gtα, 1 μm Gtβγ, and uROS membranes (100 nm rhodopsin) with 2 μm[α-32P]GTP in buffer A for 40 min at 25 °C. uROS membranes were removed by centrifugation (30 min, 100,000 ×g). Excess of unlabeled GTP (1 mm), uROS membranes (5 nm rhodopsin, only for Gt), and varying concentrations of AGS3-(572–629) or AGS3-(463–650) were added to monitor dissociation of [α-32P]GDP from Gα subunits. Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and passed through Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm). The dissociation rate constants (koff) were calculated by fitting the experimental data to a single exponential decay function: %GDP bound = 100%·e −kt. Steady-state GTPase activity measurements were initiated by mixing Giα1 (1 μm) with 10 μm [γ-32P]GTP in 100 μl of buffer A. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times and transferred to 100 μl of 7% perchloric acid. Nucleotides were precipitated using 700 μl of 10% charcoal suspension, and 32Pi formation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out in suspensions of uROS membranes (5 μm rhodopsin) reconstituted with Gtα (0.5 μm) and Gtβγ (1 μm) essentially as described (21Arshavsky V.Y.

The reaction was initiated by mixing bleached ROS membranes with 50 nm [γ-32P]GTP (∼5 × 104 dpm/pmol) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 7% perchloric acid. Nucleotides were then precipitated using charcoal, and32Pi formation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The GTPase rate constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data to an exponential function: %GTP hydrolyzed = 100·(1 −e −kt ), where k is the rate constant for GTP hydrolysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard or using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. The experimental data were fitted with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm (v.2) software. Two AGS3 GPR polypeptides, AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650), were utilized to investigate the modulation of guanine nucleotide binding to Giα1 and Gtα. AGS3-(572–629) contains the GPR repeats III and IV of AGS3, whereas AGS3-(463–650) includes all four AGS3 GPR repeats. Giα1 has a lower affinity for GDP than Gtα and, consequently, a notable intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate. The GTPγS binding to Giα1, because of intrinsic nucleotide exchange, was characterized by a kapp of 0.11 min−1 (Fig. 1 A). Addition of increasing concentrations of AGS3-(572–629) led to a dose-dependent decrease in the GTPγS binding rates. In the presence of 15 μm AGS3-(572–629) the rate of GTPγS binding to Giα1 was reduced (kapp= 0.018 min−1) (Fig. 1 A). The calculated IC50 value for the inhibitory effect of AGS3-(572–629) was 3.9 μm (Fig. 1 C). The full-length GPR domain, AGS3-(463–650) was a significantly more potent inhibitor of GTPγS binding to Giα1. It inhibited the kinetics of GTPγS binding by Giα1 with an IC50 value of 0.12 μm (Fig. 1, B and C). AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650) did not appreciably alter the rate of GTPγS binding to Gsα, reflecting a lack of interaction between these proteins (Fig. 1 D). Two different mechanisms could possibly account for the inhibitory effect of AGS3GPR on GTPγS binding to Giα1. First, AGS3 blocks the dissociation of GDP and, as a result, binding of GTPγS. Alternatively, AGS3 promotes release of both GDP and GTP (GTPγS), producing an empty pocket Giα. The rate of GDP dissociation of Giα1 in the absence of AGS3GPR (koff = 0.35 min−1) (Fig. 2 A) was higher than the GTPγS binding rate in Fig. 1 A. Although it is thought that GDP release is a rate-limiting step in the nucleotide exchange by Gα subunits (24Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rates of GDP dissociation considerably exceeding GTPγS binding rates have also been reported (25Carty D.J. Padrell E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6268-6273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that AGS3-(572–629) significantly slowed the rate of GDP release. The potency of AGS3-(572–629) as a GDI correlated with its inhibition of GTPγS binding. Not surprisingly, the full AGS3 GPR domain, AGS3-(463–650), was a more effective GDI than was AGS3-(572–629) (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Effects of AGS3GPR on the dissociation of GDP from Giα.

The slow GTPγS binding rate of Gtα (kapp = 0.001 min−1) in the presence or absence of Gtβγ was not affected by addition of AGS3-(572–629) or AGS3-(463–650) (data not shown). The ability of the AGS3GPR to influence R*-induced GTPγS binding to transducin was tested next. In the presence of ROS membranes containing 5 nm bleached rhodopsin, the rate constant of GTPγS binding to Gtαβγ was 0.040 min−1 (Fig. 3 A). AGS3-(572–629) significantly suppressed the activation of transducin by R* (Fig. 3 A). The IC50 value for the inhibitory effect of AGS3-(572–629) was 4.6 μm (Fig. 3 C). As with Giα1, AGS3-(463–650) was a more effective inhibitor of transducin activation than was AGS3-(572–629) (Fig. 3 B). The IC50 value for the effect of AGS3-(463–650) was 0.15 μm (Fig. 3 C). The R*-stimulated GDP dissociation rates from Gtαβγ in the presence of AGS3GPR were measured to determine whether the inhibition of GTPγS binding to Gtα by AGS3GPR was due to its effect on the GDP release. AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650) reduced GDP release rates from transducin proportionately to their ability to inhibit the R*-induced GTPγS binding (Fig. 4).Figure 4Effects of AGS3GPR on the rhodopsin-induced dissociation of GDP from Gtα.Gtαβγ complexed with [α-32P]GDP was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.

Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a steady-state GTPase assay provides an additional method of confirming the inhibition of Gα nucleotide exchange by AGS3GPR. The rate of steady-state GTP hydrolysis by Giα1 was 0.028 μmol of Pi/μmol of Giα·min) (Fig. 5 A). Reflecting the ability to inhibit nucleotide exchange, AGS3-(463–650) effectively suppressed the steady-state rate of GTP hydrolysis by Giα1(Fig. 5 A). To test the possibility that AGS3GPR regulates a catalytic step of GTP hydrolysis (kcat), transducin GTPase activity was measured under single turnover conditions ([GTP]< [Gt]) (21Arshavsky V.Y. Gray-Keller M.P. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The kcat for GTP hydrolysis by transducin reconstituted with uROS was 0.015 s−1 (Fig. 5 B). Addition of 5 μm AGS3-(463–650) had no effect on GTP hydrolysis (kcat = 0.014 s−1). Recent findings have identified a novel domain present singly or as multiple repeats in a variety of G protein-interacting proteins (7Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O'Kane C.J.

The first indication that this domain mediates the interaction with Gα subunits came from the analysis of the RGS protein LOCO fromDrosophila (7Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O'Kane C.J. Klambt C. Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently this sequence motif containing 19 amino acid residues has been termed GoLOCO (10Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M.A. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or, more generally, a GPR motif (9Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). GPR proteins identified to date appear to specifically target Gα subunits from the Gifamily. GST pull-down experiments showed association of Pcp2 with Goα and Giα but not Gsα (11Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rap1GAP selectively interacted with Goα and Giα but not with Gsα and Gqα (12Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). AGS3 activated the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone response in the Giα genetic background but not in yeast strains expressing Gpa1, Gsα, or G16α (9Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The specificity of GPR proteins toward different conformations of Gα remains unclear. Pcp2 bound equally the GDP and GTPγS conformations of Goα (11Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, AGS3 displayed preferential interaction with the GDP-bound Gα subunits (9Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Rap1GAP was shown to interact more avidly with GoαGDP (12Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminally extended isoform of Rap1GAP, Rap1GAPII, preferentially bound the GTP-complexed Giα (19Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Modulation of the Rap1GAP and Rap1GAPII activities by Gα subunits suggests an interesting link via GPR motifs between G protein signaling and cascades involving small monomeric GTPases (12Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Currently, the mechanisms of regulation of G protein signaling by GPR proteins are not well understood. By dissociating heterotrimeric complexes Gαβγ, GPR proteins could serve as GPCR-independent activators of G protein pathways that utilize Gβγ subunits to transduce signals (9Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Effects of GPR proteins on GPCR-dependent G protein signaling have not yet been investigated. To examine potential mechanisms of G protein regulation by GPR proteins, we analyzed the effects of AGS3GPR on the guanine nucleotide exchange of Giα and Gtα. Two AGS3 constructs, AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650), containing two and four GPR motifs, respectively, have been utilized to assess the role of domain multiplicity. The AGS3 GPR constructs markedly inhibited spontaneous GTPγS binding to Giα1 because of its intrinsic nucleotide exchange. The full-length AGS3 GPR domain, AGS3-(463–650), was approximately 30-fold more potent than AGS3-(572–629), indicating the possibility that several Gα subunits can simultaneously bind to a single AGS3 molecule. In addition, a better folding of AGS3-(463–650) cannot be excluded. Further experiments demonstrated that AGS3GPR inhibited the rate of GDP dissociation from Giα1. The effectiveness of AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650) in suppressing the Giα1 GDP dissociation rate correlated with their ability to inhibit the rate of GTPγS binding. The inhibitory effect of AGS3GPR on GTPγS binding by Giα1might be entirely due to the decrease in the GDP dissociation rate, although the higher rate of GDP dissociation precludes a firm conclusion. The GDI activity of AGS3GPR is in contrast with an earlier observation that Pcp2 stimulates GDP release from Goα (11Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The basis for the opposite effects of AGS3 and Pcp2 is not clear. It may, conceivably, be related to the structural differences in AGS3 and Pcp2 GPR motifs and/or to Pcp2 sequences outside its GPR domain. AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650) had no effects on the basal nucleotide exchange rate of Gtα. An unstimulated GTPγS binding rate of Gtα is extremely slow (kapp ≃ 0.001 min−1), and therefore it would be practically impossible to discern an inhibitory effect of AGS3GPR. However, any significant stimulation of Gtα GDP/GTP exchange by AGS3 would have been seen. Transducin activation by R* provided an excellent model system to study the potential mechanisms of regulation of GPCR/G protein coupling by GPR proteins. AGS3-(572–629) and AGS3-(463–650) effectively inhibited activation of transducin by R* in the GTPγS binding assay. Furthermore, AGS3GPR was capable of blocking the R*-induced GDP release from Gtα. By analogy to its effect on Giα1, AGS3GPR is likely to act directly on Gtα as a GDI. Other factors may have contributed to the inhibitory effect of AGS3GPR on transducin activation. AGS3 is capable of dissociating Gα and Gβγ (9Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and this would also lead to an impairment in the Gt-R* coupling. Furthermore, AGS3GPR and R* may compete for binding to Gtα, thus causing the inhibition. We did not find any evidence that AGS3GPR affects the kcat for GTP hydrolysis by Gtα. Interestingly, some RGS proteins, such as RGS12 and RGS14, contain GPR motifs (10Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M.A. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These proteins might be capable of very effective dual inhibition of G protein signaling at the level of activation by receptor and at the level of inactivation due to accelerated GTP hydrolysis. Overall, our results demonstrate the capacity of GPR proteins for negative modulation of GPCR-dependent G protein activation. GPR proteins appear to have an interesting dual potential to regulate G protein signaling. AGS3 may act as a selective activator of Gβγ-regulated effector systems independent of a receptor, while at the same time inhibiting the activation of G proteins by a GPCR."
https://openalex.org/W2060214876,"To examine the mechanisms that underlie the neurotrophin-induced, apoptosis-driven hair follicle involution (catagen), the expression and function of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which is implicated in apoptosis control, were studied during spontaneous catagen development in murine skin. By RT-PCR, high steady-state p75NTR mRNA skin levels were found during the anagen-catagen transition of the hair follicle. By immunohistochemistry, p75NTR alone was strongly expressed in TUNEL+/Bcl2- keratinocytes of the regressing outer root sheath, but both p75NTR and TrkB and/or TrkC were expressed by the nonregressing TUNEL-/Bcl2+ secondary hair germ keratinocytes. To determine whether p75NTR is functionally involved in catagen control, spontaneous catagen development was compared in vivo between p75NTR knockout (-/-) and wild-type mice. There was significant catagen retardation in p75NTR knockout mice as compared to wild-type controls (P<0.05). Instead, transgenic mice-overexpressing NGF (promoter: K14) showed substantial acceleration of catagen (P<0.001). Although NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) accelerated catagen in the organ-cultured skin of C57BL/6 mice, these neurotrophins failed to promote catagen development in the organ-cultured p75NTR null skin. These findings suggest that p75NTR signaling is involved in the control of kerotinocyte apoptosis during catagen and that pharmacological manipulation of p75NTR signaling may prove useful for the treatment of hair disorders that display premature entry into catagen."

Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All the HA synthases reported to date produce a broad distribution of high molecular weight (e.g. ∼105-107) HA chains from the substrates, UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA. With the exception of pmHAS, all of the HA synthases share regions of significant homology at the amino acid level and extensive similarity in their hydropathy profiles (25Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 26DeAngelis P.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Based on these similarities the HASs have been grouped into two classes (26DeAngelis P.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Class I HASs include all the eukaryotic and streptococcal enzymes. The pmHAS is presently the only Class II member. The two streptococcal enzymes, spHAS and seHAS, are the smallest members within the HAS family containing, respectively, 419 and 417 amino acids. These two proteins are 72% identical at the amino acid level. The streptococcal enzymes have also been purified to homogeneity and are the most extensively characterized HASs biochemically (27Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J.

These two HASs have been characterized kinetically in membranes or as purified enzymes with respect to theK m values for the two substrate sugars,V max, and average product length. Tlapak-Simmonset al. (27Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

A single HAS protein appears to be solely responsible for HA chain initiation and elongation and probably also for extrusion of the growing HA chain from the cell. The sizes of the HAS enzymes are similar to that of other transporters such as the Lac permease (30Page M.G. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15906-15914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mannose transporter IIC (31Huber F. Erni B. Eur. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1818-1822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike these transporters, however, spHAS and seHAS, as well as the other HAS family members, lack the number of predicted hydrophobic transmembrane domains necessary for the formation of a pore sufficiently large to transport the growing HA chain across the membrane. To understand the enzymatic and transport functions of the HAS family, it is important to determine the topological organization of the active site(s) and membrane-spanning or membrane-associated regions. Previously (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) we predicted a model for spHAS organization in which the ends of the protein and a large central domain were inside the cell (e.g. similar to Fig. 3 E). The eukaryotic HASs, which are ∼35% larger than the streptococcal enzymes, were proposed to have this same topological organization with an additional COOH-terminal region containing several MDs (25Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Since the streptococcal HASs are structurally the smallest, simplest members of this family, information on the topology of the spHAS and seHAS enzymes could help elucidate the basic topology of the remaining HAS family members. In this study, the topology of spHAS was characterized by protease and substrate accessibility and by fusion protein analysis using alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase as reporter enzymes, whose correct folding and activity is dependent on cellular localization. The results support a topology of HAS that is similar to the model proposed earlier, but that entails more potentially complex interactions with the membrane and delineates the membrane-associated regions near the COOH terminus. The starting vector for expression of PCR-mediated fusion proteins was pAlter Ex-1 fromPromega. The vector pKK223-3 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The vector pSKΔLphoA (37van Geest M.

Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were fromPromega unless noted otherwise. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by The Great American Gene Co. or Genosys. DNA plasmid purification was done with Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kits from Qiagen. T7 Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit and 35S-dATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Media were from Fisher and the remaining reagents were of the highest purity available from Sigma unless otherwise noted. E. coli strain DHB9 was provided courtesy of The Beckwith Collection.

CC118 for LacZ fusion assessment was provided courtesy of Dr. Colin Manoil. λTnPhoA provided by Manoil and Beckwith (39Manoil C. Beckwith J. Science. 1986; 233: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) was used for infection of DHB9 cells and integration of the AP coding region into pKK3K. Antibody to TolA (40Levengood S.K. Beyer Jr., W.F. Webster R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Webster. Custom oligonucleotides, 5′-CCCGGGAATTCNTGCCT-ATTTTTAAAAAAACTTTAATTG (forward primer) and 5′-AGAATTCTGCAGTTAATGGTGATGGTGGTGGTGTTTAAAAATAGTGAC (reverse primer, containing a His6 sequence), were used to amplify the coding sequence of spHAS from Streptococcus pyogeneschromosomal DNA by PCR with Taq polymerase (Fisher). The forward primer contains an N to allow for either a Met or Val as the NH2-terminal amino acid; the primer is suitable for either codon, although the KK3K vector used contains the spHAS ORF that begins with a Val as occurs in the wild type enzyme. The PCR product and the plasmid pKK223-3 were gel purified using GeneClean (Bio 101) after digestion with EcoRI and PstI. The products were ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting plasmid, designated pKK3K, was sequenced to confirm the coding sequence and the presence of the COOH-terminal His6 tag. Cells were transformed and maintained on LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. DHB9 cells containing pKK3K were grown in LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 mmMgSO4 with aeration at 30 °C to anA 600 of ∼1.0. λTnPhoA was added to a density of 1.4 × 109 plaque forming units/ml of culture and the cells were incubated without aeration at 30 °C for 20 min. Aliquots of the culture (100 μl) were diluted into 1 ml of LB medium and incubated at 30 °C for ∼12 h with aeration. Portions (200 μl) of these cultures were overlaid onto LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days until colonies were easily visible. The colonies were scraped into a 1.7-ml tube with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline added to each plate. Plasmid DNA from pooled colonies was isolated with Qiaprep spin columns (Qiagen) and used to transform DHB9 competent cells. This step eliminates selection of Tn integration events into the chromosome. Transformed cells were grown on LB/kanamycin plates. Colonies were picked and seeded on gridded LB/Amp plates with 40 μg/ml bromochloroindolyl phosphate, and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After overnight growth, colonies from the gridded plate were screened by PCR to identify clones with the Tn integrated into the spHAS ORF. The forward primer was the same as that used in the synthesis of pKK3K and the reverse primer was AATATCGCCCTGAGCA, which corresponds to a 5′ region of AP. PCR products were checked by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels and those colonies with PCR bands less than 1.3 kilobases in length, the size of the intact coding region, were streaked onto LB/Kan/Amp plates. Colonies were picked and seeded into LB medium with ampicillin, incubated overnight, and the cultures used to prepare frozen glycerol stocks and plasmid DNA. The DNA was digested withEcoRI to confirm the orientation of the fusion. Colonies with properly oriented and sized inserts encoding fusion proteins were grown in 0.5 ml of LB medium with ampicillin and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 40 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) with 10 mm dithiothreitol; 10 μl was used for Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for spHAS or AP. Only colonies with a band at the expected size recognized by both anti-AP and anti-spHAS antibodies were sequenced, using primer PhoA (5′-AATATCGCCCTGAGCA-3′), to confirm the site of the fusion. To create alkaline phosphatase containing a COOH-terminal His6 tag, the AP gene in pSKΔLphoA was amplified by 22 cycles of PCR with primer AP5′ (5′-AGGTCGACCATGGAGGATCCC-3′) and primer APHIS6-3′ (5′-CTAGTCTAGATTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTTCAGCCCCAGAGCG-3′) usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product and pAlter Ex-1 were digested with BamHI and XbaI and separated from the primers by a Qiagen PCR purification column. The PCR product was ligated to the pAlter Ex-1 restriction digest product with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and transformed into DHB9 competent cells. Colonies were screened by plasmid preparation and restriction digestion for the proper size and orientation of insert. The desired plasmid was designated pAP6X-1. Fig.1 shows schematically how the spHAS-AP and spHAS-LacZ fusion protein vectors were constructed. Primers were designed to amplify different lengths of the spHAS ORF. HA5′(5′-CGGGATCCGTGCCTATTTTTAAAAAAACT-3′) was used for PCR withPfu polymerase and position Thr (5′-AGTTTTTTTAAAAATAGGCACGGATCCCG-3′), Asn (5′-ATTTCCTTTAAATGGCTCAT-3′), or Pro (5′-GGGATTAGAAAGAATTTTTTT-3′) from a pKK3K template. PCR products were ligated to KpnI linker from New England Biolabs. Ligation reactions and pAP6X-1 were digested with BamHI andKpnI and ligated together. Pfu PCR was also used to generate spHAS fragments with a restriction site at the 3′ end of the products to facilitate insertion into the vector. For these PCR reactions, HA5′ was used with the reverse primers: Gly37 (5′-GGGTACCCCATAAATTCCTACAGTTGATG-3′), Val134 (5′-GGGGTACCCCGACAAGGGAACGGTGAACGATAACGTTTCGAC-3′), Gly270 (5′-GGGGTACCCTCCTAAATCAATAGCATAATTTG-3′), Asp349(5′-GGGGTACCCCGTCTAATTGAATAGCTTGAT-3′), Pro376(5′-GGGTACCCCAGGATGTTTGACCATATAAT-3′), and Lys419(5′-GGGGATCCCCTTTAAAAATAGTGACCTTTT). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into pAP6X-1. All ligations were transformed into DHB9 cells and screened by colony PCR using primers HA5′ and PhoA. Those colonies giving the expected band size were grown in overnight culture and plasmids were purified. Plasmids were screened by restriction digest then sequenced with the PhoA primer to confirm location and frame of fusions. The ORFs for the transposon-created fusion proteins were PCR-amplified with primers HA5′ and APHIS63′. PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the pAlter Ex-1 vector. Clones were isolated and assessed for correct construction by sequencing through the junction site. Primers LacZ-5′ (5′-CCCCGGGTACCTGACTCTTATACACAAAGTA-3′) and LacZH6–3′(5′-CTAGTCTAGATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTTTTGACACCAGACCAA-3′) were used to amplify the β-galactosidase ORF from strain CC170 with Pfu polymerase as above. This product and the K419AP6 construct were digested with KpnI and XbaI, gel purified, and the LacZ fragment was ligated into the Lys419 construct. The spHAS PCR amplifications used for the AP6 fusion proteins described above were also ligated into the Lys419 LacZ construct after digestion with BamHI and KpnI to remove the Lys419insert. Fusions were confirmed by sequencing the spHAS insert through the junction site. LacZ fusions were grown in JM109 cells. Clones with confirmed fusion proteins were grown overnight in LB/Amp. The overnight cultures were diluted 1:25 to start new cultures in LB/Amp grown at 30 °C with aeration for 3–4 h. Cultures were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. To determine the relative activity of the various fusion proteins, we measured cell number (by A 600), the amount of fusion protein (by quantitative Western analysis), and enzyme activity (by colorimetric assays). One ml of cells from each culture was transferred to a 1.7-ml microfuge tube and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, or phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgSO4 and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A portion (100 μl) of the suspension was diluted into 0.9 ml of cold 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, or phosphate-buffered saline and A 600 was determined. A second 100 μl of the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer with 10 mmdithiothreitol, heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and used for Western blots. Another 100 μl of the suspension was diluted into 0.9 ml of 1m Tris, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, or phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgSO4and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fifty μl of 0.1% SDS and 50 μl of chloroform were then added and the tube was vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. At time 0, 100 μl of 0.4%p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 m Tris or 8 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside was added to each reaction tube. When a yellow reaction color was observed, 120 μl of 83.3 mm EDTA, 83 mm KH2PO4was added to stop the AP assays, or 0.5 ml of 1 mNa2CO3 was added to stop the Lac assays. The time was noted, the tube was transferred to ice andA 550 and A 420 were obtained. Activities were determined using the formula: 1000*[A 420 − (1.75 ×A 550)] ÷ (time in min × nmol construct) as described by others (42Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1971Google Scholar). Both the LacZ and AP assays were also done in a multiwell plate reader format with 20 and 40 μl of induced resuspension and 20 μl of substrate in a total volume of 200 μl/well. Plate reader assays were scanned every 30 s over 1 h with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Spectramax 340, Molecular Devices). Activities were determined over the linear range of substrate conversion. Based on prior published cutoff values used by numerous other investigators (31Huber F. Erni B. Eur. J.

The average activity of each fusion protein, using the same assay method was compared as a percentage to the fusion protein construct with the highest activity. For example, for the spHAS-AP fusion proteins, all the plate-based assays were evaluated as a percent of the Asp349-AP fusion, which gave the highest specific activity in this assay. For AP or LacZ fusion proteins with low activity, the reporter protein was assessed as inside or outside of the cell, respectively. For AP or LacZ fusion proteins with high activity, the reporter protein was assessed as outside or inside of the cell, respectively. If fusion protein pairs (i.e. both AP and LacZ fusion proteins at the same spHAS position) had intermediate activities, neither was assigned an orientation because of this ambiguity or the fusion site was considered to be part of a possible MD. Samples (5–10 μl) in SDS-PAGE buffer were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 200 V for 50 min. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 100 V for 2 h in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Cell. Blots were stained with 0.05% copper(II)phthalocyanine-3,4′,4′′,4′′′-tetrasulfonic acid, tetrasodium salt (Aldrich) and images of the blots were captured with an Alpha-Innotech IS1000 imaging system. Blots were destained and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST (with 0.05% NaN3) for ≥1 h. Blots were washed in TBST and exposed to a 1:1000 dilution of anti-penta-His monoclonal Ab from Qiagen or anti-β-galactosidase monoclonal Ab from Calbiochem, in TBST containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Antibodies were biotinylated with NHS-biotin from Pierce. Secondary development was for 1 h with125I-streptavidin and the blots were analyzed using a phosphoscreen on a Molecular Dynamics Personal PhosphorImager. Expression levels were measured as integrated density values and converted to nanomole of fusion protein using an internal standard curve of purified spHAS-H6. This was followed by detection with rabbit anti-mouse IgG Ab conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Blots were developed with 0.3 mg/ml p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphatep-toluidine salt in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2. To assess which portions of spHAS reside in the periplasm, spheroplasts of cells expressing spHAS-H6(i.e. the full-length protein; not a fusion protein) were subjected to several modifying agents. Overnight cultures were seeded 1:15 into 13 ml of LB/ampicillin and grown at 30 °C, 250 rpm until late log phase. Cells were induced for 3 h with 1.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 13 ml of 20 mmTris, pH 8.5, 20% sucrose, and 0.5 ml of suspension was removed as a “no treatment” control. EDTA was added to 2 mm and lysozyme was added to 10 μg/ml. Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and >90% cell wall removal was observed by light microscopy verifying the production of spheroplasts (51Herzlinger D. Viitanen P. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochem. 1984; 23: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The MgSO4concentration was brought to 15 mm and a lysate was prepared by sonication of a 6-ml portion of the spheroplast suspension, using a microtip probe at 20 watts (W-380; Heat Systems Ultrasonic, Inc., Farmingdale, NY), until the suspensions appeared clear. Aliquots (1 ml) of spheroplasts and cell lysates were treated with either 0.2 mg/ml chymotrypsin, 0.2 mg/ml trypsin, 0.2 mg/ml Pronase, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, 9 mg/ml NHS-Biotin, or 3 mg/ml (+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine for 30 min on ice. Proteases were inhibited with 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor or 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Spheroplasts were separated from modifying reagents, broken cells, cell walls, and outer membrane fragments by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 1 min through 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20% sucro"
https://openalex.org/W2108628018,"Activation of the complement system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is potentially involved in the progression of the disease. We therefore investigated whether the terminal complement complex C5b-9 affects IL-6 production from vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMC) and set out to determine the underlying signal transduction pathway. Stimulation of human VSMC with C5b-9 resulted in an increase of IL-6 transcript and production of IL-6 protein. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibited complement-dependent IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 release, suggesting the involvement of Gi-proteins and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB). C5b-9 also induced formation of reactive oxygen species, which, along with IL-6 release, was inhibited by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. C5b-9 activated the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-kB and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which were both involved in the induction of IL-6 by C5b-9, as demonstrated by cis element double-stranded (decoy) oligonucleotides (ODN). The results demonstrate that activation of the complement system induces IL-6 release from human VSMC by a Gi-dependent pathway involving the generation of oxidative stressand the activation of the redox sensitive transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1. Our data support a new mechanism for the proatherogenic effect of the terminal complement complex."
https://openalex.org/W2000502515,"Retinoic acid (RA), through nuclear retinoid receptors, regulates the expression of numerous genes. However, little is known of the biochemical mechanisms that regulate RA concentration in vivo. CYP26 (P450RAI), a novel cytochrome P450, is expressed during embryonic development, induced by all-trans RA, and capable of catalyzing the oxidation of [3H]RA to polar retinoids including 4-oxo-RA. Here we report that CYP26 expression in adult liver is regulated by all-trans RA and dietary vitamin A, and is correlated with the metabolism of all-trans RA to polar metabolites. In normal mouse and rat liver, CYP26 mRNA was barely detectable; however, after acute treatment with all-trans RA CYP26 mRNA and RA metabolism by liver microsomes were significantly induced. Aqueous-soluble RA metabolites were detected, but their formation was not induced. The expression of retinoid receptors, RAR-gamma and RXR-alpha, was not changed after RA treatment in vivo. In a model of chronic vitamin A ingestion during aging, CYP26 mRNA expression, determined by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis, increased progressively with dietary vitamin A (P<0.0001; marginal < control < supplemented) and age (P<0.003). The relative expression of CYP26 mRNA was positively correlated with liver total retinol (log10), ranging from undetectable CYP26 expression at liver retinol concentrations below approximately 20 nmol/g to a three- to fourfold elevation at concentrations >10,000 nmol/g (r=0.90, P<0.0001). We conclude that CYP26 expression and RA metabolism are regulated in adult liver not only acutely by RA administration, as may be relevant to retinoid therapy, but under chronic dietary conditions relevant to vitamin A nutrition in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2004797151,"The Munc-18 protein (mammalian homologue of theunc-18 gene; also called nSec1 or rbSec1) has been identified as an essential component of the synaptic vesicle fusion protein complex. The cellular and subcellular localization and functional role of Munc-18 protein in pancreatic β-cells was investigated. Subcellular fractionation of insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells revealed a 67-kDa protein in both cytosol and membrane fractions. Immunohistochemistry showed punctate Munc-18 immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of rat pancreatic islet cells. Direct double-labeling immunofluorescence histochemistry combined with confocal laser microscopy revealed the presence of Munc-18 immunoreactivity in insulin-, glucagon-, pancreatic polypeptide-, and somatostatin-containing cells. Syntaxin 1 immunoreactivity was detected in extracts of HIT-T15 cells, which were immunoprecipitated using Munc-18 antiserum, suggesting an intimate association of Munc-18 with syntaxin 1. Administration of Munc-18 peptide or Munc-18 antiserum to streptolysin O-permeabilized HIT-T15 cells resulted in significantly increased insulin release, but did not have any significant effect on voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity. The findings taken together show that the Munc-18 protein is present in insulin-secreting β-cells and implicate Munc-18 as a negative regulator of the insulin secretory machinery via a mechanism that does not involve syntaxin-associated Ca2+ channels. The Munc-18 protein (mammalian homologue of theunc-18 gene; also called nSec1 or rbSec1) has been identified as an essential component of the synaptic vesicle fusion protein complex. The cellular and subcellular localization and functional role of Munc-18 protein in pancreatic β-cells was investigated. Subcellular fractionation of insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells revealed a 67-kDa protein in both cytosol and membrane fractions. Immunohistochemistry showed punctate Munc-18 immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of rat pancreatic islet cells. Direct double-labeling immunofluorescence histochemistry combined with confocal laser microscopy revealed the presence of Munc-18 immunoreactivity in insulin-, glucagon-, pancreatic polypeptide-, and somatostatin-containing cells. Syntaxin 1 immunoreactivity was detected in extracts of HIT-T15 cells, which were immunoprecipitated using Munc-18 antiserum, suggesting an intimate association of Munc-18 with syntaxin 1. Administration of Munc-18 peptide or Munc-18 antiserum to streptolysin O-permeabilized HIT-T15 cells resulted in significantly increased insulin release, but did not have any significant effect on voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity. The findings taken together show that the Munc-18 protein is present in insulin-secreting β-cells and implicate Munc-18 as a negative regulator of the insulin secretory machinery via a mechanism that does not involve syntaxin-associated Ca2+ channels. solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment protein receptor vesicular SNARE target SNARE synaptosomal-associated protein vesicle-associated membrane protein phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis picofarad Exocytosis is a highly regulated process involving the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (1Bennett M.K.

According to the solubleN -ethylmaleimide-sensitiveattachment protein receptor (SNARE)1 hypothesis of vesicle fusion, vesicles dock to a target membrane through the interaction of complementary sets of vesicular (v-SNARE) and target (t-SNARE) membrane proteins. In synaptic vesicle exocytosis, the vesicular protein synaptobrevin (also calledvesicle-associated membraneprotein (VAMP)) is the v-SNARE, and the plasma membrane-associated proteins SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associatedprotein of 25 kDa) and syntaxin 1 function as t-SNAREs (4Söllner T.

Formation of the SNARE complex (or core complex) is followed by recruitment of the cytosolic proteins NSF (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor) and α-, β-, and γ-SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein), which are required for membrane fusion (12Whiteheart S.W.

Evidence from yeast genetics suggest that other proteins also participate in the event of exocytosis and may therefore play a role in the regulation of assembly of the SNARE complex (2Ferro-Novick S.

In the present study, we have investigated the cellular localization of Munc-18 at the protein level in pancreatic endocrine cells using subcellular fractionation combined with Western blotting as well as immunohistochemistry combined with confocal laser microscopy. The possible association of Munc-18 with syntaxin in insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells was investigated by means of immunoprecipitation. The effect of Munc-18 peptide and Munc-18 antiserum on insulin release was studied in streptolysin O-permeabilized insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to study the effect of Munc-18 peptide and Munc-18 antiserum on voltage-gated Ca2+ currents. HIT-T15 cells were grown to 70% confluency in 80-cm2 NuncTM flasks (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) and homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors. The HIT-T15 cell homogenate was fractionated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation essentially as described (40Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were detached from the flasks using a 2-min incubation in PBS with 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in homogenization buffer (4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 0.005% DNase, and the following protease inhibitors: 4 μg/ml of pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine. The cells were homogenized using 40 strokes of a Teflon/glass homogenizer. Homogenate was produced by centrifugation at 5,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Protein estimation of HIT-T15 cell homogenate was performed by protein microassay (Bio-Rad). The homogenate of HIT-T15 cells was supplemented with EDTA to a final concentration of 1.5 mm, loaded onto a linear sucrose density gradient (0.45–2.0 m), and centrifuged at 4 °C for 18 h at 100,000 × g, and then seven fractions (700 μl) were collected. The molarity of each fraction was determined. Brain homogenate was prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 100 g, B & K Universal, Stockholm, Sweden), using a Teflon/glass homogenizer, by homogenization in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mmEGTA (pH 7.5) containing the following protease inhibitors: 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μmleupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 50 μmbenzamidine, 0.5 μm soya trypsin inhibitor, and 0.005% DNase (Sigma). The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. A protein estimation was performed by protein microassay (Bio-Rad). 18 μg of protein of each HIT-T15 cell fraction and 9.4 μg of brain homogenate (as a positive control) were denatured for 5 min at 100 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (41Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins. A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 1-147Google Scholar). An analysis was performed on an 8% (HIT-T15 cell fractions) or 7.5% (rat brain homogenate) SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) in 10% methanol, 20 mm Tris, 150 mmglycine, and 0.05% SDS for 12–14 h at 0.35 mA (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of the primary antibody was blocked by incubation in 5% dried milk in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20). The blot was subsequently probed overnight at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal anti-Munc-18-1 antibody (diluted 1:700; catalog no. M32320, BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The blots were washed with buffer B (50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.5% Tween 20) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey-anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in buffer A and finally washed with buffer B. Detection was performed using an ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the immunoreactive bands visualized with Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was rinsed 3 times with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (1:50, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Homogenates of HIT-T15 cells and rat brain were precleared at 4 °C for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose to eliminate nonspecific IgG and protein that bind nonspecifically to the beads. The beads were spun down for 2 min at 7000 ×g. The supernatants were incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotatory shaker with rabbit antiserum to Munc-18-1 (catalog no. 116-002, Synaptic Systems GmbH, Göttingen, Germany), or normal rabbit serum as control, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times at 4 °C with lysis buffer without Triton X-100. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in 8 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated for 20 min at 60 °C in a water bath, and centrifuged. The supernatants were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and blotted using a monoclonal antibody against syntaxin 1 (diluted 1:1,000; product S-0664, clone HPC-1, Sigma). Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (B &}K Universal, birth weight, 80–100 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (MebumalTM; 40 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and perfused via the ascending aorta with Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution (37 °C) followed by an ice-cold mixture of formalin-picric acid (4% paraformaldehyde and 0.4% picric acid in 0.16 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.9). The pancreas was removed rapidly, immediately fixed by immersion in the same fixative for 90 min, and rinsed for 24 h in an 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% sucrose, 0.02% Bacitracin, and 0.01% sodium azide. Sections were cut at a 10-μm thickness in a cryostat (Dittes, Heidelberg, Germany) and processed for direct immunofluorescence histochemistry. The sections were rinsed in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min and incubated in 5% horse serum (in buffer C) for 1 h. The sections were incubated with rabbit antiserum to Munc-18-1 (diluted 1:800; Synaptic Systems) in buffer D (PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.01% sodium azide, and 0.02% Bacitracin) overnight at 4 °C. Control sections were incubated with normal rabbit serum (1:10) as primary antibody. The sections were washed in buffer C for 1 h and incubated with lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:40; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sections were double-labeled by combining rabbit antiserum to Munc-18-1 (diluted 1:800; Synaptic Systems) with mouse monoclonal antibody to insulin (diluted 1:6,000; catalog no. I-2018, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal antibody to glucagon (diluted 1: 6000; catalog no. G-2654, Sigma), mouse monoclonal antibody to somatostatin (diluted 1:600) (44Buchan A.M. Sikora L.K. Levy J.G. McIntosh C.H. Dyck I. Brown J.C. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), or guinea pig antiserum to pancreatic polypeptide (diluted 1:12,000; lot RPP-63, Linco Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO). The combinations were visualized using a mixture of Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (diluted 1:250) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (diluted 1:80) or guinea pig (diluted 1:80) secondary antibodies (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch). After rinsing, all sections were mounted in p-phenylenediamine dissolved in PBS and glycerol (1:3) to prevent fading of immunofluorescence. Monolayers of the clonal insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells were cultured in NuncTM dishes (Nunc) using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 11 mm glucose and kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 95% air, 5% CO2 (45Santerre R.F.

Diabetes. 1985; 34: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were used between passages 60 and 70. The cells were fixed by immersion in fixative as described above for 15 min, rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min and buffer C containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and incubated with 5% horse serum for 1 h. The cells were incubated thereafter with rabbit antiserum to Munc-18, processed as described above, and visualized with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Specimens were examined in a Bio-Rad Radiance Plus confocal laser scanning system. The excitation wavelength was 488 nm for fluorescein isothiocyanate-, 543 nm for lissamine-rhodamine- and Cy3-, and 638 nm for Cy5-induced fluorescence. The images were produced using a Fuji Pictrography 3000 printer. HIT-T15 cells were grown in 96-well plates and incubated in a permeabilization buffer (potassium glutamate 140 mm, NaCl 5 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, EGTA 10 mm, and HEPES 25 mm with 0.025% albumin, pH 7.0) with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 12.5 mg/ml streptolysin O (Difco) at 37 °C for 8 min. The cells were incubated thereafter in the modified permeabilization buffer additionally containing 2 mm MgATP, 2 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and pCa 7.5 and 5 at 37 °C for 20 min. In the experiments using Munc-18-1 antiserum, permeabilized cells were incubated with the modified permeabilization buffer containing Munc-18-1 antiserum (2.5 μg/ml; BD Transduction Laboratories), first at 4 °C for 30 min, after which the temperature was raised to 37 °C. The insulin content in the buffer was measured by radioimmunoassay. The level of insulin secretion at 10 μmfree Ca2+ was taken as 100%. A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 575–594 of rat Munc-18 (19Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) was synthesized (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada). IgG was obtained from Calbiochem. Student'st test was used for statistical analysis. HIT-T15 cells were cultured for 4 days in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 32.5 μm glutathione, 0.1 μm selenous acid, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Whole-cell currents were recorded in single cells. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) on a horizontal programmable puller (DMZ Universal Puller, Zeitz Instrumente, Augsburg, Germany). Typical electrode resistance was 3–5 megaohms. Electrodes were filled with a standard internal solution in the presence or absence of 25 μm synthetic Munc-18 peptide-(575–594) (19Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), rabbit IgG (1:100), and polyclonal Munc-18 antiserum (1:100; Synaptic Systems), respectively. The standard internal solution contained 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 3 mm Mg-ATP (pH 7.2). The cells were bathed in a solution containing 140 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 3 mm glucose (pH 7.4). After obtaining a seal, the holding potential was set at −70 mV during the course of an experiment, and depolarizing voltage pulses (70 mV, 100 ms, 0.05 Hz) were applied. The resulting currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and filtered at 1 kHz. All recordings were made at room temperature (about 22 °C). The integrated Ca2+ currents were normalized by the capacitance of cells. Acquisition and analysis of data were done using the software program pCLAMP (Axon Instruments). Incubation of rat brain homogenate with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against Munc-18-1 revealed a strong band of approximately 67 kDa (Fig. 1). In subcellular fractions of HIT-T15 cells, there were bands corresponding to the predicted size of 67 kDa in all of the seven subcellular fractions, including both cytosol (Fig. 1, fractions 1 and 2) and membrane (fractions 4–6) fractions. Fraction 3 represents an intermediate of membrane and cytosol fractions, whereas fraction 7 represents a nuclear fraction. At a short exposure time, it was evident that there were two bands at around the predicted size of 67 kDa in rat brain homogenate as well as in fractions 2–6 but not in fractions 1 and 7. To evaluate the possible association of Munc-18-1 with syntaxin 1, immunoprecipitation was performed on homogenates of HIT-T15 cells and rat brain using a polyclonal antibody against Munc-18-1. A 35-kDa band corresponding to syntaxin 1 was demonstrated in extracts of HIT-T15 cells and rat brain (Fig. 2), which had been immunoprecipitated using the Munc-18-1 antiserum. There was strong Munc-18 immunoreactivity in virtually all cells of the islets of Langerhans as well as in cultured HIT-T15 cells (Figs. 3 A—C, and 4, A, C, E, and G). Munc-18 immunoreactivity was also demonstrated in nerve fibers and nerve terminals present around blood vessels and extending into the islets and the acini of exocrine cells (Fig. 3 A). Weak Munc-18 immunoreactivity was also demonstrated in pancreatic exocrine cells (Figs. 3 A and4, A, C, E, and G). Confocal laser microscopy revealed that Munc-18 immunoreactivity was punctate within the cytoplasm of endocrine cells (Figs. 3,A–C, and 4, A, C, E, and G).Figure 4Images of sections of rat pancreas obtained via confocal laser microscopy after direct double-labeling immunofluorescence histochemistry combining rabbit antiserum to Munc-18 (A, C, E, and G) with mouse monoclonal antibodies to insulin (B), glucagon (D), somatostatin (H), and guinea pig antiserum to pancreatic polypeptide (PP) (F).Punctate Munc-18 immunoreactivity is present in insulin-, glucagon-, pancreatic polypeptide-, and somatostatin-containing cells (comparearrows in A, C, E, and G with those inB, D, F, and H, respectively).Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Direct double-labeling immunofluorescence histochemistry of rat pancreatic islets demonstrated Munc-18 immunoreactivity in insulin (compare Fig. 4, A with B)-, glucagon (compare Fig. 4, C with D)-, pancreatic polypeptide (compare Fig. 4, E with F)-, and somatostatin (compare Fig. 4, G with H)-containing cells. Incubation with non-immune serum did not reveal any fluorescence in the rat pancreas (data not shown). In the presence of 30 nmCa2+, there was no significant difference in insulin release from streptolysin O-permeabilized HIT-T15 cells after the addition of Munc-18 peptide-(575–594) (25 μm) (19Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) in comparison with control (Fig. 5 A). However, in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+, there was a significant increase in insulin release after administration of Munc-18 peptide (25 μm) compared with control (Fig. 5 A).

Thus, we devised a new strategy for anti-MCP-1 gene therapy against arteriosclerosis by transfecting an amino-terminal deletion mutant (missing the amino-terminal amino acids 2 to 8) of the human MCP-1 gene into a remote organ (skeletal muscles). Intramuscular transduction with the mutant MCP-1 gene blocked monocyte recruitment induced by a subcutaneous injection of recombinant MCP-1. In a rat model in which the chronic inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis induces early vascular inflammation as well as subsequent coronary vascular remodeling, this strategy suppressed monocyte recruitment into the coronary vessels and the development of vascular medial thickening, but did not reduce perivascular fibrosis. Thus, MCP-1 is necessary for the development of medial thickening but not for fibrosis in this model. This new strategy may be a useful and feasible gene therapy against arteriosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2097878328,"Preconditioning stress induced by a transient ischemia may increase brain tolerance to oxidative stress, and the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are not well understood. In a series of experiments, we found that endogenous nitric oxide (NO), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and antioxidants blocked serum deprivation-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells. Similar to nuclear redox factor-1 (Ref-1), mRNA of human neuronal nitric oxide synthase (hNOS1) was maximally up-regulated within 2 h after oxidative stress and down-regulated by NO/GSNO and hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenger. A brief preconditioning stress induced by serum deprivation for 2 h caused a delayed increase in the expression of hNOS1 protein and the associated formation of NO and cGMP, which in turn decreased OH generation and stress-related cell death. In addition to inhibiting caspase-3 through a dithiothreitol-sensitive S-nitrosylation process, preconditioning stress concomitantly up-regulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein and down-regulated the p66shc adaptor protein. This beneficial cytoprotective process of preconditioning stress is mediated by newly synthesized NO because it can be suppressed by the inhibition of hNOS1 and guanylyl cyclase. Therefore, the constitutive isoform of hNOS1 is dynamically redox-regulated to meet both functional and compensatory demands of NO for gene regulation, antioxidant defense, and tolerance to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2136744885,"Stress modifies all aspects of cellular physiology, including the targeting of macromolecules to the nucleus. To determine how distinct types of stress affect classical nuclear protein import, we followed the distribution of NLS-GFP, a reporter protein containing a classical nuclear localization sequence (NLS) fused to green fluorescent protein GFP. Nuclear accumulation of NLS-GFP requires import to be constitutively active; inhibition of import redistributes NLS-GFP throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, starvation, heat shock, ethanol and hydrogen peroxide rapidly inhibited classical nuclear import, whereas osmotic stress had no effect. To define the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of classical nuclear import, we located soluble components of the nuclear transport apparatus. Failure to accumulate NLS-GFP in the nucleus always correlated with a redistribution of the small GTPase Gsp1p. Whereas predominantly nuclear under normal conditions, Gsp1p equilibrated between nucleus and cytoplasm in cells exposed to starvation, heat, ethanol or hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, analysis of yeast strains carrying mutations in different nuclear transport factors demonstrated a role for NTF2, PRP20 and MOG1 in establishing a Gsp1p gradient, as conditional lethal alleles of NTF2 and PRP20 or a deletion of MOG1 prevented Gsp1p nuclear accumulation. On the basis of these results, we now propose that certain types of stress release Gsp1p from its nuclear anchors, thereby promoting a collapse of the nucleocytoplasmic Gsp1p gradient and inhibiting classical nuclear protein import."
https://openalex.org/W2046278419,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from platelets and mononuclear phagocytes regulates T cell functions through endothelial differentiation gene-encoded G protein-coupled receptors (Edg Rs). Human blood unactivated CD4+ T cells express predominant ly Edg-4 LPA R over marginal levels of Edg-2 LPA R, as assessed by semiquantitative PCR and Western blots. After mitogen activation, the CD4+ T cells express Ed g-2 Rs at approximately one half the level of Edg-4 Rs. Secretion of IL-2 by unactivated Edg-4 R-predominant CD4+ T cells incubated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies was suppressed significantly and by up to 60% by 10-10 M to 10-6 M LPA, whereas secretion of IL-2 by mitogen-activated Edg-2 R and Edg-4 R codominant CD4+ T cells was enhanced by up to twofold by the same concentrations of LPA. The possibility that the two Edg Rs transduce different LPA signals to CD4+ T cells was supported by findings that IL-2 secretion was inhibited by mouse anti-Edg-4 R monoclonal antibody, but enhanced by mouse anti-Edg-2 R monoclonal antibody. The separate effects of each LPA R were studied in Jurkat T cell transfectants expressing principally human Edg-2 Rs (Jurkat-T-2) or Edg-4 Rs (Jurkat-T-4) and stimulated with anti-CD3 plus phorbol myristate acetate. LPA and anti-Edg-4 R antibody suppressed IL-2 secretion by stimulated Jurkat-T-4 cells, whereas LPA and anti-Edg-2 R antibody enhanced IL-2 secretion by stimulated Jurkat-T-2 cells. Activation-induced alterations in the relative levels of Edg-2 and -4 Rs on CD4+ T cells thus reverse the effects of LPA on T cell receptor-stimulated generation of IL-2."

Here we show that a myotrophin-like polypeptide from the sponge Suberites domuncula causes the expression of collagen in cells from the same sponge in vitro. The cDNA of the sponge myotrophin was isolated; the potential open reading frame of 360 nt encodes a 120 aa long protein (Mr of 12,837). The sequence SUBDOMYOL shares high similarity with the known metazoan myotrophin sequences. The expression of SUBDOMYOL is low in single cells but high after formation of primmorph aggregates as well as in intact animals. Recombinant myotrophin was found to stimulate protein synthesis by fivefold, as analyzed by incorporation studies using [3H] lysine. In addition, it is shown that after incubation of single cells with myotrophin, the primmorphs show an unusual elongated, oval-shaped appearance. It is demonstrated that in the presence of recombinant myotrophin, the cells up-regulate the expression of the collagen gene. The cDNA for S. domuncula collagen was isolated; the deduced aa sequence shows that the collagenous internal domain is rather short, with only 24 G-x-y collagen triplets. We conclude that the sponge myotrophin causes in homologous cells the same/similar effect as the cardiac myotrophin in mammalian cells, where it is involved in initiation of cardial ventricular hypertrophy. We assume that an understanding of sponge molecular cell biology will also contribute to a further elucidation of human diseases, here of the cardiovascular system."
https://openalex.org/W1987110948,"The role of conserved Asp204 in the human high affinity Na+/glucose cotransporter (hSGLT1) was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis combined with functional assays exploiting the Xenopus oocyte expression system.

This family uses electrochemical Na+ gradients to drive the coupled uphill transport of a variety of substrates (sugars, amino acids, vitamins, osmolytes, ions, myo-inositol, urea, and water). The expression of hSGLT1 in Xenopus laevisoocytes has resulted in a comprehensive study of both steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics (3Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M.

A six-state ordered binding model has been proposed in which transport results from ligand-induced conformational changes (6Wright E.M. Loo D.D.F. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Lostao M.P.

In this model Na+ binds before sugar, with a coupling ratio of 2 Na+:1 glucose, and voltage influences both Na+ binding and the conformational states of the unloaded transporter. Functional analysis of SGLT chimeras and truncated proteins strongly suggests that the sugar pathway is located in the C-terminal domain of the protein (8Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Kong C.T.

Site-directed thiol labeling of a residue in the proposed sugar pathway indicates that conformational changes are responsible for the coupling of Na+ and sugar transport (10Loo D.D.F.

We suggest that these conformational alterations are induced by cation binding in the N-terminal domain of the protein. Although the functional importance of the N terminus in cation binding/translocation was shown for another SGLT family member (the Na+/proline transporter (PutP) of Escherichia coli) (11Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Quick M. Stoelting S. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13523-13529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), there is little information on the role of the N-terminal domain in hSGLT1. We have initiated a study to explore the role of N-terminal residues in hSGLT1 in cotransport. In the present study, we have targeted a conserved residue, Asp204, located in a short cytoplasmic loop of hSGLT1 connecting transmembrane domains V and VI, which has been implicated in cation selectivity in PutP (12Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Replacing Asp204 in hSGLT1 with Asn, Cys, or Glu dramatically modulated the steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of the transporter. Remarkably, although a transporter with a negative amino acid (Asp or Glu) exhibited cation/glucose cotransport with a stoichiometry of 2 (Na+ or H+) to 1, neutralization of Asp204 (by Asn or Cys) resulted in the activation of a glucose-activated H+ channel. A plasmid containing human SGLT1 (hSGLT1) cDNA was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of Asp204 with Asn, Cys, and Glu was performed using a two-step polymerase chain reaction protocol (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6768) Google Scholar).

Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BglII and Eco47III, and the resulting 428-bp fragments were ligated into a similarly treated wild-type hSGLT1-containing plasmid. The fidelity of the inserted DNA fragments was confirmed by sequencing double-stranded DNA (Sequenase version 2.0, DNA sequencing kit, United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) after alkaline denaturation (15Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Each mutagenized DNA template was linearized with XbaI, transcribed, and cappedin vitro using the T3 RNA promoter (MEGAscript kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). X. laevis oocytes were injected with 50 ng of mRNA and were incubated in Barth medium containing gentamicin (5 mg/ml) at 18 °C for 3–7 days (4Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For transport and electrophysiological experiments, oocytes were bathed in an assay buffer composed of 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5, and a combination of Na+or choline+ chloride salts to give a final concentration of 100 mm. For H+ activation experiments the pH of 100 mm choline buffer was varied between 8.0 and 4.5 by titration with Tris or Mes. Uptake of methyl-α-d-[U-14C]glucopyranoside (293 Ci/mol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and electrophysiological measurements using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique were performed as described (16Ikeda T.S.

All experiments were repeated at least three times with oocytes from different donor frogs. Data fits were performed using the non-linear regression algorithm in SigmaPlot (version 5.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Unless otherwise noted, figures are based on data obtained from a typical experiment on a single oocyte, and errors represent S.E. of the fit. In these studies all comparisons between Na+ and H+ kinetics were performed in the same oocyte expressing WT, D204C, D204E, or D204N cRNA. For comparison of WT kinetics and the kinetics of a transporter with a substitution at position 204, oocytes of the same batch were analyzed on the same day within 10 h. The most conservative substitution Asp204 → Glu resulted in a reduction of Na+-dependent αMDG uptake by 87%, whereas the uptake rates of D204C and D204N were reduced by ∼50% (Fig.1). In the absence of Na+ions, the rate of αMDG uptake in oocytes expressing D204E was about 1 pmol/h, a value comparable to oocytes with the native transporter (1.7 pmol × h−1 × oocyte−1). However, replacing Asp204 with Cys or Asn increased the uptake rate by 7- and 16-fold. This increase may reflect the enhanced apparent affinity for sugar (see Table I).Table ISummary of kinetic parameters in presence of Na+ and H+ANa+I maxGlcK 0.5GlcK 0.5Na+Q maxk catNa+1-ak catcation represents the maximal turnover rate (given by the ratioI maxcation/Q max) evaluated for saturating I-V relations.

A similar I-V relation was observed for D204E in Nac, but in Hc the sugar-induced currents exhibited a supralinear increase with hyperpolarization. D204C and D204N (data not shown) exhibited essentially identical I-V relations with no saturation of the sugar-evoked currents at the most negative potential (−150 mV) in either Nac or in Hc. The glucose-evoked currents in Hc for these transporters were much greater than the Na+ currents (see Table I). In Hc for the latter transporters, glucose activated outward currents at potentials more positive than ∼+20 mV (∼+100 nA at +50 mV). A comparison of the sugar-induced currents at V m = −150 mV revealed similar values in the presence of Hc for WT (−1220 nA), D204C (−1120 nA), and D204N (−870 nA), and a reduction of about 75% for D204E (−300 nA). In Nac, WT and D204E showed comparable currents generated by 100 mmd-glucose at −150 mV (−1480 and −930 nA). Under the same test conditions, D204C and D204N exhibited less than 10% of the current observed for WT. We measured the sugar kinetics of each transporter by varying external [Glc] from 0.05 to 100 mm in the presence of Nacor Hc. The apparent affinity constants ford-glucose ( K0.5Glc) at V m = −110 mV are shown in Table I. As described earlier (20Hirayama B.A. Lostao M.P. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Turk E. Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G919-G926PubMed Google Scholar), hSGLT1 exhibited a K0.5Glc of 0.3 mm in Nac. When Hc substituted for Nac the apparent affinity for Glc was reduced by 20-fold ( K0.5Glc = 6 mm). A similar reduction of the apparent Glc affinity in Hc was also observed for each transporter with a replacement of Asp204. A closer examination of K0.5Glcrevealed two classes of mutations. First, Glu in place of Asp204 reduced the apparent affinity for Glc in either Nac or Hc about 4-fold. The second class encompasses transporters with a neutral side chain at position 204 (Asp204 → Asn or Cys), which showed increased apparent affinities for Glc. Although the K0.5Glc of D204C in Hcwas only slightly decreased (3 mm), a ∼5-fold reduction of K0.5Glc was observed in Nac (0.07 mm). D204N exhibited a more dramatic increase of the apparent affinity for Glc with a 10- and 15-fold reduction of K0.5Glc in Hc (0.6 mm) and in Nac (0.02 mm), respectively. Over a range from −150 to −30 mV, the K0.5Glc determined in Nacwas essentially voltage-insensitive for all transporters. From −150 to −50 mV, WT exhibited an approximate 4-fold increased K0.5Glc in Hc, but no voltage dependence of the K0.5Glcwas observed for the other transporters. The ImaxGlc values for each transporter increased (more negative) with hyperpolarizing potentials and were comparable to the currents generated by 100 mmd-glucose (see Fig. 2). The cation had no impact on the magnitude of ImaxGlc for WT (Table I). WT and D204E exhibited a sigmoidal ImaxGlc -V relation in Nac and thus, the similar ImaxGlc values of these two transporters shown at −110 mV (Table I) were not significantly changed by more hyperpolarizing potentials. With the exception of WT, no saturation of the ImaxGlc -V relationship was observed for each transporter at hyperpolarizing potentials in Hc. To elucidate whether the substitution of Asp204 in hSGLT1 changed the sugar specificity of the transporter, oocytes were held at −50 mV and currents generated by 10 mm sugar were monitored in the presence of Nac or Hc. Under either test condition the selectivity pattern for each transporter was in the order Glc ≥ αMDG ≥ d-galactose > 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (data not shown). Consistent with the effect of the cation on the apparent Glc affinity for WT and D204E, each sugar induced ∼10-fold lower currents in the presence of Hc than in Nac. The effect on the apparent Glc affinity of D204E was reflected by ∼4-fold lower sugar-induced currents in Nac and Hc than with WT. In Hc, D204C and D204N exhibited sugar-induced currents similar to WT, but the currents generated by each sugar in Nac were ∼50-fold lower than the sugar-evoked currents observed for WT. We determined the apparent half-maximal cation concentration for Na+- and H+-activated glucose transport ( K0.5cation). Table Isummarizes K0.5cation for all transporters at V m = −110 mV. For WT the K0.5H+ (7 μm, pH 5.2) was about three orders of magnitude smaller than the K0.5Na+ (6 mm). Again, the nature of the substitution of Asp204 grouped transporters with a neutral amino acid side chain (Asp204 → Asn or Cys) in one group. These transporters exhibited a 10-fold reduced K0.5Na+, but the K0.5H+ was not significantly altered. On the other hand, Glu in place of Asp204 reduced K0.5Na+ by about 3-fold (2 mm). However, this conservative substitution reduced K0.5H+ of this transporter by a factor of >20, shifting the pH of the apparent half-maximum concentration for H+-activated glucose transport from pH 5.2 to ∼6.5. In general, for each transporter K0.5Na+ was slightly voltage-dependent and increased about 4-fold from −150 to −50 mV, while K0.5H+over the same voltage range increased by a factor of about 2. The Hill coefficient (n) of WT for cation-activated glucose transport was larger than unity for both Na+(n Na+ > 1.5) and H+(n H+ > 1.2) and was not affected by voltage (−50 to −150 mV).n Na+ of D204E was >1.3 but for H+/sugar cotransportn H+ was <1. Independent on the cation, D204C and D204N exhibited an Na+ orn H+ of < 1. Whereas at −110 mV ImaxNa+ for each transporter was essentially indistinguishable from ImaxGlc in Na+, this similarity in Hc was only observed for WT and D204E (note that the ImaxNa+ -Vrelation of D204C and D204N and the ImaxH+ -Vrelation of D204E did not saturate at hyperpolarizing potentials). On the other hand, at V m = −110 mV, a transporter with a neutral amino acid side chain at position 204 exhibited a ∼3-fold larger ImaxH+(D204C, −1630 nA; D204N, −2450 nA) than ImaxGlc in Hc (D204C, −675 nA; D204N, −769 nA) and ImaxH+ increased supralinearly with more negative potentials. To determine the net Na+ and H+ leaks through each transporter, [Na+] or [H+] was varied between 0.1 and 100 mm Na+ or between 0.03 and 32 μm H+ and phlorizin-sensitive currents and choline currents at pH 8.0 were subtracted from the total currents. The kinetics of the cation leak were calculated atV m = −110 mV by fitting the data to Eq. 2. In general, for each transporter K0.5Na+ for glucose cotransport and leak were essentially identical, but the K0.5H+ value for the leak was ∼10-fold smaller than K0.5H+. WT exhibited a leak ImaxNa+ of −97 ± 4 nA and replacement of Asp204 with Asn (54 ± 5 nA), Cys (18 ± 2 nA), or Glu (47 ± 3 nA) reduced the leak ImaxNa+ ∼2- to 5-fold. The leak ImaxH+ for WT (430 ± 4 nA) was 2.5 to 3 times larger than for D204C (−172 ± 16 nA) and D204N (−142 ± 7 nA), but there was apparently no H+ leak through D204E. Although the Hill coefficient (n) for the Na+ or the H+ leak pathways was >1.2 only for WT, the value of n for each modified transporter was ≤1. Fig.3 A shows representative current records of oocytes injected with WT or D204E cRNA in the presence of Nac or Hc after stepping the membrane potential from the holding potential (−50 mV) to the test potential (V m = −150 to +50 mV in 20-mV decrements). After the initial fast membrane capacitive transients (τ< 1 ms) each transporter exhibited currents that relaxed to a steady-state with a single time constant (see Fig. 4). These relaxations were abolished after addition of saturating [sugar] and/or [phlorizin] (data not shown). The removal of a negative amino acid side chain at position 204 caused a dramatic reduction of the current transients (compare Q max in TableI).Figure 4Voltage dependence of relaxation time constant. Time constants (τON and τOFF ) were determined from the charge transfer in Nac (open symbols) and Hc (solid symbols) shown in Fig. 3 A. τON of WT (rectangle) and D204E (triangle) was plotted as a function of membrane potential (V m). Smooth lines represent a Gaussian fit to τON . τOFF for both transporters was voltage-independent and shown as the average over the test range (+50 to −150 mV) for WT (square with black diamond, in Nac; square with white diamond, in Hc) and D204E (triangle with black diamond, in Nac; triangle with white diamond, in Hc).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The charge movement was obtained by integration of the transporter-mediated relaxation. At each V m, a plot of the charge (Q) versus the membrane voltage (V m) yielded a sigmoidal charge-voltage (Q-V) curve (Fig. 3 B). Data were fitted to Eq. 3 to obtain the Boltzmann parametersQ max (maximal charge),V 0.5 (V m at which 50% of the charge has moved in the membrane electric field), and z(the apparent valence of the charge). Q max of WT and D204E were comparable in Nac and Hc (∼23 nanocoulombs (nC)), and Q max of D204C and D204N were reduced about 5-fold (Table I). The substitution of Nac by Hc shifted V 0.5 of WT from −36 ± 1 mV to −74 ± 4 mV. Glu in place of Asp204 exhibited a V 0.5 in Nac of −50 ± 2 mV. However, theV 0.5 of this transporter in Hc was shifted to more positive potentials (V 0.5∼+40 ± 5 mV). In Fig. 3 B the effect of varying [cation] on the charge-voltage (Q-V) relationship is shown for WT and D204E. At [Na+] or [H+] below 25 mmor 3.2 μm, respectively, the Q-Vcurve for WT didn't become saturated at negative potentials. D204E exhibited a sigmoidal Q-V curve over the entire [Na+] range tested. At [H+] higher than 3.2 μm, the Q-V relationship of the latter transporter did not become saturated at +50 mV. Fig. 3 C summarizes V 0.5 as a function of [cation]. Reducing [Na+] from 100 to 25 mmshifted V 0.5 of WT from −36 ± 1 mV to −91 ± 2 mV. Plotting V 0.5 as a function of log[Na+] revealed a linear relation with a slope of 98 ± 3 mV per 10-fold change in [Na+] (ΔV0.510).V 0.5 for D204E was apparently not dependent on [Na+] (ΔV0.510 of 8.7 ± 0.2 mV). In H+ WT (ΔV0.510 = 92 ± 7 mV), and D204E (ΔV0.510 = 87 ± 11 mV) exhibited a similar slope of ΔV0.510. However, V 0.5 of D204E was shifted by about 110 mV toward positive potentials. Over the concentration range shown in Fig. 3 C, WT and D204E exhibited a z value of ∼1. Substraction of capacitive and steady-state currents from the total currents (see Fig. 3 A) revealed a monoexponential time constant (τ) of the pre-steady-state relaxation currents. τ was voltage-dependent in theON response but not dependent on voltage in theOFF response (Fig. 4). In Nac the shapes of the τON -V curves for the transporters tested were bell-shaped and described a Gaussian fit. The maximum (τmax) for WT and D204E was ∼20 ms and ∼27 ms at ∼−100 mV. In contrast, in Hc the τ-V curve of WT didn't reach τmax over the appliedV m (+50 mV to −150 mV) but the bell-shaped τ-V relation of D204E was dramatically shifted to the right (τmax of ∼32 ms at ∼−22 mV). As reported above, D204C and D204N exhibited very small pre-steady-state currents that were at the border of resolution and precluded us from determining reliable τmax values over the entire voltage range. The stoichiometry of ion/sugar cotransport was determined by simultaneously measuring the unidirectional flux ofd-[14C]glucose into oocytes expressing WT or D204N and monitoring the sugar-evoked inward current. Integration of the inward current with time revealed the net positive charges that entered the oocyte. A plot of the net charge against glucose uptake by oocytes expressing WT revealed a linear relation in both Nacand Hc with a slope of ∼2 inward charges per glucose molecule transported (2.1 ± 0.1 in Nac; 2 ± 0.3 in Hc) (Fig. 5). In the presence of Nac the slope of the inward charge/glucose relation of D204N was 2.1 ± 0.4. Replacing Nac with Hc changed the slope for D204N to 39 ± 3. By reducing the finald-[14C]glucose concentration in Hcfrom 5 to 0.1 mm, the slope for D204N was 144 ± 7 (Fig. 5, inset), but no significant effect on the H+/glucose stoichiometry was observed for WT (data not shown). No Nac- or Hc-dependent glucose uptake or sugar-evoked current was observed in control (H2O-injected) oocytes. We next studied the effect of intracellular acidification on glucose-induced H+ currents. Acidification of the intracellular compartment was produced by rapid replacement of external choline chloride with potassium acetate (21Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows representative I-Vcurves on the effect of internal acidification of oocytes expressing D204N or WT in the presence of 31.6 μm H+ (pH 4.5). In the absence of acetate, the glucose-induced currents for D204N increased with hyperpolarization and reversed at +23 mV (Fig.6 A). Internal acidification increased the magnitude of outward currents with depolarization (+800 nA at +50 mV) but had only minor effects on currents at potentials more negative than −70 mV. No outward currents were observed after internal acidification of oocytes expressing WT under either condition (Fig. 6 B), despite the fact that the amount of WT in the plasma membrane was about four times that of D204N (Q max for WT = 14 nC, for D204N = 4 nC). Addition of 0.2 mm phlorizin reversibly blocked the inward and outward glucose-induced currents for D204N completely (Fig. 6 C). The present study confirms and extends our previous reports on the kinetics of SGLT1 (4Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

The kinetics of H+ and Na+ sugar cotransport are quite similar, even though the apparent affinity of hSGLT1 for H+ is ∼1000-fold greater than for Na+, and the apparent affinity for sugar is about 10-fold lower in Hc than in Nac (see Table I). In fact, the maximum rates of cotransport, the cation-to-sugar stoichiometry (2:1), the Hill coefficients (>1), turnover numbers (∼50 s−1), and voltage dependence of transport are virtually identical for Na+ and H+ cotransport when measured in the same oocyte. Furthermore, the pre-steady-state kinetic parameters Q max, V 0.5, and τmax are comparable in Nac and Hc.

Excess vascular oxidative stress has been associated with impaired NO release, and antioxidant status has been shown to alter endothelium-derived NO bioactivity. Although physiological levels of a-tocopherol are known to inhibit platelet function, the effect of a-tocopherol on platelet NO release is unknown. Loading platelets with physiologic levels of a-tocopherol increased platelet NO production approximately 1.5-fold (Pa-tocopherol, platelet NO release increased 50% (Pa-Tocopherol-loaded platelets also produced 74% less superoxide as compared with control (Pa-tocopherol inhibited PKC-dependent eNOS phosphorylation as determined by immunoprecipitation. Lastly, platelets isolated from NOS3-deficient mice released 80% less superoxide as compared with control animals (P=0.011), and incubation of NOS III-deficient platelets with 500 mM a-tocopherol only caused a modest additional decrease in platelet superoxide release (NS). Thus, a-tocopherol appears to enhance platelet NO release both in vitro and in vivo through antioxidant- and PKC-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2157476115,"Using immobilized GST-Raf-1 as bait, we have isolated the intermediate filament protein vimentin as a Raf-1-associated protein. Vimentin coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with Raf-1 in fibroblasts. Vimentin was not a Raf-1 substrate, but was phosphorylated by Raf-1-associated vimentin kinases. We provide evidence for at least two Raf-1-associated vimentin kinases and identified one as casein kinase 2. They are regulated by Raf-1, since the activation status of Raf-1 correlated with the phosphorylation of vimentin. Vimentin phosphorylation by Raf-1 preparations interfered with its polymerization in vitro. A subset of tryptic vimentin phosphopeptides induced by Raf-1 in vitro matched the vimentin phosphopeptides isolated from v-raf-transfected cells labeled with orthophosphoric acid, indicating that Raf-1 also induces vimentin phosphorylation in intact cells. In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the selective activation of an estrogen-regulated Raf-1 mutant induced a rearrangement and depolymerization of the reticular vimentin scaffold similar to the changes elicited by serum treatment. The rearrangement of the vimentin network occurred independently of the MEK/ERK pathway. These data identify a new branch point in Raf-1 signaling, which links Raf-1 to changes in the cytoskeletal architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2161904066,"The uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle. UCP-3 mRNA is expressed in cultured muscle cells (C2C12 or L6E9) only when differentiated, at which stage UCP-3 is highly induced by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Here we report that human UCP-3 promoter activity is dependent on MyoD and inducible by all trans-RA. The action of all trans-RA is increased by co-transfection with RA receptor (RAR). We have characterized the RA response element that controls the induction by RA in the 5' noncoding region of the UCP-3 gene. Deletion and point-mutation analysis of the hUCP-3 promoter led us to identify a direct-repeat element with one base-pair spacing (DR1) at position -71/-59 responsible for the induction by RA of the activity of the promoter. This DR1 element bound a nuclear protein complex from muscle cells that contain RAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In the absence of this element, the promoter became unresponsive to RA, but it was still dependent on MyoD. In conclusion, it has been established that UCP-3 gene promoter activity is dependent on MyoD, and the first regulatory pathway for UCP-3 gene promoter regulation has been recognized by identifying RA as a transcriptional activator of the gene."

RanBP16 and its close human homologue, RanBP17, are distant members of the importin β family.

Tf-beta-galactosidase plasmid conjugate thus constructed was specifically transfected to human erythroleukemia cells (K562) via Tf-R without the aid of any lysosomotropic agents. The transfection efficiency of the conjugate was superior to those of lipofection (1% staining) and retroviral vector (5%) and slightly lower than that of adenovirus (70%). The high level of expression with our conjugate was confirmed using other tumor cells (M7609, TMK-1) whereas in normal diploid cells (HEL), which express low levels of Tf-R, expression was negligible. When GFP gene conjugates were systemically administered through the tail vein to nude mice subcutaneously inoculated with tumor, expression of GFP mRNA was found almost exclusively in tumors and to a much lesser extent in muscles, whereas GFP revealed by fluorescence microscopy was detected only in the former. To exploit a therapeutic applicability of this method, suicide gene therapy using Tf-HSV-TK gene conjugate for massively metastasized k562 tumors in severe combined immune-deficient mice was conducted, and a marked prolongation of survival and significant reduction of tumor burden were confirmed. Thus, this method could also be used for gene therapy to disseminated tumors."

The current study has investigated the binding and uptake of AGEs by retinal microvascular endothelium in an attempt to understand the nature of AGE-interaction with receptors on the cell surface. There has been special emphasis placed on the R1, R2, and R3 components of AGE-receptor complex (AGE-RC) and their localization to caveolin-rich membrane domains. Retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) were exposed to either AGE-modified BSA (AGE-BSA) or native BSA conjugated to colloidal gold (gAGE, gBSA) for various time periods, fixed, and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Localization of AGE-RC components in caveolae was investigated using confocal microscopy and ultrastructural immunogold labeling. Caveolae were extracted from RMECs using differential Triton X-100 solubility, and Western analysis was conducted to test for caveolae enrichment and the presence of AGE-RC complex components. Ligand blots determined 125I-AGE-BSA binding to caveolae-enriched extracts. Colloidal gold conjugates of AGE-BSA bound to caveolae and were internalized to be trafficked to lysosomal-like compartments. AGE-receptor complex components were significantly enriched within caveolae. The data suggest that AGEs interact with their receptors within caveolae. It is significant that the AGE-R complex localizes to these organelles, because this may have implications for AGE binding, internalization, signal transduction, and the modulation of AGE-receptor-mediated vascular cell dysfunction."

LPH binds LTX strongly under all conditions tested and, as a neuron-specific G protein-coupled receptor, is likely to mediate intracellular signaling (13Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A.

One of the major effects of LTX binding to its receptors is the induction of cation-permeable channels, or pores, in the cell membrane (2Grasso A. Alema S. Rufini S. Senni M.I. Nature. 1980; 283: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Liu J. Misler S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6113-6125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nicholls D.G. Rugolo M. Scott I.G.

The pores play a profound role in the action of the toxin; (i) influx of Ca2+ or other cations through such pores can cause neurotransmitter release (12Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C.

However, the mechanism by which LTX induces the pores and the role of the receptors in this action remain largely unknown. The receptors could (i) mediate intracellular signaling leading to the opening of endogenous channels, (ii) participate in the pore structure or (iii) simply tether LTX to the cell surface, thus allowing its insertion into the membrane to form pores. In addition, other (non-receptor) proteins of the exocytotic apparatus could participate in pore induction upon direct stimulation by the toxin. On the other hand, LTX preparations can permeabilize artificial lipid bilayers (21Finkelstein A. Rubin L.L. Tzeng M.C. Science. 1976; 193: 1009-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Mironov S.L. Sokolov Yu V. Chanturiya A.N. Lishko V.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1992; 1112: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and form pore-like tetrameric structures in liposomes (24Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that, under some conditions, the toxin is able to make pores even in the absence of any receptors. It is unclear, however, whether LTX acts in the same way upon binding to LPH or NRX and whether these receptors are physically involved in the structure of the LTX pore. The objective of this work was to analyze the roles that LPH and NRX play in pore formation by LTX. We found that, in contrast to the crude venom, highly purified LTX in physiological concentrations is very inefficient in forming pores in lipid bilayers or receptor-less cells. When expressed in non-secretory cells, the receptors, including signaling-deficient mutants, tether LTX to the plasma membrane with subsequent formation of large pores permeable to ions and small molecules. These pores remain open in the membrane even after LTX dissociation from the receptor(s) and can be blocked by anti-LTX antibody (Ab). Our findings suggest that LTX is the sole component of the pores but only inserts efficiently into the plasma membrane if recruited by any of its receptors. Bilayer lipids were purchased from Avanti; other reagents were from Sigma. LTX was purified from the venom ofLatrodectus lugubris as described (25Ashton A.C. Rahman M.A. Volynski K.E. Manser C. Orlova E.V. Matsushita H. Davletov B.A. van Heel M. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized venom was dissolved in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 20 mm EDTA, applied on to a high performance gel filtration column KW-803 (Waters) and eluted with buffer A. Fractions containing LTX were subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a Protein-Pak Q AP-1 column (Waters) eluted with a gradient of NaCl. The LTX fraction (corresponding to conventional toxin preparations (34Ushkarev I.A. Grishin E.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1986; 12: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar)) was further purified by preparative native electrophoresis using a 3.5-cm-long 6% polyacrylamide gel cast in a model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). The electrophoresis buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3. Electrophoresis was carried out overnight at 200 V, with continuous elution of proteins (monitored at 280 nm). LTX was pooled and concentrated to 2–7 μm using a Centriprep 30 unit (Amicon). Proteins obtained after each stage of purification were carefully tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting and assayed for toxicity, receptor binding, and transmitter release (25Ashton A.C. Rahman M.A. Volynski K.E. Manser C. Orlova E.V. Matsushita H. Davletov B.A. van Heel M. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Planar bilayers were formed from pure lipids suspended at a total concentration of 30 mg/ml in n-decane (Aldrich). Membranes containing POPE, equimolar POPE/POPS, or an equimolar mixture of POPE, POPS, POPC, and cholesterol were cast across a 0.3-mm-diameter hole in a polystyrene partition separating two solution-filled chambers as described elsewhere (48Ashley R.H. Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 97-117PubMed Google Scholar, 49Williams A.J. Ashley R.H. Ion Channels, a Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 43-67Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the bilayers were exposed to symmetric 100 mm KCl buffered with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The membranes were voltage-clamped using a Biologic RK-300 patch clamp amplifier (Intracel, UK), and transmembrane currents were low pass-filtered at 1–10 kHz (−3-db point, 8-pole Bessel-type response) and recorded. Experiments were only carried out with membranes that thinned spontaneously to give a capacitance of at least 250 picofarads and a conductance of <10 picosiemens; junction potentials were routinely nulled to within ± 1 mV. The cis side of the bilayer (the side to which LTX was added) was voltage-clamped relative to thetrans side, which was grounded, and we followed the standard electrophysiological current convention (i.e. positive currents flowing cis to trans are shown as positive, up-going currents). The contents of the chambers were changed by perfusion (≥10 volumes) as required. Data were post-filtered and digitally sampled at 5 times the filter corner frequency for analysis using pClamp 6 (Axon) and other programs. Relative ion permeabilities were calculated from reversal potentials measured under bi-ionic conditions using appropriate forms of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz and Fatt-Ginsborg equations. Rat latrophilin cDNA in pBlueScript (13Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) was cleaved with HindIII andEcoRI restrictases and subcloned into the same sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). To produce LPH-FS lacking the 5′-untranslated region, the fragment between the HindIII andBamHI sites of the initial construct was replaced with a shorter fragment, which was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified between primers CGTGCCCGCCCCAAGCTTTCGCCA (N77) and GGGTCCGCAGGTCATATTTG. Latrophilin deletion mutants LPH-7TM and LPH-5TM were prepared by PCR between N77 and oligonucleotides GCACTTGCTGTACTTCTAGAGCACCTTTTT or ATGAGCTTCGGATCATCTAGAGCAGGGTC, respectively, using latrophilin cDNA as a template. These fragments were then digested with HindIII and XbaI and ligated into the respective sites of pcDNA3.1. For LPH-1TM, LPH-FS was cleaved with HpaI and NotI, and the deleted piece was replaced with a fragment obtained by PCR between primers GGAGAATGCCACAGTGAAGCTGGCAGGTGAG and AGGAAGCGGCCGCTGCACAGTTACTTGTGGATG (cut with the same enzymes). To make the LPH-NRX hybrid, an intermediate construct was prepared by replacing theXhoI/XbaI segment of the LPH-FS with a PCR-amplified fragment between primers AAGGGAACTCGAGGAATTGCCTCG and GGCCTCTAGAGAAGCAGAAGGTGG. Another fragment, obtained by PCR (between CTTCTCTATGCTAGCTACAAGTACAG and TAAAAACAGTCTAGACTTCCTGATTGCA) on the NRX template and cut with NheI and XbaI, was then introduced into the XbaI site of the intermediate construct. The full-size neurexin construct was prepared by directly subcloning aKpnI-BglII fragment of the bovine cDNA for neurexin Iα into pcDNA3.1. All mutations introduced were verified by sequencing. DNA for transfection of mammalian cells was prepared using Qiagen kits. Transfection of COS-7 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbit polyclonal Ab recognizing the N-terminal domain of LPH was obtained by injecting rabbits with bovine brain LPH purified by LTX affinity chromatography and SDS-electrophoresis (9Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The C terminus-specific Ab was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein consisting of glutathioneS-transferase and the LPH C terminus (cDNA fragment 3976–4856). LPH fusion proteins were constructed to affinity purify these Abs; the N-terminal domain (nucleotides 630–2957) was subcloned into the pGEX-4X vector in-frame with glutathioneS-transferase, whereas the C-terminal domain (nucleotides 3976–4856) was cloned into the pQE40 vector (Qiagen) in-frame with dihidrofolate reductase. The fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli, purified by glutathione or Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and spot-blotted onto pieces of Immobilon membrane (Millipore). These were used to purify the LPH-specific Ab from respective sera as described (50Rucklidge G.J. Milne G. Chaudhry S.M. Robins S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Anti-NRX Ab was elicited in rabbits injected with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated with the NRX C-terminal peptide (CSANKNKKNKDKEYYV) and affinity-purified using this peptide immobilized on thiol-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were grown on multi-well chamber slides (Nunc) and transfected as described above. One day after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and washed again. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by a 20-min incubation with 3% (w/v) goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some experiments, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100. The specimens were then incubated for 1 h with the respective primary Ab, washed, incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), washed, mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. In some experiments, a fluorescent derivative of LTX was used, which was obtained using the FluoroLink mAb labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In immunocytochemical experiments, the distribution pattern of the fluorescently labeled LTX was identical to that of immunostained toxin. For immunoblotting, COS-7 cells were detached from plates in ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were then dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, and 8 m urea (105 cells/50 μl of buffer) for 30 min at 37 °C and separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels not containing urea. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore) and visualized using primary Ab, goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG, and chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) followed by exposure onto x-ray film. Specimens were imaged with a LSM 510 system (Zeiss) mounted on an upright microscope (Axioplan-2, Zeiss) using dual excitation at 488 and 633 nm. Light emitted by doubly stained preparations was analyzed using a combination of an FITC-type narrow band-pass filter block (505–530 nm) and a long-pass filter block (≥650 nm). Images were collected using oil immersion objective (Plan-Neofluar, 40×/1.3, Zeiss) for fixed samples or a water immersion objective (Achroplan, 40× W/0.8, Zeiss) for submerged unfixed samples. To quantify the degree of co-localization, scatter diagrams for doubly stained samples were produced using the LSM 510 software (Zeiss). In such diagrams, the brightness of each pixel in the red channel (Cy5-LTX) is interpreted as X coordinate, and that in the green channel (immunostained NRX) is interpreted as Y coordinate; coordinates of pixels that have similar intensity in both channels (co-localization) appear near the diagonal running from bottom left to top right of the graph. LTX was iodinated as described earlier (34Ushkarev I.A. Grishin E.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1986; 12: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar). When binding experiments were performed on culture plates, the cells were incubated with 1 nm iodinated LTX in buffer A (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 2 mm CaCl2, then washed with this buffer. Bound toxin was eluted from plates with 1% Triton X-100. Alternatively, cells were scraped off the plates into PBS, counted, then incubated with increasing concentrations of [125I]LTX and filtered through GF/F glass fiber filters (Whatman). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled toxin. The radioactivity of the Triton eluate from plates and of the filters was measured in a γ-spectrometer. For influx experiments, cells were plated at 50% confluence on 6-well tissue culture plates, transfected with control or receptor plasmids, and 24 h later, used in measurements of LTX-stimulated influx of45Ca2+, [3H]NE, or FITC. For 45Ca2+ influx, the cells were washed twice with buffer A and incubated at room temperature for 5 min in the same buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2–4 μCi/ml 45Ca2+. One to five min after the addition of 1–2 nm LTX, the cells were quickly washed twice with buffer A. Alternatively, the toxin pores were pre-formed in cells before the addition of 45Ca2+. For this purpose, the cells were incubated with 1 nm LTX, washed with 0.2 mm EGTA, and kept in buffer A without Ca2+ for a further 10–30 min at room temperature (anti-LTX serum or purified IgG fraction was included in some experiments at this stage); influx was initiated by the addition of Ca2+/45Ca2+. In all cases, after the final wash, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 10 mmEDTA and 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was mixed with 10 ml of UltimaGold scintillation mixture (Packard), and its radioactivity was determined in a β-spectrometer. [3H]NE influx was measured in receptor- or vector-transfected cells either by simultaneously adding LTX and 0.5–2.5 μCi of [3H]NE or by pre-forming LTX pores as above, with subsequent addition of the label. Influx was determined after 5 min by washing and lysing the cells. To measure FITC influx, the cells were briefly washed with buffer A (plus/minus 2 mm Ca2+) before the addition of 5 μm FITC with or without 4 nm LTX. After a 10-min incubation, the cells were extensively washed with buffer A and immediately examined by confocal microscopy using a water immersion objective. Recently, we introduced a new improved LTX purification procedure (25Ashton A.C. Rahman M.A. Volynski K.E. Manser C. Orlova E.V. Matsushita H. Davletov B.A. van Heel M. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that uses an additional step (preparative native electrophoresis) to remove several proteins usually contaminating conventional LTX preparations (26Frontali N. Ceccarelli B. Gorio A. Mauro A. Siekevitz P. Tzeng M.C. Hurlbut W.P. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 462-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The resulting highly purified LTX is fully active in biochemical and physiological tests (25Ashton A.C. Rahman M.A. Volynski K.E. Manser C. Orlova E.V. Matsushita H. Davletov B.A. van Heel M. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we compared the ability of this pure LTX and the crude spider venom to form channels in artificial planar lipid bilayers (21Finkelstein A. Rubin L.L. Tzeng M.C. Science. 1976; 193: 1009-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) containing different lipids and in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The addition of small amounts of the crude venom (containing as little as 10 pm pure LTX) always gave rise to channel activity within 2 min (Fig. 1 A). Larger doses of the venom (equivalent to 10 nm LTX) typically gave rise to macroscopic conductances of >500 nanosiemens. The channels were permeable to both Ca2+ and K+ and had conductances ranging from 20 to 200 picosiemens, suggesting that the venom contains several different channel-forming components. Relative Ca2+/K+ selectivities (measured in bi-ionic conditions in palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) bilayers) ranged from 0.45 ± 0.2 (mean ± S.D.,n = 6) for 60-picosiemens channels to 1.6 ± 0.7 (mean ± S.D., n = 6) for 150–200-picosiemens channels. Partially purified toxin (corresponding to conventional LTX preparations) was much less active than the crude venom, typically producing only 1–2 channels despite prolonged exposure (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, 10 nm pure LTX (i.e. 1000-fold more concentrated than in the venom) did not give rise to any channel activity after periods of 20–60 min when added to more than 20 bilayers containing POPE and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine (POPS), POPE alone, or a POPE/POPS/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC)/cholesterol mixture, irrespective of the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. The result was the same if membranes were broken and reformed in the continued presence of LTX. To illustrate these findings, Fig. 1 C shows an experiment using POPE/POPS/POPC/cholesterol bilayer. 10 nm LTX had no effect over a prolonged period (note a different time scale), but there was near-immediate channel activity on stirring in the venom equivalent to 10 pm LTX (confirming that the bilayer remained intact and fusion-competent). These findings suggest that many pore-forming constituents of the venom are gradually removed from LTX by the purification procedure, resulting in a pure toxin that is unable to form pores in pure lipid membranes at physiological concentrations. In one experiment, we added a bolus of 2 μm LTX to produce a final concentration of more than 100 nm (Fig. 1 D). This did result in immediate channel activity, suggesting that pure LTX can induce membrane pores provided it is present at extremely high concentrations. Unfortunately, the need for these very large amounts of pure toxin precluded further, more detailed experiments on planar bilayers. On the other hand, nanomolar LTX is known to induce pores readily in the membranes of neurons and endocrine cells or even non-secretory cells expressing the toxin receptors (e.g. see Refs. 17Hurlbut W.P.

To investigate this phenomenon, we applied LTX to COS-7 cells in the presence of extracellular 45Ca2+. Consistent with its poor ability to permeabilize pure lipid bilayers, 2 nm LTX was unable to induce influx of Ca2+ into vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1 E). Only when the toxin concentration was elevated to more than 100 nm, did some Ca2+ influx occur in control cells (Fig. 1 E). However, 2 nm LTX from the same toxin batch induced a large accumulation of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 E) by cells that had been transfected with an LPH expression construct (13Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol.

These results indicated that the receptor was required for the induction of LTX pores by a mechanism to be determined. To study the possibility that LPH-mediated signal transduction is involved in the LTX pore formation, we produced a series of LPH deletion mutants (Fig. 2 A). Heptahelical receptors require their cytoplasmic loops and the cytoplasmic tail in order to interact functionally with G proteins (30Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As a result, functional coupling to G proteins was abolished 2Y. A. Ushkaryov, unpublished data. in the mutants LPH-N5TM, LPH-N3TM and LPH-N1TM, which contain five, three, and one transmembrane domain (TM), respectively. To independently test whether the receptor itself makes part of the pore, a structurally different LTX receptor, NRX Iα, was also expressed (Fig. 2 A). In addition, a LPH-NRX hybrid was obtained by fusing the cytoplasmic domain of NRX to the C terminus of LPH-N1TM. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the recombinant LPH mutants had molecular masses consistent with the addition of approximately 15 kDa due to glycosylation (Fig. 2 B). All these constructs could be purified from solubilized cells by LTX affinity chromatography (not shown), indicating that expression in non-neuronal cells and the mutagenesis did not abolish the affinities of the receptors for LTX. Immunostaining of non-permeabilized cells transfected with the LPH mutants revealed that most of these prote"

Mutations in the WRN gene, encoding a DNA helicase, underlie the segmental progeroid Werner syndrome (WS). WS is also associated with increased genomic instability and elevated cancer risk. The p53 and WRN proteins can engage in direct protein-protein interactions. We report that excess WRN elicits increased cellular p53 levels and potentiates p53-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, cells derived from WS patients exhibit an attenuated and delayed induction of p53 by UV or by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. These results suggest that WRN may participate in the activation of p53 in response to certain types of DNA damage. Furthermore, the failure to induce p53 effectively may contribute to enhanced genomic instability and elevated cancer risk in WS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2015476100,"Local delivery of angiogenic growth factors for the treatment of myocardial ischemia has been well documented in various animal models, and clinical trials are now in progress. Our strategy was radically different, based on selective protection of some of the growth factors naturally present within the injured tissue. This protection was obtained by applying a chemically defined substitute for Dextran called RGTA11 (for ReGeneraTing Agent). RGTA is a family of agents, which has properties mimicking those of heparan sulfates toward heparin-binding growth factors (HBGF) and which stimulate tissue repair and protection. Indeed, we have previously shown that RGTA prevents most of the damage resulting from acute skeletal muscle ischemia [FASEB J. (1999) 13, 761-766]. We now show that the same agent can be used for the treatment of myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction was induced in pigs by ligation of the left circumflex artery. One hour later, a single injection of 10 mg of RGTA11 was made in the center of the infarcted area. Three weeks later we observed 1) recovery of 84% of the initial left ventricular ejection fraction (only 55% in saline-treated controls), 2) an almost 50% reduction in the infarct size, 3) a reduction in fibrotic tissue formation, 4) significant preservation of myocytes, and 5) an increase in the number of blood vessels. The treatment of ischemic heart disease with RGTA would have clear advantages over other therapies such as growth factor, gene, or cell transplants, based on a stable, simple, and easy-to-develop chemical product."
https://openalex.org/W1984268564,"Cell culture studies have established SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) as an important factor in growth factor and cytokine-activated signaling pathways. However, the significance of SHP2 in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is not known since early embryonic lethality occurs in shp2 null mice. To bypass this embryonic lethality, transgenic animals containing a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP2 (SHP2-CS) under the control of a nestin intron II/thymidine kinase minimal promoter were generated. In the developing CNS of these animals, although high-level transgene expression was detected in the neuroepithelium, there was no obvious abnormality in progenitor cell proliferation or migration. In the adult brain, high-level transgene expression was detected in the subventricular zone, rostral migratory stream, dentate gyrus of hippocampus, and cerebellum. Because SHP2 function is likely important in cell survival pathways, we used a focal cerebral ischemia model to examined whether SHP2 is important during CNS injury. Ischemia-induced damage and neuronal death was found to be significantly greater in nestin-SHP2-CS mice than in wild-type littermates. These findings indicate that SHP2 is a required factor in signaling pathway(s) important for neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W2152741583,"There is considerable interest in determining the conditions leading to enhanced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression and nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis. Using in vivo footprinting, we demonstrate that heat shock of murine macrophages concurrent with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment stimulated changes in guanine methylation sensitivity at ?898/9, at a putative partial heat shock element (HSE) and at -893/4, a site bordering an E-box, within the iNOS gene enhancer, suggesting inducible occupation by transcription factors at these regions. LPS treatment accompanied by heat shock provoked increased iNOS gene transcription, increased levels of iNOS protein, and increased production of NO compared with LPS treatment alone. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed low constitutive levels of specific binding to an E-box and a partial HSE within the iNOS enhancer. Binding to the E-box was increased by LPS treatment or by heat shock, achieving a greater increase by a combination of both treatments. The proteins occupying this site were identified as belonging to the USF family of transcription factors. Heat shock or LPS increased binding to the HSE, and the factor responsible for this interaction was identified as heeat shock factor-1 (HSF-1). Mutations at the HSE revealed the importance of HSF-1 in the induction of iNOS by LPS. Thus, our data reveal two novel regulatory sites in the murine iNOS gene, one of which is implicated in enhancing iNOS expression via LPS stimulation, and provide the first evidence that heat shock enhances transcription of the iNOS gene. These results could have implications in the host response mechanism to fever-associated gram-negative infection."
https://openalex.org/W2065348240,"Retroviral integrases catalyze four endonuclease reactions (processing, joining, disintegration, and nonspecific alcoholysis) that differ in specificity for the attacking nucleophile and target DNA sites. To assess how the two substrates of this enzyme affect each other, we performed quantitative analyses, in three retroviral systems, of the two reactions that use a variety of nucleophiles. The integrase proteins of human immuno- deficiency virus type 1, visna virus, and Rous sarcoma virus exhibited distinct preferences for water or other nucleophiles during site-specific processing of viral DNA and during nonspecific alcoholysis of nonviral DNA. Although exogenous alcohols competed with water as the nucleophile for processing, the alcohols stimulated nicking of nonviral DNA. Moreover, different nucleophiles were preferred when the various integrases acted on different DNA targets. In contrast, the nicking patterns were independent of whether integrase was catalyzing hydrolysis or alcoholysis and were not influenced by the particular exogenous alcohol. Thus, although the target DNA influenced the choice of nucleophile, the nucleophile did not affect the choice of target sites. These results indicate that interaction with target DNA is the critical step before catalysis and suggest that integrase does not reach an active conformation until target DNA has bound to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2164994831,"The myogenic determination factors (MDFs) are transcriptional activators that target E boxes in many muscle-specific promoters, including those of the genes coding for the subunits of the acetylcholine receptor. It is not known, however, if in vivo a given E box in a transcriptionally active gene is occupied, either uniquely by one MDF or randomly by all MDFs. We have analyzed expression of MDF and acetylcholine receptor subunits in cultured mouse muscle cells and, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, have determined which individual MDFs reside at promoters of several receptor subunit genes. We find that before fusion, C2C12 cells express myf-5, MyoD, and myogenin, all of which take up residence at promoters of all subunits except e. At this stage, herculin is present in limited amounts and is detected mainly at the γ and δ subunit genes. On myotube formation, herculin reaches high levels; concomitantly, the e subunit gene becomes a common MDF target and begins to be expressed. In general, any MDF protein that is expressed also is present on transcriptionally active receptor genes; transcriptional activity of target genes correlates with occupancy by MDF, in particular, herculin."
https://openalex.org/W2117253669,"Tat protein, a trans-activating factor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, acts also as an extracellular molecule modulating gene expression, cell survival, growth, transformation, and angiogenesis. Here we demonstrate that human thrombospondin-1 (TSP), a plasma glycoprotein and constituent of the extracellular matrix, binds to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-Tat protein but not to GST. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding of free GST-Tat to immobilized TSP reveals a highaffinity interaction (Kd equal to 25 nM). Accordingly, TSP inhibits cell internalization and HIV-1 LTR trans-activating activity of extracellular Tat in HL3T1 cells with ID50 equal to 10–30 nM. Also, TSP inhibits cell interaction and mitogenic activity of extracellular Tat in T53 Tat-less cells. TSP is instead ineffective when administered after the interaction of Tat with cell surface heparan-sulfate proteoglycans has occurred, in keeping with its ability to prevent but not disrupt Tat/heparin interaction in vitro. Finally, TSP inhibits the autocrine loop of stimulation exerted by endogenous Tat in parental T53 cells. Accordingly, TSP overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, angiogenic activity, and tumorigenic capacityof stable T53 transfectants. Our data demonstrate the ability of TSP to bind to Tat protein and to affect its LTR trans-activating, mitogenic, angiogenic, and tumorigenic activity. These findings suggest that TSP may be implicated in the progression of AIDS and in AIDS-associated pathologies by modulating the bioavailability and biological activity of extracellular Tat.—Rusnati, M., Taraboletti, G., Urbinati, C., Tulipano, G., Giuliani, R., Molinari-Tosatti, M.

https://openalex.org/W2167598859,"Control of lymphocyte cell survival and proliferation is critical for both the immune response and for the prevention of autoimmune and infectious diseases. The actions of interleukin-2, the major T-cell regulatory cytokine, are mediated by the complex network of divergent signalling pathways controlled by its high-affinity receptor. Various studies have indicated that the generation of certain lipid second messengers is an important mechanism in the control of proliferation and cell death. We have examined the relationship between diacylglycerol and ceramide and the levels of the lipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, their potential precursors, in the human T-cell line Kit 225 cultured in three distinct conditions to favor apoptosis, cell arrest, and proliferation. Our data show that, in proliferating cells, the ratios of diacylglycerol/ceramide and phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin are higher than those found in arrested cells and increase with time in culture. These ratios are rapidly reversed in apoptotic cells. Further experiments reveal that de novo synthesis of both diacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine is greatest in proliferating cells, whereas sphingomyelin synthase activity is increased in cells undergoing apoptosis. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time that the ratio of mitogenic/antimitogenic lipids changes dramatically during T-cell proliferation and cell death. These results indicate that lipid second messengers and the enzymes that are responsible for their generation may provide targets for novel therapeutic interventions in the clinical management of immunosuppression and autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2063740220,"The immature rat uterus has been extensively used as an in vivo model system to study the molecular mechanisms of steroid hormone actions. In this study, we demonstrated the regulated expression of syndecan-3 in the rat uterus by the steroid hormone 17β-estradiol. Administration of a single physiological dose of 17β-estradiol (40 μg/kg) to ovariectomized immature animals induced a rapid and transient increase in uterine syndecan-3 mRNA. Transcript levels reached a peak elevation of 3-fold above saline control tissues 4 h after hormone administration. Inhibition of message up-regulation by actinomycin D but not cycloheximide indicated a hormone response dependent on RNA transcription but not new protein synthesis. The estrogenic ligands estriol and tamoxifen were also effective at raising syndecan-3 mRNA levels; however, nonestrogenic ligands, including progesterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and dexamethasone, failed to stimulate a change in mRNA levels.

This estrogen-regulated expression of syndecan-3 may play an important role in changes in tissue ultrastructure crucial for proper uterine growth. heparan sulfate proteoglycan glycosaminoglycan 17β-estradiol kilobase It has been known for some time that ovarian hormones induce changes in expression of surface proteins on epithelial cells lining the uterine lumen believed to be crucial for blastocyst reception (1Murphy C.R. Rogers A.W. Cell. Biophys. 1981; 3: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Included in this group of modified surface proteins are the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).1 HSPGs are nearly ubiquitous components of mammalian cell membranes that exhibit binding interactions with a variety of extracellular ligands. Molecular cloning and analysis has led to identification of multiple forms of membrane-anchored proteoglycans. Those best characterized are the membrane intercalated molecules, four of which display significant homologies in core protein structure and are classified as members of the same gene family. These related molecules are called the syndecans and include syndecans-1–4. Syndecans contain a small core protein with distinct functional domains to which are linked multiple glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, predominantly of the heparan sulfate variety. Homology of syndecan family members is most striking in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, showing >50% amino acid sequence similarity. In contrast, the extracellular ectodomains show little homology (2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Loose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific serine residues in the ectodomain regions serve as target sites for GAG attachment during proteoglycan synthesis. Variation in number and position of GAG attachment sites within the nonhomologous ectodomains leads to substantial differences in syndecan structure and potentially produces differential functions for each of the family members. Precise functions of each syndecan family member have not fully been determined. Experimental observations indicate involvement of these compounds in cell adhesion, cell morphogenesis, and regulation of cell responsiveness to soluble growth-regulatory compounds (3Carey D.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). These functions are attributed primarily to the glycan moieties. Both basic fibroblast growth factor (4Klagsbrun M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Rapraeger A. Krufka A. Olwin B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial growth factor (6Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have binding affinities for heparan sulfate, and evidence indicates that HSPGs function as coreceptors for these compounds at the cell surface. By virtue of their HSPG associations, binding of growth factors to specific cell surface receptors is facilitated, thereby enhancing effective signal transduction in target cells. Heparan sulfate GAG chains also provide cell membrane binding sites for extracellular matrix adhesion proteins, including fibronectin (7Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Barkalow F.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17971-17978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such binding interactions may facilitate or reinforce attachment of matrix proteins to their specific cell surface integrin receptors. Evidence that cell surface HSPGs have a role in focal adhesion formation in fibroblast and Chinese hamster ovary cells (10LeBaron R.G. Esko J.D. Woods A. Johansson S. Hook M J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and the specific localization of syndecan-4 to focal adhesions in a variety of cell types (11Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 12Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) further supports syndecan facilitation of organized cell-matrix interactions. Syndecan-3 has been implicated as an important matrix adhesion molecule in regulated neurite outgrowth activity during development in the central nervous system (13Carey D.J. Conner K. Asundi V.K. O'Mahony D.J. Stahl R.C. Showalter L.J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Hartman J. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2873-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additional observations that neuronal cell adhesion molecule, a homophilic cell-cell adhesion protein, exhibits binding affinity for heparan sulfate also suggest potential HSPG involvement in cell-cell anchorage (14Reyes A.A. Akeson R. Brezina L. Cole G.J. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A direct assessment of differential binding affinities of the various membrane proteoglycans has not yet been completed. Therefore, the functional significance of the diverse forms of syndecan family members remains unclear. Given the potential functional variation of the syndecans, it is not surprising that regulated expression of the family members has been observed. Although data are incomplete, syndecans appear to be expressed in tissue-specific patterns, although some crossover is apparent (for review, see Ref. 15Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Syndecan-3, although initially characterized by its high degree of expression in the nervous system during early postnatal development (16Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), is also observed in vascular smooth muscle cells and stratified epithelia. Regulation of expression in these various cell types, however, is poorly understood, although evidence indicates both temporal and spatial changes during a variety of development and cell differentiation processes. Such changes in expression often correlate with intervals when cell morphology is altered and major tissue ultrastructural reorganizations are occurring. Limited information is available concerning the molecular mechanisms of syndecan gene regulation. Induction of syndecan-1 expression has been observed in response to basic fibroblast growth factor in cultured populations of epithelial cells (17Elenius K. Maata A. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6435-6441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vascular smooth muscle cells by exposure to platelet-derived growth factor (18Cizmeci-Smith G. Stahl R.C. Showalter L.J. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18740-18747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, syndecan-4 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells is induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (19Cizmeci-Smith G. Langan E. Youkey J. Showalter L.J. Carey D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ovarian hormones have been shown to regulate expression of syndecan-1 in mouse uterine tissue (20Potter S.W. Morris J.E. Anat. Rec. 1992; 234: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, histochemical analysis to detect binding of anti-syndecan-1 antibodies demonstrated a dramatic change in lumenal epithelial cell localization during the estrous cycle involving repositioning from a predominantly apical location during intervals of low hormone secretion to an exclusively basolateral position during the peak fertility phase. Estrogen has also been shown to change the total content of cell surface HSPGs and to stimulate their turnover in the mouse uterine epithelium (21Morris J.E. Potter S.W. Gaza-Bulseco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4712-4718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely believed that such changes in epithelial cell HSPG expression are important for establishment of the blastocyst-receptive uterine state. The binding interactions of HSPGs in cell-matrix adhesion may indicate that estrogen-regulated changes in HSPG expression have an important role in directing endometrial matrix reorganization and cell spatial arrangements that accompany growth of the organ. However, little is known about the role of the syndecans in hormone-regulated uterine growth or about specific mechanisms that regulate their expression in the uterus. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effect of estrogen on syndecan-3 expression in the rat uterus. Analysis of syndecan-3 mRNA and protein indicate that transient changes in syndecan-3 expression occur in response to estrogen treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis of uterine tissue sections showed high levels of expression in epithelial cells that line the uterine lumen and a change in cell surface localization of the protein in these cells in response to estrogen treatment. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (Buckshire Corp., Perkasie, PA) were ovariectomized at 21 days of age. Three to five days after surgery, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 17β-estradiol (E2; 40 μg/kg in a 0.9% NaCl, 0.4% ethanol vehicle). Control animals received vehicle only. For experiments in which animals were treated with gene transcription or protein translation inhibitors, intraperitoneal injection of actinomycin D (8 mg/kg) or cycloheximide (4 mg/kg) was administered 2 h before E2 or control vehicle injection. Additional treatment compounds used for steroid specificity analysis were administered at the following doses: dexamethasone (600 μg/kg), estriol (40 μg/kg), tamoxifen (20 mg/kg), progesterone (4 mg/kg), and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (400 μg/kg). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. For RNA and protein analysis, animals were killed by decapitation at defined intervals after injection, and the uteri were stripped of adhering fat and mesentery, removed, and immediately frozen at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (−270 °C). For tissue specificity experiments, additional tissues were removed from these same animals and handled similarly. Total RNA was extracted from pooled uterine samples (approximately three to five uteri/sample) using Tri Reagent solution (22Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 53-57Google Scholar). Frozen tissue was homogenized in Tri Reagent using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments), and the homogenates were phase separated by addition of chloroform and centrifugation at 12,000 × g. RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase by addition of 100% isopropanol and pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The final RNA pellet was washed once with 75% ethanol, briefly dried, and dissolved in FORMazol (Molecular Research Center). Total RNA was quantified by spectrophotometric analysis at an absorbance of 260 nm. Total RNA was resolved in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel by electrophoresis at 100 V in a 1× 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer (20 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, 8.3 mm NaOAc, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). RNA samples contained ethidium bromide (1 μg) for later visualization under ultraviolet light. An RNA ladder (0.24–9.5 kb; Life Technologies, Inc.) was loaded into one lane of each gel as molecular weight standard. Gels were photographed under UV illumination (Eagle Eye System; Stratagene), and the images were used for densitometric analysis of the 18s rRNA band to correct for loading inequalities between samples. Resolved RNA was transferred to Magna 0.45-μm nylon membrane (Magna Separation Industries) using a downward capillary transfer technique (23Chomczynski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) in 10× SSC as transfer buffer. RNA was fixed by baking at 80 °C for 15 min, followed by UV cross-linking (GS Gene Linker; Bio-Rad). 32P-Radiolabeled nucleic acid probes were prepared from a 1-kb EcoRI fragment of cloned rat syndecan-3 cDNA (16Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 23 ng of purified cDNA fragment were used for probe synthesis by random primer labeling (Prime-It II kit; Stratagene) with α[32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as isotope. Northern blots were prehybridized at 65 °C in a solution containing 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 5× Denhardt's reagent. Prehybridized blots were incubated at 65 °C in a hybridization solution (5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 10% dextran sulfate) and the 32P-labeled probe (∼1.2–2.1 × 109 dpm/μg DNA). Membranes were washed under standard conditions and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji RX). For quantitative comparisons of mRNA levels, hybridization signals were quantified by direct measurement of membrane-bound radioactivity by phosphorimage analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Nonspecific background counts per minute in each lane were subtracted from the total counts per minute for radiolabeled mRNA bands to yield net counts per minute. Net counts were used for quantification of mRNA levels and direct comparison between RNA samples. Protein was extracted from pooled samples of frozen uteri (three to six uteri/sample) by homogenization in a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) using a Polytron homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, supernatants were saved, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) plus 1% Triton X-100. Pellet extracts were centrifuged as before, and the supernatants were removed and pooled with the supernatant from the initial extraction step. Aliquots of mixed supernatant samples were quantified by spectrophotometric analysis using a colorimetric dye assay (Bio-Rad). Extracted protein (25 μg) was denatured at 100 °C in a solution containing 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue. Samples were applied to a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and resolved by electrophoresis (Mini Protean II apparatus; Bio-Rad) at 100 V in a buffer containing 2.5 mm Tris base (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) with a 100-V current. Membranes were soaked in a blocking solution of Blotto plus 1% Tween 20 and then incubated in a 1:250 dilution of polyclonal rabbit (anti-rat) syndecan-3 antibody (16Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in blocking solution at room temperature using a microhybridization oven. The antibody solution was removed, and the membrane was washed and then incubated in a 1:3000 dilution of secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat (anti-rabbit) IgG (Bio-Rad) in blocking solution. Membranes were again washed and processed for detection of syndecan-3 protein by incubation in an appropriate substrate solution containing a luminol compound (SuperSignal Substrate; Pierce) for chemiluminescent signal development. Luminescent membranes were exposed to x-ray film for signal detection. The intensity of luminescent bands was quantified by x-ray film densitometry (EagleEye; Stratagene) and used for comparison of protein content in each sample of uterine protein. Uteri were harvested, and the horns were separated at the cervix. Each horn was embedded in OCT tissue medium (Electron Microscopy Services) and frozen. Uterine tissue sections (8 μm thickness) were generated using a cryostat microtome (Reichert-Jung Histostat) at −25 °C and placed on latex-coated slides (Cell Point Scientific). Tissue sections were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of polyclonal rabbit (anti-rat) syndecan-3 antibodies in blocking solution (0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.7, 5% nonfat milk) at room temperature. The antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed with blocking agent and then incubated in a 1:100 dilution of Texas Red-conjugated goat (anti-rabbit) IgG (Molecular Probes) for a minimum of 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections were washed as before and then rinsed briefly with 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline. Sections were examined on an inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence (Axiovert 35; Zeiss) using the appropriate filters for excitation of the Texas Red fluorescent marker and visualization of emitted light. Sections were photographed, and the images were used for identification of cell type expression of syndecan-3 and analysis of differences in expression pattern between uterine tissue samples. As a control, uterine sections from the same animals were incubated in blocking agent alone and then exposed to Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. Staining in control sections indicated a weak, diffuse background fluorescence that was similar between saline- and hormone-treated animals. E2-induced changes in syndecan-3 mRNA content were assessed by Northern blot analysis of RNA samples extracted from ovariectomized animals over a range of post-hormone treatment intervals from 0 to 48 h that included both the early and late uterine growth phases. Hybridization of Northern blots with radiolabeled rat syndecan-3 probe identified one major 5.9-kb transcript in the uterus (Fig. 1,top). Phosphorimage analysis of hybridized blots indicates that levels of syndecan-3 mRNA increased as early as 2 h and reached a peak value ∼3-fold higher 4 h after E2administration compared with levels in saline control animals (Fig. 1,bottom). Transcript levels remained elevated at 18 and 24 h after hormone treatment and then returned to the saline control level by 48 h. There were no changes detected in syndecan-3 mRNA content in 24- or 48-h saline-injected control animals. These data clearly indicate a transient increase in syndecan-3 mRNA content in response to estrogen treatment with peak changes in mRNA occurring during the early uterine growth phase. To determine whether the effect of E2 on syndecan-3 mRNA is dose dependent and thus indicative of a true hormone-regulated process, ovariectomized animals were treated with increasing doses of E2, and levels of syndecan-3 mRNA were analyzed by Northern blot. Because the initial Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1) indicated that the induced change in syndecan-3 mRNA content was greatest 4 h after hormone treatment, all uterine tissues were extracted at this time point after either E2 or saline control injections. Little or no change in syndecan-3 mRNA was detected at E2 dosages of <0.4 μg/kg (Fig. 2, top). However, mRNA levels increased to 43% of the maximum hormone response at a dose of 0.4 μg/kg (Fig. 2, bottom). Doses of 4 and 40 μg/kg produced equivalent increases in mRNA, indicating a maximum response level had been reached. The characteristic dose-response curve from the analysis (Fig. 2, bottom) is consistent with a response that is controlled by physiological levels of estradiol. Although the changes in syndecan-3 mRNA are indicative of a direct hormone-regulated process, it was of interest to determine whether the increase in mRNA after hormone treatment is the result of a direct change in transcription of the syndecan-3 gene. To study the transcription-dependent nature of syndecan-3 mRNA changes, ovariectomized animals were pretreated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or saline as control before E2administration 2 h later. Tissues were harvested 4 h after hormone challenge to determine the effect of the inhibitor at the time point when mRNA content was estimated to be at the peak level after estrogen treatment. Hybridization results are shown in Fig.3. Syndecan-3 mRNA content in animals pretreated with actinomycin D and challenged with E2, (Act D + E2) were significantly reduced 2-fold from transcript levels observed in animals treated with E2alone (saline + E2). This decrease in mRNA content by the transcription-inhibitory compound thus indicates that the syndecan-3 gene is regulated at the level of transcription. The E2-induced changes in syndecan-3 mRNA, however, were not similarly affected by pretreatment of animals with the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Animals were pretreated with cycloheximide (4 mg/kg) or saline vehicle 2 h before E2 administration, and mRNA levels were measured in uterine tissue 4 h after hormone challenge. Syndecan-3 mRNA content was increased ∼2–3-fold in cycloheximide-pretreated animals (Fig. 3, CHX + E2), which was similar to the level of change observed in animals pretreated with saline (saline + E2). To more specifically investigate hormone responsiveness of the syndecan-3 gene, ovariectomized animals were treated with various estrogenic and nonestrogenic steroid hormones, and mRNA content was determined by Northern blot analysis. Animals were treated with the estrogenic compounds E2, estriol, and tamoxifen or nonestrogenic steroid compounds, including progesterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and dexamethasone at the indicated effective dosages (Fig. 4). Uterine tissues were harvested from all treatment groups 4 h after hormone injections and processed for Northern blot analysis. Of the steroid hormones administered, only the estrogenic compounds E2, estriol, and tamoxifen induced increases in syndecan-3 mRNA content that were ∼2–3-fold above levels measured in saline control animals for all three compounds (Fig. 4, bottom). The nonestrogenic sex steroid compounds progesterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone caused no change in syndecan-3 mRNA over the same interval. However, treatment with the glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone produced a decrease in mRNA levels, an ∼80% reduction, compared with levels in tissues from saline control animals. Because the observed changes in uterine syndecan-3 mRNA clearly indicate hormone regulation of gene transcription, it was of interest to assess whether E2effected similar changes in other tissues known to contain the estrogen receptor, including heart (24Klangkalya B. Chan A. Life Sci. 1988; 42: 2307-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), liver (25Freychuss B.L. Sahlin L. Masironi B. Reiksson H. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 142: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), lung (26Thuresson-Klein A. Moawad A.H. Hedqvist P. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1985; 151: 506-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and spleen (27Myers M.J. Heim M.C. Hirsch K.S. Queener S.F. Petersen B.H. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All tissues were harvested from the same hormone-treated animals whose uteri were extracted and used for the initial syndecan-3 Northern blot analysis shown in Fig. 1. The syndecan-3 mRNA transcript was detected in all tissues analyzed; however, there were no detectable changes in mRNA levels after E2 administration in any of these tissues at any postinjection interval (Fig.5). To assess changes in expressed syndecan-3 protein during the E2-induced uterine growth response, Western blot analysis of total uterine protein extracts was completed. Anti-syndecan-3 antibodies identified a broad high molecular mass band in the range of 190–250 kDa (Fig.6). This is consistent with previous observations of the protein in other rat tissues and likely reflects varying degrees of glycanation at potential GAG attachment sites on the core protein (16Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Protein content clearly increased by 8 h and remained elevated at 20 h after hormone treatment. Levels then appeared to decline and return to that measured in saline control animals by 48 h. These changes in syndecan-3 protein content therefore initiate during the hypertrophic phase but peak early in the hyperplastic phase of uterine growth and clearly demonstrate transient regulation of syndecan-3 expression by the estrogenic hormone. Previous work in the mouse uterus has shown regulated changes in syndecan-1 expression in vivo during the normal fertility cycle in adult animals (20Potter S.W. Morris J.E. Anat. Rec. 1992; 234: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To better characterize the cell type-specific expression of syndecan-3 and assess changes in the pattern of uterine syndecan-3 expression, immunohistochemical localization was completed. The same anti-syndecan-3 antibodies were used to visualize location of the protein in sections of uteri harvested from saline control and hormone-treated animals. Results show that syndecan-3 is expressed in epithelial cells of glands in the endometrial stroma, smooth muscle cells of the myometrium, and epithelial cells of the perimetrium (Fig.7). The protein is also highly expressed in columnar epithelial cells of the endometrium (Fig.8). Changes in staining intensity in all cell types indicate that protein levels increase after hormone treatment; however, the most pronounced changes in expression pattern were observed in the epithelial cells of the endometrium that line the uterine lumen.Figure 8Histochemical analysis of temporal and spatial changes in syndecan-3 protein expression. Uteri were removed from saline-treated (control) and E2-treated (40 μg/kg) ovariectomized animals, and 8-μm frozen sections were prepared for immunodetection of syndecan-3 protein. Binding of anti-syndecan-3 antibodies was detected indirectly using Texas Red-conjugated mouse (anti-rabbit) IgG. Staining of sections shows the expression pattern specifically in the endometrial epithelium (E); the uterine lumen (L) and endometrial stroma (S) are also indicated. Scale bar, 20 μm. Panels reflect a time course of hormone response intervals:1, saline-treated control animals; staining is evident on apical (a) and basal (b) cell borders;2, 2 h after E2 treatment; 3, 6 h after E2 treatment; 4, 8 h after E2 treatment; staining at the apical cell surface (a) is diminished and more intense at the basolateral surfaces (b); 5, 12 h after E2treatment; almost exclusive basal staining is evident (b);6, 20 h after E2 treatment; basal localization still evident; 7, 48 h after E2 treatment; return to a staining pattern similar to that in saline tissues with reappearance of protein at apical cell borders (a); 8, control immunofluorescent tissue preparation; 12-h post-E2 uterus exposed only to fluorescent secondary antibodies.View Large"
