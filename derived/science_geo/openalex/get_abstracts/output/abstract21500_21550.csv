https://openalex.org/W2086487142,"Cytokine-activated human endothelial cells express vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which binds lymphocytes. We now identify the integrin VLA-4 as a receptor for VCAM-1 because VLA-4 surface expression on K-562 cells (following transfection of the VLA alpha 4 subunit cDNA) resulted in specific cell adhesion to VCAM-1, and anti-VLA-4 antibodies completely inhibited VCAM-1-dependent cell-cell attachment. In addition, VLA-4 expression allowed K-562 cells to attach to the heparin II binding region (FN-40) of fibronectin. However, VLA-4/VCAM-1 and VLA-4/FN-40 interactions are readily distinguishable: only the former was inhibited by the anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody HP1/3, and only the latter was inhibited by soluble FN-40. The VCAM-1/VLA-4 ligand-receptor pair may play a major role in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes to inflammatory sites in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1994305152,"The critical pathways through which protein-tyrosine kinases induce cellular proliferation and malignant transformation are not well defined. As microinjection of antibodies against p21ras can block the biological effects of both normal and oncogenic tyrosine kinases, it is likely that they require functional p21ras to transmit their mitogenic signals. No biochemical link has been established, however, between tyrosine kinases and p21ras. We have identified a non-catalytic domain of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, SH2, that regulates the activity and specificity of the kinase domain. The presence of two adjacent SH2 domains in the p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) indicates that GAP might interact directly with tyrosine kinases. Here we show that GAP, and two co-precipitating proteins of relative molecular masses 62,000 and 190,000 (p62 and p190) are phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells that have been transformed by cytoplasmic and receptor-like tyrosine kinases. The phosphorylation of these polypeptides correlates with transformation in cells expressing inducible forms of the v-src or v-fps encoded tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, GAP, p62 and p190 are also rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in fibroblasts stimulated with epidermal growth factor. Our results suggest a mechanism by which tyrosine kinases might modify p21ras function, and implicate GAP and its associated proteins as targets of both oncoproteins and normal growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. These data support the idea that SH2 sequences direct the interactions of cytoplasmic proteins involved in signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1971516038,"Gene mutation in vivo in human T lymphocytes appears to occur preferentially in dividing cells. Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are assumed to have one or more populations of diving T cells that are being stimulated by autoantigens. Mutant T cell clones from MS patients were isolated and tested for reactivity to myelin basic protein, an antigen that is thought to participate in the induction of the disease. The hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) clonal assay was used to determine mutant frequency values in MS patients with chronic progressive disease. Eleven of 258 thioguanine-resistant (hprt-) T cell clones from five of the six MS patients who were tested proliferated in response to human myelin basic protein without prior in vitro exposure to this antigen. No wild-type clones from these patients, nor any hprt- or wild-type clones from three healthy individuals responded to myelin basic protein. Thus, T cell clones that react with myelin basic protein can be isolated from the peripheral blood of MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2140595736,"HIV-1 Rev protein, purified from E. coli, binds specifically to an RNA transcript containing the 223 nucleotide long Rev response element (RRE) sequence. Rev binds to RRE in vitro with an apparent dissociation constant of 1 to 3 nM as determined by filter binding, gel mobility shift assays, or an immunoprecipitation assay using a monoclonal antibody specific for the Rev C-terminus. Antisense RRE sequences are bound by Rev with a 20-fold lower affinity than wild-type RRE sequences. The Rev-RRE complex forms even in the presence of a 10,000-fold molar excess of 16S rRNA, whereas formation of the low affinity antisense RRE-Rev complex is efficiently blocked by addition of excess 16S rRNA. A approximately 33 nucleotide fragment is protected from ribonuclease T1 digestion by the binding of Rev to RRE RNA, suggesting that Rev binds with high affinity to only a restricted region of the RRE. This protected fragment is unable to rebind Rev protein but has been mapped to a 71 nucleotide long Rev binding domain sequence that overlaps the protected fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1599053981,"The repair of 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methyl-formamidopyrimidine (Fapy) residues in DNA is performed by a Fapy-DNA glycosylase activity which is encoded for by the fpg gene in Escherichia coli. Besides DNA glycosylase activity, this protein, the FPG protein, is endowed with an EDTA-resistant activity nicking DNA at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. To overproduce the FPG protein, the fpg gene was placed under the control of the tac promoter in the expression vector pKK223-3 yielding the pFPG230 plasmid. The production of the FPG protein in cells harboring the pFPG230 plasmid was 800-fold higher than that of the wild type strain after induction by isopropyl-beta-D-thio-galactopyranoside. From these cells, the FPG protein was purified to homogeneity in sufficient quantity to study its physical and catalytic properties. In its active form, the FPG protein is a globular monomer of 31 kDa and has an experimentally measured isoelectric point of 8.5. When the FPG protein is heat-denatured in the presence of EDTA the two activities are more rapidly inactivated than when heated in the absence of EDTA, suggesting that the FPG protein possesses a tightly bound metal ion. Atomic absorption spectrophotometric analysis shows that there is one zinc/FPG protein molecule. The FPG protein is different from previously described DNA glycosylases and AP-nicking enzymes in E. coli. The contribution of the AP-nicking activity associated with the FPG protein represents 10-20% of the total EDTA-resistant AP-nicking activities in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1966019489,"Target cells are thought to regulate the survival of afferent neurons during development by supplying limiting amounts of neurotrophic factors, but the degree to which afferent neurons remain dependent on target-derived support in the adult is uncertain. In this study, uninjured basal forebrain cholinergic neurons did not die after excitotoxic ablation of their target neurons in young adult rats, indicating that they are either not dependent on neurotrophic factors for survival or can obtain trophic support from other sources after target neurons are lost. This finding suggests that cholinergic cell death in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease is not due solely to a loss of target neurons or factors provided by them."
https://openalex.org/W1973757037,"Retinoblastoma, a malignancy of the eye occurring in young children, has been widely studied as a model for genetic predisposition to cancer. This disease is caused by mutations in both alleles of an anti-oncogene (the retinoblastoma gene, Rb) that inactivate or eliminate the Rb encoded protein, p105Rb (refs 1 and 2). Here we report that expression of a viral oncogene, the simian virus 40 T antigen, in the retina of transgenic mice produces heritable ocular tumours with histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features identical to those of human retinoblastoma. Furthermore, we demonstrate a specific association between p105Rb and T antigen in mouse retinoblastoma tumour cells. Thus, the occurrence of these tumours is in vivo evidence for oncogenesis due to the ocular-specific expression of an Rb-binding oncoprotein that can functionally inactivate the Rb protein. As an animal model for heritable retinoblastoma, these mice should allow the study of the ontogeny, pathogenesis and treatment of this malignant disease."

https://openalex.org/W1483470782,"The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contains a large C' terminus distal to the protein tyrosine kinase domain that is conserved among members of its extended gene family. To investigate the C' terminus, a series of mutant EGFR cDNAs encoding progressive C'-terminal deletions were prepared and expressed in null recipient B82L cells. In vivo self-phosphorylation was retained in receptors truncated to residues 1052 and 1022 which lack the three identified sites of tyrosine self-phosphorylation. Receptors truncated to residue 991 did not undergo in vivo self-phosphorylation. Purified 1022 truncated receptor was self-phosphorylated to the extent of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor protein. The deduced additional site of tyrosine self-phosphorylation at residue 992 was confirmed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and protein sequencing. EGFRs deleted to give C'-terminal residues 1052, 1022, 991, and 973 exhibited enhanced EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of cell substrates in vivo, whereas deletion at residue 944 abolished all detectable EGF-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicate that ligand-induced self-phosphorylation is limited to the C' terminus of the EGFR and suggest that this region of the holoreceptor has an inhibitory function."
https://openalex.org/W1595132971,"The vitronectin receptor mediates cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and thrombospondin in an RGD-dependent manner. We previously demonstrated the direct interaction between the vitronectin receptor and an RGD-containing peptide by photoaffinity labeling the receptor with 125I-sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azido-salicylamido)-1,3'-dithioprop ion ate (SASD)-GRGDSPK (Smith, J. W., and Cheresh, D. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18726-18731). In that report, we identified amino acid residues 61-203 of the beta-subunit as proximal to the ligand binding site. Here we demonstrate that 125I-SASD-GRGDSPK affinity labels the alpha-subunit of the receptor at least two distinct sites within the region encompassing residues 139-349. Both of these regions are within the putative divalent cation binding region of the alpha-subunit. Collectively, our results suggest that discrete amino-terminal domains of both subunits of the receptor contribute to the structure of the ligand binding domain and furthermore that the ligand and divalent cation binding domains are spatially and functionally linked."

https://openalex.org/W1536337406,"We have identified the sites phosphorylated in vitro by epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase in bovine brain phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma). They are tyrosine residues 472, 771, 783, and 1254. The rate of phosphorylation was fastest with the sites at 771 and 783, then at 1254, and slowest at 472. PLC-gamma isolated from cells treated with EGF is known to contain at least four tyrosine phosphate-containing peptides and two of them are identified to be residues 771 and 1254 in the accompanying paper (Wahl, M. I., Nishibe, S., Kim, J. W., Kim, H., Rhee, S. G., and Carpenter, G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3944-3948). The 3 residues 472, 771, and 783 are located closely to the regions of PLC-gamma which exhibit a high sequence similarity to the regulatory domain of the src family tyrosine kinases. Nevertheless, the tyrosine phosphorylation did not affect the catalytic activity of PLC-gamma in vitro. We propose, therefore, that the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma by EGF receptor kinase alters its interaction with putative inhibitory proteins and leads to its activation."
https://openalex.org/W1483065892,"The vitronectin (Vn) receptor belongs to the integrin family of proteins and although its biochemical structure is fully characterized little is known about its binding affinity and specificity. We report here that Vn receptor binding to different matrix proteins is influenced by the surrounding lipid composition of the membrane. Human placenta affinity purified Vn receptor was inserted into liposomes of different composition: (i) phosphatidylcholine (PC); (ii) PC+phosphatidylethanolamine (PE); (iii) PC+PE+phosphatidylserine (PS) + phosphatidylinositol (PI) + cholesterol (chol). The amount of purified material that could be incorporated into the three lipid vesicle preparations was proportional to the efficiency of the vesicle formation that increased from PC (38%) to PC+PE and PC+PE+PS+PI+chol (about 50%) vesicles. Electron microscopy analysis showed that the homogeneity and size of the three liposome preparations were comparable (20-nm diameter) but their binding capacity to a series of substrates differed widely. Vn receptor inserted in PC liposomes bound only Vn, but when it was inserted in PC+PE and PC+PE+PS+PI+chol liposomes it also attached to von Willebrand factor (vWF) and fibronectin (Fn). Vn receptor had higher binding capacity for substrates when it was inserted in PC+PE+PS+PI+chol than PC+PE liposomes. Antibodies to Vn receptor blocked Vn receptor liposome binding to Vn, vWF, and Fn. The intrinsic emission fluorescence spectrum of the Vn receptor reconstituted in PC+PE+PS+PI+chol liposomes was blue-shifted in relation to PC liposomes, suggesting a conformational change of the receptor in the membranes. These data provide direct evidence that the Vn receptor is promiscuous and can associate with Vn, vWF and Fn. The nature of the membrane lipid composition surrounding the receptor could thus influence its binding affinity, possibly by changing its conformation or exposure or both."
https://openalex.org/W2095381278,"The ability of some microorganisms to rapidly alter the expression and structure of surface components reflects an important strategy for adaptation to changing environments, including those encountered by infectious agents within respective host organisms. Mycoplasma hyorhinis, a wall-less prokaryotic pathogen of the class Mollicutes, is shown to undergo high-frequency phase transitions in colony morphology and opacity and in the expression of diverse lipid-modified, cell-surface protein antigens. These proteins spontaneously vary in size, contain highly repetitive structures, and are oriented with their carboxyl-terminal region external to the membrane. Thus, mycoplasma membrane lipoproteins generate microbial surface diversity and may be part of a complex system that controls interactions of these organisms with their hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2033245328,"A rapid increase in the RNA levels of the proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc was detected after human cytomegalovirus infection. Neither inactivation of viral infectivity with ultraviolet irradiation (with or without psoralen), nor inhibition of translation with cycloheximide or anisomycin adversely affected the enhanced expression of proto-oncogenes, even though these treatments substantially reduced or eliminated the detection of immediate early viral antigens. The increase in the RNA levels of the proto-oncogenes was prevented in the presence of α-amanitin or actinomycin D. Thus, expression of these oncogenes appears to be induced by events occurring before the onset of viral protein synthesis, perhaps by the interaction of viral particles with the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1509652229,"We have previously described a cDNA which encodes a binding site with the pharmacology of the D2-dopamine receptor (Bunzow, J. R., VanTol, H. H. M., Grandy, D. K., Albert, P., Salon, J., Christie, M., Machida, C., Neve, K. A., and Civelli, O. (1988) Nature 336, 783-787). We demonstrate here that this protein is a functional receptor, i.e. it couples to G-proteins to inhibit cAMP generation and hormone secretion. The cDNA was expressed in GH4C1 cells, a rat somatomammotrophic cell strain which lacks dopamine receptors. Stable transfectants were isolated and one clone, GH4ZR7, which had the highest levels of D2-dopamine receptor mRNA on Northern blot, was studied in detail. Binding of D2-dopamine antagonist [3H]spiperone to membranes isolated from GH4ZR7 cells was saturable, with KD = 96 pM, and Bmax = 2300 fmol/mg protein. Addition of GTP/NaCl increased the IC50 value for dopamine competition for [3H]spiperone binding by 2-fold, indicating that the D2-dopamine receptor interacts with one or more G-proteins. To assess the function of the dopamine-binding site, acute biological actions of dopamine were characterized in GH4ZR7 cells. Dopamine, at concentrations found in vivo, decreased resting intra- and extracellular cAMP levels (EC50 = 8 +/- 2 nM) by 50-70% and blocked completely vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) induced enhancement of cAMP levels (EC50 = 6 +/- 1 nM). Antagonism of dopamine-induced inhibition of VIP-enhanced cAMP levels by spiperone, (+)-butaclamol, (-)-sulpiride, and SCH23390 occurred at concentrations expected from KI values for these antagonists at the D2-receptor and was stereoselective. Dopamine (as well as several D2-selective agonists) inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 45 +/- 6%, with EC50 of 500-800 nM in GH4ZR7 membranes. Dopaminergic inhibition of cellular cAMP levels and of adenylyl cyclase activity in membrane preparations was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml, 16 h). Dopamine (200 nM) abolished VIP- and thyrotropin-releasing hormone-induced acute prolactin release. These data show conclusively that the cDNA clone encodes a functional dopamine-D2 receptor which couples to G-proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent hormone secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1581943980,"Initiation of mRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase II occurs by a multistep pathway that involves the polymerase along with several auxiliary factors. Here I describe an analysis of the kinetics and mechanism of action of Drosophila RNA polymerase II by using the detergent Sarkosyl to inhibit different steps in the pathway leading to transcription initiation. The template DNA and Drosophila transcription factors assemble into a partially Sarkosyl-resistant initiation complex with a kinetically first order time course characterized by a t1/2 of about 3 min, and subsequent conversion of the initiation complex into the elongating complex occurs rapidly (less than 5 s). During the formation of the first two phosphodiester bonds, there is a stepwise transition from the initiation complex to the 0.25% Sarkosyl-resistant elongating polymerase. In contrast to the mammalian RNA polymerase II systems, the Drosophila extracts possess the ability to carry out many rounds (approximately 10) of transcription in vitro. Finally, the transcription factors are committed to the template DNA as an initiation complex, but then no longer appear to remain committed to the DNA after initiation of transcription. This finding suggests that there is complete assembly and disassembly of the transcription complex during each round of transcription by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1993411667,"A small plasmid-specified RNA (RNA I) inhibits formation of the RNA primer for CoIE1 DNA replication by binding to its precursor (RNA II). Binding is modulated by the plasmid-specified Rom protein. Both in the presence and absence of Rom, binding starts with interaction between loops of RNAs. To understand the mechanism of binding, we examined the interactions of pairs of single stem-loops that are complementary fragments of RNA I and RNA 11. We found that these complementary single stem-loops bind to each other at their loops, forming an RNAase V1-sensitive structure. Rom protects the complex from cleavage and from alkylation of phosphate groups by ethylnitrosourea. A single dimer of Rom binds to the complex by recognizing the structure rather than its exact nucleotide sequence. Rom enhances complex formation by decreasing the rate of dissociation of the complex. Structures of RNA complexes formed in the presence and absence of Rom are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1826363106,"Regions within the 5'-flanking sequence of the bovine CYP17 (P-450(17)alpha) gene which are required for cAMP-dependent regulation of transcription have been localized by transient transfection of chimeric reporter gene constructs into mouse adrenal tumor Y1 cells. Two sequences have been found which individually confer cAMP responsiveness to reporter genes; they are located at -243/-225 and -80/-40 base pairs (bp). Obvious sequence homology between these two regions is not apparent. Gel shift competition analysis indicates that nuclear protein(s) binding to the -243/-225-bp region can be competed for by the addition of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus cAMP-responsive element (CRE) from the human chorionic gonadotropin alpha gene, whereas addition of this CRE does not abolish protein-DNA complexes formed with fragments containing the -80/-40-bp sequence. Gel shift and Southwestern analysis indicate that the -243/-225-bp region of the P-450(17)alpha gene and the CRE both bind a 47-kDa protein and that the CRE binds additional proteins (43 and 68 kDa) not apparently recognized by the -243/-225-bp sequence. Thus cAMP-dependent regulation of the bovine P-450(17)alpha gene appears to involve two independent cis-regulatory regions, neither of which contains a consensus CRE. Based on protein binding analysis, one of these regions (that including -80/-40 bp) is distinct from the consensus CRE while the other (that containing -243/-225 bp) may be related to the consensus CRE."
https://openalex.org/W1503663915,"The Na,K-ATPase alpha isoform (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) and beta subunit genes exhibit a complex pattern of expression during heart development. To identify possible molecular signals that regulate the differential expression of these genes, isolated neonatal rat myocardial and non-myocardial cells were cultured in chemically defined medium and the responses of the multiple Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNAs to various hormones were tested. Myocardiocytes in control cultures express primarily alpha 1 and beta mRNAs. Triiodothyronine (T3) induced the expression of alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta mRNAs without influencing alpha 1 mRNA levels. Dexamethasone (DEX) treatment similarly induced alpha 2 mRNA levels, but the abundance of the other subunit transcripts remained unaltered. T3 and DEX together caused increases in alpha 2 and beta mRNA, increments similar to that observed with T3 alone. However, DEX specifically repressed the induction of alpha 3 mRNA by T3. Both hormones stimulated corresponding changes in the sarcolemma concentration of these Na,K-ATPase isozymes. Addition of norepinephrine to the cultures had little appreciable effect on expression of the alpha isoform and beta mRNAs. Although characterized less extensively, control cultures of non-myocardiocytes expressed alpha 1, alpha 3, and beta mRNAs, of which only the beta mRNA was stimulated by T3. These data indicate that thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones differentially regulate the expression of multiple alpha isoform and beta subunit mRNAs of Na,K-ATPase in cardiocytes in vitro and, therefore, may also be important physiological modulators in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1530640784,"The energy dependence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake was characterized in rat brain synaptic vesicles and in proteoliposomes reconstituted with a new procedure from vesicular detergent extracts. The proteoliposomes displayed high ATP-dependent GABA uptake activity with properties virtually identical to those of intact vesicles. GABA uptake was similar at chloride concentrations of 0 and 150 mM, i.e. conditions under which either the membrane potential (delta psi) or the pH difference (delta pH) predominates. Delta psi was gradually dissipated by increasing the concentration of SCN-. GABA uptake was reduced by 10 mM SCN-, showing less sensitivity to delta psi reduction than glutamate uptake but more than dopamine uptake. Dissipation of delta pH with NH+4 abolished GABA uptake at pH 7.3, whereas no significant inhibition occurred at pH 6.5. In contrast, dopamine uptake was inhibited more strongly, even at pH 6.5, and glutamate uptake was not reduced in either condition. We conclude that GABA uptake is driven by both components of the proton electrochemical gradient, delta pH and delta psi, and that this is different from the uptake of both dopamine and glutamate, which is more strongly dependent on delta pH and delta psi, respectively. Thus, our data suggest that GABA uptake is electrogenic and occurs in exchange for protons."

https://openalex.org/W1640373721,"DNase I footprinting assays were performed to identify the binding sites for putative trans-acting factors involved in the control of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene expression using mouse AFP promoter fragments (-839 to +56) and nuclear protein extracts from fetal, newborn, and adult livers and from brain and kidney. Our studies have shown that with nuclear protein from adult mouse liver, there are 14 protected regions in the AFP promoter up to -839 base pairs (bp). Region I (-82 to -43) was protected by at least three different factors, one of which is CCAAT-binding/enhancer-binding protein. This region is highly conserved in the mouse, rat, and human AFP genes and has been shown previously to be essential for the regulation of tissue-specific expression in mouse. Differences in DNase I protection with fetal, newborn, and adult nuclear proteins have been observed in the proximal promoter region (up to -202 bp) and in regions further upstream (up to -839 bp). Significant differences among liver, kidney, and brain nuclear protein-binding sites have also been observed. In these studies, we have mapped the fetal and adult nuclear protein-binding sites of the cis-acting DNA sequences of the mouse AFP proximal promoter (up to -200) and have identified specific protein-binding sites in the distal promoter (-200 to -839). We have also identified the sites of the AFP promoter which bind nuclear proteins from highly differentiated tissues in which AFP is not expressed."

https://openalex.org/W1523864517,"We have investigated the localization and pattern of expression of the three alpha subunit isoforms of Na,K-ATPase in the transporting ciliary epithelium of the bovine eye. Using specific cDNA probes and antisera to the alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 isoforms of Na,K-ATPase, we demonstrated that mRNAs and polypeptides for the three distinct forms of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) were expressed in the ciliary epithelium in vivo. Immunochemical localization of the three alpha isoforms of Na,K-ATPase in two ultrastructurally different regions of the ciliary epithelium (namely, the pars plicata and pars plana) revealed that the three alpha isoforms of Na,K-ATPase were distributed in a distinct fashion in the basolateral plasma membrane domains of nonpigmented (NPE) and pigmented (PE) cells. The NPE cells in the pars plicata showed an immunoreactive signal to all the three alpha isoforms; in the pars plana, they showed immunoreactive signals only for the alpha 1 and alpha 2 isoforms but not for alpha 3. The PE cells, in both the pars plana and pars plicata regions, showed an immunoreactive signal only for the alpha 1 isoform; immunoreactive signals were not detected for alpha 2 and alpha 3. To verify the differential immunostaining patterns of NPE and PE cells, specific antibodies for each of the three alpha subunit isoforms of Na,K-ATPase were applied to immunoblots containing microsomal fractions from flow cytometric-sorted cells (NPE and PE). Our results indicate that alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 polypeptides were present in microsomal fractions of NPE cells of the pars plicata and pars plana and that the alpha 1 polypeptide was the only polypeptide present in the PE cells from both regions of the ciliary epithelium. These results also revealed that the alpha 3 isoform epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody McB-X3.1 in the pars plicata is not readily accessible in the pars plana. A cell line was established from the ciliary epithelium of a bovine eye by viral transformation with simian virus 40. In culture, this cell line expressed all three alpha isoforms at the mRNA and polypeptide levels, suggesting that the line may have derived from the NPE layer."
https://openalex.org/W1513965564,"The expression of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in cultured chicken skeletal muscle can be altered by varying the demand for ion transport. Veratridine, an activator of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels, causes a specific transient increase in biosynthesis of the sodium pump that accounts for the doubling of the number of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase molecules in the sarcolemma (Wolitzky, B.A., and Fambrough, D.M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9990-9999). Here we report a study of veratridine-induced up-regulation, focusing upon alpha- and beta-mRNA levels and transcription rates. Myotubes normally express the alpha 1-isoform mRNA and the beta-mRNA at a molar ratio of 0.6 +/- 0.1 (S.D.). In the presence of veratridine, the beta-mRNA is transiently up-regulated approximately 3-fold. The kinetics of this increase parallel the rate of beta-subunit protein synthesis. The increase in beta-mRNA during up-regulation is accomplished by an increase in the transcription rate of the beta gene. The veratridine-induced increase in beta-mRNA is not blocked by cycloheximide. The alpha-mRNA also increases during exposure to veratridine, but this increase is very modest and occurs very late in the up-regulation process. The increased beta-mRNA results in over-production of beta-subunits, which we postulate drives more efficient assembly of alpha beta complexes, i.e. sodium pump molecules. As the up-regulated state is achieved the level of beta-mRNA falls abruptly, reflecting a marked decrease in beta-mRNA stability. Treatment of up-regulated myotubes with tetrodotoxin, a veratridine antagonist, results in rapid down-regulation of the sodium pump, while having little or no effect on the levels of alpha 1- and beta-mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1589424070,"We have studied the influence of thyroid hormone status in vivo on expression of the genes encoding guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) alpha-subunits Gs alpha, Gi alpha(2), Gi alpha(3), and both the 36-kDa form (beta 1) and the 35-kDa form (beta 2) of the beta-subunit in rat ventricle. The relative amounts of immunoactive Gi alpha(2) and Gi alpha(3) were greater in ventricular membranes from hypothyroid animals than from euthyroid animals (1.9- and 2.6-fold, respectively). A corresponding 2.3-fold increase in Gi alpha(2) mRNA was observed as well as a 1.5-fold increase in Gi alpha(3) mRNA. The relative amounts of immunoactive beta 1 and beta 2 polypeptides were also increased (2.8- and 1.8-fold, respectively) in the hypothyroid state and corresponded with comparable increases in the relative levels of beta 1 and beta 2 mRNAs. No difference was seen between the amounts of Gi alpha(2), Gi alpha(3), beta 1, and beta 2 in the euthyroid state and the hyperthyroid state. In contrast to these effects of thyroid hormone status on Gi alpha and beta, the steady-state amounts of Gs alpha protein and mRNA were not altered by thyroid hormone status. Thyroid hormone status did not alter sensitivity of adenylyl cyclase to stimulation by sodium fluoride or guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp), nor did it influence GppNHp-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity. These results demonstrate that thyroid hormone status in vivo can regulate expression of specific G protein subunits in rat myocardium. However, the physiological consequences of these changes remain unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1597477503,"Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) stimulates DNA synthesis in quiescent murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). CSF-1 action has been shown to involve activation of the CSF-1 receptor kinase. The protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (PMA), is itself weakly mitogenic and synergises with CSF-1 for stimulation of BMM DNA synthesis suggesting a possible role for protein kinase C in the stimulation of BMM DNA synthesis. In this report we show that several agents which raise intracellular cAMP (8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, cholera toxin, and prostaglandin E2) reversibly inhibit DNA synthesis in BMM induced by CSF-1, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interleukin-3, and PMA. The suppressive action of cAMP elevation on the proliferative response to CSF-1 can be manifested even late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Several CSF-1-stimulated earlier responses, viz. protein synthesis, Na+/H+ exchange, Na+,K(+)-ATPase and c-myc-mRNA expression, were not inhibited thus showing a striking difference from some other cellular systems involving growth factor-mediated responses. c-fos-mRNA levels were raised and stabilized by the cAMP-elevating agents, and this modulation was not altered by CSF-1. Thus, the signaling pathways in the macrophages involving tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C activation are associated with increased proliferation while those involving elevation of cAMP (and presumably activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases) appear to have an inhibitory effect."
https://openalex.org/W1530382660,"In isolated hepatic microsomal vesicles the heavy metals Cd2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ inhibit Ca2+ uptake and evoke a prompt efflux of Ca2+ from preloaded vesicles in a dose-dependent manner. N-Ethylmaleimide also inhibits Ca2+ uptake and causes Ca2+ release, but it is less effective in these respects than the heavy metals. Measurement of mannose-6-phosphatase activity indicate that the heavy metal-induced Ca2+ efflux is not caused by a general increase in membrane permeability. Heavy metals also inhibit the Ca2(+)-ATPase activity and the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate of the enzyme. In contrast, the sulfhydryl modifying reagent, N-ethylmaleimide inhibits the Ca2(+)-ATPase activity while it has a relatively small effect on Ca2+ release. Thus, the effects of these agents on Ca2+ sequestering and Ca2(+)-ATPase activity are not strictly proportional. The sulfhydryl group reducing agent dithiothreitol protects the microsomes from the effects of heavy metals, while glutathione is less protective. Addition of vanadate to vesicles, at a concentration which completely blocked the activity of the Ca2(+)-ATPase, resulted in a small and slow release of the accumulated Ca2+. Subsequent additions of heavy metals evoked a massive Ca2+ release. Thus, the effects of heavy metals on Ca2+ efflux cannot be due entirely to their inhibition of the Ca2+ pump. The heavy metal-induced Ca2+ efflux is not inhibited either by ruthenium red or tetracaine."
https://openalex.org/W1772679588,"From morphological and biochemical studies it has been recognized that the regions where the outer and inner membranes of mitochondria come in close contact (contact sites) can be the route mechanism through which mitochondria interact directly with the cytoplasm. We have studied these regions electrophysiologically with the patch clamp technique, with the aim of understanding if this direct interaction is mediated by high conductance ion channels similar to the channel already detected in the inner membrane of mitochondria (Sorgato M. C., Keller, B. U., and Stuhmer, W. (1987) Nature 330, 498-500). Contact sites isolated from rat brain mitochondria were thus incorporated into liposomes subsequently enlarged sufficiently to be patch clamped. This study shows that these particular fractions contain ion channels with conductances ranging from approximately 5 picosiemens to 1 nanosiemens (in symmetrical 150 mM KCl). Most of these channels are not voltage-dependent and can be open at physiological potentials sustained by respiring mitochondria. The lack of voltage sensitivity seems not to be the outcome of methodological artifacts, as voltage-gated channels are detected in giant liposomes containing either the outer mitochondrial membrane or a partially purified fraction of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These data therefore indicate that channels present in mitochondrial contact sites have properties which render them amenable to perform several of the functions hypothesized for these regions, particularly that of translocating macromolecules from the cytoplasm to the matrix of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1581935652,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are potent endotoxins that are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative septicemia. The liver is known to be the primary organ responsible for the clearance of LPS from the systemic circulation in mammals. In this work, 125I-labeled LPS have been used in a filtration assay for the specific binding of LPS to intact rat hepatocytes. Eight S-form (smooth) LPS with complete O-specific polysaccharide chains isolated from different O-serotypes of Salmonella and Escherichia coli as well as nine R-form (rough) LPS isolated from Salmonella mutants deficient in synthesis of their core oligosaccharides were used in this study. All 125I-labeled S-form LPS and R-form LPS, except Re, show specific binding to isolated hepatocytes. The binding is saturable, is inhibited with excess unlabeled homologous or heterologous LPS but not lipid A, and is trypsin sensitive. L-Glycero-D-mannoheptose (heptose), a constituent of the inner core region of almost all LPS, is a potent inhibitor of the specific binding of 125I-labeled Rb2 LPS, whereas other monosaccharides, including 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (KDO), have weak or negligible inhibitor activity. These results strongly suggest the presence of a lectin-like receptor for the LPS inner core region (heptose-KDO region) on the plasma membrane of rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1495489079,"Heparin-binding growth factor-1 (HBGF-1), also known as acidic fibroblast growth factor, is a potent mitogen for a variety of cell types including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Studies using murine 3T3 fibroblasts have shown that HBGF-1 induces numerous cellular responses such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific polypeptides and the increased expression of actin mRNA. Here we report that the addition of HBGF-1 to quiescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells increases the level of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain mRNA but not PDGF B-chain mRNA. In contrast, factors that inhibit endothelial cell proliferation such as phorbol myristate acetate and the cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increase both PDGF A-chain and B-chain mRNA levels. HBGF-1 induction of PDGF A-chain mRNA expression occurs in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and thus does not require de novo protein synthesis. HBGF-1 also increases c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc mRNA levels; in the presence of cycloheximide, PDGF A-chain and protooncogene mRNA accumulation kinetics are similar. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that the transcription rate of the PDGF A-chain gene transiently increases after HBGF-1 addition. Immunoprecipitation analysis using PDGF A-chain-specific antibodies indicates that HBGF-1-stimulated cells synthesize and secrete an increased amount of PDGF relative to unstimulated cells. If HBGF-1 can regulate PDGF expression by vascular endothelial cells in vivo, then HBGF-1 availability would be an important component of smooth muscle cell growth control. For example, HBGF-1 within the vessel wall would promote smooth muscle cell proliferation by (a) direct interaction with smooth muscle cell HBGF-1 receptors, and (b) increasing the amount of endothelial cell-derived PDGF available for binding to smooth muscle cell PDGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1526232930,"Chick cartilages contain type I collagen mRNAs but do not synthesize type I collagen. The 5' end of the mRNA derived from the alpha 2 type I collagen gene (alpha 2(I] in cartilage differs from the 5' end of the mRNA in cells and tissues that actively synthesize alpha 2(I) collagen. This difference in mRNA structure results from the use of a cartilage-specific transcription start site within intron 2 of the alpha 2(I) collagen gene. The use of the cartilage transcription start site replaces exons 1 and 2 with a 96-base exon contained within intron 2. The resulting transcripts contain several small open reading frames, all of which appear out of frame with the collagen coding sequence. The cartilage form of the mRNA no longer encodes alpha 2(I) collagen, thus explaining the absence of alpha 2(I) collagen in cartilage. Transcription of the alpha 2(I) collagen gene initiates at the previously described (bone/tendon) promoter in prechondrogenic limb mesenchyme, which synthesizes alpha 2(I) collagen. Thus, the cessation of alpha 2(I) collagen synthesis which occurs during differentiation of prechondrogenic mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes apparently results from the switch in promoter utilization from the bone/tendon promoter to the cartilage promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1587737221,"Myosin light chain kinase can be divided into three distinct structural domains, an amino-terminal tail, of unknown function, a central catalytic core and a carboxy-terminal calmodulin-binding regulatory region. We have used a combination of deletion mutagenesis and monoclonal antibody epitope mapping to define these domains more closely. A 2.95-kilobase cDNA has been isolated that includes the entire coding sequence of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (607 amino acids). This cDNA, expressed in COS cells encoded a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase with a specific activity similar to that of the enzyme purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. Serial carboxy-terminal deletions of the regulatory and catalytic domains were constructed and expressed in COS cells. The truncated kinases had no detectable myosin light chain kinase activity. Monoclonal antibodies which inhibit the activity of the enzyme competitively with respect to myosin light chain were found to bind between residues 235-319 and 165-173, amino-terminal of the previously defined catalytic core. Thus, residues that are either involved in substrate binding or in close proximity to a light chain binding site may be located more amino-terminal than the previously defined catalytic core."
https://openalex.org/W1608259485,"The membrane lipid phase may be an important mediator of the peptide-receptor interaction. In order to understand the mechanism of this interaction, it is important to know the peptide structure, not only in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer environment, but also at the bilayer surface and in solution. To investigate this problem we have measured the secondary structure of the 11-residue neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its fragments in aqueous solutions, in membrane mimetic solvents, and associated with lipid bilayers using Raman and CD spectroscopy. Raman and CD spectra of SP bound to liposomes indicate a less than 20% helix content. We interpret these results to indicate that SP contains virtually no helix when bound to negatively charged liposomes. These spectra are similar to spectra of peptides in type I and III beta-turns. SP forms between 10 and 30% (1-3 residues) helical structure in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles and less than 10% helix in methanol and trifluoroethanol. The binding of SP to negatively charged liposomes significantly changes the structure of the lipid acyl chains, decreasing order in some cases and increasing it in others. Raman spectra of SP in water indicates that SP near 30 mM forms an ensemble of structures in water that is distinct from completely unfolded peptide and from the aggregated beta-sheet form observed in saline solutions. We conclude from our CD results that methods used to quantitate secondary structure from CD spectra of short peptides cannot be used to distinguish between very short helical segments and beta-turns."
https://openalex.org/W1557481366,"Paired intercellular transmembrane channels, termed connexons, comprised of hexameric assemblies of gap junction protein, were isolated and purified from rat liver by exploiting their resistance to either Sarkosyl detergent solubilization or alkali extraction. The secondary structures of the gap junction proteins prepared by these methods were compared by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Both the spectra and the calculated net secondary structures of the proteins obtained by the two isolation methods were different. The protein isolated by the Sarkosyl treatment was found to be approximately 50% alpha-helical, while protein isolated by alkali extraction had a lower helix content (approximately 40%). In both types of preparations, however, the helical content of the gap junction protein was sufficiently large to be consistent with an all-helical model for the membrane-spanning parts of the structure. CD spectroscopy was also used to examine the effects of proteolytic digestion of the cytoplasmic domain on the net secondary structure of the detergent-treated gap junction protein. The membrane-bound fragments had a slightly higher proportion of their residues that were alpha-helical in nature, suggesting that the transmembrane and/or intra-gap domains are indeed enriched in this type of secondary structure. This information constrains the range of models which can be realistically proposed for the channel structure."
https://openalex.org/W1580100206,"In an attempt to identify the transcription initiation sites in chicken mitochondrial DNA, RNAs capped in vitro using vaccinia guanylyl transferase and [alpha-32P] GTP were analyzed. The most abundant labeled transcript was identified by RNA sequencing as the mitochondrial tRNA(His). Sequence analysis also revealed that this tRNA contains an extra guanylate residue at its 5' end, characteristic of the histidine tRNA family. The respective genomic region was also cloned and sequenced. In contrast to bacteria and the mitochondria of fungi and plants, the extra G of chicken mitochondrial tRNA(His) is not encoded in the gene. Therefore, the guanylate residue must be added post-transcriptionally, as demonstrated for the nuclear tRNA(His) in yeast and Drosophila. Analysis of a capped tRNA(His) precursor of chicken mitochondria suggests that addition of the extra G occurs independently of 3' end maturation. Since in the chicken mitochondrial tRNA(His) the extra G can be efficiently labeled by the capping assay, it should possess a 5'-terminal di- or triphosphate, which contrasts to the 5'-terminal monophosphate proposed for the nuclear encoded tRNA(His). Our results imply that the ability of a mitochondrial RNA to be capped in vitro does not necessarily prove that it contains a transcription initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W1602684125,"Vitronectin (VN) is an adhesive glycoprotein with roles in the complement, coagulation, and immune systems. Many of the functions of VN are mediated by a glycosaminoglycan binding site, near its carboxyl-terminal end. In this paper, we show that the highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), dextran sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, and fucoidan effectively augment [14C]putrescine incorporation into VN and cross-linking of VN into high molecular multimers by guinea pig liver transglutaminase (TG). Other GAGs including heparin, low molecular weight heparin, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and the nonsulfated dextrans were ineffective in accelerating these reactions. Dextran sulfate of average molecular mass 500 kDa was more effective than dextran sulfate of average molecular mass 5 kDa, supporting a template mechanism of action of the GAGs, in which VN molecules align on the GAG in a conformation suitable for cross-linking. The VN multimers catalyzed by TG retained functional activity in binding [3H]heparin, platelets, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). [3H]Heparin bound selectively to the 65-kDa monomeric band of VN and to the multimers derived from this band. PAI-1, however, bound equally to both the 75- and 65-kDa monomeric forms of VN, suggesting that the PAI-1 binding site on VN is distinct from the GAG binding site. The interaction of GAGs with the TG-catalyzed cross-linking of VN may facilitate studies of VN structure-function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1535834108,"Abstract Cis-acting elements involved in the control of rat alpha-fetoprotein gene expression in the liver and its modulation by glucocorticoid hormones were detected after transfection of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and their transient expression into two hepatoma cell lines. The proximal promoter region (-324 to -15) was found to contain all the information necessary for tissue-specific expression. It is also involved in the negative gene modulation by glucocorticoids and includes an activating regulatory domain allowing efficient expression in the HepG2 cells. Three regions within 7 kilobase pairs of the 5' extragenic sequences are capable of stimulating the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity driven by the alpha-fetoprotein promoter sequence. One of these regions, at about -2.5 kilobase pairs, contains a short indivisible 170-base pair DNA element that fulfills all the criteria of a tissue-specific enhancer, i.e. orientation and position independence, as well as cell-specific stimulation of gene expression driven by a homologous or heterologous promoter. The enhancing properties of this element are totally abolished by glucocorticoids. DNase I footprinting experiments indicate that several rat liver nuclear proteins interact with this enhancer element."

https://openalex.org/W2247269551,"To decipher the intracellular targeting mechanism by which the major glycoprotein of peripheral nerve myelin, P0, is delivered to myelin after crush injury, as well as to the lysosome after permanent transection injury of the sciatic nerve--experimental paradigms characterized by the presence and absence of axonal regeneration and subsequent myelin assembly, respectively--the role of sulfation of P0 was investigated. P0 sulfation is shown to occur within the Golgi apparatus as a post-translational modification of the oligosaccharide chain which is dependent on processing beyond the action of mannosidase I. It is associated with myelination as observed during development and after crush injury, but does not occur after transection injury, even in the presence of the mannosidase II inhibitor, swainsonine, or the lysosomotrophic agent, L-methionine methyl ester. Although P0 accumulation can be demonstrated with both agents when other precursors are used (e.g. fucose, mannose, amino acids) and indicates lysosomal targeting and delivery of P0 after the action of GlcNAc transferase I, the absence of P0 sulfation after transection suggests that the lack of this modification may result in a default mechanism for lysosomal targeting after nerve transection. Lysosomal degradation of P0 was evaluated after crush injury by pulse-chase analyses with 35SO4 and [3H] mannose in the presence and absence of chlorate, an inhibitor of ATP-sulfarylase. Although P0 sulfation of the oligosaccharide chain is a stable modification whose labeling is dramatically inhibited by chlorate, no decrease in mannose-labeled P0 was seen with chlorate even with prolonged chase times. Because of this lack of degradation of mannose-labeled P0 in the presence of chlorate in the crushed nerve, it is concluded that the absence of P0 sulfation does not result in a default mechanism for lysosomal delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1557711824,"Glucagon stimulates flux through the glycine cleavage system (GCS) in isolated rat hepatocytes (Jois, M., Hall, B., Fewer, K., and Brosnan, J. T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3347-3351. In the present study, flux through GCS was measured in isolated rat liver perfused with 100 nM glucagon, 1 microM epinephrine, 1 microM norepinephrine, 10 microM phenylephrine, or 100 nM vasopressin. These hormones increased flux through GCS in perfused rat liver by 100-200% above the basal rate. The possibility that the stimulation of flux by adrenergic agonists and vasopressin is mediated by increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ which in turn could regulate mitochondrial glycine catabolism was examined by measuring flux through GCS in isolated mitochondria in the presence of 0.04-2.88 microM free Ca2+. Flux through GCS in isolated mitochondria was exquisitely sensitive to free Ca2+ in the medium; half-maximal stimulation occurred at about 0.4 microM free Ca2+ and maximal stimulation (7-fold) was reached when the free Ca2+ in the medium was 1 microM. The Vmax (nanomoles/mg protein/min) and Km (millimolar) values for the flux through GCS in intact mitochondria were 0.67 +/- 0.16 and 20.66 +/- 4.82 in the presence of 1 mM [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid and 3.28 +/- 0.76 and 10.98 +/- 1.91 in presence of 0.5 microM free Ca2+, respectively. The results show that the flux through GCS is sensitive to concentrations of calcium which would be achieved in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes stimulated by calcium-mobilizing hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1539467692,"We have shown previously that purified human erythropoietin rapidly alters the phosphorylation of an integral erythroid membrane protein, pp43 (Choi, H.-S., Wojchowski, D. M., and Sytkowski, A. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2933-2936). We have now purified pp43 to apparent homogeneity and have prepared antibodies to it. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer of membrane proteins to nitrocellulose, the antibodies identified pp43 and a series of higher molecular weight antigenically related proteins, up to 50 kDa, in erythropoietin-responsive Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells and in normal murine erythroid cells. Examination of purified subcellular fractions confirmed the localization of pp43 and the related proteins to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation with [gamma-32P]ATP demonstrated that, in contrast to pp43, these higher molecular weight proteins were not phosphorylated. Marked differences in both the abundance of pp43 and related proteins and the degree of erythropoietin-sensitive pp43 phosphorylation were found between the plasma membranes of Rauscher cells and those of non-responsive Friend murine erythroleukemia cells. In addition only trace amounts of a 50-kDa antigenically related protein and no phosphorylated pp43 were detected in the plasma membranes of two erythropoietin-insensitive human erythroid cells lines, K562 and HEL. The results suggest that the abundance and degree of phosphorylation of pp43 and the antigenically related proteins is strongly correlated with the erythropoietin responsiveness of the particular erythroid cell types."
