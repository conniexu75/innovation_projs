https://openalex.org/W4220765272,"The design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge1-5. Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications."

Tumor-associated macrophages, however, are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous. Specific subsets of tumor-associated macrophage might be endowed with distinct roles on cancer progression and antitumor immunity. Here, we identify a discrete population of FOLR2+ tissue-resident macrophages in healthy mammary gland and breast cancer primary tumors. FOLR2+ macrophages localize in perivascular areas in the tumor stroma, where they interact with CD8+ T cells. FOLR2+ macrophages efficiently prime effector CD8+ T cells ex vivo. The density of FOLR2+ macrophages in tumors positively correlates with better patient survival. This study highlights specific roles for tumor-associated macrophage subsets and paves the way for subset-targeted therapeutic interventions in macrophages-based cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4221135580,"Asymmetric localization of oskar ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules to the oocyte posterior is crucial for abdominal patterning and germline formation in the Drosophila embryo. We show that oskar RNP granules in the oocyte are condensates with solid-like physical properties. Using purified oskar RNA and scaffold proteins Bruno and Hrp48, we confirm in vitro that oskar granules undergo a liquid-to-solid phase transition. Whereas the liquid phase allows RNA incorporation, the solid phase precludes incorporation of additional RNA while allowing RNA-dependent partitioning of client proteins. Genetic modification of scaffold granule proteins or tethering the intrinsically disordered region of human fused in sarcoma (FUS) to oskar mRNA allowed modulation of granule material properties in vivo. The resulting liquid-like properties impaired oskar localization and translation with severe consequences on embryonic development. Our study reflects how physiological phase transitions shape RNA-protein condensates to regulate the localization and expression of a maternal RNA that instructs germline formation."
https://openalex.org/W4220721882,"Polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes strongly influence autoimmune disease risk. HLA risk alleles may influence thymic selection to increase the frequency of T cell receptors (TCRs) reactive to autoantigens (central hypothesis). However, research in human autoimmunity has provided little evidence supporting the central hypothesis. Here we investigated the influence of HLA alleles on TCR composition at the highly diverse complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), which confers antigen recognition. We observed unexpectedly strong HLA-CDR3 associations. The strongest association was found at HLA-DRB1 amino acid position 13, the position that mediates genetic risk for multiple autoimmune diseases. We identified multiple CDR3 amino acid features enriched by HLA risk alleles. Moreover, the CDR3 features promoted by the HLA risk alleles are more enriched in candidate pathogenic TCRs than control TCRs (for example, citrullinated epitope-specific TCRs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Together, these results provide genetic evidence supporting the central hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W4220777014,"Autolysosomes contain components from autophagosomes and lysosomes. The contents inside the autolysosomal lumen are degraded during autophagy, while the fate of autophagosomal components on the autolysosomal membrane remains unknown. Here we report that the autophagosomal membrane components are not degraded, but recycled from autolysosomes through a process coined in this study as autophagosomal components recycling (ACR). We further identified a multiprotein complex composed of SNX4, SNX5 and SNX17 essential for ACR, which we termed ‘recycler’. In this, SNX4 and SNX5 form a heterodimer that recognizes autophagosomal membrane proteins and is required for generating membrane curvature on autolysosomes, both via their BAR domains, to mediate the cargo sorting process. SNX17 interacts with both the dynein–dynactin complex and the SNX4–SNX5 dimer to facilitate the retrieval of autophagosomal membrane components. Our discovery of ACR and identification of the recycler reveal an important retrieval and recycling pathway on autolysosomes. Zhou and colleagues identify SNX4–SNX5–SNX17 as a multiunit complex that mediates the recycling of autophagosomal components from autolysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220832917,"Cytokines are powerful immune modulators that initiate signaling through receptor dimerization, but natural cytokines have structural limitations as therapeutics. We present a strategy to discover cytokine surrogate agonists by using modular ligands that exploit induced proximity and receptor dimer geometry as pharmacological metrics amenable to high-throughput screening. Using VHH and scFv to human interleukin-2/15, type-I interferon, and interleukin-10 receptors, we generated combinatorial matrices of single-chain bispecific ligands that exhibited diverse spectrums of functional activities, including potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by surrogate interferons. Crystal structures of IL-2R:VHH complexes revealed that variation in receptor dimer geometries resulted in functionally diverse signaling outputs. This modular platform enabled engineering of surrogate ligands that compelled assembly of an IL-2R/IL-10R heterodimer, which does not naturally exist, that signaled through pSTAT5 on T and natural killer (NK) cells. This ""cytokine med-chem"" approach, rooted in principles of induced proximity, is generalizable for discovery of diversified agonists for many ligand-receptor systems."
https://openalex.org/W4221035760,"Pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) provide an unprecedented opportunity to study human heart development and disease, but they are functionally and structurally immature. Here, we induce efficient human PSC-CM (hPSC-CM) maturation through metabolic-pathway modulations. Specifically, we find that peroxisome-proliferator-associated receptor (PPAR) signaling regulates glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in an isoform-specific manner. While PPARalpha (PPARa) is the most active isoform in hPSC-CMs, PPARdelta (PPARd) activation efficiently upregulates the gene regulatory networks underlying FAO, increases mitochondrial and peroxisome content, enhances mitochondrial cristae formation, and augments FAO flux. PPARd activation further increases binucleation, enhances myofibril organization, and improves contractility. Transient lactate exposure, which is frequently used for hPSC-CM purification, induces an independent cardiac maturation program but, when combined with PPARd activation, still enhances oxidative metabolism. In summary, we investigate multiple metabolic modifications in hPSC-CMs and identify a role for PPARd signaling in inducing the metabolic switch from glycolysis to FAO in hPSC-CMs."
https://openalex.org/W4220880337,"Abstract The activities of non-haematopoietic cells (NHCs), including mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial cells, in lymphomas are reported to underlie lymphomagenesis. However, our understanding of lymphoma NHCs has been hampered by unexplained NHC heterogeneity, even in normal human lymph nodes (LNs). Here we constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas of more than 100,000 NHCs collected from 27 human samples, including LNs and various nodal lymphomas, and it revealed 30 distinct subclusters, including some that were previously unrecognized. Notably, this atlas was useful for comparative analyses with lymphoma NHCs, which revealed an unanticipated landscape of subcluster-specific changes in gene expression and interaction with malignant cells in follicular lymphoma NHCs. This facilitates our understanding of stromal remodelling in lymphoma and highlights potential clinical biomarkers. Our study largely updates NHC taxonomy in human LNs and analysis of disease status, and provides a rich resource and deeper insights into LN and lymphoma biology to advance lymphoma management and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4221067768,"Chromosomal organization, scaling from the 147-base pair (bp) nucleosome to megabase-ranging domains encompassing multiple transcriptional units, including heritability loci for psychiatric traits, remains largely unexplored in the human brain. In this study, we constructed promoter- and enhancer-enriched nucleosomal histone modification landscapes for adult prefrontal cortex from H3-lysine 27 acetylation and H3-lysine 4 trimethylation profiles, generated from 388 controls and 351 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 739). We mapped thousands of cis-regulatory domains (CRDs), revealing fine-grained, 104-106-bp chromosomal organization, firmly integrated into Hi-C topologically associating domain stratification by open/repressive chromosomal environments and nuclear topography. Large clusters of hyper-acetylated CRDs were enriched for SCZ heritability, with prominent representation of regulatory sequences governing fetal development and glutamatergic neuron signaling. Therefore, SCZ and BD brains show coordinated dysregulation of risk-associated regulatory sequences assembled into kilobase- to megabase-scaling chromosomal domains."
https://openalex.org/W4221097152,"Spindle- or lemon-shaped viruses infect archaea in diverse environments. Due to the highly pleomorphic nature of these virions, which can be found with cylindrical tails emanating from the spindle-shaped body, structural studies of these capsids have been challenging. We have determined the atomic structure of the capsid of Sulfolobus monocaudavirus 1, a virus that infects hosts living in nearly boiling acid. A highly hydrophobic protein, likely integrated into the host membrane before the virions assemble, forms 7 strands that slide past each other in both the tails and the spindle body. We observe the discrete steps that occur as the tail tubes expand, and these are due to highly conserved quasiequivalent interactions with neighboring subunits maintained despite significant diameter changes. Our results show how helical assemblies can vary their diameters, becoming nearly spherical to package a larger genome and suggest how all spindle-shaped viruses have evolved from archaeal rod-like viruses."

The preventive strategies designed to minimize the virus transmission by remaining at home, being isolated, and keeping social distance, which would substantially reform people's lifestyle, physical activity, eating habits, etc. Consequently, those measures might create a disturbance in weight management and overweight. Therefore, how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the physical activities of individuals and its impacts on the Body Mass Index (BMI) is explored herein.An online-based cross-sectional study collected data from 338 Bangladeshi adults in November 2020. The questionnaire included socio-demographics, health-related variables, physical activity-related variables, and diet measurement. Inferential statistics (i.e., chi-square test, McNemar test) were used to measure the associations between BMI and studied variables with a consideration of two scenarios ('before' and 'during' the pandemic inception), where p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results showed that the prevalence of overweight was 30.5% 'before' the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased to 34.9% 'during' the pandemic; that means 4.4% of the participants significantly gained weight after the pandemic inception. There was no significant role of socio-demographic (e.g., gender, age, current residence, occupation) or physical activity-related factors (e.g., unavailability of outdoor space, not performing regular physical exercise, exercising with a partner) in changing the BMI status after the pandemic inception. However, following a proper diet plan during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed to decrease BMI status significantly.The present study suggests that a minor portion of the participants reported increasing their overweight status after the pandemic inception, whereas having a proper diet plan during the pandemic can significantly decrease BMI status. Therefore, the importance of the appropriate diet plan should be considered while implementing any policies."

The development of vaccines may offer a potential eradication of COVID-19. This study evaluated the general knowledge, attitude, and perception of COVID-19 vaccines in the Pakistani population.A self-reporting e-survey and questionnaire-based survey from vaccination centers of different cities of Pakistan among 502 participants were conducted. The questionnaire comprised four sections inquiring demographics, vaccination status, and perception or attitude towards the vaccine. Univariate logistic regression was applied to predict the knowledge, attitude and behavior of participants.The mean age of participants was 50.8±20.3 years. 53% of the participants have both doses of vaccine administered. Pain on the site of injection (49.8%) was the most common symptom, followed by asthenia (43.0%), muscle pain (29.5%), and swelling (24.5%) on the site of vaccine administration. Females complain of more symptoms than males. More severe symptoms were reported after the first dose of vaccine administration; these symptoms subsided within a week for most participants. Overall, the respondents have a positive attitude towards the vaccine. 47.4% are sure about the vaccine's efficacy, 48.6% said getting vaccinated was their own decision, and 79.9% also recommended others to get vaccinated.The study concluded that the Pakistani population has a positive attitude but inadequate knowledge towards COVID-19 vaccines. Immediate awareness and vaccination education programs should be conducted by the authorities to complete the mass vaccination schedule."

https://openalex.org/W4220920572,"Oral cancer (OC) poses a threat to human health and imposes a heavy burden on countries. We assessed the burden imposed by OC on Asian nations from 1990 to 2019 based on gender and age.We collected oral cancer data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study from 1990 to 2019 in 45 Asian countries and territories. Annual case data and age-standardised rates (ASRs) were used to investigate the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of OC based on age and gender from 1990 to 2019 in 45 Asian countries and territories. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to assess incidence rate, mortality, and trends in DALYs.The age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) of OC increased from 1990 to 2019 with an EAPC of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19-0.46), and the age-standardised death rate of OC remained stable at an EAPC of 0.08 (95%CI, from -0.06 to 0.21). The age-standardised DALYs of OC decreased at an EAPC of -0.16 (95%CI, from -0.30 to -0.02). The proportion of patients older than 70 years increased yearly in terms of incidence, mortality, and DALYs from 1990 to 2019. Of the DALYs, smoking was the main contributor in the Asian regions, and the largest contributor to DALYs in most Asian regions. Other contributors were alcohol use and chewing tobacco.Although the burden of OC was declining in Asia, South Asia remained the region with the highest burden. OC caused the greatest burden in Pakistan, Taiwan China, and India. Therefore, measures should be taken to reduce the burden of oral cancer in high-risk regions and countries with attributable risk factors."

This study investigated the changes in the characteristics and clinical outcomes of HCC patients in Korea.Patients initially diagnosed with HCC and treated at the National Cancer Center, Korea between 2000 and 2015 (n = 4,291) were followed up until February 2017. Differences in patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between chronological cohorts: cohort A (2000-2004, n = 1,157) vs. B (2005-2009, n = 1,678) vs. C (2010-2015, n = 1,456).The median age of the patient cohort was 57 years (range, 13-98 years), and male predominance was noted (81.6%). HBV infection was the most common etiology (74.8%). The proportion of patients diagnosed with good liver function and small tumors (<2 cm) increased significantly over time: 74.6%, 79.9%, and 87.4% for Child-Pugh class A (p<0.001) and 8.0%, 8.5%, and 12.0% for modified UICC stage I (p<0.001) in cohorts A, B, and C, respectively. Median overall survival improved significantly over time: 14.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0-16.8 months), 22.9 months (95% CI, 20.3-25.5 months), and 53.6 months (95% CI, 45.7-61.5 months) in cohorts A, B, and C, respectively. HBV-related patients showed significantly improved survival (12.7 vs. 20.4 vs. 64.5 months, p<0.001) associated with the use of antiviral treatments (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.80).The survival of patients with HCC, especially HBV-related HCC, has improved significantly over time in Korea."
https://openalex.org/W4220935908,"Background Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is controversial as a hemorrhage control adjunct due to lack of data with a suitable control group. We aimed to determine outcomes of trauma patients in shock undergoing REBOA versus no-REBOA. Methods This single-center, retrospective, matched cohort study analyzed patients ≥16 years in hemorrhagic shock without cardiac arrest (2000–2019). REBOA (R; 2015–2019) patients were propensity matched 2:1 to historic (H; 2000–2012) and contemporary (C; 2013–2019) groups. In-hospital mortality and 30-day survival were analyzed using chi-squared and log rank testing, respectively. Results A total of 102,481 patients were included (R = 57, C = 88,545, H = 13,879). Propensity scores were assigned using age, race, mechanism, lowest systolic blood pressure, lowest Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and body region Abbreviated Injury Scale scores to generate matched groups (R = 57, C = 114, H = 114). In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the REBOA group (19.3%) compared to the contemporary (35.1%; p = 0.024) and historic (44.7%; p = 0.001) groups. 30-day survival was significantly higher in the REBOA versus no-REBOA groups. Conclusion In a high-volume center where its use is part of a coordinated hemorrhage control strategy, REBOA is associated with improved survival in patients with noncompressible torso hemorrhage."

Maternal and neonatal tetanus occurs under improper hygiene practices during childbirth. Globally, an estimated 3.3 million newborn deaths occur every year, and about 9,000 babies die every day in the first 28 days of life. This study sought to identify risk factors associated with the immunization of rural women against tetanus in rural areas in ten East African countries.The data used in this study were taken from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of ten East African countries (Ethiopia, Burundi, Comoros, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Malawi, Ruanda, Tanzania, Uganda and, Zambia). Multivariable binary logistic regression is used to determine the risk factors associated with tetanus-protected women in east Africa.The weighted total samples of 73735 rural women were included in the analysis. The combined prevalence of tetanus immunization among protected rural women in ten East African countries was 50.4%. Those women with age of 24-34 (AOR = 0.778; 95%CI: 0.702-0.861), higher educational level (AOR = 4.010; 95%CI: 2.10-5.670), rich women (AOR = 3.097;95%CI: 2.680-3.583), mass media coverage (AOR = 1.143; 95%CI: 1.030-1.269), having above three antenatal care follow up (AOR = 1.550; 95% CI: 1.424-1.687), big problem of distance to health facility (AOR = 0.676; CI: 0.482-0.978) and place of delivery health facility (AOR = 1.103; 95% CI: 1.005-1.210) had a significant effect on women's protected from tetanus.The coverage of tetanus immunization in East Africa was very low. Public health programs target rural mothers who are uneducated, poor households, longer distances from health facilities, mothers who have the problem of media exposure, and mothers who have not used maternal health care services to promote TT immunization."
https://openalex.org/W4221095384,"There is growing evidence that mammalian cells deploy a mitochondria-associated metabolon called the purinosome to perform channeled de novo purine biosynthesis (DNPB). However, the molecular mechanisms of this substrate-channeling pathway are not well defined. Here, we present molecular evidence of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between the human bifunctional phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase/succinocarboxamide synthetase (PAICS) and other known DNPB enzymes. We employed two orthogonal approaches: bimolecular fluorescence complementation, to probe PPIs inside live, intact cells, and co-immunoprecipitation using StrepTag-labeled PAICS that was reintegrated into the genome of PAICS-knockout HeLa cells (crPAICS). With the exception of amidophosphoribosyltransferase, the first enzyme of the DNPB pathway, we discovered PAICS interacts with all other known DNPB enzymes and with MTHFD1, an enzyme which supplies the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate cofactor essential for DNPB. We show these interactions are present in cells grown in both purine-depleted and purine-rich conditions, suggesting at least a partial assembly of these enzymes may be present regardless of the activity of the DNPB pathway. We also demonstrate that tagging of PAICS on its C terminus disrupts these interactions and that this disruption is correlated with disturbed DNPB activity. Finally, we show that crPAICS cells with reintegrated N-terminally tagged PAICS regained effective DNPB with metabolic signatures of channeled synthesis, whereas crPAICS cells that reintegrated C-terminally tagged PAICS exhibit reduced DNPB intermediate pools and a perturbed partitioning of inosine monophosphate into AMP and GMP. Our results provide molecular evidence in support of purinosomes and suggest perturbing PPIs between DNPB enzymes negatively impact metabolite flux through this important pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4220930379,"Bees flying through natural landscapes frequently encounter physical challenges, such as wind and cluttered vegetation, but the influence of these factors on flight performance remains unknown. We analyzed 548 videos of wild-caught honeybees (Apis mellifera) flying through an enclosure containing a field of vertical obstacles that bees could choose to fly within (through open corridors, without maneuvering) or above. We varied obstacle field height and wind condition (still, headwinds or tailwinds), and examined how these factors affected bees' flight altitude, ground speed, and side-to-side casting motions (lateral excursions). When obstacle fields were short, bees flew at altitudes near the midpoint between the tunnel floor and ceiling. When obstacle fields approached or exceeded this midpoint, bees tended to increase their altitude, but they did not always avoid flying through obstacles, despite having the freedom to do so. Bees that flew above the obstacles exhibited 40% faster ground speeds and 36% larger lateral excursions than bees that flew within the obstacle fields. Wind did not affect flight altitude, but bees flew 12-19% faster in tailwinds, and their lateral excursions were 19% larger when flying in headwinds or tailwinds, as compared to still air. Our results show that bees flying through complex environments display flexibility in their route choices (i.e., flying above obstacles in some trials and through them in others), which affects their overall flight performance. Similar choices in natural landscapes could have broad implications for foraging efficiency, pollination, and mortality in wild bees."
https://openalex.org/W4220984724,"The purpose of this study was to analyse whether contextual (perception of motivational climate and positive and negative spontaneous self-talk in sports), personal (positivity) and situational variables (positive and negative spontaneous self-talk employed in competition and precompetitive anxiety) predict performance in a competition of ensembles of rhythmic gymnastics. 258 female gymnasts between ages14 and 20 (M = 15.24, SD = 1.46) participated in the study, completing pre- and post-competition measures. The results of the path-analysis showed that both the task-involving climate and positivity predicted positive self-talk in sport. This predicted self-confidence which, in turn, positively predicted positive situational self-talk in competition. For its part, the perception of an ego-involving climate positively predicted the use of both negative and positive self-talk in sport. Negative self-talk in sports predicted negative situational self-talk in competition and somatic and cognitive anxiety. In turn, cognitive anxiety positively predicted negative situational self-talk. Finally, performance was positively predicted by positive situational self-talk and negatively by negative situational self-talk. These results explain the functioning of spontaneous self-talk at different levels of generality and its relationship with sports performance."
https://openalex.org/W4220724182,"A growing body of literature highlights the increasing demand on college graduates to possess the problem finding, problem framing, and problem-solving skills necessary to address complex real-world challenges. Design thinking (DT) is an iterative, human-centered approach to problem solving that synthesizes what is desirable, equitable, technologically feasible, and sustainable. As universities expand efforts to train students with DT mindsets and skills, we must assess faculty and student DT practices and outcomes to better understand DT course experiences. Understanding how DT is taught and experienced within higher education can help schools promote student learning and align their training programs with professional, personal, and civic needs. In this study, surveys were completed by 19 faculty and 196 students from 23 courses at four universities. DT teaching and learning was characterized by three DT practices and five outcomes. Statistically significant differences were found by discipline of study and student type (i.e., graduate vs undergraduate), but not by gender or race/ethnicity. These results can be used to inform the development of classroom-based DT teaching and learning strategies across higher education institutions and disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W4220766166,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central energy sensor that coordinates the response to energy challenges to maintain cellular ATP levels. AMPK is a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic disorders, and several direct synthetic activators of AMPK have been developed that show promise in preclinical models of type 2 diabetes. These compounds have been shown to regulate AMPK through binding to a novel allosteric drug and metabolite (ADaM)-binding site on AMPK, and it is possible that other molecules might similarly bind this site. Here, we performed a high-throughput screen with natural plant compounds to identify such direct allosteric activators of AMPK. We identified a natural plant dihydrophenathrene, Lusianthridin, which allosterically activates and protects AMPK from dephosphorylation by binding to the ADaM site. Similar to other ADaM site activators, Lusianthridin showed preferential activation of AMPKβ1-containing complexes in intact cells and was unable to activate an AMPKβ1 S108A mutant. Lusianthridin dose-dependently increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in mouse primary hepatocytes, which led to a corresponding decrease in de novo lipogenesis. This ability of Lusianthridin to inhibit lipogenesis was impaired in hepatocytes from β1 S108A knock-in mice and mice bearing a mutation at the AMPK phosphorylation site of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1/2. Finally, we show that activation of AMPK by natural compounds extends to several analogs of Lusianthridin and the related chemical series, phenanthrenes. The emergence of natural plant compounds that regulate AMPK through the ADaM site raises the distinct possibility that other natural compounds share a common mechanism of regulation."

The causes of obesity are complex and are routed in health behaviours, environmental factors, government policy and the cultural and built environment. Consequently, a Whole System Approach (WSA) which considers the many causes of obesity and shifts the focus away from individuals as points of intervention and puts an emphasis on understanding and improving the system in which people live in is required. This protocol describes a programme of research that will: critically evaluate the evidence for WSAs; assess longitudinally the implementation of a WSA to diet and healthy weight to explore the range of levers (drivers) and opportunities to influence relevant partnerships and interventions to target obesity in East Scotland. The programme consists of four workstreams within a mixed methods framework: 1) Systematic review of reviews of WSAs to diet and healthy weight; 2) Longitudinal qualitative process evaluation of implementing two WSAs in Scotland; 3) Quantitative and Qualitative momentary analysis evaluation of a WSA; and 4) the application of System Dynamics Modelling (SDM) methodology to two council areas in Scotland. A Public Involvement in Research group (PIRg) have informed each stage of the research process.

https://openalex.org/W4220841755,"Ultrasound imaging is valuable for non-invasively estimating fascicle lengths and other features of pennate muscle, especially when performed computationally. Effective analysis techniques to date typically use optic flow to track displacements from image sequences, but are sensitive to integration drift for longer sequences. We here present an alternative algorithm that objectively estimates geometric features of pennate muscle from ultrasound images, without drift sensitivity. The algorithm identifies aponeuroses and estimates fascicle angles to derive fascicle lengths. Length estimates of human vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius fascicles in healthy subjects (N = 9 and N = 17 respectively) compared well (overall root-mean-square difference, RMSD = 0.52 cm) to manual estimates by independent observers (n = 3), with overall coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) of 0.98. Our tests yielded accuracy (CMC, RMSD) and processing speed similar to or exceeding that of state-of-the-art algorithms. The algorithm requires minimal manual intervention and can optionally extrapolate fascicle lengths that extend beyond the image frame. It thus facilitates automated analysis of ultrasound images without drift."
https://openalex.org/W4220930486,"WWP2 is a HECT E3 ligase that targets protein Lys residues for ubiquitination and is comprised of an N-terminal C2 domain, four central WW domains, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. The peptide segment between the middle WW domains, the 2,3-linker, is known to autoinhibit the catalytic domain, and this autoinhibition can be relieved by phosphorylation at Tyr369. Several protein substrates of WWP2 have been identified, including the tumor suppressor lipid phosphatase PTEN, but the full substrate landscape and biological functions of WWP2 remain to be elucidated. Here, we used protein microarray technology and the activated enzyme phosphomimetic mutant WWP2Y369E to identify potential WWP2 substrates. We identified 31 substrate hits for WWP2Y369E using protein microarrays, of which three were known autophagy receptors (NDP52, OPTN, and SQSTM1). These three hits were validated with in vitro and cell-based transfection assays and the Lys ubiquitination sites on these proteins were mapped by mass spectrometry. Among the mapped ubiquitin sites on these autophagy receptors, many had been previously identified in the endogenous proteins. Finally, we observed that WWP2 KO SH-SH5Y neuroblastoma cells using CRISPR-Cas9 showed a defect in mitophagy, which could be rescued by WWP2Y369E transfection. These studies suggest that WWP2-mediated ubiquitination of the autophagy receptors NDP52, OPTN, and SQSTM1 may positively contribute to the regulation of autophagy."

Invasive Nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS), corresponding to serotypes other than Typhi and Paratyphi, have emerged in sSA and pose a significant risk to public health. We conducted a whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis of 72 strains of Salmonella isolated from diarrheic human patients and chicken meat sold in multipurpose markets in Dakar, Senegal. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing combined with WGS data analysis revealed frequent resistance to fluoroquinolones and the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination that are among the most used treatments for invasive Salmonella. In contrast, resistance to the historical first-line drugs chloramphenicol and ampicillin, and to cephalosporins was rare. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was lower in clinical isolates compared to chicken strains pointing to the concern posed by the excessive use of antimicrobials in farming. Phylogenetic analysis suggested possible transmission of the emerging multidrug resistant (MDR) Kentucky ST198 and serotype Schwarzengrund from chicken to human. These results stress the need for active surveillance of Salmonella and AMR in order to address invasive salmonellosis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella strains and other important bacterial diseases in sSA."

The purpose of this study to know where to locate those stem cells during repair.Animal model of chronic rotator cuff tear was created in 24 rats. Adipose-derived stem cells were engineered as a sheet and transplanted 1) between a torn tendon and humerus (interposition group) or 2) over a repaired tendon-to-bone junction (overlay group) at the time of surgical repair. Tracking of stem cells with overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) were carried out at the time of sacrifice in additional 4 shoulders in each group. Histological and Biomechanical evaluation was performed to compare the differences in tendon-to-bone healing.Histology showed increased fibrocartilage, a clear boundary at the mineralized fibrocartilage, abundant collagen type III, and higher total scores, especially in the interposition group. GFP-overexpression was observed at the transplanted site at 2 weeks after repair. Although two groups where stem cell sheets applied showed higher load to failure than the repair-only group, the load to failure was not different between the interposition and overlay group.In the chronic rotator cuff repair model, stem cell sheets enhanced regeneration of the tendon-to-bone junction. This regeneration was effective when the stem cell sheet was interpositioned at the tendon-to-bone interface.Basic Science Study; In Vivo Animal Model; Histology and Biomechanics."
https://openalex.org/W4220787952,"Interindividual anatomical differences in the human cortex can lead to suboptimal current directions and may result in response variability of transcranial electrical stimulation methods. These differences in brain anatomy require individualized electrode stimulation montages to induce an optimal current density in the targeted area of each individual subject. We aimed to explore the possible modulatory effects of 140 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on the somatosensory cortex using personalized multi-electrode stimulation montages. In two randomized experiments using either tactile finger or median nerve stimulation, we measured by evoked potentials the plasticity aftereffects and oscillatory power changes after 140 Hz tACS at 1.0 mA as compared to sham stimulation (n = 17, male = 9). We found a decrease in the power of oscillatory mu-rhythms during and immediately after tactile discrimination tasks, indicating an engagement of the somatosensory system during stimulus encoding. On a group level both the oscillatory power and the evoked potential amplitudes were not modulated by tACS neither after tactile finger stimulation nor after median nerve stimulation as compared to sham stimulation. On an individual level we could however demonstrate that lower angular difference (i.e., differences between the injected current vector in the target region and the source orientation vector) is associated with significantly higher changes in both P20/N20 and N30/P30 source activities. Our findings suggest that the higher the directionality of the injected current correlates to the dipole orientation the greater the tACS-induced aftereffects are."
https://openalex.org/W4220791700,"Owing to its sustainability and environmentally friendliness, bacterial cellulose (BC) has received attention as a zero-waste textile material. Since the color of original BC was mostly yellowish white, a dyeing process is necessary to suggest BC as a textile. Thus, this study aimed to suggest a natural dyeing method using coffee to produce an eco-friendly coffee-dyed bacterial cellulose (BC-COF) bio-leather and to propose a reusing method as a dye adsorbent. To determine the dyeing and mordanting conditions with the highest color strength value, parameters such as dyeing temperature, time, mordanting methods were evaluated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that BC-COF was successfully colorized with coffee without changing its chemical and crystalline structures. In addition, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis confirmed that coffee molecules were successfully incorporated into fiber structures of BC. The effects of pH, concentration, temperature, and time on the adsorption of methylene blue dye using BC-COF bio-leather were also evaluated using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and zeta potential measurement. The results showed that BC-COF was found to be most effective when pH 6 of methylene blue solution with a concentration of 50 mg/L was adsorbed for 30 minutes at 25°C. Moreover, BC-COF could be reused for multiple times and had better dye adsorption rate compared to the original BC. From the results, it was confirmed that BC-COF could be employed as a dye adsorbent."
https://openalex.org/W4220806294,"As an important part of the second defense line of the power system, the Security and Stability Control System (SSCS) is of great significance to ensure the reliable operation of the power system. However, SSCS still lacks an effective security mechanism and is easily accessed by attackers, thus posing a threat to the stable and reliable operation of the power system. To tackle this issue, we propose a blockchain-based identity authentication scheme for Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) of SSCS. We first propose an identity authentication system model for IEDs and design the deployment of consortium chain nodes on IEDs, with architectural characteristics of SSCS and the working scenario of IEDs taken into consideration. The consortium chain is used to store credentials required for authentication, ensuring that they are tamper-proof. We combine IP address, port number and physical ID, and propose the unique identification of IEDs, with a data structure designed for the identification. We also propose a lightweight identity authentication method based on renewable hash chains, with hash chains used as one-time authentication passwords, and introduce a renewal mechanism of hash chains. Further, the detailed processes of registration and authentication phase are designed. Finally, the security analysis shows that our identity authentication scheme can resist various attacks, and the feasibility of our scheme is verified by experiments."

The study retrospectively reviewed patients with (2018 FIGO) stage IB3 and IIA2 cervical cancer who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by NACT-RS or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). The outcome measures were the 5-year survival and complication rates between the two groups. The median follow-up was 75 months. In total, 218 patients had stage IIA2, 136 patients had stage IB3, 201 patients received CCRT, and 153 patients received preoperative NACT-RS. In the CCRT group, the incidence of early complications (myelosuppression, gastrointestinal and urinary) was higher compared with that in the NACT-RS group (76.1 vs. 26.1%; p < 0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference between the two study groups concerning late complications. Five-year PFS was 79.9% and 85.5% in the NACT-RS and CCRT groups, respectively (p = 0.093). Five-year OS was 86.9% and 85.5% in the NACT-RS and CCRT groups, respectively (p = 0.97). In the multivariate clinicopathologic characteristics analysis for OS, initial tumor size > 4.3 cm (HR 5.11; p < 0.001), AC/ASC (HR 1.89; p = 0.02), histologic grade 2-3 (HR 2.25; p = 0.04), and 2018 FIGO stage IIA2 (HR 8.67; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors. The survival of patients with stage IB3 and IIA2 cervical cancer treated with NACT-RS was similar to that of patients treated with CCRT without increasing side effects."

Heat maps of tuberculosis case rates by neighborhood were created. Local indicators of spatial autocorrelation, Moran's I, were used to identify where in the study area spatial clusters and outliers of tuberculosis case rates were occurring. Age- and sex-stratified case rates were also assessed.We identified reports of 1,295 TB cases across 74 neighborhoods during the five-year study period, for an average annual rate of 124.2 reported TB cases per 100,000 population. In evaluating case rates by individual neighborhood, we identified a median rate of reported cases of 123.6 and a range from 0 to 800 cases per 100,000 population. Individuals aged 15-44 years old and men had higher case rates than other age groups and women. Locations of both hot and cold spots overlapped across age- and gender-specific maps.There is significant geographic heterogeneity in rates of reported TB cases and evident hot and cold spots within the study area. Characterization of the spatial distribution of these rates and local hot spots may be one practical tool to inform the work of local coalitions to target TB interventions in their zones."

This survey aimed to investigate current practice patterns of KM treatment for obesity among doctors.A questionnaire on clinical practice patterns of KM treatment for obesity was constructed and distributed to 21,788 KM doctors (KMDs). The questionnaire was consisted of respondent characteristics, state of treated patient, diagnosis, treatment, and usage pattern of herbal medicine for obesity.A total of 4.9% of KMDs (n = 1,084/21,788) validly completed the survey. Patients with Obesity Class I (25 ≤ Body mass index (BMI) ≤ 29.9) are the most common in KM clinics. Bioelectric impedance and KM Obesity Pattern Identification Questionnaire were routinely used for diagnosis. The average treatment duration was 4.16 weeks, and patients visited on an average 4.25 times per month for treatment. Herbal medicine is the most commonly used for obesity treatment by KMDs, and Taeeumjowui-tang was the most frequently prescribed. Ephedrae Herba, which is identified as the most used herbs for weight loss, was prescribed 5.18 ± 2.7 g/day at minimum and 10.06 ± 4.23 g/day at maximum. A total of 62.9% of responded KMDs had ever a patient with uncomfortable symptoms due to Ephedrae Herba use, neuropsychiatric events were the most common symptoms, followed by gastrointestinal events.Taken together, this study provides information on real clinical practice patterns of KM including patients, diagnosis, treatments, and herbal medicine for obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4221068308,"The psychological response to an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is significant and can negatively impact return to sports outcomes. This study aimed to quantify the association between factors associated with return to sport using network analysis.441 participants who underwent primary ACL reconstruction. The 12-item ACL Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale was administered to all participants 12 months after surgery. Three network analyses were used to quantify the adjusted correlations between the 12 items of the ACL-RSI scale, and to determine the centrality indices of each item (i.e., the degree of connection with other items in the network). Further subgroup network analyses were conducted for those who had (n = 115) and had not returned (n = 326) to their pre-injury level of sport.The greatest adjusted correlation was between Q7 and Q9 (fear of re-injury and afraid of accidentally injuring knee) of the ACL-RSI (group 0.48 (95%CI [0.40 to 0.57])) across all three networks. The most important item in the network was Q12 (relaxed about sport) across all three networks. Individuals who did return to sport had greater Strength centrality for Q8 (confidence in knee, P = 0.014) compared to those who did not return to sport.Fear of re-injury and being relaxed about playing sport were the two most important nodes in the network models that describe the return to sport readiness. The importance of knee confidence at influencing psychological readiness was greater in athletes who did return to sport compared to those who did not. Our findings provide candidate therapeutic targets that could inform future interventions designed to optimize return to sport rates in athletes post ACL reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W4221070890,"The advance selling (AS) has been widely applied in fresh industry for it can elevating the customer experience and increase flexibility thus profit for a retailer. However, the introduction of the AS will have an impact on spot market in pricing strategy, market share and the profit of the retailer. Hence, to coordinate the supply chain and improve the efficiency of the agricultural supply chain, a two-stage game theory model is constructed to analyze the effects of AS on three classic contracts: wholesale price, quantity discount and revenue-sharing contract. This paper also discusses the boundary conditions of whether a retailer should sell in advance. The conclusions of this paper are as follows: First, revenue-sharing contracts are superior to wholesale price and quantity discount contracts when retailers sell in advance, the wholesale price contract can perform better than the quantity discount contract in the presence of AS if the contract parameter is properly set. Second, a revenue-sharing contract that normally coordinates the supply chain can performs poorly when the retailer sells in advance that the social welfare would be higher if using a quantity discount contract instead. These conclusions have important implications for suppliers when retailers sell in advance. Such suppliers need to design appropriate contracts to distribute FAP that carefully take into consideration the AS activities in the market."
https://openalex.org/W4220808206,"The research of the Kaizer Hill site (the Hilltop and its Terraces), recognized as a Pre Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) quarry site, involved studies of the rock damage associated with the quarrying activities as well as of the recovered material remains, mostly chipped stone artifacts. We present here the results of our on-site explorations (excavations, surveys and surface-collections), focusing on the findings deriving from the Terraces. Diverse rock damage patterns were identified and described, portraying systematic rock mass-exploitation through quarrying fronts, natural rock joints and fissures enlargement, drilling and chiseling. There are multiple indications that the local bedrock (Bi'na Formation, Turonian) comprising flint and limestone was quarried under a systematic quality evaluation, leaving residual flint unsuitable for exploitation. Of interest to note that nearly all of the flint artifacts excavated and collected on the Terraces were made on raw material transported from the Hilltop (Mishash Formation, Campanian), knapped in-situ, on the quarried rock surfaces of the slopes. The flint tools bear witness to intensive use involving mainly boring and drilling. The dominant tool type is the flint axe for which a variety of waste products related to its production were found in-situ, enabling the reconstruction of axe reduction sequence. Similar axes and waste products were found in many PPN sites indicating that there was a common, widely-used scheme of making flint axes during the PPN. Interestingly, besides the flint waste, there were also limestone waste products typical of the last shaping and thinning stages of axe production, indicating that limestone axes were shaped technologically similar to the flint ones, contrary to what has been assumed before. Rare findings, such as obsidian pieces, originating from much further a-field indicate ties with other PPN communities, near and/or far. Overall, this study provides unique and novel insights on Levantine PPN lifeways."
https://openalex.org/W4220900648,"Botswana, like other Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries is currently undergoing demographic and epidemiological transitions which are shown by an increase in chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their associated risk factors. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of and factors associated with hypertension, diabetes and stroke/heart attack multimorbidity in Botswana. The definition of multimorbidity used in this study is the presence of two or more NCDs in an individual.This study used secondary data derived from the Botswana WHO STEPS 2014 survey. The survey employed a nationally representative multi-stage sampling design. The study sample consisted of 3527 respondents aged 20-69 years of age who had successfully completed the questionnaire and met the inclusion criteria. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess factors associated with multimorbidity. All comparisons were considered to be statistically significant at 5% level. Statistical tests were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and stroke/heart attack multimorbidity was estimated to be at 3.5% in the sampled population. The odds of reporting multimorbidity were highest among females (AOR = 9.73, 95% CI = 8.30-11.42) than males and among respondents aged 35-49 (AOR = 1.20, 95% C.I. = 1.10-1.31) and 50-69 years (AOR = 1.52, 95% C.I. = 1.23-1.67) than individuals aged 20-24 years. Moreover, the odds of multimorbidity were significantly higher among married (AOR = 15.92, 95% C.I. = 13.40-18.92) and living together (AOR = 6.68, 95% C.I. = 5.72-7.81) couples; and individuals who reported that they earn an average annual household income of BWP ≥20 000 (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.84-2.75) compared to their counterparts. Behavioural risk factors significantly associated with higher odds of multimorbidity were obesity (AOR = 6.79, 95% C.I. = 6.20-7.90), physical inactivity (AOR = 4.41, 95% C.I. = 3.65-5.31) and hazardous alcohol consumption (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.23-1.81). On the other hand the odds of reporting multimorbidity were significantly low among individuals with sufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables (AOR = 0.47, 95% C.I. = 0.39-0.56) and non-tobacco users (AOR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.49-0.68).Multimorbidity was more common among females, the elderly people and was associated with obesity, poor fruit and vegetable intake, and tobacco use. Strategies to combat NCDs and multimorbidity should be aimed to target early stages of life since behavioural factors and lifestyles that increase the likelihood of disease are entrenched in earlier stages of life."
https://openalex.org/W4220959038,"Exudation by fine roots generally varies with their morphological traits, but the effect of belowground resource availability on the root exudation via root morphological traits and biomass remains unknown. We aimed to determine the effects of morphological and physiological traits on root exudation rates and to estimate stand-scale exudation (Estand) by measuring the mass, length, and surface area of fine roots in a Moso bamboo forest. We measured root exudation as well as morphological and physiological traits in upper and lower plots on a slope with different belowground resource availability. The mean (± S.D.) root exudation rates per mass in the upper and lower slope were 0.049 ± 0.047 and 0.040 ± 0.059 mg C g-1 h-1, respectively, which were in the range of exudation found in woody forest ecosystems. We observed significant relationships between root exudation per mass and root respiration, as well as specific root length and surface area. In contrast, exudation per length and area did not correlate with morphological traits. The morphological traits did not differ between slope positions, resulting in no significant difference in root exudation per mass. Fine root biomass, length, and surface area on a unit ground basis were much higher in the lower than those in the upper slope positions. Estand was higher when estimated by mass than by length and area because the morphological effect on exudation was ignored when scaled using mass. Estand was 1.4-2.0-fold higher in the lower than that in upper slope positions, suggesting that the scaling parameters of mass, length, and area determined the Estand estimate more than the exudation rate per mass, length, and area. Regardless of scaling, Estand was much higher in the Moso bamboo forest than in other forest ecosystems because of a large fine-root biomass."

We retrospectively compared the clinical features and treatment of OGIB cases, with or without active small bowel bleeding (n = 173), with other cases (n = 247). Patient sex, age, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure histories were matched for the analysis.The male/female ratio was 247/173 and the average age was 51.54 years. In multivariate analysis, the use of direct oral anticoagulants was significant (P = 0.016), and vascular lesions (P = 0.018) were observed in OGIB cases. When OGIB cases with and without active small bowel bleeding were compared, serum albumin level was lower in cases with active bleeding (P = 0.031). When treatment of OGIB cases were compared, those without vascular lesions could be treated conservatively (P = 0.0047). In the 1:1 propensity score matching analysis, serum creatinine level was elevated in cases of active bleeding (P = 0.029), and cases without vascular lesions were treated conservatively (P = 0.010).Use of direct oral anticoagulants is frequently associated with OGIB.

https://openalex.org/W4220837198,"Traditional blood sampling by venipuncture is cumbersome and relatively expensive. Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is desirable because of its ease of sample collection, transportation and storage. It has been used in clinical diagnosis but not been thoroughly studied for the potential use to assess the immune status of individuals following natural infection or preventive vaccination. The goal of this study was to compare DBS to traditional blood samplings in detection of antibodies in individuals vaccinated against measles, hepatitis A, tetanus, influenza and varicella zoster. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test DBS eluates and serum samples for antibodies against measles, varicella, tetanus and hepatitis A. Sensitivities, specificities, and correlation coefficients were evaluated to compare optical density (OD) values of paired serum and DBS samples. The long-term stability of DBS samples at different temperatures was assessed using simulated immune measles blood. DBS OD was highly correlated with serum OD for antibodies to measles (r = 0.93), varicella (r = 0.82), and tetanus (r = 0.91). Sensitivities of DBS OD ranged from 86-99% and specificities ranged from 96-100% using cut-offs established by each assay. By contrast, the hepatitis A data showed a low sensitivity (31%) and weak correlation (r = 0.14) between DBS and serum samples. Antibody titers in serum samples for anti-influenza A (H1N1 and H3N1) failed to correlate in DBS eluates in HAI and MN assays. DBS samples were stable for 4 weeks when stored at room temperature and for 6 months at 4°C. DBS sampling was sensitive, specific, and highly correlated with traditional venipuncture sampling in detection of antibodies against measles, tetanus and varicella zoster, but not hepatitis A and influenza. Thus, the success of using DBS sampling to assess the antibody levels in immunized individuals may be dependent on the pathogens and the development of the assay used."
https://openalex.org/W4220898213,"Municipalities have been trying to involve citizens as citizen participation is thought to improve municipalities' accountability, the quality of services, and to align policies and services to communities' needs. This study examined citizens' participation preferences in policymaking by investigating their health policy priorities, expectations of involvement, and required support.For this case-study the realist evaluation approach was applied to focus groups with citizens and to a workshop with a local panel consisting of professionals, citizens and citizen representatives.This study showed that citizens want to be involved in (health) policymaking with the aim of improving their communities' quality of life and living environment and prioritised local services and amenities (e.g. suitable housing, public transport, health and care services). Instead, professionals' priorities were focussed on singular public health issues related to prevention and lifestyle factors. The results also show that citizens felt responsible for driving citizen participation and representing community needs to the municipality, but needed the municipality to improve their communication and accessibility in order to do so successfully. Furthermore, the professionals on the panel indicated that they needed training on how to reach out to citizens. Such training should highlight how to better align their language to citizens' lived experiences. They also wanted their organisations to provide more space, flexibility and resources to build relationships with citizens in order to provide improved communication and accessibility to citizens.The difference in priorities between citizens and professionals highlights the importance of involving citizens in policymaking. Moreover, citizens' involvement can act as a lever for change to bring a wider range of services and policy sectors together and has the potential to better align policies to citizens' lived experiences and hopefully increase the democratic legitimacy of policymaking. However, to fulfil such potential municipalities will need to invest in improving their accessibility and communication with communities."

We assayed genetic data for 327 samples collected during 1999-2015 from the Carlyle Lake study area across 21 microsatellite loci. We found hibernacula formed distinct genetic clusters corresponding to the three main study areas (Dam Recreation Areas, Eldon Hazlet State Park, and South Shore State Park). Genetic structuring and low estimates of dispersal indicated that connectivity among these study areas is limited and each is demographically independent. Hibernacula exhibited moderate levels of heterozygosity (0.60-0.73), but estimates of effective population size (5.2-41.0) were low and track census sizes generated via long-term mark-recapture data. Hibernacula at Carlyle Lake, which represent the only Eastern Massasauga remaining in Illinois, are vulnerable to future loss of genetic diversity through lack of gene flow as well as demographic and environmental stochastic processes. Our work highlights the need to include population-level genetic data in recovery planning and suggests that recovery efforts should focus on managing the three major study areas as separate conservation units in order to preserve and maintain long-term adaptive potential of these populations. Specific management goals should include improving connectivity among hibernacula, maintaining existing wet grassland habitat, and minimizing anthropogenic sources of mortality caused by habitat management (e.g., mowing, prescribed fire) and recreational activities. Our molecular study provides additional details about demographic parameters and connectivity at Carlyle Lake that can be used to guide recovery of Eastern Massasauga in Illinois and throughout its range."
https://openalex.org/W4220704679,"Staphylococcus aureus employs a multitude of immune-evasive tactics to circumvent host defenses including the complement system, a component of innate immunity central to controlling bacterial infections. With antibiotic resistance becoming increasingly common, there is a dire need for novel therapies. Previously, we have shown that S. aureus binds the complement regulator factor H (FH) via surface protein SdrE to inhibit complement. To address the need for novel therapeutics and take advantage of the FH:SdrE interaction, we examined the effect of a fusion protein comprised of the SdrE-interacting domain of FH coupled with IgG Fc on complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis and bacterial killing of community associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus. S. aureus bound significantly more FH-Fc compared to Fc-control proteins and FH-Fc competed with serum FH for S. aureus binding. FH-Fc treatment increased C3-fragment opsonization of S. aureus for both C3b and iC3b, and boosted generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a. In 5 and 10% serum, FH-Fc treatment significantly increased S. aureus killing by polymorphonuclear cells. This anti-staphylococcal effect was evident in 75% (3/4) of clinical isolates tested. This study demonstrates that FH-Fc fusion proteins have the potential to mitigate the protective effects of bound serum FH rendering S. aureus more vulnerable to the host immune system. Thus, we report the promise of virulence-factor-targeted fusion-proteins as an avenue for prospective anti-staphylococcal therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W4220799303,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional cytokine that promotes neurogenesis and neuroprotection. MIF is predominantly expressed in astrocytes in the brain. The serum MIF level and microsatellites/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MIF gene promoter region are known to be associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). Interestingly, previous studies reported that hypoxia, an environmental risk factor for SCZ, induced MIF expression through binding of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the MIF promoter.We investigated the involvement of MIF in SCZ while focusing on the HIF pathway. First, we conducted an association study of the SNP rs17004038 (C>A) in the HRE of the MIF promoter between 1758 patients with SCZ and 1507 controls. Next, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on MIF expression in primary cultured astrocytes derived from neonatal mice forebrain.SNP rs17004038 was significantly associated with SCZ (p = 0.0424, odds ratio = 1.445), indicating that this SNP in the HRE of the MIF promoter was a genetic risk factor for SCZ. Hypoxia induced MIF mRNA expression and MIF protein production and increased HIF-1 binding to the MIF promoter, while the activity of the MIF promoter was suppressed by mutations in the HRE and by deletion of the HRE in astrocytes.These results suggest that SNP rs17004038 in the HRE of the MIF promoter was significantly associated with SCZ and may be involved in the pathophysiology of SCZ via suppression of hypoxia and HIF pathway-induced MIF expression."
https://openalex.org/W4221112933,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with defective pancreatic β-cell adaptation in pregnancy, but the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Our previous studies demonstrated that GDM women display increased plasma adrenomedullin (ADM) levels, and non-obese GDM mice show decreased serum concentrations of insulin and the number of β-cells in pancreas islets. The aims of this study is to examine if ADM and its receptors are expressed in female mouse pancreas, and if so, whether insulin secretion is regulated by ADM in mouse β-cell line, NIT-1 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. Present study shows that ADM and its receptor components CRLR, RAMPs are present in mouse pancreatic islets and co-localized with insulin. The expressions of ADM, CRLR and RAMP2 in islets from pregnant mice are reduced compared to that of non-pregnant mice. NIT-1-β cells express ADM and its receptor mRNA, and glucose dose-dependently stimulates expressions. Furthermore, ADM inhibits NIT-1-β cell growth, and this inhibition is reversed by ADM antagonist, ADM22-52. The glucose-induced insulin secretion was suppressed by ADM in NIT-1-β cells and isolated pancreatic islets from pregnant mice. These inhibitory effects are accompanied by upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress biomarker genes in NIT-1-β cells. This study unveils that reduced ADM and its receptors may play a role in β-cell adaptation during pregnancy, while increased plasma ADM in GDM may contribute to the β-cells dysfunction, and blockade of ADM may reverse β-cell insulin production."
https://openalex.org/W4221119881,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer in the United States, affecting one million people per year. Patients with aggressive disease have limited treatment options and high mortality, highlighting the need to identify new biomarkers linked to poor clinical outcome. HRAS mutations are found in skin papillomas and cSCCs and increase in frequency when MAP3K family members are inhibited, suggesting a link between blockade of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and initiation of RAS-primed cells. Tpl2 , a MAP3K gene, can serve as a tumor suppressor gene in cSCC. We have previously shown that upon Tpl2 ablation, mice have heightened sensitivity to aberrant RAS signaling. Tpl2 -/- mice display significantly higher numbers of papillomas and cSCCs in two-stage chemical carcinogenesis studies and increased tumorigenicity of keratinocytes expressing oncogenic v-ras Ha in nude mouse skin grafts. In part, this is mediated through increased mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) receptor activity. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is reported to be an essential factor for MET-driven carcinogenesis and MET activation may confer resistance to EGFR therapies, suggesting that the concurrent use of both an EGFR inhibitor and a MET inhibitor may show promise in advanced cSCCs. In this study we assessed whether normal or Ras-transformed Tpl2 -/- keratinocytes have aberrant EGFR signaling and whether concomitant treatment with EGFR/MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors was more effective than single agents in reducing growth and angiogenic potential of Ras-transformed keratinocytes. Tpl2 -/- keratinocytes exhibited increased HER-2 and STAT-3 under basal conditions and elevated p-MET and p-EGFR when transduced with oncogenic RAS. Inhibition of MET by Capmatinib increased p-EGFR in Tpl2 -/- keratinocytes and papillomas, and inhibition of EGFR by Gefitinib increased HER2 and HER3 signaling in both genotypes. Treatment of keratinocytes with EGFR and MET inhibitors, in combination, significantly enhanced endothelial tube formation, MMP-9 activity and activation of other RTKs, with more pronounced effects when Tpl2 was ablated. These data indicate that Tpl2 cross-talks with both EGFR and MET signaling pathways. Upon inhibition of EGFR/MET signaling, a myriad of escape mechanisms exists in keratinocytes to overcome targeted drug effects."
https://openalex.org/W4221135220,"Objective Food safety and nutrition during pregnancy are important concerns related to fetal brain development. In the present study, we aimed to explore the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA ω-3) on exogenous sodium nitrite intervention-induced fetal brain injury in pregnant rats. Methods During pregnancy, rats were exposed to water containing sodium nitrite (0.05%, 0.15%, and 0.25%) to establish a fetal rat brain injury model. Inflammatory factors and oxidative stress levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or flow cytometry. Subsequently, animals were divided into three groups: control, model, and 4% PUFA ω-3. Pregnancy outcomes were measured and recorded. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were utilized to observe brain injury. ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were adopted to measure the levels of inflammatory factors, the NRF1/HMOX1 signaling pathway, and mitochondrial and oxidative stress damage. Results With the increase of sodium nitrite concentration, the inflammatory factors and oxidative stress levels increased. Therefore, the high dose group was set as the model group for the following experiments. After PUFA ω-3 treatment, the fetal survival ratio, average body weight, and brain weight were elevated. The cells in the PUFA ω-3 group were more closely arranged and more round than the model. PUFA ω-3 treatment relieved inflammatory factors, oxidative stress levels, and mitochondria damage while increasing the indicators related to brain injury and NRF1/HMOX1 levels. Conclusions Sodium nitrite exposure during pregnancy could cause brain damage in fetal rats. PUFA ω-3 might help alleviate brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage, possibly through the NRF1/HMOX1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, appropriately reducing sodium nitrite exposure and increasing PUFA omega-3 intake during pregnancy may benefit fetal brain development. These findings could further our understanding of nutrition and health during pregnancy."
