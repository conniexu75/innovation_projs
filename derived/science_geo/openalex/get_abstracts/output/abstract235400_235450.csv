https://openalex.org/W2064036807,"Premature termination codons induce rapid transcript degradation in eukaryotic cells through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)1,2. This pathway can modulate phenotypes arising from nonsense or frameshift mutations, but little is known about the physiologic role of NMD in higher eukaryotes. To address this issue, we examined expression profiles in mammalian cells depleted of Rent1 (also called hUpf1), a factor essential for NMD3,4. Upregulated transcripts included those with upstream open reading frames in the 5′ untranslated region, alternative splicing that introduces nonsense codons or frameshifts, introns in the 3′ untranslated region or selenocysteine codons. Transcripts derived from ancient transposons and endogenous retroviruses were also upregulated. These RNAs are unified by the presence of a spliced intron at least 50 nucleotides downstream of a termination codon, a context sufficient to initiate NMD5. Consistent with direct regulation by NMD, representative upregulated transcripts decayed more slowly in cells deficient in NMD. In addition, inhibition of NMD induced by amino acid starvation upregulated transcripts that promote amino acid homeostasis. These results document that nonsense surveillance is a crucial post-transcriptional regulatory event that influences the expression of broad classes of physiologic transcripts, has been functionally incorporated into essential homeostatic mechanisms and suppresses expression of evolutionary remnants."
https://openalex.org/W2000928657,"The arrival of humans on oceanic islands has precipitated a wave of extinctions among the islands' native birds. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this extinction event varies markedly between avifaunas. We show that the probability that a bird species has been extirpated from each of 220 oceanic islands is positively correlated with the number of exotic predatory mammal species established on those islands after European colonization and that the effect of these predators is greater on island endemic species. In contrast, the proportions of currently threatened species are independent of the numbers of exotic mammalian predator species, suggesting that the principal threat to island birds has changed through time as species susceptible to exotic predators have been driven extinct."
https://openalex.org/W2087728854,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength, the most established cellular model of information storage in the brain, is expressed by an increase in the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. However, the source of AMPA receptors mobilized during LTP is unknown. We report that AMPA receptors are transported from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane for LTP. Stimuli that triggered LTP promoted not only AMPA receptor insertion but also generalized recycling of cargo and membrane from endocytic compartments. Thus, recycling endosomes supply AMPA receptors for LTP and provide a mechanistic link between synaptic potentiation and membrane remodeling during synapse modification."
https://openalex.org/W2127053639,"DNA microarrays are widely used to study changes in gene expression in tumors, but such studies are typically system-specific and do not address the commonalities and variations between different types of tumor. Here we present an integrated analysis of 1,975 published microarrays spanning 22 tumor types. We describe expression profiles in different tumors in terms of the behavior of modules, sets of genes that act in concert to carry out a specific function. Using a simple unified analysis, we extract modules and characterize gene-expression profiles in tumors as a combination of activated and deactivated modules. Activation of some modules is specific to particular types of tumor; for example, a growth-inhibitory module is specifically repressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and may underlie the deregulated proliferation in these cancers. Other modules are shared across a diverse set of clinical conditions, suggestive of common tumor progression mechanisms. For example, the bone osteoblastic module spans a variety of tumor types and includes both secreted growth factors and their receptors. Our findings suggest that there is a single mechanism for both primary tumor proliferation and metastasis to bone. Our analysis presents multiple research directions for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2109793046,"The correct timing of flowering is essential for plants to maximize reproductive success and is controlled by environmental and endogenous signals. We report that nitric oxide (NO) repressed the floral transition in Arabidopsis thaliana . Plants treated with NO, as well as a mutant overproducing NO ( nox1 ), flowered late, whereas a mutant producing less NO ( nos1 ) flowered early. NO suppressed CONSTANS and GIGANTEA gene expression and enhanced FLOWERING LOCUS C expression, which indicated that NO regulates the photoperiod and autonomous pathways. Because NO is induced by environmental stimuli and constitutively produced, it may integrate both external and internal cues into the floral decision."

The genome includes a 45âkilobase pair element that can exist in chromosomal and episomal forms, selective expansions of important gene families, genes for unexpected metabolic pathways, and previously unknown candidate virulence determinants. We highlight the genes that may account for Legionella 's ability to survive in protozoa, mammalian macrophages, and inhospitable environmental niches and that may define new therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W2050412627,"The current paper demonstrates that cholesterol and its hydroxylated derivative, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), inhibit cholesterol synthesis by two different mechanisms, both involving the proteins that control sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), membrane-bound transcription factors that activate genes encoding enzymes of lipid synthesis. Using methyl-β-cyclodextrin as a delivery vehicle, we show that cholesterol enters cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and elicits a conformational change in SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), as revealed by the appearance of a new fragment in tryptic digests. This change causes SCAP to bind to Insigs, which are endoplasmic reticulum retention proteins that abrogate movement of the SCAP·SREBP complex to the Golgi apparatus where SREBPs are normally processed to their active forms. Direct binding of cholesterol to SCAP in intact cells was demonstrated by showing that a photoactivated derivative of cholesterol cross-links to the membrane domain of SCAP. The inhibitory actions of cholesterol do not require the isooctyl side chain or the Δ5-double bond of cholesterol, but they do require the 3β-hydroxyl group. 25-HC is more potent than cholesterol in eliciting SCAP binding to Insigs, but 25-HC does not cause a detectable conformational change in SCAP. Moreover, a photoactivated derivative of 25-HC does not cross-link to SCAP. These data imply that cholesterol interacts with SCAP directly by inducing it to bind to Insigs, whereas 25-HC works indirectly through a putative 25-HC sensor protein that elicits SCAP-Insig binding. The current paper demonstrates that cholesterol and its hydroxylated derivative, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), inhibit cholesterol synthesis by two different mechanisms, both involving the proteins that control sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), membrane-bound transcription factors that activate genes encoding enzymes of lipid synthesis.

These data imply that cholesterol interacts with SCAP directly by inducing it to bind to Insigs, whereas 25-HC works indirectly through a putative 25-HC sensor protein that elicits SCAP-Insig binding. Nearly 30 years ago, during early studies of feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in cultured cells, it was noted that oxygenated sterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol were more than 50-fold more potent than cholesterol in reducing the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (1Kandutsch A.A.

These experiments were conducted by dissolving sterols in ethanol and adding them to protein-containing aqueous culture media in which cholesterol forms an amorphous suspension and thus has poor access to the interior of the cell. When cholesterol was delivered to cells in low density lipoprotein (LDL), 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; 25-HC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; photo 25-HC, 6-azi-5α-cholestan-3β,25-diol; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; OSBP, oxysterol-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; photocholesterol, 6-azi-5α-cholestan-3β-ol; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TM, transmembrane helix; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HSV, herpes simplex virus. a physiologic carrier that enters cells through LDL receptors, the ability of cholesterol to suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was enhanced (5Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, when methods were devised to reconstitute LDL with sterol esters, it was observed that 25-hydroxycholesterol was only about 5-fold more potent than cholesterol when both sterol esters were reconstituted into LDL and delivered through LDL receptors (6Krieger M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5052-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The question of whether cholesterol itself is a regulator or whether it must be converted to an oxygenated metabolite, like 25-hydroxycholesterol, remained unresolved (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). In view of this ambiguity, studies of feedback regulation in our laboratory have generally used a mixture of cholesterol and 25-hydroxy-cholesterol in a 10:1 molar ratio added in ethanol. In recent years the mechanism of sterol feedback regulation at the transcriptional level has been elucidated, but the issue of 25-hydroxycholesterol versus cholesterol as a physiologic regulator remains unsettled. Transcriptional regulation is mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), a three-member family of membrane-bound transcription factors (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domains of SREBPs are transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper variety. This domain is followed by a membrane attachment domain consisting of two transmembrane helices, which is followed by a COOH-terminal regulatory domain. SREBPs are oriented in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in a hairpin fashion with their NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains facing the cytosol. Immediately after synthesis, SREBPs form a complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic ER protein with eight membrane-spanning helices. In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts its bound SREBP to the Golgi apparatus where the SREBP is processed sequentially by two membrane-embedded proteases that release the NH2-terminal domain so that it can enter the nucleus where it activates transcription of the gene encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and more than 30 other genes whose products are necessary for lipid synthesis (9Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). When 25-hydroxycholesterol is delivered to cells in ethanol or when cholesterol is delivered in LDL, SCAP becomes trapped in the ER. The bound-SREBP is no longer carried to the Golgi apparatus, and the NH2-terminal domain cannot enter the nucleus (11Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). As a result, transcription of the lipid biosynthetic genes declines. Retention of the SCAP·SREBP complex in the ER is mediated by the sterol-induced binding of SCAP to Insigs, which are resident proteins of the ER membrane (11Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Cultured cells express two Insig isoforms, designated Insig-1 and Insig-2, that are closely related in amino acid sequence and have the same membrane topology (13Feramisco J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 8487-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When mixtures of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol are added to cultured cells, SCAP is induced to bind to Insig-1 and Insig-2, as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and by detection of the complex by blue native gel electrophoresis (11Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 12Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Mutant forms of SCAP harboring any one of three point mutations fail to bind Insig-1 and Insig-2, and thus they constitutively transport SREBPs to the Golgi even in the presence of sterols (11Yang T.

Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which cholesterol regulates SCAP·Insig binding was disclosed recently by studies demonstrating that SCAP directly binds cholesterol (15Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.-P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and thereby undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to Insigs (16Adams C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In one set of experiments, we isolated sealed ER membrane vesicles from cholesterol-depleted cells, taking advantage of the observation that cholesterol can be solubilized by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) in a form that allows it to partition into membranes (17Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). We incubated the cholesterol-depleted membranes with cholesterol·MCD complexes and then digested them with trypsin. The digests were subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted with an antibody against the luminal loop that lies between transmembrane segments 7 and 8 of SCAP (18Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In membranes from sterol-depleted cells, trypsin cut at arginines 496 and 747, generating a fragment of 37 kDa. When the membranes were treated with cholesterol·MCD, a previously sequestered arginine at position 503 was exposed, and trypsin cleavage gave a smaller product of 35 kDa (16Adams C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This cholesterol-induced conformational change in SCAP was enhanced when cells expressed excess Insigs, and this increase was not seen with the sterol-resistant SCAP mutants that do not bind Insigs (16Adams C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The suggestion that this conformational change reflects direct binding of cholesterol to SCAP was supported strongly by the recent finding that the purified, detergent-solubilized membrane domain of SCAP binds [3H]cholesterol with stereospecificity and saturation kinetics (15Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.-P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Competition experiments revealed that binding required the 3β-hydroxyl group of cholesterol, but it did not require the side chain (15Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.-P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although the above-cited studies provide a mechanism for feedback regulation by cholesterol, they raise questions about whether 25-hydroxycholesterol acts by the same mechanism. Indeed, in the direct binding studies, SCAP failed to bind 25-hydroxycholesterol (15Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.-P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Moreover, 25-hydroxycholesterol did not induce a conformational change in SCAP when added to membranes in vitro (16Adams C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we use a variety of methods to demonstrate that cholesterol acts in intact cells by binding to SCAP and inducing a conformational change, whereas 25-hydroxycholesterol neither binds nor induces a conformational change. Nevertheless, both sterol regulators block SREBP processing by inducing SCAP to bind to Insig. These studies strongly suggest that cells must contain another protein that recognizes 25-hydroxy-cholesterol and thereby induces SCAP to bind to Insigs. Materials—We obtained sterols from Steraloids, Inc.; MCD and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc.; trypsin (type 1 from bovine pancreas), soybean trypsin inhibitor, chymotrypsin, and Triton X-100 from Sigma; peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) from New England Biolabs, Inc.; Nonidet P-40 Alternative from Calbiochem; and FuGENE 6 reagent from Roche Applied Science.

Chemical Syntheses—6-Azi-5α-cholestan-3β-ol (photocholesterol) was prepared from 6-keto-5α-cholestan-3β-ol as previously described (22Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). 6-Azi-5α-cholestan-3β,25-diol (photo 25-hydroxycholesterol) was prepared similarly from 6-keto-5α-cholestan-3β,25-diol. The latter compound was prepared by a modification of the method of Tavares et al. (23Tavares R. Randoux T. Braekman J.-C. Daloze D. Tetrahedron. 1993; 49: 5079-5090Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief, 25-HC (1 g) was treated with t-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride (2.8 equivalents) and imidazole (6.4 equivalents) in dimethylformamide (0.07 m) for 16 h at room temperature. After extractive work-up and chromatographic purification, the corresponding silylether was obtained in 74% yield (1.2 g). This material was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (0.06 m) and treated with a 1 m BH3 solution in tetrahydrofuran (3.8 equivalents). After stirring for 48 h at room temperature, the resulting solution was added to a solution of pyridinium chlorochromate (10 g) in dichloromethane (150 ml). After refluxing for 1 h, the mixture was filtered over florisil, and the filtrate was concentrated and purified by silica gel chromatography to provide 1.04 g (85%) of the corresponding 6-keto derivative. 6-Keto-5α-cholestan-3β,25-diol was obtained by deprotection of the silylether with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (2.6 equivalents) in tetrahydrofuran (0.17 m). Extraction and purification by silica gel chromatography provided 0.6 g of pure 6-keto-5α-cholestan-3β,25-diol (90% yield).

Following incubation, the cells were washed once with cold PBS, then treated with 500 μl of buffer B, and scraped into 1.5-ml tubes on ice. The cells were passed through a 22-gauge needle 11 times and then shaken for 20 min at room temperature using a Vortex Genie 2 (Fisher). The protein concentration of each total cell extract was measured (BCA kit; Pierce) after which an aliquot of cell extract (25 μg) was mixed with 0.25 volume of buffer D, heated for 7 min at 95 °C, and then subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Transient Transfection and Fractionation of SRD-13A Cells—On day 0, the cells were set up for experiments in medium C at 7.5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. On day 2, the cells were transfected in medium B with plasmids by using FuGENE 6 reagent as described (26Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was adjusted to 4–7 μg/dish by the addition of pcDNA3 mock vector. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and switched to medium D or medium E for varying times of incubation as described in the figure legends. The cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts in buffer C (28DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.-P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J.

Blue Native-PAGE for Detection of SCAP·Insig-1 Complex—Aliquots of the 20,000 × g membrane fraction were resuspended in buffer E containing 0.4% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 Alternative and then mixed with an equal volume of buffer E containing no detergent. After incubation on ice for 30 min, detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 1 × 105 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then analyzed by 4–16% blue native-PAGE as described (11Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Sterol Treatment of Membranes in Vitro—Aliquots (100 μg) of the 20,000 × g membrane fraction were resuspended in buffer A with or without sterol·MCD complex to give a final volume of 500 μl. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Buffer was aspirated from the resulting membrane pellets, and the membranes were resuspended in buffer A for subsequent photoaffinity labeling and/or protease treatment. Photoaffinity Labeling—All of the experiments using photoactive sterols were performed in the dark. Irradiation of membranes in vitro was performed using a portable ultraviolet lamp (UVP model UVL-28, peak transmission at 365 nm) applied to the samples contained in 1.5-ml tubes on ice for 10–15 min. Irradiation of intact transfected SRD-13A cells used a GE Black light bulb (model F40BLB) placed at a distance of 11 cm from open 100-mm dishes of cells for 20 min at room temperature. Proteolytic Cleavage of SCAP—Our previously described protocol (16Adams C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Aliquots (100 μg) of the 20,000 × g membrane fraction from transfected SRD-13A cells were resuspended in 135 μl of buffer A. To each tube was added 2 μg of trypsin (in 5 μl), and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Trypsin digestion was stopped by the addition of 100 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (in 5 μl). PNGase F treatment, acetone precipitation, and resuspension in buffer D were performed as described (19Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In experiments using chymotrypsin, 50 μg of membranes were resuspended in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 30 μg of chymotrypsin to give a final volume of 68 μl. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then moved to ice for 10 min before mixing with 14 μl of buffer D and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Trypsin-treated samples and chymotrypsin-treated samples were analyzed on 12 or 15% Tris-Tricine gels, respectively, except as noted in the legend to Fig. 9B. RNA Interference—Single-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized by the University of Texas Southwestern RNA Oligonucleotide Synthesis Core. Complementary single-stranded siRNAs were annealed into duplexes at a final concentration of 20 μm. The oligonucleotides used to generate duplex siRNA (sense/antisense) were as follows: human Insig-1, UGGUGUCUAUCAGUAUACATT/UGUAUACUGAUAGACACCUTT and CCAGUGCUAAAUUGGAUUUTT/AAAUCCAAUUUAGCACUGGTT; human Insig-2, UCUCCAGAUUUCCUCUAUGTT/CAUAGAGGAAAUCUGGAGATT and GUGCUAAAGUGGAUUUCGATT/UCGAAAUCCACUUUAGCACTT; and green fluorescent protein, CAGCCACAACGUCUAUAUCTT/GAUAUAGACGUUGUGGCUGTT. On day 0, SV-589 cells were set up at a density of 1.75 × 105 cells/100-mm dish in medium F supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. On day 1, the cells were washed once with 8 ml of PBS, refed with 3 ml of medium F (without antibiotics), and then transfected with siRNA using a ratio of 10 μl of OligofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen) to 1050 pmol of siRNA duplexes/dish (added in a volume of 1 ml) as described by the manufacturer. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the cells received additional medium to give a final volume of 7 ml of medium F containing fetal calf serum at a final concentration of 10%. On day 4, after incubation for 3 days, the cells were used for experiments. Quantification of cellular mRNAs targeted for knockdown was done by real time PCR (29Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D.

Immunoblot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). The immunoblots were performed at room temperature using the following primary antibodies: 5 μg/ml of IgG-7D4, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the NH2 terminus of hamster SREBP-2 (30Yang J.

Here we show that strains of Escherichia coli carrying a deletion of a single metabolic gene increase their growth rates (by 87% on average) during adaptive evolution and that the endpoint growth rates can be predicted computationally in 39 of 50 (78%) strains tested. These results show that computational models can be used to predict the eventual effects of genetic modifications.
https://openalex.org/W2017045389,"The tetracycline antibiotics block microbial translation and constitute an important group of antimicrobial agents that find broad clinical utility. Resistance to this class of antibiotics is primarily the result of active efflux or ribosomal protection; however, a novel mechanism of resistance has been reported to be oxygen-dependent destruction of the drugs catalyzed by the enzyme TetX. Paradoxically, the tetX genes have been identified on transposable elements found in anaerobic bacteria of the genus Bacteroides. Overexpression of recombinant TetX in Escherichia coli followed by protein purification revealed a stoichiometric complex with flavin adenine dinucleotide. Reconstitution of in vitro enzyme activity demonstrated a broad tetracycline antibiotic spectrum and a requirement for molecular oxygen and NADPH in antibiotic degradation. The tetracycline products of TetX activity were unstable at neutral pH, but mass spectral and NMR characterization under acidic conditions supported initial monohydroxylation at position 11a followed by intramolecular cyclization and non-enzymatic breakdown to other undefined products. TetX is therefore a FAD-dependent monooxygenase. The enzyme not only catalyzed efficient degradation of a broad range of tetracycline analogues but also conferred resistance to these antibiotics in vivo. This is the first molecular characterization of an antibiotic-inactivating monooxygenase, the origins of which may lie in environmental bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2104574305,"Retroviruses utilize cellular dNTPs to perform proviral DNA synthesis in infected host cells. Unlike oncoretroviruses, which replicate in dividing cells, lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus, are capable of efficiently replicating in non-dividing cells (terminally differentiated macrophages) as well as dividing cells (i.e. activated CD4+ T cells). In general, non-dividing cells are likely to have low cellular dNTP content compared with dividing cells. Here, by employing a novel assay for cellular dNTP content, we determined the dNTP concentrations in two HIV-1 target cells, macrophages and activated CD4+ T cells. We found that human macrophages contained 130-250-fold lower dNTP concentrations than activated human CD4+ T cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that, unlike oncoretroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs), lentiviral RTs efficiently synthesize DNA even in the presence of the low dNTP concentrations equivalent to those found in macrophages. In keeping with this observation, HIV-1 vectors containing mutant HIV-1 RTs, which kinetically mimic oncoretroviral RTs, failed to transduce human macrophages despite retaining normal infectivity for activated CD4+ T cells and other dividing cells. These results suggest that the ability of HIV-1 to infect macrophages, which is essential to establishing the early pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, depends, at least in part, on enzymatic adaptation of HIV-1 RT to efficiently catalyze DNA synthesis in limited cellular dNTP substrate environments. Retroviruses utilize cellular dNTPs to perform proviral DNA synthesis in infected host cells.

Cellular dNTP levels serve as a biomarker for the replicative capacity of mammalian cells (for review, see Ref. 1Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Consistent with this function, numerous studies have reported that dNTP contents in cancer cells and transformed cell lines are elevated 3-10-fold compared with normal cells and that dividing cells have higher dNTP contents than non-dividing cells (1Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 2Angus S.P. Wheeler L.J. Ranmal S.A. Zhang X. Markey M.P. Mathews C.K. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol.

Cellular dNTP levels also fluctuate during the cell cycle and upon DNA damage, when replication and repair DNA synthesis levels are altered (6Skoog L. Bjursell G. J. Biol.

In addition, many viruses utilize cellular dNTPs to carry out their replicative cycle. These viruses include lentiviruses, such as the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; T/P, template-primer complex; RT, reverse transcriptase; MuLV, murine leukemia virus; AMV, avian myeloblastosis virus; KF, Klenow fragment; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOI, multiplicity of infection.1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; T/P, template-primer complex; RT, reverse transcriptase; MuLV, murine leukemia virus; AMV, avian myeloblastosis virus; KF, Klenow fragment; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOI, multiplicity of infection. and SIV), which are unique among retroviruses in their ability to infect both non-dividing cells, such as terminally differentiated macrophages (11Lewis P.F. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 510-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dividing cells, such as activated CD4+ T cells. Changes in cell tropism between macrophages and T cells that occur during the course of lentiviral infection are closely related to immunological and clinical manifestations of lentivirus infection (i.e. CD4+ T cell decrease and AIDS). In contrast to lentiviruses, oncoretroviruses productively replicate only in dividing cells (11Lewis P.F. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 510-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lewis P. Hensel M. Emerman M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is intriguing to consider how lentiviral DNA polymerases may have evolved to replicate efficiently in quiescent cells (i.e. terminally differentiated/non-dividing macrophages) that presumably contain low levels of dNTPs.In this study, we established a sensitive dNTP assay to measure dNTP concentrations in primary HIV-1-susceptible host cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) efficiently performs processive DNA synthesis under reaction conditions that contained dNTP concentrations equivalent to those found in macrophages. In contrast, oncoretroviral RTs were unable to efficiently polymerize under these conditions. Finally, we designed pseudotyped HIV-1 virus vectors that contained either wild-type RT or RTs with mutations that affected dNTP binding affinity. An analysis of reporter gene expression in vector-infected target cells revealed that the mutant constructs could transduce only actively dividing cells (cell lines, primary activated T cells), whereas the wild-type vectors could transduce both dividing and non-dividing (macrophage) host cells. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the unique ability of HIV-1 to infect non-dividing cells depends, at least in part, on the evolutionary adaptation of its reverse transcriptase to function under conditions of limiting dNTP availability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsOligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.

Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT and Klenow fragment (KF) were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively.Single Nucleotide Incorporation AssayFour different 19-mer DNA templates containing sequence variations (N) at the 5′ end nucleotide (5′-NTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC-3′) were individually annealed to an 18-mer DNA primer (5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA-3′), which was 32P-labeled at its 5′ end (template: primer, 4:1). The nucleotide at the 5′ end of the primer determines the dNTP to be measured. The primer (160 pmol in 80 μl) was labeled using 40 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) with 80 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. An additional 40 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase was added for an additional 30-min period of labeling. After heat inactivation (95 °C, 10 min), the labeled primer was split into four separate tubes annealed with each of the four 19-mer templates (160 pmol) with the addition of 10× STE buffer (100 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA for final concentration) in a final volume of 50 μl. The template/primer mixture was incubated for 10 min at 95 °C, 5 min at 55 °C, and 5 min at 22 °C and stored on ice until used.The template/primer complexes (T/Ps) were extended using RT proteins in a standard dNTP assay reaction. Each assay reaction (20 μl) contained 0.2 pmol of T/P (10 nm, primer concentration), 2 μl of appropriate dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences) or extracted cellular dNTPs, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm (dT)20, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs). Reactions were initiated by adding excess RT proteins (60 nm) in relation to dNTP concentration (0.2-6.4 nm or 4-128 fmol in 20 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated with 10 μl of 40 mm EDTA, 99% formamide. Reaction products were immediately denatured by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min, and 4 μl of each 30 μl of final reaction mixture was quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) of 14% acrylamide-urea denaturing gels (SequaGel, National Diagnostics; model S2 sequencing gel electrophoresis apparatus, Labrepco). Note that in our purification protocol, ∼30-60% of the purified RT protein was active as determined by our pre-steady-state kinetic assay using a similar 18-mer/40-mer primer/RNA template (17Weiss K.K.

The reaction with less RT (10 nm), which is still a higher concentration than the highest dNTP concentration used (6.4 nm), gave a similar incorporation profile under the assay condition.Standard Curves for Single Nucleotide IncorporationThe gels obtained from the incorporation assay (see Fig. 1A) were subjected to phosphorimaging analysis (see above). The percent of primer extension in each reaction was calculated by determining the ratios of extended versus total (extended and unextended) primers. Each signal for the extended products was normalized using the background signal in the control reactions incubated without RT (see Fig. 1C, lane C). The calculated percentage primer extension was plotted from triplicate reactions as a function of the dNTP quantity used, generating standard curves for all four dNTPs. The percentage primer extension determined in triplicate reactions containing extracted cellular dNTPs was then extrapolated to the standard curves to determine the dNTP contents present in the cellular samples.Primer Extension by RT ProteinsThe primer extension assay was modified from a previously described misincorporation assay (18Diamond T.L.

Briefly, an RNA T/P was prepared by annealing a 38-mer RNA (5′-AAGCUUGGCUGCAGAAUAUUGCUAGCGGGAAUUCGGCGCG-3′, Dharmacon Research) to the 17-mer A primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCT-3′; template:primer, 2.5:1, Invitrogen) 32P-labeled at the 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Assay mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 nm T/P, the RT protein concentrations specified in the legends to Fig. 2, A and B, and 4 dNTPs at concentrations indicated in the figure legends under the condition described in the dNTP assay above. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated for analysis as described in the dNTP assay. Concentrations of RTs (i.e. 1 and 4×) and dNTPs (i.e. 4 and 0.04 μm) used in each primer extension experiment were described in each figure legend. This reaction condition allows multiple rounds of primer extension. We also performed the single round primer extension. In this reaction, RTs were preincubated with the 32P-labeled 17-mer/38-mer RNA template (10 nm), and the reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of dNTP (0.04 μm) and a molar excess of cold T/P (1 μm) for 3 min at 37 °C. For the trap control, RTs were preincubated with a mixture of the 32P-labeled T/P and the cold T/P, and the reaction was initiated by adding dNTP (0.04 μm). We also employed a 120-nucleotide-long RNA template annealed to a 32P-labeled 20-mer primer (19Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4710-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This T/P was also extended by different concentrations of RTs and dNTP for 10 min at 37 °C (see Fig. 1D legend).Fig. 2Comparison of reverse transcription capability of lentiviral and oncoretroviral RTs at different dNTP concentrations. A 32P-labeled 17-mer primer (S) was annealed to a 38-mer RNA template and then extended by two lentiviral RTs (A), HIV-1 and SIV RTs, and two oncoretroviral RTs (B), MuLV and AMV RTs, in reactions containing each dNTP at 4 μm. Two different input levels of RT activity were used in these reactions (1× and 4×, as indicated). The RT reactions were repeated with these same two reverse transcription activities (4× and 1×) in reactions that contained each dNTP 0.04 μm; the fully extended primer is 38 nucleotides long (lane F). 4× concentrations of RTs are as follows: HIV-1 RT, 3.2 nm; SIV RT, 6 nm; MuLV RT, 0.5 nm; AMV RT, 2.25 nm. The same T/P used in A and B was extended by HIV-1 (3.2 nm) and MuLV RTs (0.5 nm) under the condition allowing a single round of primer extension at 0.04 μm dNTP (C). A 32P-labeled 20-mer primer (S) annealed to a 120-nt-long RNA template encoding HIV-1 RT genome (D) was extended at 4 and 0.04 μm dNTP by the four RTs under the same condition used in A and B. The 2× concentration was used for the two lentiviral RTs (H, 6.4 nm HIV-1 RT; S, 12 nm SIV RT), whereas the 8× concentration was used for the two oncoretroviral RTs (M, 4 nm MuLV RT; A, 9 nm AMV RT). E, dNTP concentration-dependent single nucleotide incorporation by MuLV and HIV-1 RTs was determined on the 18-mer/19-mer assay T/Ps. The single nucleotide incorporation activity of these two DNA polymerases at different dNTP concentrations was analyzed using the T-specific template/primer pair (10 nm) in the presence of decreasing dTTP concentrations (50, 5, 0.5, and 0.05 μm). The 18-mer and 19-mer primers indicate unextended and extended primers, respectively. Polymerase concentrations showing ∼60% primer extension on this template/primer pair at 50 μm dTTP are 1 nm MuLV RT and 0.8 nm HIV-1 RT. F, steady-state kinetic analysis of the two DNA polymerases with the four 18-mer/19-mer T/Ps is shown (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results are from experiments performed in triplicate with standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Transduction of primary human cells by pseudotyped lentivirus vectors containing wild-type, V148I, or Q151N RTs. Primary human cells were infected with eGFP-encoding lentivirus vectors containing the indicated RT variants (Wild-type, V148I, Q151N). T cells were fixed 48 h post-infection with 0.5% formaldehyde, and macrophages were fixed 120 h post-infection in 0.5% formaldehyde after treatment with 2 mm EDTA and gentle scraping. Flow cytometric analysis of eGFP expression in transduced CD4+ T cells (A) and macrophages (B) from one representative experiment are shown. The negative control (mock) infections are shown in black, whereas results from vector-transduced cells are depicted by the green histograms. Total cells were gated on the basis of physical parameters (forward and side scatter), and the percent GFP-positive cells was determined after gating parameters were set such that the percent GFP-positive cells in the negative control cells was 1%. C, representative images of macrophages 120 h post-infection are shown. Fluorescent images are shown (upper panels) with corresponding bright field images (lower panels); images were taken at ×14 magnification.

(20Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was modified to determine DNA polymerization efficiencies of DNA polymerases with the 18-mer/19-mer template/primers used in the dNTP assay (see above). Reaction conditions were the same as those described in the dNTP assay except for DNA polymerase concentrations (0.5-2 nm). For the analysis of dNTP incorporation kinetics, four different templates (5′ template nucleotides T, C, G, or A for dATP, dGTP, dCTP, or dTTP incorporation, respectively) annealed to the 32P-labeled 18-mer primer were used (see above). The amounts of RTs and incubation times were adjusted to yield an extension that was 30-60% of the total labeled primer (0.8 pmol) at the highest dNTP concentrations, and the reactions were repeated with eight decreasing concentrations of each dNTP. For HIV-1 RT, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 720 nm dNTPs were used, and for MuLV RT, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 μm were used. We also measured the steady-state kinetic values using the processive reverse transcription with the 38-mer RNA annealed to the 32P-labeled 17-mer. In this analysis, the different concentrations of all four dNTP mixtures were used. Products (single nucleotide-incorporated primer or all extended products) were resolved in 14% polyacrylamide-urea gel and quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis using the OptiQuant software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The kcat and Km values were determined from the Michaelis-Menten equation.dNTP Extraction from CellsThe protocol for dNTP extraction from cells was similar to that described previously (21Roy B. Beuneu C. Roux P. Buc H. Lemaire G. Lepoivre M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets (5 × 104-2 × 106 cells) were washed twice with 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Mediatech) and resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold 60% methanol. Samples were vortexed vigorously to lyse the cells and then heated at 95 °C for 3 min prior to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatants were collected and completely vacuum-dried using a SpeedVac (Savant) with medium heat. The dried pellets were subsequently resuspended in dNTP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2; 100 μl for 1 × 106 HeLa cells and 10 μl for 1 × 106 primary cells), and usually 1-2 μl of the extracted dNTP samples were used for each 20-μl single nucleotide incorporation reaction (see above). The proper dilutions of the dNTP samples were prepared for the assay to make the primer extension values lie within the linear ranges of the dNTP incorporation (2-32% primer extension). The extracted dNTP samples were stored at -70 °C until used. Several different volumes of the extracted dNTP samples were also used to confirm the linearity of the primer extension. In addition, the dNTP samples were prepared from different cell numbers depending on the recovery efficiency of the primary cells from each blood sample (see below). However, the dNTP content of each cell type was normalized by pmol/1 × 106 (see Fig. 1F).Isolation and Culture of Human T Cells and Monocyte-derived MacrophagesHuman macrophages and CD4+ T cells were isolated from human buffy coats (Blood Research Institute) as described (22Klimatcheva E. Planelles V. Day S.L. Fulreader F. Renda M.J. Rosenblatt J. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 928-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested from Ficoll density gradients (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway), and monocytes were then purified using immunomagnetic selection with anti-CD14 antibody-conjugated magnetic beads following the manufacturer's recommendations (Miltenyi Biotech). CD4+ lymphocytes were isolated from monocyte-depleted buffy coats by immunomagnetic selection using anti-CD4 antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. The purified human monocytes were incubated in 10-cm dishes in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech) containing 20% human AB serum (Sigma) for 4 days in the presence of 5 ng/ml human recombinant GM-CSF (R&D Systems) and then incubated for an additional 3 days in the absence of GM-CSF to allow differentiation into macrophages. The purified resting T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% autologous human serum, although activated T cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% autologous human serum and 5 ng/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) for 24 h and then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% human serum and 5 ng/ml human recombinant interleukin 2 (Sigma) for 3 days. These cell preparations were to prepare for dNTP extracts and also for analysis of cell volumes using confocal microscopy.Pseudotyped Virus Cloning and PreparationpHCMV-VSVG envelope vector (23Akkina R.K. Walton R.M. Chen M.L. Li Q.X. Planelles V. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2581-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pD3-GFP transfer vector, which encodes the HIV-1 NL4-3 genome with the eGFP gene in place of HIV-1 envelope, were used for preparing pseudotyped HIV-1. The V148I and Q151N mutations were cloned into pD3-GFP (pNL4-3-based) vector using the overlapping PCR with proper primers that were designed based on the pNL4-3 RT sequence. The created mutations were confirmed by sequencing with the 3305 primer (5′-GCACTATAGGCTGTACTGTCC-3′), and correct SwaI relegation was confirmed with D3-GFP SEQ SwaI F (5′-CAGGCCATATCACCTAG-3′) and D3-GFP SEQ SwaI R (5′-TCTAACTGGTACCATAAC-3′) primers. 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were grown to ∼90% confluency with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate in T-175 flasks. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of envelope vector and 25 μg of transfer vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations (in the absence of geneticin). Cells were split in half into two new T-175 flasks 16 h post-transfection. Supernatant was collected 48 and 72 h post-transfection and stored at 4 °C. Virus was harvested by ultracentrifugation at 22,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C with the Beckman SW 28 rotor. Virus was titrated by infection of HeLa cells 2Obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health from Dr. Richard Axel (24Maddon P.J.

In addition, controls were performed by pretreating HeLa cells for 2 h prior to and during infection with 0.5 mm cycloheximide, which is a general translation inhibitor. Cells were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry 48 h post-infection. Results showed that very little protein was carried over with the pseudotyped virus preparations, as evidenced by <1% GFP-positive cells with plus cycloheximide infections compared with >20% GFP-positive cells in minus cycloheximide infections (data not shown).Infection of Primary CD4+ T Cells and Monocyte-derived MacrophageT cells and macrophage were purified essentially as described above.T Cell Infections—After 5 days of T cell stimulation with phytohem-agglutinin and interleukin 2 (see above), 2 × 105 stimulated T cells were infected in the presence of polybrene with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 based on HeLa cell titering. For QN virus infections, an MOI of 65 was used because of trouble generating high titer QN virus. These infections reflect the addition of viral stocks containing 200-300 ng of p24. Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a 100-μl total volume. Two hours post-infection, 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum and 4 ng/μl interleukin 2 was added, and infections were incubated for an additional 46 h. Cells were visualized and photographed by fluorescent microscopy to detect GFP fluorescence by infected cells. The percent of infection was determined after cells were prepared for flow analysis by fixation with 0.5% formaldehyde.Macrophage Infections—After the initial magnetic bead purification, 2 × 106 CD14+ cells/well were plated into 6-well plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 2% heat-inactivated human AB serum and 5 ng/ml GM-CSF for 48 h. This was followed by a 48-h incubation in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% heat-inactivated human AB serum and 5 ng/ml GM-CSF. Cells were then incubated for an additional 8 days in the absence of GM-CSF, with fresh medium added after the initial 4 days. Macrophages were infected with pseudotyped virus at an MOI of 40 based on HeLa cell titering and assuming 1 × 106 cells/well in the presence of polybrene. These infections reflect the addition of viral stocks containing 80-130 ng of p24. Initial infections were in 250-μl volumes for the first 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 followed by the addition of 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 20% heat-inactivated human AB serum. Incubations were continued for up to 6 days, and cells were periodically examined for GFP fluorescence by fluorescent microscopy. Cells were fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde after disassociation from the plates by 30 min of incubation with 2 mm EDTA and gentle scraping. The percent of infection was determined by flow cytometry.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDetermination of dNTP Levels in HIV-1 Target Cells, Human Macrophages, and Resting or Activated CD4+ T Cells—First, we established a highly sensitive enzymatic dNTP assay that allowed us to measure the dNTP contents of primary and non-dividing cells such as macrophages. For the enzymatic measurement of each dNTP contained in a mixture of four different dNTPs, we designed a 32P-labeled 18-mer primer that could anneal to any of four different 19-mer DNA templates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because these dNTP assay T/Ps contain only one of the four possible nucleotides at the 5′ protruding end of the template, DNA polymerases can incorporate only the complementary dNTP onto each of the four T/Ps. Using the specific T/Ps, we found that HIV-1 RT efficiently performed single nucleotide incorporation, even at very low dNTP concentrations, compared with KF of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (data not shown) and MuLV RT (see below). When 200 fmol of T/Ps were extended by HIV-1 RT (60 nm) in the presence of different amounts of the individual dNTPs for 5 min at 37 °C, 19-mer extended products were generated. As shown in Fig. 1A, incorporation of dCTP and dTTP was detected at concentrations as low as 4 fmol, which extended ∼2% of the primers. Similar profiles were seen with dGTP and dATP (data not shown). The percent of primer extension in each reaction was then calculated to generate standard curves for incorporation of each dNTP onto the appropriate template/primer (Fig. 1B, dTTP and dGTP). No detectable primer extension was observed in control reactions lacking"

Although taxol induces apoptosis of cancer cells, its exact mechanism of action is not yet known. In this study we investigated death receptors, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), the activation of caspases-10 and -8 as well as the downstream caspases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in taxol-induced apoptosis in the CCRF-HSB-2 human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Pretreating the cells with neutralizing antibodies to Fas, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor 1, or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (DR4 and DR5) did not affect taxol-induced apoptosis, but transfection of the cells with a dominant negative FADD plasmid resulted in inhibition of taxol-induced apoptosis, revealing that taxol induces apoptosis independently of these death receptors but dependently on FADD. Furthermore, the drug induced activation of caspases-10, -8, -6, and -3, cleaved Bcl-2, Bid, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and lamin B, and down-regulated cellular levels of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) and X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). However, despite the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in taxol-treated cells, caspase-9 was not activated. Inhibitors of caspases-8, -6, or -3 partially inhibited taxol-induced apoptosis, whereas the caspase-10 inhibitor totally abrogated this process. Taxol-induced apoptosis was also associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and a significant increase in ROS generation. However, increased ROS production was not directly involved in taxol-triggered apoptosis. Therefore, these results demonstrate for the first time that taxol induces FADD-dependent apoptosis primarily through activation of caspase-10 but independently of death receptors.

Up-regulation of the transcription factor FoxO3a by taxol in MCF-7 breast cancer cells can also result in increased levels of Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, which can cause apoptosis in these cells (23Sunters A.

However, the exact mechanism by which taxol induces apoptosis in various cell lines is not well understood. Apoptotic signaling and execution pathways involve the activation of caspases, which in turn cleave key protein substrates. On the basis of primary structure, procaspases can be divided into two classes, caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10, which contain long amino-terminal prodomains and act as initiators, and caspases-3, -6, and -7, with short prodomains that act as effectors (24Thornberry N.A.

Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Two well studied pathways are involved in apoptosis, (a) the mitochondrion-initiated pathway and (b) the cell surface death receptors pathway (28Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). In the mitochondrial pathway, cytochrome c, certain caspases, apoptosis-inducing factor, Smac/DIABLO, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)-binding protein, and other apoptosis-inducing factors are released from the intramembrane space to the cytosol (29Ferri K.F. Jacotot E. Blanco J. Este J.A. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Xie Z. Brothers G. Reed J.C. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Once released, cytochrome c and dATP bind to apoptotic proteinase-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), and this complex along with adenine nucleotides promotes procaspase-9 autoactivation (30Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar), which in turn activates caspases-2, -3, -6, -8, and -10 (31Slee E.A. Harte M.T.

In the death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway (e.g. Fas/Fas ligand interaction and cell death), caspase-8 is an initiator caspase that can activate the downstream caspases including caspase-3. Active caspase-8 also cleaves a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, and the truncated Bid induces mitochondrial cytochrome c release (30Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar, 34Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar), thereby linking the two pathways. After activation, both caspase-8 and caspase-9 activate caspase-3, which in turn cleaves other caspases and many cellular proteins including fodrin, protein kinase C, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, gelsolin, and DNA fragmentation factor-45 (DFF45) (28Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 33Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). A third pathway also has been recently identified (35Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this pathway Bid is cleaved downstream of the point of Bcl-2 action, catalyzed by caspase-3, upstream of caspase-8 activation, and acts as a potential feedback loop for amplification of apoptosis-associated release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Our data revealed that taxol induces Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)-dependent apoptosis in CCRF-HSB-2 cells independently of the death receptors. Moreover, for the first time we found that taxol triggers apoptosis primarily through activation of caspase-10 and the signaling pathway downstream of this caspase, including caspase-6 and -3 activation, but independently of caspase-9 activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, caspase-8 activation played a lesser role in taxol-induced apoptosis than did caspase-10 in these cells. Cell Line, Culture Conditions, and Cell Survival 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) Assay—The CCRF-HSB-2 human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 15% fetal calf serum and 100 ng/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For MTT assay, 1 × 104 cells were plated in 100 μl of the growth medium in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations (0.1–1 μm) of taxol in 96-well plates and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 12–48 h. The cells were then incubated with 25 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h. After dissolving the crystals with 0.04 n HCl in isopropanol, the plates were read in a microplate reader at 570 nm. The concentration of drug that inhibited cell survival by 50% (IC50) was determined from cell survival plots. Colony-forming Assay for Taxol-treated CCRF-HSB-2 Cells—300 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.9% methylcellulose. The cells in triplicate wells were treated with or without 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 7 days. The number of colonies in each control and treated well was determined using a Zeiss inverted microscope. Annexin V Binding Assay to Detect Apoptotic Cells—After treatment with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol, the cells (5 × 105 cells/treatment) were used to determine the translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer surface of the plasma membrane during apoptosis using the human phospholipid binding protein, annexin V, conjugated with fluorescein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) by flow cytometry as described by the manufacturer. Apoptosis and necrosis were analyzed by quadrant statistics on the propidium iodide-negative, fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive cells, and propidium iodide-positive cells, respectively. Effects of Caspase Inhibitors on Taxol-induced Apoptosis—To determine which caspases are involved in apoptosis induced by taxol, caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO), caspase-6 inhibitor (Z-VEID-FMK), caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK or IETD-CHO), caspase-9 inhibitors (Z-LEHD-FMK or LEHD-CHO) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and caspase-10 inhibitor (Z-AEVD-FMK) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used. These caspase inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO; Sigma); the final concentration of Me2SO was 0.1%. Cells (5 × 105) were preincubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm each of these inhibitors for 3 h at 37 °C then treated with or without 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 48 h and processed for annexin V binding assay as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as we described elsewhere (36Wu C.H. Rastegar M. Gordon J. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7006-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using several antibodies. In short, 5 × 105 cells or 50 μg of protein/lane were separated by 5–15% SDS-PAGE then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon membrane, and then the protein levels were detected using the dilutions of the antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat antibodies (1:2500 v/v, Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. The membranes were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for various times.

(Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Bid monoclonal antibody AF860 (1:1000 v/v) was provided by R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody AC-74 (1:2000 v/v) was obtained from Sigma. The anti-caspase-9 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 v/v) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The rabbit anti-caspase-3 (CPP32) polyclonal antibody (1:1000 v/v) and the anti-cytochrome c antibody (1:1000 w/v) were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. The anti-FADD mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The anti-caspase-6 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000 v/v), the caspase-10 monoclonal antibody (1: 1000 v/v), and XIAP monoclonal antibody 2F1 (1:1000 v/v) were purchased from Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Watertown, MA). FLIP monoclonal antibody (1:1000 v/v) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The p21WAF-1/CIP-1 monoclonal antibody (AB-1) (1:1000 v/v) was purchased from Calbiochem. The Smac/DIABLO rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab-1) (1:1000 v/v) was purchased from Oncogene (San Diego, CA). Treatment of Cells with Neutralizing Antibodies to the Death Receptors and Detection of Apoptosis—To determine whether taxol-induced apoptosis occurs through the death receptors, CCRF-HSB-2 cells were pretreated with the anti-Fas-neutralizing antibody ZB-4 (20 μg/ml, Immunotech, France), the anti-TNFR1-neutralizing antibody H398 (Camarillo, CA), or neutralizing polyclonal goat antibodies raised against extracellular domains of TRAIL-R1 (anti-DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (anti-DR5) (20 μg/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) 3 h before treatment with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 48 h. In control experiments cells were treated with mouse IgG1 or normal goat serum before taxol treatment. Apoptosis was the measured by annexin V assay as described above. Stable Transfection of CCRF-HSB-2 Cells with pcDNA3 and Dominant Negative FADD Mutant (dnFADD)/pcDNA3 Plasmids—The CCRF-HSB-2 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or dnFADD/pcDNA3 using SuperFect reagent (Qiagent, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. The transfectants were then selected by adding 1 mg/ml G418 to the growth media. The dnFADD/pcDNA3 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Claudius Vincenz (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Isolation of Cytosolic Fraction for Detecting Cytochrome c—CCRF-HSB-2 cells (∼2 × 107) were incubated with or without taxol for 48 h and harvested by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in a 5× volume of ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm sucrose). After incubation on ice for 15 min the cells were mechanically disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were centrifuged at 1800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, which contained mitochondria, was subjected to further centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to pellet the mitochondrial fraction. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a Microcon YM-100 filter. The flow-through (i.e. cytosolic fraction) was mixed with ice-cold acetone, and proteins were precipitated at –20 °C for several hours. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the protein pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and subjected to Western blotting analysis for cytochrome c. Preparation of Cytosol Fractions from Cells and Determination of the Release of Smac/DIABLO—CCRF-HSB-2 cells (3 × 106) were incubated with or without 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 48 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 5 volumes of homogenation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitor (2 μg/ml aprotinin) and containing 250 mm sucrose. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min to allow the cells to swell and lyse. Cell homogenates were prepared by disrupting the cells by 40 strokes in a 2 ml of Dounce glass homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were centrifuged twice at 2500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatants containing mitochondria were collected and subjected to further centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to pellet the mitochondrial fraction. The post-mitochondrial supernatants were successively filtered through Microcon YM-50 filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to yield the cytosolic fraction. The cytosolic fraction was then subjected to Western blotting analysis for Smac/DIABLO. Cytofluorimetric Analysis of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (Δψm)—Changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) during apoptosis in CCRF-HSB-2 cells were studied using 5,5′,6,6,-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanine (JC-1; Molecular Probes) as a probe as described previously (37Gordon J. Wu C.H. Rastegar M. Safa A.R. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This dye accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix under the influence of the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Cells were treated with or without 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol in culture media for 48 h. JC-1 membrane potential-related fluorescence was recorded using an FL1 photomultiplier tube by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. For each analysis 5 × 105 cells were used. The cytofluorimetric analysis of mitochondrial Δψm was performed in triplicate. Analysis of ROS and Apoptosis—Levels of intracellular ROS were measured using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) as we previously described (38Wu C.H. Gordon J. Rastegar M. Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5160-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CCRF-HSB-2 cells (5 × 105) were treated with or without 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol in culture media for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 5 μm dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and analyzed by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer as described previously. The analysis of ROS was performed in triplicate. To determine whether the increased ROS generated by taxol treatment caused apoptosis, CCRF-HSB-2 cells were treated without or with 10 mm antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in the absence or presence of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 12–48 h. Apoptosis was then measured by cell annexin V binding assay as described above. Taxol Inhibited Growth and Induced Apoptosis and Necrosis in CCRF-HSB-2 Cells—To examine taxol-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in CCRF-HSB-2 cells, we first assessed the effect of taxol on the survival and proliferation of these cells by treating them with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 48 h followed by MTT assay (Fig. 1A). The results presented in Fig. 1A revealed that taxol at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm reduced the proliferation and survival of CCRF-HSB-2 cells in a dose-dependent fashion and that the IC50 value of taxol was about 0.25 μm. We also investigated the effect of taxol on long term cell growth by determining their colony-forming capacity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results presented in Fig. 1B show that taxol at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm reduced the number of colonies by 84, 88, and 100%, respectively. Next, apoptosis triggered by taxol was detected by annexin V binding assay. Early in the apoptotic process, phospholipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane was disrupted, leading to exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. We used fluorescein-conjugated annexin V as described under “Experimental Procedures” to determine apoptotic cell death in cultures of CCRF-HSB-2 cells treated with taxol. Annexin V is an anticoagulant protein that preferentially binds to negatively charged phospholipids and can be used to identify apoptosis. The data presented in Fig. 1C revealed that treating the cells with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 48 h induced apoptosis in 11, 24, and 38% of the cells, respectively. We further analyzed the extent of necrosis in the same cell population as described under “Experimental Procedures” and found that 17, 23, and 27% of cells underwent necrosis (Fig. 1D). Although taxol induces both apoptosis and necrosis, in this report we only describe the apoptosis arm in detail. Taxol-Triggered Activation of Several Caspases in CCRF-HSB-2 Cells—To determine which caspases are involved in apoptosis induced by taxol, the cells were treated with taxol in the absence or presence of 100 μm concentrations of specific inhibitors of caspase-3 (DEVD-CHO), caspase-6 (Z-VEID-FMK), caspase-8 (IETD-CHO), caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-FMK), and caspase-10 (Z-AEVD-FMK), respectively, for 48 h. Results presented in Fig. 2 clearly illustrate that the inhibitors of caspase-3 or caspase-8 partially and the inhibitors of caspase-6 or caspase-10 almost totally inhibited taxol-induced apoptosis. However, the inhibitor of caspase-9, Z-LEHD-FMK, did not prevent taxol-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2). To confirm these data, another caspase-9 inhibitor, LEHD-CHO, was used, and it also had no effect on apoptosis, revealing that caspase-9 does not play a role during taxol-triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, our Western blot analysis shows that caspase-9 was not activated by taxol (see Fig. 4C). Collectively, the data shown in Fig. 2 revealed that the initiator caspase-10 and the executioner caspase-6 are essential for triggering taxol-induced apoptosis. However, none of the caspase inhibitors used affected necrosis. We also assessed the effects of the cathepsin B inhibitor Z-FA-FMK and the cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FF-FMK and found that these inhibitors did not affect taxol-induced apoptosis (data not shown).Fig. 4Effects of taxol treatment on caspases-8, -9, and -10. A and B, panels a, aliquots (50 μg of protein) from untreated CCRF-HSB-2 cells (lane 1), cells treated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol, respectively (lanes 2–4), cells treated with 100 μm the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-FMK (lane 5), or a 100 μm concentration of this inhibitor plus 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol, respectively (lanes 6–8) for 48 h at 37 °C were processed for Western blot analysis using antibodies to caspases-8 and -10, respectively. A and B, panels b, cells were treated as in panel a, but caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK or caspase-10 inhibitor Z-AEVD-FMK was used. C, aliquots (50 μg of protein) from untreated CCRF-HSB-2 cells (lane 1) and cells treated with 1 and 5 μm taxol, respectively (lanes 2 and 3) were treated for 48 h and processed for Western blot analysis using antibodies to caspase-9. As a positive control, we treated CCRF-HSB-2 cells with etoposide (VP-16) and detected the 37-kDa active form of this caspase (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether taxol treatment causes activation of caspases, we performed Western blotting of the executioner caspases (caspases-3 and -6) and initiator caspases (caspases-8, -9, and -10) using antibodies capable of recognizing the proforms and activated forms of these caspases. Western blot analysis of caspase-3 was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody produced to recombinant human caspase-3, known to recognize both the 32-kDa procaspase-3 as well as the 17- and 11-kDa activated forms of this caspase. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of the cells with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm taxol for 48 h increased the cleavage of procaspase-3 to its 17- and 11-kDa active forms in these cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover, treating the cells with the caspase-10 inhibitor Z-AEVD-FMK and taxol as described under “Experimental Procedures” prevented the processing of procaspase-3 to its active species, but it was not fully processed and was presented as an inactive 24-kDa intermediate form (39Xiao C.

https://openalex.org/W2018954820,"Alzheimer's disease is a major illness of dementia characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and extensive neuronal apoptosis. However, the mechanism behind neuronal apoptosis in the Alzheimer's-diseased brain is poorly understood. This study underlines the importance of neutral sphingomyelinase in fibrillar Aβ peptide-induced apoptosis and cell death in human primary neurons. Aβ1–42 peptides induced the activation of sphingomyelinases and the production of ceramide in neurons. Interestingly, neutral (N-SMase), but not acidic (A-SMase), sphingomyelinase was involved in Aβ1–42-mediated neuronal apoptosis and cell death. Aβ1–42-induced production of ceramide was redox-sensitive, as reactive oxygen species were involved in the activation of N-SMase but not A-SMase. Aβ1–42 peptides induced the NADPH oxidase-mediated production of superoxide radicals in neurons that was involved in the activation of N-SMase, but not A-SMase, via hydrogen peroxide. Consistently, superoxide radicals generated by hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase also induced the activation of N-SMase, but not A-SMase, through a catalase-sensitive pathway. Furthermore, antisense knockdown of p22phox, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, inhibited Aβ1–42-induced neuronal apoptosis and cell death. These studies suggest that fibrillar Aβ1–42 peptides induce neuronal apoptosis through the NADPH oxidase-superoxide-hydrogen peroxide-NS-Mase-ceramide pathway.

Neuropathologically, the disease is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques composed of aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein, a 40–43 amino acid proteolytic fragment derived from the amyloid precursor protein (1Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The importance of Aβ in AD has been shown by means of several transgenic animal studies. The overexpression of mutant amyloid precursor protein results in neuritic plaque formation and synapse loss and correlative memory deficits, as well as behavioral and pathological abnormalities similar to those found in AD (2Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar). Although deposition of Aβ peptides is one of the primary causes of neuronal loss in AD (1Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2Hsiao K.

Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which Aβ causes neuronal loss is largely unknown. Increased TUNEL staining in postmortem AD brains suggests that neurons in the brains of AD patients die through apoptosis (3Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J.

However, the mechanism by which Aβ peptides lead to neuronal loss is poorly understood. Although sphingomyelin was initially considered only a structural component of plasma membrane, several investigations established the involvement of sphingolipids and its metabolites in the key events of signal transduction associated with cell regulation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (10Hannun Y.A.

Because ceramide, the lipid second messenger molecule, produced from the degradation of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinases (neutral and acidic) induces apoptosis and cell death in various cell types, including glial and neuronal cells (10Hannun Y.A.

Here we report that fibrillar Aβ1–42 peptides induce the activation of sphingomyelinases and the production of ceramide in human primary neurons. We also show that the activation of neutral, but not acidic, sphingomyelinase plays the vital role in neuronal apoptosis and that NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production in neurons is responsible for Aβ-induced activation of neutral sphingomyelinase. Reagents—Neurobasal medium and B27 supplement were purchased from Invitrogen. Human Aβ peptides 1–42 and 42–1 were obtained from Bachem Bioscience. Antibodies against p22phox were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphorothioate-labeled antisense and scrambled oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized in the DNA-synthesizing facility of Invitrogen. Isolation of Human Primary Neurons—Human primary neurons were prepared as described by Zhang et al. (16Zhang Y. McLaughlin R. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All of the experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB number 224–01-FB) of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Briefly, 11–17-week-old fetal brains obtained from the Human Embryology Laboratory (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) were dissociated by trituration and trypsinization (0.25% trypsin in PBS at 37 °C for 15 min). The trypsin was inactivated with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Mediatech). The dissociated cells were filtered through 380- and 140-μm meshes (Sigma) and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed once with PBS and once with Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Sigma). In the first step, neurons were enriched by allowing the cells (3 × 106/ml) to adhere to poly-d-lysine-coated plates or coverslips for 5 min. Nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells (mostly neurons) were further treated with 10 μm Ara-C to prevent the proliferation of dividing cells. After 10 days of Ara-C treatment, the cells were used for this study. More than 98% of this preparation was positive for microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), a marker for neurons. Preparation of Fibrillar Aβ—Fibrillar Aβ1–42 and control reverse peptide Aβ42–1 (Bachem Bioscience) were prepared by incubating freshly solubilized peptides at 50 μm in sterile distilled water at 37 °C for 5 days (17Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of Primary Neurons—During treatment with fibrillar Aβ peptides, the cells were incubated in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplement without antioxidant (B27-AO) (Invitrogen). Assay of Neutral and Acidic Sphingomyelinases (N-SMase and A-SMase)—Activities of SMase(s) were assayed as described by Liu et al. (18Liu B. Andrieu-Abadie N. Levade T. Zhang P. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, after stimulation with fibrillar Aβ peptides, the cells were washed with PBS, harvested in PBS, divided into two halves, and centrifuged. The fraction for N-SMase was resuspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), and the cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was used as the enzyme source for N-SMase. The reaction mixture contained enzyme preparation in buffer A containing 5 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin, 5 nmol of phosphatidylserine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 100 μl. Similarly, the fraction for A-SMase was resuspended in buffer B (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). The cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatant was used as the source of A-SMase. The activity of A-SMase was measured in a 100-μl reaction mixture consisting of the enzyme preparation in buffer B and 5 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin. The enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of substrate and stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and 0.2 ml of water. After vortexing and phase separation, the aqueous phase was removed for counting. Lipid Extraction—Approximately 5 × 105 cells were exposed to fibrillar Aβ peptides for different periods of time, and the lipids were extracted as described previously (19Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Pahan K. Khan M. Singh I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Quantification of Ceramide Levels by Diacylglycerol Kinase Assay— Ceramide content was quantified using diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described earlier (19Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Pahan K. Khan M. Singh I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, dried lipids were solubilized in 20 μl of an octyl β-d-glucoside/cardiolipin solution (7.5% octyl β-d-glucoside, 5 mm cardiolipin in 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) by sonication in a sonicator bath. The reaction was then carried out in a final volume of 100 μl containing the 20-μl sample solution, 50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.6, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 6.6 μg of DAG kinase, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 1–5 × 105 cpm/nmol) for 30 min at room temperature. The labeled ceramide-1-phosphate was resolved with a solvent system consisting of methyl acetate:n-propyl alcohol:chloroform:methanol:0.25% KCl in water:acetic acid (100:100:100:40:36:2). A standard sample of ceramide was phosphorylated under identical conditions and developed in parallel. Both standard and experimental samples had an identical RF value (0.46). Quantification of ceramide-1-phosphate was carried out by autoradiography and densitometric scanning using a Fluor Chem 8800 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corporation). Values are expressed either as arbitrary units (absorbance) or as percent of control, considering control as 100%. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. Assay of Superoxide Production—Superoxide production by human primary neurons was detected by LumiMax™ superoxide anion-detection kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells suspended in 100 μl of superoxide anion assay medium were added to 100 μl of reagent mixture containing 0.2 mm luminol, 0.25 mm enhancer, and either fibrillar Aβ1–42 or Aβ42–1 at 1 μm in superoxide anion assay medium. Light emission was recorded at regular intervals in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). Assay of Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) Production—The production of H2O2 by human primary neurons was quantified by a colorimetric H2O2 assay kit (Assay Designs, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, different amounts of supernatants were allowed to react with 100 μl of a color reagent containing xylenol orange in an acidic solution with sorbitol and ammonium iron sulfate followed by reading of the optical density at 550 nm. Immunostaining—Coverslips containing 200–300 cells/mm2 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by treatment with cold ethanol (-20 °C) for 5 min and 2 rinses in PBS. The samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min and incubated in PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin and goat anti-p22phox (1:50), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:50), or goat anti-MAP-2 (1:50), as described previously (21Dasgupta S. Zhou Y. Jana M. Banik N.L. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3874-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After three washes in PBST (15 min each), the slides were further incubated with Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For negative controls, a set of culture slides was incubated under similar conditions without the primary antibodies. The samples were mounted and observed under a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES confocal laser scanning microscope. Fragment End Labeling of DNA—Fragmented DNA was detected in situ by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated binding of 3′-OH ends of DNA fragments generated in response to fibrillar Aβ1–42, using a commercially available kit (TdT FragEL™) from Calbiochem. Briefly, cover slips were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at room temperature and washed prior to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase staining. Cell Viability Measurement—Mitochondrial activity was measured with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma). The cells were grown on 24-well culture plates with 500 μl of medium and treated with various reagents according to the experimental design. At the end of the treatment period, 300 μl of culture medium were removed from each well, and 20 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) were added and incubated for 1 h. Lactate Dehydrogenase Measurement—The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured using the direct spectrophotometric assay using an assay kit from Sigma. Fibrillar Aβ1–42 Peptides Induce the Production of Ceramide in Human Primary Neurons—Because the fibrillar form of Aβ is commonly found in the senile plaques in AD brains (1Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), we examined whether fibrillar Aβ1–42 is capable of inducing apoptosis in human primary neurons. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, fibrillar Aβ1–42, but not reverse (Aβ42–1), peptides markedly induced the formation of apoptotic bodies. Because ceramide is an important inducer of apoptosis in different cells (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 11Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E.

Res. 1997; 48: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and cell-permeable C2-ceramide induced apoptosis in human fetal neurons (Fig. 1), we examined the effect of fibrillar Aβ1–42 and Aβ42–1 on the induction of ceramide production. We have found that fibrillar Aβ1–42, but not Aβ42–1, induced the production of ceramide in human primary neurons at different times of incubation. Within 15 min of treatment, fibrillar Aβ1–42 peptides were able to induce the level of ceramide by more than 2-fold, and with further increase in duration of treatment, the level of ceramide increased markedly (Fig. 2A). After 10 h of treatment of Aβ1–42, a ∼12-fold increase in ceramide production was observed (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the fibrillar form, soluble Aβ1–42 peptides were weakly efficient in inducing the level of ceramide (Fig. 2A). For example, soluble Aβ1–42 peptides were unable to induce the production of ceramide at 15 or 30 min of stimulation. However, after 6 h of stimulation, soluble Aβ1–42 peptides induced a 4-fold increase in ceramide production compared with an 8-fold increase by fibrillar Aβ1–42 (Fig. 2A). Although Aβ1–42-induced production of ceramide was dose-dependent, Aβ1–42 effectively induced the production of ceramide even at 0.25 μm (Fig. 2B). Because Aβ1–42 induced neuronal apoptosis effectively at 1 μm, we have chosen the particular dose for further studies. On the other hand, under similar treatment conditions, fibrillar reverse (Aβ42–1) peptides were unable to induce the production of ceramide (Fig. 2A), suggesting the specificity of the effect. Because DAG kinase phosphorylates both DAG and ceramide using [γ-32P]ATP as substrate, both lipids can be quantified in the same assay. In contrast to a time-dependent increase in ceramide production, the level of DAG was unchanged at different time points of stimulation (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Fibrillar Aβ1–42, but not Aβ42–1, peptides induce the production of ceramide and the activation of neutral (N-SMase) and acidic (A-SMase) sphingomyelinases in human primary neurons. Cells were incubated with 1 μm of fibrillar Aβ1–42, fibrillar Aβ42–1, or soluble Aβ1–42 in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27-AO for different time intervals. Lipids were extracted, and ceramide and DAG contents (A) were determined. a, p < 0.001 versus control. B, after 6 h of incubation with different concentrations of Aβ1–42, ceramide contents were determined. b, p < 0.05 versus control. C, after incubation with either fibrillar Aβ1–42 or Aβ42–1 at 1 μm for different time intervals, activities of N-SMase and A-SMase were assayed in total cell extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fibrillar Aβ1–42 Peptides Induce the Activation of Sphingomyelinases in Human Primary Neurons—Five distinct sphingomyelinases have been identified based upon their pH optima, cellular localization, and cation dependence (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 11Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). However, the neutral membrane-bound Mg2+-independent sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) and the lysosomal acid pH optima sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) have been the best studied for their roles in ceramide generation (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 11Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether fibrillar Aβ1–42 peptides are capable of inducing the activation of N-SMase and A-SMase. Marked induction of N-SMase activity was observed even at 15 min of treatment with Aβ1–42, with the maximum induction (∼5-fold) observed at 1 h (Fig. 2C). However, the induction of N-SMase activation decreased afterward. On the other hand, Aβ42–1 peptides were unable to induce the activation of N-SMase at different time points of stimulation. Although Aβ1–42, but not Aβ42–1, peptides also induced the activation A-SMase showing the peak at 30 min, the level of its induction was much lower than that of N-SMase (Fig. 2C). Because TNF-α is a prototype inducer of N-SMase (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 18Liu B. Andrieu-Abadie N. Levade T. Zhang P. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we were prompted to investigate whether TNF-α had any role in fibrillar Aβ1–42-induced neuronal activation of N-SMase. However, neutralizing antibodies against human TNF-α capable of blocking TNF-α-induced activation N-SMase had no effect on Aβ1–42-induced activation of N-SMase in human primary neurons (data not shown). Role of N-SMase and A-SMase in Aβ1–42-induced Apoptosis and Cell Death in Human Primary Neurons—Antisense oligonucleotides provide the most effective tool with which to investigate the in vivo functions of different proteins in human primary neurons. Therefore, we adopted the antisense-knockdown technique to investigate the role of N-SMase and A-SMase in Aβ1–42-induced neuronal apoptosis and cell death. Using the method of Bloomfield and Giles (23Bloomfeild M.R. Giles I.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 293SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and based on the translational initiation site, we selected different antisense (ASO) and scrambled (ScO) oligonucleotide sequences against human N-SMase and A-SMase and screened their efficacy to inhibit Aβ1–42-induced activation of respective SMase in primary neurons. After screening of several antisenses, we found the following specific ASO and ScO against N-SMase and A-SMase: N-SMase, ASO, 5′-CAGCGAGCCCGTCCACCAGCC-3′; ScO, 5′-CACGCGTCCGACGCCGCACGA-3′ and A-SMase, ASO, 5′-GACATCTCGGAGCCGGGGCA-3′; ScO, 5′-GGAAACCCGGTTAGGCCCGG-3′. As observed in Fig. 3, ASO against N-SMase dose-dependently inhibited Aβ1–42-induced activation of N-SMase but not A-SMase. Similarly, ASO against A-SMase inhibited Aβ1–42-induced activation of A-SMase but not N-SMase. On the other hand, respective ScO did not influence the activation of either N-SMase or A-SMase (Fig. 3). Next, we investigated the effect of antisense knockdown of N-SMase and/or A-SMase on Aβ1–42-induced neuronal apoptosis and cell death. Under the experimental condition of ASO/ScO treatment, the control neurons showed a few apoptotic bodies, but Aβ1–42 treatment resulted in marked increase in apoptosis (Fig. 4, A and B). However, ASO, but not ScO, against N-SMase markedly blocked Aβ1–42-induced neuronal apoptosis (Fig. 4, A and B). On the other hand, antisense knockdown of A-SMase had no effect on Aβ1–42-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B). After 18 h of treatment, Aβ1–42 reduced cell viability, as evidenced by a decrease in MTT metabolism (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, ASO against N-SMase, but not A-SMase, effectively prevented Aβ1–42-induced loss of MTT metabolism. Similarly, Aβ1–42 also induced an increase in LDH release, and treatment of cells with ASO against N-SMase, but not A-SMase, resulted in significant reduction in LDH release (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, ScO against N-SMase had no effect on Aβ1–42-induced loss of MTT metabolism and increase in LDH release (Fig. 4C). These studies suggest that activation of N-SMase, but not A-SMase, plays the key role in fibrillar Aβ1–42-mediated neuronal apoptosis and cell death. Involvement of Reactive Oxygen Species in Aβ1–42-induced Production of Ceramide and Activation of N-SMase in Human Primary Neurons—Next we investigated the mechanisms by which Aβ1–42 induced the activation of N-SMase in neurons. Earlier observations (12Singh I. Pahan K. Khan M. Singh A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20354-20362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Liu B. Andrieu-Abadie N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) that reactive oxygen species are involved in cytokine-induced production of ceramide and activation of N-SMase prompted us to investigate whether reactive oxygen species play a role in Aβ1–42-induced production of ceramide and activation of N-SMase in neurons. We examined the effect of antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and diphenyliodonium (DPI), on Aβ1–42-induced production of ceramide and activation of SMases. Interestingly, both NAC and DPI dose-dependently prevented Aβ1–42-induced generation of ceramide (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Aβ1–42-induced ceramide generation in neurons is redox-sensitive. Next, we investigated whether Aβ1–42-induced activation of N-SMase and/or A-SMase is/are redox-sensitive. Although both NAC and DPI dose-dependently inhibited Aβ1–42-induced activation of N-SMase (Fig. 5B), these two antioxidants had no effect on the activation of A-SMase (Fig. 5C), suggesting that Aβ1–42-induced activation of N-SMase, but not A-SMase, is redox-sensitive. Involvement of NADPH Oxidase in Aβ1–42-induced Activation of N-SMase in Human Primary Neurons—In an attempt to identify the reactive oxygen species-producing molecule that couples fibrillar Aβ1–42 to N-SMase in neurons, we examined the production of superoxide in response to fibrillar Aβ peptides using the LumiMax™ superoxide anion-detection kit (Stratagene). Interestingly, treatment of primary neurons with fibrillar Aβ1–42, but not Aβ42–1, peptides resulted in time-dependent release of superoxide (Fig. 6). The production of superoxide was observed as early as 30 s of stimulation, which peaked at 50 s of stimulation and decreased afterward. On the other hand, the production of superoxide by Aβ1–42 was close to the control value, even after 120 s of stimulation (Fig. 6). This Aβ1–42-induced production of superoxide was completely inhibited when the cells were pretreated with 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase for 15 min (data not shown). On the other hand, catalase (25 units/ml) had no effect on fibrillar Aβ1–42-induced superoxide production (data not shown), suggesting that the LumiMax™ superoxide kit detects superoxide but not H2O2. Because DPI inhibited Aβ1–42-induced activation of N-SMase (Fig. 5B), we examine"
https://openalex.org/W1984611855,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates caspase-12 in murine cells, triggering the ER stress-specific cascade for implementation of apoptosis. In C2C12 murine myoblast cells, activation of the cascade occurs without release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, suggesting that the cascade is independent of mitochondrial damage. Stable overexpression of Bcl-xL in C2C12 cells suppressed activation of caspase-12 and apoptosis. In ER-stressed cells, but not in normal cells, Bcl-xL was co-immunoprecipitated with Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, suggesting that Bcl-xL sequesters Bim, thereby inhibiting the apoptotic signaling. Fractionation of C2C12 cells revealed that ER stress led to translocation of Bim from a dynein-rich compartment to the ER, while stable overexpression of Bcl-xL suppressed accumulation of Bim on the ER. Although the toxic effect of Bim had been previously observed only at the mitochondrial outer membrane, overexpression of a Bim derivative, Bim(ER), targeted at the surface of the ER led to apoptosis. A C2C12 transfectant overexpressing the caspase-12 suppressor protein was resistant to Bim(ER), suggesting that the toxic effect of Bim on the ER is dependent on activation of caspase-12. Knockdown of Bim by RNA interference provided cells resistant to ER stress. These results suggest that translocation of Bim to the ER in response to ER stress is an important step toward activation of caspase-12 and initiation of the ER stress-specific caspase cascade.

Knockdown of Bim by RNA interference provided cells resistant to ER stress. These results suggest that translocation of Bim to the ER in response to ER stress is an important step toward activation of caspase-12 and initiation of the ER stress-specific caspase cascade. The caspase protease family plays a central role in the execution of apoptosis (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 2Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). It is broadly divided into two groups: initiator caspases, which are activated first and initiate a caspase cascade, and effector caspases, which mainly dismantle cellular structures. Caspases are synthesized as precursor proteins (procaspases). Initiator caspases undergo autoprocessing in response to apoptotic stimuli, while effector caspases are cleaved by initiator caspases for activation. There are three major apoptotic cascades triggered by specific initiator caspases: the death receptor pathway, the mitochondrial pathway, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; BH-3, Bcl-2 homology domain-3; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAGE-3, melanoma-associated antigen-3. pathway. These are activated by caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-12, respectively (3Mehmet H. Nature. 2000; 403: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 4Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). ER stress is caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, which occurs under a variety of conditions (e.g. mutation in secretory proteins or disruption of calcium homeostasis). This type of cellular stress is receiving increased attention because it is considered a cause of pathologically relevant apoptosis (5Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and is especially implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (6Arridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 7Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. Chan S.L. Leissring M.A. Shepel P.N. Geiger J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). ER stress activates caspase-12 on the surface of the ER, and caspase-12-deficient cells are resistant to ER stress inducers (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yaun J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar), indicating that caspase-12 is significant in ER stress-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism responsible for caspase-12 activation is largely unknown, unlike in the case of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 whose activation mechanisms have been revealed at the molecular level (9Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family regulates activation of caspase-9. Proteins of the Bcl-2 family have either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic functions (11Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic members are classified into two groups based on their structure, i.e. BH-3 (Bcl-2 homology domain-3) only proteins (e.g. Bad, Bid, and Bim), and multidomain pro-apoptotic members containing BH-1 through BH-3 (e.g. Bax and Bak). BH-3 only proteins can serve as intracellular death ligands proximal to multidomain pro-apoptotic members (13Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 14Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In response to apoptotic stimuli (e.g. death ligands, mitogen withdrawal), BH-3 only proteins translocate to mitochondria and induce conformational changes in Bax and Bak, which activate them. These activated multidomain proteins, in turn, cause an increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. The released cytochrome c, together with Apaf-1, activates caspase-9 (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar, 16Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinicasula S.M. Ahamad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

The lack of either Bax or Bak is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis, but double knock-out cells are highly resistant to a variety of apoptotic stimuli including ER stress (17Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E. H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). Evidently, Bax and Bak have mutually redundant functions. Anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) exert their anti-apoptotic actions either by heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic members, especially BH-3 only proteins (18Cheng E.H.

Although it had been thought that cytochrome c released from mitochondria is required for caspase-9 activation (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar, 16Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinicasula S.M. Ahamad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6236) Google Scholar), we have shown that caspase-12 can activate caspase-9 directly without cytochrome c release in C2C12 myoblast cells under ER stress (22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The active caspase-9, in turn, activates a downstream caspase such as caspase-3. We have proposed the existence of an ER stress-specific caspase cascade consisting of caspase-12, -9, and -3 (22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Other studies also show that caspase-9 activation can occur in an Apaf-1-independent, and thus cytochrome c-independent, manner (23Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Shuler M.

In some cell lines, however, ER stress induces cytochrome c release (24Häcki J. Egger L. Monney L. Conus S.T.R. Fellay I. Borner C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 25Ito Y. Mishra N. Kumar S. Narula N. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6233-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) by an unknown pathway. Therefore, it is likely that the activation of caspase-9 and its downstream effector caspases can be achieved in ER stress-induced apoptosis either by caspase-12 or by the Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex (22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Since ER stress-induced caspase activation in C2C12 myoblast cells is independent of cytochrome c release and the mitochondrial pathway, this model provides the opportunity to analyze activation of caspase-12 without these complications. We have taken advantage of this to examine the possible involvement of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family in the activation step. Our results suggest that ER stress induces translocation of Bim, which is associated with cytoplasmic dynein in healthy cells (26Puthalakath H. David C.S. Huang D.C.S. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), to the ER, causing activation of caspase-12. Reagents—Tunicamycin and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem. Etoposide was obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—C2C12 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Adding either tunicamycin or thapsigargin induced apoptosis. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed by fluorescence microscopic observation of cells stained with a MitoSensor reagent (Clontech), as described previously (22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—C2C12 cells were scraped from culture dishes to obtain attached cells, and the culture medium was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to obtain dying cells. All the following steps were carried out at either 0 °C or 4 °C. Cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, containing aprotinin (Sigma), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Immediately after homogenization, sucrose was added to 250 mm, nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 3 min, and the heavy membrane (mitochondria-rich) fraction was sedimented by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was split into the S-100 (cytosol) and the light membrane (ER) fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Western Blot Analysis—Denatured proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12 or 14% acrylamide) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). For immunoblotting we used antibodies against caspase-12 (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yaun J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar), cytochrome c (Pharmingen), caspase-3 (BD Transduction Laboratories), hemeoxygenase I (Stressgen), BiP (BD Transduction Laboratories), CHOP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase-9 (Medical and Biological Laboratory, Nagoya, Japan), Bcl-xL (BD Transduction Laboratory), Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bid (R&D Systems), Bad (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bim (Calbiochem), Bnip3 (Chemicon), Bak (Oncogene), and Bax (Oncogene). Plasmid Construction—We amplified the full-length human Bcl-xL cDNA containing codons 1–234 and a partial Bcl-xL cDNA (codons 1–213) lacking the C-terminal membrane-binding region (27Rudner J. Lepple-Wienhues A. Budach W. Berschauer J. Friedrich B. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4161-4172PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR, introducing NheI and XhoI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The ER-targeted Bcl-xL(ER) was generated by ligating the partial Bcl-xL cDNA with a cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal targeting sequence (ITTVESNSSWWTNWVIPAISALAVALMYRLYMAED) of cytochrome b5 (27Rudner J.

Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The mitochondria targeted version (Bcl-xL(Mito)) was constructed using the same truncated Bcl-xL cDNA and a cDNA fragment corresponding to the hydrophobic C-terminal region (LILAMLAIGVFSLGAFIKIIQLRKNN) of Listeria monocytogenes ActA protein (27Rudner J.

Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The cytosolic version of Bcl-xL (Bcl-xLdel) was made by deleting the membrane binding sequence and inserting a stop codon. A FLAG-tagged Bcl-xL(ER) was constructed by inserting the Bcl-xL(ER) DNA fragment into the pCMVTag2C vector (Stratagene). The ER-targeted mutant of Bim (Bim(ER)) was created by insertion of Bim cDNA fused with the cytochrome b5 partial cDNA into the NheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). RNAi—Hairpin siRNA inserts were chemically synthesized and cloned into the pSilencer 3.0 vector (Ambion). The sequences of the targeted site are: sense, 5′-GGTGGACAATTGCAGCCTG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CAGGCTGCAATTGTCCACC-3′. C2C12 cells were transfected at 40–50% confluence in 6-well plates with 1.2 μg of pSilencer plasmid DNAs and 0.3 μg of pEGFP. N2 (BD Clontech) using a Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were incubated for 72 h, during which time the synthesis of Bim was suppressed by the hairpin siRNAs, and then incubated for another 24 h in fresh medium with or without tunicamycin (2 μg/ml). To detect green fluorescent protein (GFP), cells were observed under an AX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured with an ORCA-cooled charge-coupled camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). Stable Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—Transfectants of C2C12 cells stably expressing Bcl-xL were generated as follows. The Bcl-xL plasmid DNAs were linearized by either ScaI or ApaLI digestion before transfection with a Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectants were grown in a medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks before cloning, and positive clones were detected by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using an anti-Bcl-xL antibody. The FLAG-tagged Bcl-xL(ER) was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (M2) affinity resin (Sigma) as described previously (22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Prolonged ER Stress Induces Activation of Caspase-12—ER stress-induced apoptosis is preceded by activation of a cytoprotective signaling cascade termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (29Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 30Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The UPR is an adaptive response, which alters transcriptional and translational programs to cope with the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Although protein synthesis is generally down-regulated in the UPR, which decreases a load in the ER, the UPR, on the other hand, induces a group of specific proteins, including molecular chaperones. We examined the time course of caspase-12 activation and compared it with that of the UPR-specific up-regulation. Treatment of C2C12 cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation in the ER, caused induction of BiP, an ER resident molecular chaperon, and CHOP, an ER stress-specific transcription factor (31Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X.-Z. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Induction of these proteins started and persisted after no more than 4 h of tunicaymycin treatment. After ∼20 h of tunicamycin treatment, C2C12 cells started to show apoptotic morphology (Ref. 22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar and data not shown). At around the same time, 20 h, activation of caspase-12 was detected by Western blot analysis, as the active form of caspase-12 (∼35 kDa) (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yaun J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar), in addition to the 48-kDa precursor (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that although it takes about 20 h for ER stress to initiate activation of caspase-12 under the conditions used, caspase-12, once activated, efficiently induces apoptosis within a relatively short time period, as observed in the cases of the death receptor and the mitochondrial pathways (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar, 32Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that an intracellular event leading to the activation of caspase-12 takes place at around or just before 20 h of tunicmycin treatment. Bcl-xL Can Suppress ER Stress-induced Apoptosis—To explore the regulation mechanism of caspase-12 activation, we tested whether an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL, could suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis in C2C12 cells. A recent study shows that Bcl-xL is predominantly localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane, due to the presence of the C-terminal signal sequence (33Kaufmann T. Schlipf S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, Bcl-2, which lacks a strong localization signal of this kind, is distributed between several intracellular membranous structures and could presumably function in these different organelles. We anticipated that Bcl-xL might not be able to suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis, because ER stress-induced caspase activation in C2C12 occurs in the absence of cytochrome c release from mitochondria, being independent of the mitochondrial pathway (22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of cytochrome c release, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was maintained in apoptotic cells after induction of apoptosis by ER stress inducers, tunicamycin and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the ER-specific calcium ATPase. In contrast, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in apoptotic C2C12 cells under other conditions (Fig. 2A). Preliminary data showed, however, that transient overexpression of Bcl-xL provided resistance to ER stress (data not shown). We therefore established stable transfectants (C2C12/Bcl-xL) that overexpressed Bcl-xL (Fig. 2B). Apoptosis of the parental C2C12 cells (Fig. 2C) or a vector-control line (C2C12/vec2 described in Ref. 22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) was induced by the ER stress inducers, tunicamycin and thapsigargin. Approximately 40% of the C2C12 cells exhibited apoptotic morphology after 24-h exposure to the inducers (Fig. 2C) (22Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, C2C12/Bcl-xL cells displayed only the same low background level, <2%, of apoptosis observed in untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis showed that tunicamycin treatment did not activate caspase-12 in the C2C12/Bcl-xL cells (Fig. 2D), but it did in the parental C2C12 cells (Fig. 1A). This indicates that Bcl-xL on the mitochondrial outer membrane suppresses apoptosis by inhibiting procaspase-12 activation that presumably occurs on the surface of the ER (34Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mitochondrial Bcl-xL prevents pro-apoptotic ligands from translocating to the ER in response to ER stress for caspase-12 activation, as already suggested in connection with the inhibitory action of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 on the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway (18Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). To obtain supporting evidence that Bcl-xL can suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis not by a direct effect on the mitochondrial outer membrane but by sequestration of cytoplasmic proteins, we established and analyzed C2C12 transfectants stably overexpressing ER-targeted Bcl-xL (Bcl-xL(ER)). For this purpose, we replaced the C-terminal membrane-associated portion of Bcl-xL with a potent ER-targeting signal sequence from cytochrome b5 (28Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As controls, Bcl-xL mutants whose C-terminal portion was either deleted (Bcl-xLdel) or replaced with the mitochondria-targeting sequence of ActA protein (28Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) were also created. These ER-targeting and mitochondria-targeting signal sequences have been successfully used with Bcl-2 (27Rudner J. Lepple-Wienhues A. Budach W. Berschauer J. Friedrich B. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4161-4172PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and Bak (35Zong W.-X. Li C. Hatzivassoliou G. Lindsten T. Yu Q.-C. Yuan J. Thompson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). As in the case of C2C12/Bcl-xL, a stable transfectant overexpressing the ER-targeted Bcl-xL (Fig. 2B) was also resistant to ER stress inducers (Fig. 2C), and caspase-12 was again not activated (Fig. 2E). Induction of CHOP in these Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells suggests that ER stress is actually generated by ER stress inducers in these transfectants (Fig. 2F), while apoptotic signaling connecting ER stress to activation of caspase-12 is suppressed by Bcl-xL. Suppression of apoptosis and caspase-12 activation in the presence of ER stress was also observed with both the mitochondria-targeted and the deletion mutants of Bcl-xL (data not shown). These results indicate that Bcl-xL can probably suppress apoptosis regardless of its location provided that it can physically interact with the pro-apoptotic ligands. Bim Is Specifically Associated with Bcl-xL in Cells under ER Stress—To identify the pro-apoptotic ligands that are sequestered by Bcl-xL, we immunoprecipitated Bcl-xL proteins in stable C2C12 transfectants. For efficient recovery of the pro-apoptotic molecules involved in ER stress-specific caspase activation, we FLAG-tagged the N terminus of the ER-targeted Bcl-xL and established a stable cell line overexpressing it (C2C12/FLBX/ER). The C2C12/FLBX/ER cells, which were resistant to ER stress (data not shown), were exposed to tunicamycin, and the FLAG-tagged Bcl-xL(ER) was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3A). The immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies against pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including BH-3 only proteins (Bim, Bad, Bid, and Bnip3) and multidomain proteins (Bax and Bak), as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Bim, Bad, and Bid were found in the immunoprecipitates from tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. 3, B–D), but the other proteins were not detected in the immunoprecipitates from the untreated cells or from the stressed cells (data not shown). The anti-FLAG antibody did not precipitate these proteins in the parental C2C12 cells (Fig. 3, A–D, Control). It is likely that Bcl-xL sequesters these BH-3-only proteins, some of which, if not all, play a role in activation of the ER stress-specific caspase cascade in C2C12 cells under ER stress conditions. Bad and Bid were efficiently recovered through immunoprecipitation from both the untreated cells and the stressed cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, Bim was not coprecipitated with Bcl-xL(ER) in untreated cells, while it was specifically captured by Bcl-xL(ER) in the presence of ER stress (Fig. 3B). Previous studies showed that the cytoplasmic dynein complex in healthy cells sequesters Bim. The release of Bim from dynein and the subsequent translocation to mitochondria has been reported for the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway (26Puthalakath H. David C.S. Huang D.C.S. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The result of immunoprecipitation suggests that ER stress also triggers the release of Bim. ER Stress Induces ER Accumulation of Bim—We next examined whether pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family are translocated to the ER during ER stress-induced apoptosis, especially focusing on the behavior of Bim. To analyze the intracellular localization of pro-apoptotic proteins in healthy cells, we fractionated postnuclear extracts of untreated C2C12 cells into the heavy membrane (mitochondria-rich), S-100 (cytosol), and light membrane (the ER-rich) fractions. The purity of each fraction or the absence of cross-contamination was checked by Western blot analysis of marker proteins representing the mitochondria, cytosol, and the ER fractions: cytochrome c, procaspase-3, and hemeoxygenase I, respectively (Fig. 4A). To examine the intracellular distribution of pro-apoptotic proteins in healthy cells, we immunoblotted proteins in each fraction equivalent to ∼7 × 105 cells. In healthy cells, Bim proteins were predominantly localized in the heavy membrane fraction, in which cytoplasmic dynein was efficiently recovered (Fig. 4B). The majority of Bad and Bid were detected in the S-100 fraction. The multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak were mainly detected in the S-100 and the mitochondrial fractions, respectively, as has been observed in other cell lines (36Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Yo"

These interactions among receptors, adaptors, and scaffolding proteins are highly regulated processes that can be controlled by phosphorylation events (3Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Methods such as yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation, and affinity chromatography using immobilized receptor fragments as bait have been used to identify potential receptor-binding proteins. The proposed functional roles of these interacting proteins are very diverse. Examples include promotion or inhibition of agonist-induced receptor internalization (6Xia Z. Gray J.A.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a number of cases have been described where a specific adaptor protein has been biochemically and/or functionally linked to a single or several related receptors. However, to what degree such interactions are of general importance for 7TM receptors or for specific subsets of receptors or, in fact, only a single or a few receptors is in most cases still unclear. To address the question of the importance of specific adaptor scaf-folding proteins for the function of 7TM receptors in general, we chose a systematic biochemical approach by establishing a library of 7TM receptor tails fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). 7TM receptors expose several intracellular loops for potential interaction with intracellular proteins. However, it is especially the C-terminal tail of the receptors that interacts with adaptor and scaffolding proteins (17Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although, for example, intracellular loop 3 is critically involved in the recognition process between the receptor and transducer/effector molecules such as the heterotrimeric G proteins and arrestins, these proteins also interact with parts of the C-terminal receptor tail (26Wong S.K. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Cen B. Xiong Y. Ma L. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28DeGraff J.L.

Thus, the tail contains recognition sequences and epitopes for effector as well as scaffolding proteins. Besides the so-called “helix VIII” region, i.e. a relatively short, amphipathic, and helical segment located between the intracellular end of TM-VII and a frequently occurring palmitoylated Cys motif, very little information is available concerning the secondary and tertiary structures of 7TM receptor tails, which in the available x-ray structures have appeared to be rather un-ordered (31Schwartz T.W. Holst B. Foreman J.C. Johansen T. Textbook of Receptor Pharmacology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2003: 81-109Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is known that recognition motifs for adaptor and scaffolding proteins in the tails can be coiled-coil domains or C-terminally located PDZ recognition sequences (32Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 33Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In this study, proteins proposed to be involved in post-endocytotic sorting of receptors were probed for interactions with the library of 7TM receptor tail-fusion proteins. The vast majority of 7TM receptors are internalized upon agonist stimulation. In the classical, arrestin-mediated pathway, the activated receptor is phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, which leads to recruitment of arrestin. Arrestin functions as an adaptor protein interacting with clathrin and AP2, thereby targeting the receptor to clathrin-coated pits and subsequent endocytosis. Following endocytosis, the receptors may enter one of two pathways (see Fig. 1). In the recycling pathway, which has been described for the β2-adrenergic receptor, the μ-opioid receptor, and the tachykinin NK1 receptor, the ligand dissociates in the acidic pH of the endosomal compartment and the receptor is dephosphorylated and subsequently returned to the plasma membrane. In contrast, in the lysosomal pathway used by the δ-opioid receptor and protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), the receptor is targeted for degradation in lysosomes. The mechanism behind this targeted sorting of receptors is poorly understood. However, a number of proteins have been proposed to govern the differential sorting event. ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50, also called Na+/H+-exchanger regulatory factor) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) have both been suggested to be responsible for the recycling of the β2-adrenergic receptor (21Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 22Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), which originally was demonstrated to be required for the lysosomal sorting of the epidermal growth factor receptor, was recently suggested to be involved in the lysosomal sorting of PAR1 as well (24Wang Y. Zhou Y. Szabo K. Haft C.R. Trejo J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protease-activated receptors are irreversibly activated by enzymatic digestion of the N-terminal segment of the receptor, and the sorting of activated receptors to lysosomes rather than recycling is critical for terminating signaling for these receptors. Another protein called G protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein (GASP) was recently suggested to be involved in the preferential lysosomal sorting of the δ-opioid receptor (23Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the four proteins, EBP50, NSF, SNX1, and GASP, which have been proposed to function as adaptor proteins involved in the post-endocytotic sorting of 7TM receptors, are structurally very different and have been implicated in various other cellular functions. Here, these proteins are probed for their ability to bind to the C-terminal tails of 59 different 7TM receptors as determined by GST pull-down assays, which routinely have been used to confirm protein interactions identified by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid screening (8Hu L.A.

The metabolite 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate is not only an intermediate of the MEP pathway for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate but is also involved in the biosynthesis of thiamin (vitamin B1) and pyridoxal (vitamin B6) in plants and many microorganisms. Herein we report the first isolation and characterization of most downstream intermediates of the MEP pathway in the three intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. These include, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate, 4-(cytidine-5-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol, 4-(cytidine-5-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate, and 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate. These intermediates were purified by HPLC and structurally characterized via biochemical and electrospray mass spectrometric analyses. We have also investigated the effect of fosmidomycin on the biosynthesis of each intermediate of this pathway and isoprenoid biosynthesis (dolichols and ubiquinones). For the first time, therefore, it is demonstrated that the MEP pathway is functionally active in all intraerythrocytic forms of P. falciparum, and de novo biosynthesis of pyridoxal in a protozoan is reported. Its absence in the human host makes both pathways very attractive as potential new targets for antimalarial drug development.

Malaria is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the tropics, with 300 to 500 million clinical cases and 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths per year. Nearly all fatal cases are caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The resistance of this parasite to conventional antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine is growing at an alarming rate and therefore new efficient drugs are urgently needed (1Moore S.A. Surgey E.G.

In all organisms studied so far, the biosynthesis of isoprenoids such as dolichol, cholesterol, and ubiquinones depends on the condensation of the different numbers of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; MEP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate; DOXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate; DOX, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose; CDP-ME, 4-(cytidine-5-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol; CDP-MEP, 4-(cytidine-5-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate; ME-2,4-cPP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; ESI-QTOF-MS, ESI-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Qn, Coenzyme Qn. and dimethylallyl diphosphate units.

However, in higher plants, in several algae, in some eubacteria, and in P. falciparum the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway was described as the alternative non-mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of IPP (for reviews, see Refs. 5Lichtenthaler H.K.

These units are used for the biosynthesis of ubiquinones and dolichols, and for the prenylation of proteins and other products (33Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D.

They also demonstrated that an amino-terminal signal sequence in 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase targeted the enzyme to apicoplasts. Furthermore, this group demonstrated that fosmidomycin and FR900098 are able to inhibit growth of P. falciparum in culture and to cure mice infected with the related malaria parasite, Plasmodium vinckei (21Jomaa H.

In several organisms, DOXP is also used for both thiamin (vitamin B1) (39White R.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3833-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and pyridoxal (vitamin B6) biosynthesis (40Hill R.E. Himmeldirk K. Kennedy I.A. Pauloski R.M. Sayer B.G. Wolf E.

The term vitamin B6 is used to refer collectively to the compound pyridoxine (pyridoxol) and its vitamers pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives. Vitamin B6 is essential for all organisms and plays a key role as a co-factor in many metabolic conversions of amino acids. All organisms have an efficient salvage pathway that interconvert between the various vitameric forms and their phosphorylated derivatives. Plants, fungi, bacteria, archaebacteria, and protists synthesize pyridoxine, for which two independent and exclusive biosynthetic machineries exist. One machinery consists of the pdxA, pdxB, pdxJ, and pdxH genes, restricted to some eubacteria like Escherichia coli. The other machinery is characterized by the presence of two genes, pdx1 and pdx2, and seems to be broadly distributed in plants, fungi, archaebacteria, and some eubacteria (43Ehrenshaft M. Bilski P.

The pathway for de novo vitamin B6 biosynthesis was extensively characterized in E. coli (40Hill R.E. Himmeldirk K. Kennedy I.A. Pauloski R.M. Sayer B.G. Wolf E. Spenser I.D. J. Biol.

Very recently, the enzymatic function of the pdx2 gene product has been demonstrated, with glutamine amidotransferase activity (49Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 50Bauer J.A. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2704-2711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of the product encoded by pdx1 was recently inferred by Wetzel and colleagues (51Wetzel D.K. Ehrenshaft M. Denslow S.A. Daub M.E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using cross-complementation analysis to determine a functional relationship between pdx1 and pdxJ. It has been suggested that pdx1 is involved in the pyridoxine ring closure reaction. The P. falciparum genome contains a pdx1 homologue (PlasmoDB ID code MAL6P1.215) suggesting that the parasite could possibly synthesize pyridoxine. Because of their absence in human cells, both the MEP pathway and perhaps the de novo synthesis of vitamin B6 are excellent molecular targets for the development of new antimalarial drugs. Furthermore, in-depth knowledge of the biosynthesis of intermediates could refine the search for news drugs aimed at the inhibition of each intermediate of the corresponding pathways. On the other hand, the presence of genes or their transcripts does not necessarily prove that the corresponding proteins are metabolically active. For this reason, the active metabolic pathway must be demonstrated. In this report, we demonstrate by biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses the presence of most of the intermediates of the MEP pathway and an active de novo biosynthesis of pyridoxine in blood stage forms of the malaria parasite.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14452-14461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The gas mixture of the tissue culture flasks (75 cm2) consisted of 5.05% CO2, 4.93% O2, and 90.2% N2. Parasite development and multiplication were monitored by microscopic evaluation of Giemsa-stained thin smears. Ring (1–20 h after reinvasion), trophozoite (20–30 h after reinvasion), and schizont (30–45 h after reinvasion) forms were purified on a 40/70/80% discontinuous Percoll® gradient (10,000 × g, 30 min, 25 °C) (55Braun-Breton C. Jendoubi M. Brunet E. Perrin L. Scaife J. Pereira da Silva L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the fraction containing the ring stage and uninfected erythrocytes (80%), parasites were isolated by treatment with 0.1% (w/v) saponin for 5 min followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Some experiments were carried out with synchronized parasites in the ring, trophozoite, or schizont stages. Cultures were synchronized by two treatments with 5% (w/v) d-sorbitol solution in water (56Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). Fosmidomycin was diluted in culture medium and was used at 5, 2.5, 1.25, 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.1 μm concentrations. Inhibition tests were carried out in flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Falcon). The method of Desjardins et al. (57Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar) was used to determine the IC50 value. Briefly, ring-stage parasite cultures (200 μl per well, with 5% hematocrit and 0.5% parasitemia) were exposed to increasing drug concentrations. After 24 h in culture, [G-3H]hypoxanthine was added (5 μCi/ml final), and after an additional 24-h incubation period, cells were harvested. All tests were done in triplicate. Suspensions of similarly treated, uninfected erythrocytes were used for background determination. Parasitemia and parasite morphology was determined by microscopic analysis of Giemsa-stained blood smears immediately before and at the end of the assays. The IC50 value of growth inhibition was calculated using Probit Analysis (Minitab Statistical Software 13.30™, Minitab Inc.). The experiments with labeled parasites were performed using two different protocols. Protocol 1—Asynchronous cultures of P. falciparum with ∼10% parasitemia untreated or pretreated with 1 μm fosmidomycin for 30 h were labeled for 18 h with [2-14C]DOXP (1.56 μCi/ml), [1-14C]sodium acetate (6.25 μCi/ml), d-[U-14C]glucose (6.25 μCi/ml), or l-[35S]methionine (25 μCi/ml) in the presence of 1 μm fosmidomycin. Radiolabeled amino acid l-[35S]methionine was incorporated into 10 mm methionine-deficient RPMI. For the metabolic labeling with d-[U-14C]glucose all cultures were incubated in glucose-deficient medium (2 g/liter) for 2 h before the addition of the radioactive precursor. Each parasite stage (ring, trophozoite, and schizont) was purified on a discontinuous Percoll® gradient and stored in liquid N2 for subsequent HPLC analysis. Before being stored or protein-extracted, parasites were separated from red blood cells by incubating with 20 pellet volumes of 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g at 4 °C). For analysis by SDS-PAGE each stage was then purified as described above, followed by lysis of the cells in twice their volume of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm Na p-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After incubation for 15 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and supernatants were stored in liquid N2 (54Kimura E.A. Couto A.S. Peres V.J. Casal O.L. Katzin A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14452-14461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protocol 2—Synchronous cultures of P. falciparum starting in ring, trophozoite, or schizont stages with ∼10% parasitemia were labeled with [1-14C]sodium acetate (6.25 μCi/ml), and recovered for analysis in trophozoite, schizont, and ring stages, respectively. The parasites were separated from erythrocytes by treatment with 0.1% (w/v) saponin as described above and stored in liquid N2 for subsequent HPLC analysis. Each purified parasite stage was freeze-dried and successively extracted with hexane (3× 0.5 ml) and ethanol/water (1:1, v/v; 1× 1mlat 55 °C for 1.5 h). Aliquots of each extract were monitored for radioactivity with a Beckman LS 5000 TD β-counter. Samples were analyzed using a Gilson HPLC 322 pump (Gilson, Villiers-le-Bel, France) and a gradient module connected to a 152 UV-visible detector, a temperature regulator 831, and a fraction collector FC203B (Gilson, Villiers-le-Bel, France). UNIPOINT™ Software (Gilson Inc.) was used as the operational and analytical system. For comparison of the influence of fosmidomycin treatment on the biosynthesis of the different intermediates, the same quantities of treated or untreated parasites were analyzed. Percent inhibition was determined as follows: [100–(number of cpm in treated parasites × 100/number of cpm in untreated parasites)]. The ethanol/water fraction was dephosphorylated with hydrofluoric acid (50%, v/v) for 3 h at room temperature, then neutralized with LiOH and analyzed by HPLC using an Aminex® HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 cm, Bio-Rad) eluted with 6 mm H2SO4 at 65 °C. Standards of pyridoxine and DOX were detected at 190 nm with retention times of 6.75 and 12 min, respectively. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. The aliquots were collected at 0.5-min intervals, neutralized with BaOH, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting, or mass spectroscopic analysis in samples without previous labeling (12Sprenger G.A. Schorken U. Wiegert T. Grolle S. de Graaf A.A. Taylor S.V. Begley T.P. Bringer-Meyer S. Sahm H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12857-12862Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Samples from parasites labeled with [1-14C]sodium acetate were first purified using Aminex® HPX-87H columns as mentioned above. The fractions corresponding to a retention time of 6.75 min were recovered, neutralized, and re-chromatographed by HPLC using an Ultrasphere ODS Beckman column (4.6 mm × 25 cm, 5 μm). The mobile phase was prepared by mixing 25% of methanol with 75% of a 5 mm solution of sodium hexanesulfonate containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The pyridoxine standard was detected at 270 nm with a retention time of 17 min. The aliquots were collected at 1-min intervals and subjected to liquid scintillation counting (58Kirchmeier R.L. Upton R.P. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1978; 67: 1444-1446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ethanol/water fractions were analyzed using an Ultrasphere ODS Beckman column (4.6 mm × 25 cm, 5 μm). The eluents were 20 mmN′,N-dimethylhexylamine in 10% methanol with the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with formic acid (solvent A) and 50% methanol containing 2 mmN′,N-dimethylhexylamine, pH 7.0 (solvent B). The HPLC gradient was 10 to 50% methanol in 50 min. The eluent was monitored at 270 nm and the flow rate was 0.75 ml/min. The aliquots were collected at 1-min intervals and subjected to liquid scintillation counting, or ESI-QTOF-MS analysis in unlabeled samples (59Monkkonen H. Moilanen P. Monkkonen J. Frith J.C. Rogers M.J. Auriola S. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2000; 738: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The hexane fraction was analyzed using an Ultrasphere ODS Beckman column (4.6 mm × 25 cm, 5 μm). The gradient elution system used was methanol/water (9:1, v/v; solvent A) and hexane/propan-2-ol/methanol (1:1:2, v/v/v; solvent B). A linear gradient was run from 5 to 100% of B over a period of 25 min. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 210 nm. Fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals and aliquots were subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Geraniol, geraniolgeraniol, farnesol, dolichol 11, Prenol C40–60, and Prenol C80–110 were used as standards and co-injected with the samples (60Couto A.S. Kimura E.A. Peres V.J. Uhrig M.L. Katzin A.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The hexane fraction was analyzed using an Ultrasphere ODS Beckman column (4.6 mm × 25 cm, 5 μm). Hexane/methanol (75:25, v/v) was used as the solvent system at 1 ml/min flow rate. Standards were detected at 275 nm. One-min fractions were collected and aliquots were monitored for radioactivity. Authentic standards of Q7–10 were co-injected with the sample (61de Macedo C.S. Uhrig M.L. Kimura E.A. Katzin A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 207: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structural characterization of DOX, MEP, CDP-ME, CDP-MEP, and ME-2,4-cPP were accomplished by using 2.5 × 109 parasites obtained from 160 ml of unlabeled asynchronous cultures of P. falciparum. The same number of uninfected erythrocytes was analyzed in parallel. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) were performed with a Finnigan LCQ-Duo ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Samples were run in the positive-ion mode with capillary voltage and temperature set at 4.52 kV and 247.8 °C, respectively, in the 50–500 mass-to-charge (m/z) range. For ESI-MS/MS analysis a relative collision energy of 30% (1.5 eV) was applied, and the sheath (N2) and collision helium gas pressures were 1.5 mTorr and 4 p.s.i., respectively. Samples were dissolved in a methanol/water (1:1, v/v), 0.1% formic acid mixture, and analyzed by direct injection using a Harvard Syringe pump model 11 (Harvard Inc., Holliston, MA), operating at 5–10 μl/min flow rate. ESI-QTOF-MS data with high resolution and high mass accuracy were collected in the negative-ion mode using an electrospray ionization hybrid quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Q-TOF, Waters, Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) (62Sabino A.A.

We investigated the function of the histone H3/H4 chaperones anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1p) and chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) in vivo. Analysis of chromatin structure by accessibility to micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion demonstrated that the chromatin from CAF-1 mutant yeast has increased accessibility to these enzymes. In agreement, the supercoiling of the endogenous 2μ plasmid is reduced in yeast lacking CAF-1. These results indicate that CAF-1 mutant yeast globally under-assemble their genome into chromatin, consistent with a role for CAF-1 in chromatin assembly in vivo. By contrast, asf1 mutants globally over-assemble their genome into chromatin, as suggested by decreased accessibility of their chromatin to micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion and increased supercoiling of the endogenous 2μ plasmid. Deletion of ASF1 causes a striking loss of acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9, but this is not responsible for the altered chromatin structure in asf1 mutants. These data indicate that Asf1p may have a global role in chromatin disassembly and an unexpected role in histone acetylation in vivo.

These data indicate that Asf1p may have a global role in chromatin disassembly and an unexpected role in histone acetylation in vivo. The eukaryotic genome is assembled into an ordered nucleoprotein structure known as chromatin. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which comprises ∼147 bp of DNA wound 1.75 times around an octamer of core histones (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6927) Google Scholar). The core histone octamer includes two molecules each of histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B and is deposited in a stepwise manner onto DNA (2Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). First, a heterotetramer of histones H3 and H4 is deposited onto the DNA, followed by deposition of a heterodimer of histones H2A and H2B on either side of H3/H4 to complete the nucleosome. The packaging of the genome into chromatin mainly occurs immediately following DNA replication. Biochemical approaches have been used to identify chromatin assembly factors that mediate the assembly of newly replicated DNA into chromatin. This approach has been particularly useful in the identification of the histone chaperones that mediate the deposition of histones H3 and H4 onto newly replicated DNA in vitro, which is the first step in the chromatin assembly process. Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: CAF-1, chromatin assembly factor 1; ASF1, anti-silencing function 1; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; WT, wild type. was discovered over a decade ago as a factor that is required to complement a crude extract in order to deposit H3 and H4 onto newly replicated DNA in vitro (3Smith S. Stillman B. Cell. 1989; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The preference of CAF-1 for newly replicated DNA appears to be mediated via its interaction with the replication protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (4Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). A second H3 and H4 histone chaperone, termed anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1), was identified by fractionation of a crude extract. ASF1 can assemble unreplicated DNA into chromatin (5Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and is also required to facilitate CAF-1-mediated assembly of newly replicated DNA into chromatin in vitro (5Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Because of the artifactual nature of biochemical chromatin assembly systems (reviewed in Ref. 2Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it is imperative that the function of histone chaperones be examined in vivo. Recent evidence indicates that CAF-1 may well be a chromatin assembly factor in human cells. Removal of CAF-1 by short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity of bulk chromatin to micrococcal nuclease digestion, indicating that the chromatin is less well packaged in the absence of CAF-1 (6Nabatiyan A. Krude T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2853-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether ASF1 is a chromatin assembly factor in vivo, as global effects of ASF1 on chromatin structure in vivo have not been reported. ASF1 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, and its inactivation leads to a broad range of cellular defects (5Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 7Singer M.S. Kahana A. Wolf A.J. Meisinger L.L. Peterson S.E. Goggin C. Mahowald M. Gottschling D.E.

A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of which is unclear. By contrast to the in vitro role of ASF1 as a chromatin assembly factor, we have recently discovered that yeast ASF1 (Asf1p) mediates chromatin disassembly at the PHO5 and PHO8 promoters in vivo (12Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence suggesting that Asf1p is a global chromatin disassembly factor in yeast, whereas CAF-1 is a global chromatin assembly factor in vivo. Furthermore, we have found that Asf1p plays an unexpected role in acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast cultures and genetic manipulations were performed following standard methods (25Adams A.G. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). The genotypes of all strains used in this study are described in Table I. The H4K4Q strain carries substitutions of lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16 to glutamate in histone H4, and the H3tailΔ strain has the N terminus of histone H3 deleted (amino acids 1–28). Yeast strains were grown to a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose for all analyses.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainStrain backgroundGenotypeSourceROY1172W303MAT α ade2-1 LYS2 leu2-3,112 his3-11 trp1-1 ura3-1 TELVIIL::URA3 HMRa:ADE2 can1-100Tyler et al.

Open table in a new tab MNase and DNase I Analysis—Equal amounts of nuclei were digested with increasing concentrations of micrococcal nuclease MNase (Sigma) or DNase I (Worthington) as described previously (26Gregory P.D. Horz W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated and electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Supercoiling Analysis—30 ml of the indicated yeast strains were grown to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml, sedimented, resuspended in 400 μl of resuspension buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm EDTA, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide), 500 μl of phenol, and 200 μl of 0.5-mm glass beads, and then vortexed for 30 s followed by 30 s on ice. This was repeated three times. DNA was deproteinized by the addition of SDS to 0.5% final concentration and Proteinase K (50 μg/ml final concentration), and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in 400 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer with RNase A (50 μg/ml final concentration) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. DNA was ethanol-precipitated, and 15 μ g of DNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.75 μg/ml chloroquine. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a P32-labeled 2-kb EcoRI fragment from the 2μ plasmid. Western Blotting Analysis of Histones—Equivalent numbers of cells (1 × 107) grown in log phase were centrifuged and washed in 1 volume of double distilled H2O. The pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer (0.06 m Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) 2-mercapthoethanol, and 0.0025 (w/v) bromphenol blue). 10 μl of each whole cell extract was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Equal amounts of nuclei were isolated as described previously (26Gregory P.D. Horz W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer. 10 μl of each nuclei extract was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used: H3 (Abcam), H4 (Cell Signaling), H2A (Upstate), H2B (Abcam), AcH3K9 (Cell Signaling), AcH3K9K14 (Upstate), AcH3K18 (Cell Signaling), AcH3K23 (Cell Signaling), AcH3K27 (Upstate), AcH4 (Upstate), AcH4K8 (Cell Signaling), AcH4K12 (Cell Signaling), Tubulin (Serotec), and Nup1 (Covance). Densitometric Tracings—Quantitation was performed using Labworks (UVP, Inc.). The pixel intensity within each lane was determined and graphed using Microsoft Excel. Microarray Analyses—Sample preparation and array processing were performed according to Affymetrix GeneChip® protocols. Microarray data was analyzed with Affymetrix and GeneSpring software; the log average and standard deviation for three independent experiments is shown. Loss of CAF-1 Leads to a Subtle Increase in Accessibility to Micrococcal Nuclease, whereas Loss of Asf1p Leads to Decreased Accessibility to Micrococcal Nuclease—To determine whether Asf1p and CAF-1 assemble chromatin in vivo, we examined the structure of chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing deletions of the ASF1 (asf1Δ) or CAC1 (cac1Δ) genes. CAF-1 is a heterotrimeric complex encoded by the CAC1/RLF2, CAC2, and CAC3/MSI1 genes in yeast. CAF-1 can be inactivated by deleting any of its three encoding genes because deletion of the gene that encodes any one subunit of CAF-1 or all three subunits of CAF-1 has identical phenotypic consequences (13Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). First, we analyzed sensitivity to MNase, which cuts double-stranded DNA between nucleosomes. Sensitivity to MNase digestion indicated that no gross changes in chromatin structure occurred upon deletion of ASF1 or CAC1 (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the observation that gross nucleosome loss results in inviability (14Kim U.J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas asf1 and CAF-1 mutants are viable. However, closer examination revealed that the chromatin from the cac1 mutant was slightly more accessible to digestion by MNase, as compared with the wild type chromatin. This is indicated by the slightly smaller DNA fragment sizes in the cac1Δ strain at any given MNase concentration when compared with the same MNase concentration in the wild type strain (compare the quantitation tracings of the MNase digestion of chromatin from WT and cac1Δ strains at 0.16 units/ml MNase) (Fig. 1). By contrast, chromatin from the asf1 mutant appeared to be slightly more resistant to digestion with MNase, as compared with the wild type chromatin. This was apparent by the larger DNA fragment sizes in the asf1Δ strain at any given MNase concentration when compared with the same MNase concentration in the wild type strain, even though there appears to be less DNA in the asf1Δ samples than in the wild type (compare quantitation tracings of the MNase digestion of chromatin from WT and asf1Δ strains at 0.16 units/ml MNase) (Fig. 1). Loss of CAF-1 Leads to Increased Accessibility to DNase I, whereas Loss of Asf1p Leads to Decreased Accessibility to DNase I Digestion—Next, we examined the accessibility of the chromatin to digestion with DNase I, a more sensitive measure of chromatin structure than MNase digestion (15Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Similar to the result obtained with MNase above, chromatin from the cac1Δ strain was more accessible to DNase I digestion than chromatin from the wild type strain, apparent from the smaller DNA fragments at lower nuclease concentrations as compared with the wild type strain (compare quantitation tracings of the DNase I digestion of chromatin from WT and cac1Δ strains at 2 units/ml DNase I) (Fig. 2). Therefore, chromatin in yeast lacking CAF-1 is more open or less fully assembled into nucleosomes than normal, consistent with a role of CAF-1 as a chromatin assembly factor. Similar to the result obtained for MNase digestion above, chromatin from the asf1Δ strain was less accessible to DNase I digestion, apparent from the smaller DNA fragments in the wild type strain at lower nuclease concentrations as compared with the asf1Δ strain (compare quantitation tracings of the DNase I digestion of chromatin from WT and asf1Δ strains at 4 units/ml DNase I) (Fig. 2). Therefore, chromatin in yeast lacking Asf1p appears to be less open or more assembled into nucleosomes than normal. These findings are in contrast to the in vitro function of Asf1p as a chromatin assembly factor and instead suggest that Asf1p may disassemble chromatin in a global manner in vivo. Loss of CAF-1 Leads to Reduced Supercoiling of the Endogenous 2μ Plasmid, whereas Loss of Asf1p Leads to Increased 2μ Supercoiling—To further investigate chromatin structure in asf1 and CAF-1 mutants, we measured supercoiling of the endogenous 2μ plasmid. Because the assembly of each nucleosome onto a closed DNA circle results in the incorporation of one negative supercoil (16Wang J.C. Cell. 1982; 29: 724-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the extent of supercoiling is a measure of nucleosome assembly. Comparison of the topoisomer distributions of the 2μ plasmid demonstrated that the cac2Δ strain has approximately two supercoils less than the wild type strain, corresponding to the loss of two nucleosomes per plasmid in CAF-1 mutants (Fig. 3). This supercoiling result is consistent with the increased accessibility of MNase and DNase I to chromosomal DNA upon loss of CAF-1 (Figs. 1 and 2). Taken together, these results suggest that CAF-1 has a global role as a chromatin assembly factor in yeast. Next, we analyzed the effect of deleting ASF1 on supercoiling of the endogenous 2μ plasmid. Comparison of the topoisomer distributions of the 2μ plasmid demonstrated that the asf1Δ strain has approximately two supercoils more than the wild type strain, corresponding to the gain of two nucleosomes per plasmid in asf1 mutants (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the reduced accessibility of MNase and DNase I to chromosomal DNA in the asf1 mutant (Figs. 1 and 2), demonstrating that the loss of Asf1p results in a more compact chromatin structure. We also examined the effect of deleting ASF1 in strains that have reduced 2μ supercoiling. Comparison of the asf1Δcac1Δ and cac1Δ strains demonstrated an increase in supercoiling corresponding to a gain of approximately one nucleosome per plasmid upon deletion of ASF1 (Fig. 3). These results show that the deletion of ASF1 increases the number of supercoils on the endogenous 2μ plasmid, corresponding to increased numbers of nucleosomes in the absence of Asf1p. Loss of Asf1p Causes a Striking Decrease in Acetylation of Histone H3 on Lysine 9—To provide further evidence that the supercoiling changes in the asf1 and CAF-1 mutants are due to altered nucleosome density, we examined other factors that can influence plasmid supercoiling. It is well known that changes in the activity of topoisomerases in vivo can result in altered DNA supercoiling (17Pruss G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because CAF-1 and Asf1p influence chromatin structure (as shown above), it is possible that their absence may lead to altered transcription of topoisomerases. To address this question, we measured the levels of transcripts from the TOP1 and TOP2 genes, encoding topoisomerase 1 and 2, respectively, and found no significant difference between the asf1Δ or cac2Δ strains as compared with wild type (Table II). It is also possible that altered transcription from genes encoded on the 2-μ plasmid can result in altered supercoiling of the 2μ plasmid (18Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To address whether this could explain the altered supercoiling in the asf1 and CAF-1 mutants, we measured transcript levels of the 2μ-encoded genes. We found that there was no change in the transcript levels from the FLP1 gene, whereas transcript levels increased for REP1, REP2, and RAF1 in the asf1 mutant as compared with wild type cells (Table II). However, increased transcription is known to result in decreased supercoiling (18Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); therefore, the increased supercoiling seen in the asf1 mutant cells cannot be because of the increased expression of the 2μ-encoded genes. Comparison of the levels of the 2μ-encoded gene transcripts between cac2Δ and wild type strains showed no change in expression of REP1 or REP2 and minor (1.56-fold and 2-fold respectively) increases in expression from the FLP1 and the RAF1 transcript (Table II). However, this slight increase in transcription is not sufficient to explain the change in supercoiling that we observed. It has also been suggested in the field that mutations in the ADE2 gene can affect 2μ supercoiling. However, changes in ADE2 cannot explain the altered supercoiling that we observed with asf1 and CAF-1 mutants because we obtained the same supercoiling results in strains auxotrophic or wild type for ADE2 (Fig. 3; data not shown).Table IIMicroarray analysis of 2μ-encoded and topisomerase genes in asf1 and CAF-1 mutantsGeneAverageS.D.Call by AffymetrixComparison between WT and asf1Δ strainsFLP10.100.99NCREP11.430.50IREP21.670.12IRAF11.530.76ITOP1-0.531.21NCTOP20.530.70NCComparison between WT and cac2Δ strainsFLP10.640.29MIREP10.670.64MIREP20.330.42NCRAF11.000.60ITOP1-0.601.11NCTOP20.230.83NC Open table in a new tab Next, we addressed whether the amount of bulk histones or levels of histone acetylation is altered upon loss of Asf1p or CAF-1. The amount of bulk histones is known to alter plasmid supercoiling, where reduced amounts of histones lead to decreased 2μ supercoiling in vivo (14Kim U.J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the total amounts of histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B in strains lacking Asf1p or CAF-1. This was particularly important to examine for Asf1p, as it has been reported that lack of Asf1p alters gene expression of the histone genes (9Sutton A. Bucaria J. Osley M.A. Sternglanz R. Genetics. 2001; 158: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found no difference in the total amount of the core histones between wild type, asf1Δ, or cac1Δ strains (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the altered supercoiling in cells lacking Asf1p and CAF-1 is not because of altered levels of histone proteins. To investigate the possibility that deletion of ASF1 or CAC1 may lead to accumulation of histones in the cytoplasm, which would result in altered extents of chromatin assembly, we examined the cellular distribution of core histones. Having determined that the total levels of core histones were similar between the wild type, asf1Δ, or cac1Δ strains, we compared the levels of core histones in nuclear extracts. We found that the levels of core histones were indistinguishable between wild type, asf1Δ, or cac1Δ strains, (Fig. 4B; data not shown). Therefore, the altered supercoiling in cells lacking Asf1p and CAF-1 is not due to altered cellular distribution of core histone proteins. Next, we asked whether histone acetylation levels are altered upon the loss of Asf1p or CAF-1, because increased histone acetylation is known to cause reduced 2μ supercoiling, whereas decreased histone acetylation leads to increased 2μ supercoiling (19Lutter L.C. Judis L. Paretti R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5004-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To address this question, we used antibodies specific for acetylated lysines on histones H3 and H4 (Fig. 4C). For the yeast lacking CAF-1, we found no change in the levels of histone acetylation on lysine 9, 14, 18, 23, or 27 of histone H3 and no change in either overall acetylation of histone H4 or acetylation on lysine 8 or 12 of H4 (Fig. 4C). Similarly, we found no change in the levels of acetylation of lysines 18, 23, or 27 of histone H3 nor lysines 8, 12, or overall acetylation of histone H4 in asf1Δ strains compared with wild type (Fig. 4C). By contrast, we observed an approximate 50% reduction in acetylation using an antibody that recognizes both acetylated Lys-9 and Lys-14 of histone H3 upon loss of Asf1p. Using an antibody specific for acetylation of Lys-9 of histone H3, we observed a striking absence of detectable acetylation upon loss of Asf1p as compared with wild type (Fig. 4C). We were unable to test levels of Lys-14 acetylation alone, as a specific antibody for acetylated Lys-14 of histone H3 was not available. However, because of the striking loss of Lys-9 acetylation in asf1 mutants, we assume that the majority of the reduced signal from the antisera that recognized either acetylated Lys-9 or Lys-14 is due to the loss of Lys-9 acetylation. These results show that histone acetylation levels are not altered upon loss of CAF-1, whereas acetylation of H3 lysine 9 is drastically reduced upon loss of Asf1p. Decreased Supercoiling in asf1 Mutants Is Not a Consequence of Loss of Lysine 9 Acetylation—Having discovered that there are differences in histone acetylation between yeast with and without Asf1p, it was essential to establish that this was not responsible for the altered chromatin structure that we had observed in asf1 mutants. To address this question, we constructed an asf1Δ strain that also lacked the acetylatable N terminus of histone H3, “asf1ΔH3tailΔ” to prevent any effect of histone H3 acetylation on 2μ supercoiling. As a control, we also included a strain “H4K4Q” that has all of the acetylatable lysines of histone H4 altered to glutamic acid and therefore cannot be acetylated. The histone mutant strains H3tailΔ and H4K4Q cause a reduction of one or two supercoils, respectively, in the endogenous 2μ plasmid as compared with wild type 2P. Megee and M. Smith, personal communication. (Fig. 5). Comparison between the H3tailΔ and H3tailΔasf1Δ strains showed an increase of ∼1 supercoil/plasmid upon deletion of ASF1 (Fig. 5). This result demonstrates that the increased supercoiling that occurs upon loss of Asf1p is not due to loss of histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation, as it still occurs in strains lacking the H3 N-terminal tail. Similarly, comparison of the H4K4Q and H4K4Qasf1Δ strains showed an increase of ∼2–3 supercoils/plasmid upon deletion of ASF1 (Fig. 5). This provides another example of where deletion of ASF1 results in increased 2μ supercoiling, as was seen above in Fig. 3. In summary, the increased plasmid supercoiling observed upon deletion of ASF1 is independent of any role of histone acetylation on plasmid supercoiling. Taking all of our results together, these data indicate that loss of Asf1p results in global over-assembly of the genome into chromatin, suggesting that Asf1p has a broad role as a chromatin disassembly factor in vivo. CAF-1 Is a Global Chromatin Assembly Factor—It cannot be assumed that molecules that assemble chromatin in vitro actually perform this function in vivo. In fact, almost any negatively charged molecule can act as a histone chaperone to assemble chromatin in vitro (2Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but there is little direct evidence that histone chaperones identified biochemically can assemble chromatin in vivo. The best previous evidence to hint that CAF-1 may assemble chromatin in yeast came from its transcriptional effects on the four silent loci of yeast (13Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), which are known to be sensitive to chromatin structure. Here we show by MNase and DNase I accessibility analyses and by supercoiling analysis of the endogenous 2μ plasmid that there are global changes in the bulk chromatin structure upon disruption of CAF-1, corresponding to nucleosome loss from the genome. This is consistent with the recently reported increased accessibility to MNase that results from short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CAF-1 in HeLa cells (6Nabatiyan A. Krude T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2853-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As such, the biochemical role of CAF-1 as a chromatin assembly factor indeed appears to reflect its function as a chromatin assembly factor in vivo. Furthermore, the biochemical role of CAF-1 in the assembly of chromatin during DNA replication is likely also to be the case in vivo, because CAF-1 was recently identified in a complex with the histone variant H3.1 that is specifically assembled during DNA replication (20Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Asf1p Appears To Be a Global Chromatin Disassembly Factor—In biochemical chromatin assembly assays, ASF1 can mediate the assembly of chromatin (5Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 21Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Sharp J.A. Fouts E.T. Krawitz D.C. Kaufman P.D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Mello J.A. Sillje H.H. Roche D.M. Kirschner D.B. Nigg E.A. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, our data strongly suggest that yeast Asf1p is a global chromatin disassembly factor. Specifically, we found changes in the bulk chromatin structure in yeast disrupted for ASF1 that correspond to a gain of nucleosomes over the genome by MNase, DNase I, and 2μ supercoiling analyses. Our findings contradict a recent report of a loss of plasmid supercoiling upon deletion of ASF1 (10Prado F. Cortes-Ledesma F. Aguilera A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is possible that the change in supercoiling they observed was in fact an increase upon deletion of ASF1, as there were no controls for the direction of the mobility of the topoisomers. In fact, their MNase accessibility analysis, which was reported as showing no difference between asf1 mutants and wild type, showed that the chromatin from their asf1Δ strain was more resistant to MNase digestion than their wild type chromatin upon limited digestion. Therefore, we interpret the data in this previous report (10Prado F. Cortes-Ledesma F. Aguilera A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as being consistent with our findings, which indicate that Asf1p is involved in chromatin disassembly in vivo. Although our proposed role for Asf1p as a chromatin disassembly factor may appear to conflict with the function of Asf1p as a chromatin assembly factor in vitro (5Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), Asf1p may have a chromatin assembly function in vivo that is not apparent in these studies of the static state of chromatin in yeast lacking Asf1p. Alternatively, the biochemical function of ASF1 as a chromatin assembly factor may be an in vitro artifact. This is unlikely to be the case as we originally isolated Drosophila ASF1 in a complex with histones that were strictly acetylated at the residues found specifically on newly synthesized histones (5Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). If the function of ASF1 were only to disassemble chromatin, then it would not have been isolated with the newly synthesized form of histones. Furthermore, ASF1 was recently isolated from human cells in a soluble complex with the histone variant H3.1 that is only assembled into chromatin during DNA replication and in a complex with the histone variant H3.3 that is only assembled into chromatin during transcription (20Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). This suggests that ASF1 is involved broadly in chromatin assembly. We propose that Asf1p functions as both an assembly and disassembly factor in vivo and that the balance is more in favor of chromatin disassembly during transcriptional regulation, as suggested by the more compact chromatin structure in asf1 mutants. Consistent with our proposed role for Asf1p as a chromatin disassembly factor during transcriptional activation, we have recently shown that yeast Asf1p mediates the disassembly of chromatin from the promoters of the PHO5 and PHO8 genes during transcriptional activation (12Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The changes in chromatin structure upon disruption of ASF1 or CAF-1 are modest. This suggests that either additional chromatin assembly/disassembly factors remain to be discovered or that budding yeast has some ability to spontaneously assemble/disassemble chromatin structures. On this note, it worth mentioning that deletion of ASF1 from fission yeast (24Umehara T. Chimura T. Ichikawa N. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or fruit flies (8Moshkin Y.M. Armstrong J.A. Maeda R.K. Tamkun J.W. Verrijzer P. Kennison J.A. Karch F. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2621-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is lethal, whereas budding yeast can tolerate loss of Asf1p. It will be interesting to determine in the future whether the inviability of higher eukaryotes lacking ASF1 is a consequence of more profound defects in chromatin structure or whether higher eukaryotes are more sensitive to subtle changes in chromatin structure. Loss of Histone H3 Lys-9 Acetylation in Yeast Lacking Asf1p—In this study we performed many controls to verify that the altered chromatin structure in yeast lacking Asf1p or CAF-1 is indeed due to increased and decreased numbers of nucleosomes, respectively, on the genome. The only other change that we found that could possibly cause altered chromatin structure was a drastic reduction in levels of acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9 in yeast lacking Asf1p. This loss of histone acetylation on lysine 9 in asf1 mutants is quite striking and is the subject of another study. 3M. Adkins and J. Tyler, manuscript in preparation. However, we ruled out the possibility that this altered histone acetylation was responsible for the altered chromatin structure in yeast lacking Asf1p by deleting the acetylatable N-terminal tail from the only copy of histone H3 in these cells. The additional deletion of ASF1 still resulted in changes to the chromatin structure, indicating that this loss of H3 Lys-9 acetylation, although interesting, is not responsible for the altered chromatin structure in asf1 mutants. As such, we interpret our supercoiling results as reflecting altered numbers of nucleosomes. Although it is difficult to disprove, it remains a possibility that the altered supercoiling we observed reflects an altered path of the DNA around the nucleosomes. How the loss of histone chaperones may result in changes to the DNA-histone interactions within nucleosomes is difficult to envision. In conclusion, these studies have revealed that CAF-1 is a genome-wide chromatin assembly factor, whereas Asf1p appears to be a genome-wide chromatin disassembly factor.

Thus, it is the concerted effort of growth-promoting and growth-inhibitory molecules on neuronal and non-neuronal cells that act to influence the developing nervous system.Postnatal cerebellar development involves migration of cerebellar granule neurons from the external germinal layer to the rapidly developing granule cell layer. During migration, a granule neuron develops several neurites, two of which ultimately become parallel fibers of the cerebellar molecular layer (7Altman J. Bayer S.A. Development of the Cerebellar System: in Relation to its Evolution, Structure, and Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997Google Scholar). Whereas most cell migration and neuritogenesis in the cerebellum is complete within the second postnatal week, migration of granule neurons, growth of the granule cell layer, and extension of parallel and vertical fibers continues through postnatal day 21 (P21) (7Altman J.

Although β1 and β2 mRNA expression is initially low in cerebellum, their expression is more robust from P14 through adulthood (18Shah B.S. Stevens E.B. Pinnock R.D. Dixon A.K. Lee K. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). β3 mRNA expression is detected in brain as early as embryonic day 10. β3 then decreases in brain after P3 in certain areas (including the cerebellum) but remains high in the hippocampus and striatum (18Shah B.S. Stevens E.B. Pinnock R.D. Dixon A.K. Lee K. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In adult rats, β4 mRNA is expressed in the cerebral cortex, cerebellar purkinje cells, hippocampus, caudate putamen, and globus pallidus (19Yu F.H. Westenbroek R.E. Silos-Santiago I. McCormick K.A.

However, the expression profile of β4 at earlier time points is not known.Here we examine the role of β-subunits in postnatal cerebellar granule cell neurite extension. We examine the effects of β1, β2, and β4 presented on the surface of fibroblast monolayers, or in soluble form, on neurite growth promotion in cerebellar granule cells isolated from β1(+/+) or β1(-/-) mice. We show that β1 promotes, whereas β2 reduces the level of basal neurite extension. The β4 subunit has no measurable effect on neurite outgrowth. Previous studies used heterologous expression systems, such as Drosophila S2 cells, to show β subunit-mediated cell adhesive interactions (12Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The present study is the first functional demonstration of β-subunit-mediated cell adhesion in neurons.The observation that an IGSF CAM can promote neurite outgrowth is far from novel. What is novel, is that proteins that participate in voltage-dependent ion channel gating can also function as CAMs that participate in extracellular and intracellular signal transduction leading to neurite extension. We propose that β subunits, as CAMs, participate in inter- and intracellular communication and thus may play critical roles in neuronal development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCerebellar Dissociation—β1(+/+) and β1(-/-) mice were generated and maintained as previously described, in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (20Chen C.

Animals used in this study were bred from β1(+/-) mice that had been repeatedly backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice for at least 10 generations, creating congenic strains. The β1(+/+) and β1(-/-) mice used in each individual experiment were age-matched littermates. Following cervical dislocation, cerebella from β1(+/+) or β1(-/-) mice at the ages indicated in the figure legends were quickly excised and placed in ice-cold Hibernate A/B-27 with l-glutamine. Tissue was cut into small pieces and cerebellar granule cells were dissociated according to the method described by Brewer with slight modifications (21Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebellar tissue was subjected to trypsin treatment (1 mg/ml) in Hibernate A (Brain Bits) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Following trypsinization, tissue was allowed to settle for 2–5 min and Hibernate A/trypsin was aspirated. Tissue was resuspended in 2 ml of Hibernate A/B-27 and triturated using a fire-polished glass pipette or P 1000 pipette tip. Neurons were isolated by centrifugation for 15 min at 800 × g using a 4-ml Opti-Prep (Axis-Shield) density gradient (35, 25, 20, and 15%) made with Hibernate A/B-27. Fraction 3, which is highly enriched in neurons, was collected and resuspended in 12 ml of Neurobasal A/B-27 with 0.5 mm l-glutamine. Cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, resuspended in Neurobasal A/B-27 with 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5 ng/ml FGF-β, then plated at 2 × 104 cells/well.

Goatanti rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) at 1:500 dilution was used as the secondary antibody. Monolayers were visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope at the Microscopy and Image Analysis Core facility at the University of Michigan. Digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop.Creation of CHLβ4 Stable Cell Line—Rat brain total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using the Titan One RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) with primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the rat β4 cDNA sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers BK001030 and XM_236199): 5′-CTGTGCACACTGTCCTATCCAAGC and 3′-CACATCTCAGACAGGACTCGGCATC. The resulting reverse transcriptase-PCR product was used as the template in a second PCR using nested β4 primers: 5′-CAACTCGAGCGCTCCGGAGAGAACAGGAC and 3′-ATCGAATTCACCATCAGAAAGTGAGGCTC. The resulting PCR product was gelpurified, subcloned into pcDNA3.1/hygro(-) (Invitrogen), and sequenced to confirm identity with β4. CHL cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/hygro(-)/β4 using FuGENE (Roche) and stable cell colonies were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis of the resulting CHL-β4 cell lines was performed using full-length β4 antisense cDNA as the probe label with digoxigenin. 10 μg of total RNA was extracted from each cell line, and loaded onto an RNA gel. Following transfer, hybridization and detection was as previously described (20Chen C. Westenbroek R.E. Xu X. Edwards C.A. Sorenson D.R. Chen Y. McEwen D.P. O'Malley H.A. Bharucha V. Meadows L.S.

Upon the establishment of confluent monolayers, freshly dissociated cerebellar granule cells were plated (2 × 104 cells/well) on top of cell monolayers and allowed to grow in Neurobasal A/B-27 with l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5 ng/ml FGF-β for 19–22 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and visualized using a primary monoclonal antibody to GAP 43 (Chemicon, 1:500) followed by and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:500). Images were captured on a Zeiss Axiophot florescent microscope using a ×40 objective in the Microscopy and Image Analysis Core facility at the University of Michigan. Digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Images used for analysis were randomly selected by NIH Image or Image J software for all conditions. The longest neurite from each of the first 50, randomly selected, isolated granule cells were measured in at least five experiments per condition. This process of analysis eliminated user bias. A neurite was defined as a process protruding from GFAP positive cells, with neuronal morphology, ranging in length from ∼0.1 μm to greater than 200 μm in some instances.Construction and Analysis of the Soluble β1 Subunit—A vector constructed to express an inducible, truncated form of the β1 subunit was prepared using PCR with pcDNA3.1.β1 encoding the rat β1 subunit (GenBank™ accession code NM_017288) as template, forward primer: 5′-GGATCCTTGCGCGGCCATGGGGAC-3′, and reverse primer: 5′-GGAATTCTCTGACACGATGGATGC-3′. These primers introduced BamHI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the extracellular β1 domain. PCR products were ligated in-frame into the pcDNA 4/TO vector (Invitrogen), transformed, and minipreps were performed. The pcDNA 4/TO vector is extremely useful because it is tetracycline responsive and provides carboxyl-terminal c-myc and His6 tags. Successful cloning was confirmed by restriction digest with EcoRI and BamHI as well as dideoxy sequencing. The newly constructed pcDNA4/TO-β1 vector was stably cotransfected into CHL cells with pcDNA6/TR that encodes a tetracycline repressor protein under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promotor (CHLSolβ1 cells).Western blot analysis was carried out on 5 μl of tissue culture medium exposed for 22 h to a single confluent well of either uninduced CHLSolβ1 cells or 1 mg/ml tetracycline-induced CHL or CHLSolβ1 cells (200 μl total volume). Blots were probed with mouse anti-c-myc antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:2,000) was incubated with blots for 1 h prior to washing and chemiluminescent detection using West Dura reagent (Pierce).Affinity Purification of the CHLSolβ1 Subunit—Confluent T-75 flasks of CHLSolβ1 cells were induced to express the soluble β1 subunit using 1 mg/ml tetracycline overnight. Collected media was centrifuged at 500 × g to remove cells and debris. Media was then collected and incubated for 1–2 h with nickel metal hydride-agarose (Qiagen). Nonspecific interactions with the nickel-agarose were disrupted using a washing buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaHPO4, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) prior to elution. The CHLSolβ1 protein was eluted from nickel-agarose using 200 mm imidazole in the wash buffer.Immunohistochemistry—-P12 or P18 C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized by administering an intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/ml, Abbott Laboratory) and perfused intracardially with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2–5 h followed by immersion in 30% sucrose overnight. Brains were frozen in -20 °C 2-methylbutane for 1 min and then stored at -80 °C until sectioning. Brain sections were cut to a thickness of 10 μm, mounted on glass slides, and stored at -20 °C until use.Immunohistochemistry was performed using protein A-Sepharose-purified anti-β1ex (1:200) or anti-β4 (1:25). The anti-β4 (19Yu F.H. Westenbroek R.E. Silos-Santiago I. McCormick K.A. Lawson D. Ge P. Ferriera H. Lilly J. DiStefano P.S. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Curtis R. J.

The monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (Molecular Probes) used to identify cerebellar Bergmann glia was used at a dilution of 1:250. Anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 nm and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 nm secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes and used as secondary antibodies.

CHL cells offer a benefit over other cell lines in that they do not express endogenous sodium channel β subunits (22Isom L.L. Scheuer T. Brownstein A.B. Ragsdale D.S. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of P18 mouse cerebellum shows β1 staining in the granule neurons as well as in the Purkinje cell layer (Fig. 1A). Immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses of CHL-β1 cells indicate that they express moderate levels of β1 subunits (Fig. 1, B and C). Neurite outgrowth experiments were performed whereby 2 × 104 acutely dissociated cerebellar granule neurons were plated on confluent fibroblast monolayers and allowed to grow for 19–22 h prior to fixation and neurite length determination. Staining for GAP 43 (Fig. 2A) revealed neurons that typically contained two or three processes. Sodium channel β1 subunits presented by the monolayer cells (CHL-β1) resulted in increased neurite extension by the overlying granule neurons compared with neurons grown on CHL cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, growth of cerebellar granule neurons on CHL or CHL-mock monolayers yielded an average neurite length of 41.5 ± 1.8 μm and 46.3 ± 4.2 μm, respectively. In contrast to granule neurons grown on CHL or CHL-mock monolayers, neurons grown on CHL-β1 fibroblasts consistently showed a 1.4–1.7-fold increase in neurite extension with an average neurite length of 68.4 ± 4.3 μm. This increase was highly reproducible, and could not be attributed to individual outliers because there was always a greater percentage of neurons at any given neurite length when granule neurons were grown on CHL-β1 monolayers versus control monolayers (Fig. 2C). As shown in the neurite length distribution (Fig. 2C), granule cells grown on CHL or CHL-mock monolayers had 9.2 or 9.8% of neurites with a length of 100 μm or greater, respectively. This is in contrast to granule neurons grown on CHL-β1 monolayers where 23.8% of neurites had a length of 100 μm or greater.Fig. 2Cerebellar granule neurons grown on β1-transfected monolayers show increased neurite length. A, upper panel: typical granule neuron grown on CHL-β1 cells and stained with anti-GAP 43 antibody. Lower panel: typical GAP 43-positive granule neuron grown on CHL cell monolayers. Scale bar = 20 μm. B, granule neurons grown on CHL-β1 monolayers showed increased mean neurite length compared with granule neurons grown on CHL or CHL-mock monolayers. Increases in neurite length were ∼1.4–1.7-fold in all experiments. C, neurite distribution for a given neurite length. Neurite length distributions for neurons grown on CHL (solid line) or CHL-mock (dotted line) monolayers overlap, indicating a similar percentage of neurites at any given neurite length under these conditions. The rightward shift of the neurite length distribution for granule neurons grown on CHL-β1 monolayers (dashed line) indicates an increase in the percentage of neurites at any given length. For B and C, 13 independent experiments (50 neurons measured per experiment) were performed for each condition. Error bars represent the S.E. Values are statistically significant for p < 0.05 using a one-way analysis of variance with a Dunnett's post test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β1-Mediated Outgrowth Is Blocked by β1 Antibodies—We next used an antiserum specific to the Ig loop region of β1 (anti-β1ex) to examine the specificity of the observed increases in neurite outgrowth. We reasoned that if the observed effects were truly β1 specific, involving extracellular, cell adhesive events, then neurite outgrowth on CHL-β1 monolayers should be blocked by the addition of antibodies that recognize the β1Ig loop domain. When 5 μg/ml β1ex antibody, directed against the A-A′ face of the β1 Ig loop domain (12Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol.

Comparison of the β1 amino acid sequence with the crystal structure of myelin Po predicts that the anti-β1ex antibody epitope lies in a region that is critical for trans-homophilic cell adhesion (23Shapiro L.

We observed no changes in neurite length when β1ex antibodies were added to granule neurons grown on CHL monolayers. The addition of non-immune IgG had no effect on granule neurons grown on either CHL or CHL-β1 monolayers. These results, taken together with our previous results, suggest that β1 may play a role in neurite extension from acutely dissociated P14–P21 cerebellar granule cells.Fig. 5A soluble, truncated form of β1 promotes neurite outgrowth.

B, induction of pcDNA4/TO-β1-transfected CHL cells (CHLSolβ1) with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (“+ tet”) results in robust expression of the soluble β1 subunit, as assessed by Western blot analysis of media taken from the cell lines. Uninduced pcDNA4/TO-β1-transfected CHL cells (“- tet”) express a low level of soluble β1. The Western blot was probed with anti-c-myc antibody or an anti-β1ex antibody (RH). CHL, untransfected cells do not produce c-myc-tagged β1 subunits even after treatment with tetracycline. Molecular mass standards are shown in kDa. Arrow indicates immunoreactive c-myc-tagged β1 bands.

https://openalex.org/W2115978592,"The transection of the axon of central neurons has dramatic consequences on the damaged cells and nerves. Injury activates molecular programs leading to a complex repertoire of responses that, depending on the cellular context, include activation of sprouting, axonal degeneration, and cell death. Although the cellular mechanisms started at the time of lesion are likely to shape the changes affecting injured cells, the acute physiological reaction to trauma of mammalian central neurons is not completely understood yet. To characterize the physiology of the acute response to axonal transection, we have developed a model of in vitro axotomy of neurons cultured from the rodent cortex. Imaging showed that axotomy caused an increase of calcium in the soma and axon. Propagation of the response to the soma required the activation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, since it was blocked by tetrodotoxin. The electrophysiological response to axotomy was recorded in patched neurons kept in the current clamp configuration: injury was followed by vigorous spiking activity that caused a sodium load and the activation of transient calcium currents that were opened by each action potential. The decrease of the electrochemical gradient of sodium caused inversion of the Na-Ca exchanger that provided an additional mean of entry for calcium. Finally, we determined that inhibition of the physiological response to axotomy hindered the regeneration of a new neurite. These data provide elements of the framework required to link the axotomy itself to the downstream molecular machinery that contributes to the determination of the long-term fate of injured neurons and axons."

To directly examine its role, four lines of transgenic mice with different configurations of flanking nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) encompassing the protamine domain were created. We show that upon removal of the MARs, the locus becomes subject to position effects. The 3′ MAR alone may be sufficient to protect against silencing. In concert, the MARs bounding this domain likely synergize to regulate the expression of the various members of this gene cluster. Interestingly, the MARs may convey a selective reproductive advantage, such that constructs bearing both 5′ and 3′ MARs are passed to their offspring with greater frequency.

The final stages of mammalian spermatogenesis are marked by a considerable morphological change, reflective of genomic restructuring mediated by the replacement of the majority of histones with protamines (PRM). 1The abbreviations used are: PRM, protamine; HS, DNase I-hypersensitive site; LCR, locus control region; MAR, nuclear matrix attachment region. These small, basic, arginine-rich proteins compact the genome into the sperm nucleus. This is accomplished in many varied ways throughout the phylogenetic kingdom (reviewed in Ref. 1Oliva R. Dixon G.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 25-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For example, mammals, birds, and reptiles utilize a PRM or PRM1-like nuclear protein to repackage their sperm genomes. Compaction can be augmented through the formation of disulfide bonds between adjacent protamines and with the use of a second protamine PRM2 (2Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Repackaging of the genome occurs in a stepwise manner with some somatic histones first being replaced by germ cell-specific histone variants (reviewed in Ref. 3Braun R.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 10-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through a series of DNA strand-breaks (4McPherson S. Longo F.J. Eur. J.

Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and some of the histones are displaced by the transition nuclear proteins (TNP1 and TNP2). Finally, the majority of the histones, along with the TNPs, are exchanged for protamines. The human protamine PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 gene cluster maps to chromosome 16p13.13 (6Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A.

Protamine 1 (PRM1), protamine 2 (PRM2), and transition protein 2 (TNP2) are expressed solely in the testes during a defined stage of spermiogenesis. The specific temporal and spatial pattern of expression of the various members of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 gene cluster and the ability to isolate purified populations of spermatogenic cells at each stage of differentiation render this system well suited to dissecting the regulatory mechanisms that underlie facultatively expressed genes. This suite of genes resides in a single DNase I-sensitive domain (7Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.A. Mohamed A.N. Koppitch F. Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol.

Development. 1998; 125: 4749-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In part, this is believed to reflect the incomplete replacement of the histones with protamines in this region that may be required to initiate repackaging of the male genome to a somatic-like structure upon fertilization (10Wykes S.M. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29471-29477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The domain is flanked by two haploid-specific nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) (11Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11619-11622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) spanning a distance similar to that of the short sperm chromatin loops (5Ward W.S. Partin A.W. Coffey D.S. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The association of these select regions of the genome with the sperm nuclear matrix appears vital to the formation of the male pronucleus (12Ward W.S. Kimura Y. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The members of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 gene cluster are regulated at both the levels of transcription and translation. Both temporal and tissue transcriptional specificity are modulated by the association of various testes-specific factors with their respective promoters (13Zambrowicz B.P. Harendza C.J.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although each member is transcribed at the round spermatid stage, translation is not initiated until the spermatid begins to elongate (reviewed in Ref. 3Braun R.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 10-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This elaborate orchestration of synthesis can only be accomplished once the chromatin domain has formed an open structure (8Kramer J.A.

Development. 1998; 125: 4749-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The packaging of chromatin into higher ordered structures in the eukaryotic genome is mediated by DNA-DNA, DNA-histone, protein-protein, and other interactions. These higher ordered structured segments tend to be silent but can, in some cases, permit basal transcriptional activity (15Georgel P.T. Fletcher T.M. Hager G.L. Hansen J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1617-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The transition from a higher ordered conformation to one that is relaxed and amenable to high levels of transcription is termed potentiation (16Scholer H.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This was first observed by increased nuclease sensitivity (17Wu C. Bingham P.M. Livak K.J. Holmgren R. Elgin S.C. Weintraub H.

Cell. 1985; 42: 705-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24Freeman L.A. Garrard W.T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 165-209PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rose S.M.

Sci. 1987; 12: 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Housekeeping genes are partitioned into chromosomal segments that bear a constitutively open structure, whereas tissue-specific genes tend to exist in a facultatively open conformation. For example, the α-globin cluster (27Vickers M.A. Vyas P. Harris P.C. Simmons D.L. Higgs D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3437-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) exists in a constitutively potentiated conformation, since it also contains the 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase gene, a housekeeping gene that is active in DNA damage repair. However, the α-globin genes are not expressed in all cell types. They are regulated through an elaborate series of histone modifications and the specific binding of several transcription factor complexes (28Anguita E. Hughes J. Heyworth C. Blobel G.A. Wood W.G. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2841-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast, the genes of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain exist in a transcriptionally silent, compacted chromatin conformation in most cell types. It is facultatively potentiated in the pachytene spermatocyte just prior to their expression in the round spermatid (9Kramer J.A. McCarrey J.R. Djakiew D. Krawetz S.A. Development. 1998; 125: 4749-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potentiation is necessary but not sufficient for transcription; it provides an essential first step toward expression, granting access to cis-regulatory elements. The mechanism of partitioning the genome into inactive and potentially active segments remains poorly understood. Several classes of regulatory regions including boundary elements, locus control regions (LCRs), and MARs are known to influence transcription through the modification of chromatin structure. For example, tissue and temporal specificity of the β-globin gene cluster is attributed to the LCR, characterized by five upstream DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSs). These HSs interact with other elements upstream of each of the genes of this cluster and can be assembled into an active chromatin hub (29Patrinos G.P. De Krom M. De Boer E. Langeveld A. Imam A.M. Strouboulis J. De Laat W. Grosveld F.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Palstra R.J. Tolhuis B. Splinter E. Nijmeijer R. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Nat.

The formation of the hub correlates with changes in the patterns of nuclear matrix association (32Ostermeier G.C. Liu Z. Martins R.P. Bharadwaj R.R. Ellis J. Draghici S. Krawetz S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that nuclear matrix facilitates and/or mediates the formation of the active chromatin hub. The nuclear matrix is a proteinaceous network that has been implicated in a myriad of processes while serving as a structural organizer within the cell nucleus. For example, by direct DNA-nuclear matrix interactions, MARs organize chromatin into loop domains (33Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and by nuclear matrix association maintain chromosomal territories (34Ma H. Siegel A.J. Berezney R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 36Jackson D.A. J. Cell.

In addition to its structural role, evidence from a number of loci suggests that the nuclear matrix may assume a more dynamic role modulating the activity of a host of genes and domains (32Ostermeier G.C.

Cai S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For example, the initial observation that many MARs contain topoisomerase II binding sites immediately suggested that association with the nuclear matrix could provide a means to relieve torsional stress in active chromatin domains (24Freeman L.A. Garrard W.T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 165-209PubMed Google Scholar, 45Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Other activities including the nuclear matrix acting as a primary transcriptional organizer have recently become well delineated. For example, the SATB1 network binds the MARs of a host of T-cell-specifying genes aiding in the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes and transcription-promoting elements (43Yasui D. Miyano M. Cai S. Varga-Weisz P. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nature. 2002; 419: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 46Kieffer L.J. Greally J.M. Landres I. Nag S. Nakajima Y.

Without this interaction, the genes are misregulated, and T-cell differentiation and spermatogenesis fail (42Alvarez J.D. Yasui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T.

In this report, we have used transgenic analysis to evaluate the function of nuclear matrix association in the expression of the human protamine domain. This is the first direct assessment of the role of the nuclear matrix for any haploid expressed gene. We present evidence that the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain becomes subject to position effects without the complement of haploid-specific MARs. In the absence of the 5′ MAR, and with only the 3′ MAR about the protamine domain, transcription is reduced but not ablated. This suggests that the 3′ MAR may provide a dominant protective effect against silencing in the male haploid genome, whereas a regulatory synergism between upstream and downstream elements bounded by the MARs ensures the appropriate regulation of this suite of genes. Constructs and Transgenic Animals—Four constructs bearing different arrangements of MARs about the human PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 protamine domain (GenBank™ U15422.1) were generated by restriction endonuclease digestion of cosmid hp3.1 (49Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31067-31073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, this cosmid contains an ∼40-kb fragment of human chromosome 16p13.13 (6Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. DNA Seq. 1995; 5: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Purified DNA was microinjected into fertilized eggs obtained by mating (C57BL/6 × SJL)F1 or C57BL/6 female mice with (C57BL/6 × SJL)F1 male mice essentially as described for single or low copy transgene insertion (50Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M.E. Yagle M.K. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Transgenes were maintained hemizygous on a C57BL/6 background (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Genotype and copy number verification was performed by real time PCR, as described (51Martins R.P. Krawetz S.A. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Nuclease Protection—Total RNA was isolated from whole organs by homogenization in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, buffered with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 17 mm sarcosyl, using a PRO Scientific 200 homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc., Oxford, CT). Homogenates were treated with 0.1 volumes of 3.0 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and then extracted with 1 volume of pH ∼4.3, saturated phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1). The aqueous phase was removed, and then nucleic acids were precipitated following the addition of 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The nucleic acid pellet was then suspended in resuspension solution that contained 6 m guanidine-HCl, buffered with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol. RNA was selectively precipitated overnight at 4 °C following the addition of 0.18 m sodium acetate and 2 m LiBr. The RNA was pelleted by centrifugation and then suspended in the guanidine-HCl resuspension solution, and purity was verified by spectrophotometry. This was repeated until the A260/A280 ratio of at least 1.6 was obtained. When this was achieved, RNA was precipitated a final time at –20 °C for at least 2 h following the addition of 0.18 m sodium acetate and 0.75 volumes of ethanol. Following precipitation, the RNA was recovered by centrifugation and then suspended in RNase-free water. RNA integrity was judged by the relative ratio of the 28 and 18 S rRNAs as analyzed by 2% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. RNAs with a ratio of 28 to 18 S of at least 1.8 was deemed acceptable. Antisense RNA probe templates for human PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 as well as mouse Prm1, Prm2, and Tnp2 were generated by ligation-mediated PCR using Lig'n'scribe (Ambion, Austin, TX) as shown in Fig. 1. A eukaryotic 18 S rRNA probe template was purchased from Ambion. Probes were prepared by PCR using Hot Star Taq (Qiagen, La Jolla, CA). A 15-min hot start at 95 °C was followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, a 30-s annealing step at TA1, as described in Table I, and then elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. A final 10-min extension step at 72 °C for 10 min terminated the reaction.Table ILigation-mediated PCR strategy to produce antisense probes for the ribonuclease protection assay Open table in a new tab The primary PCR product was then ligated to a T7 promoter adapter (Ambion). Following ligation, the product was subjected to a second round of PCR as above, at an annealing temperature of TA2 (Table I) using the Ambion primer along with the nested primer. Antisense probes, labeled with α-[32P]dCTP, were then generated by in vitro transcription using the MAXIscript protocol (Ambion) and then purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNase protection assays were performed with 10 μg of total sample RNA, using the RPAIII kit (Ambion), essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. RNA was hybridized to antisense probes at 48 °C for 16 h. The hybridization mixture containing the hybridized products was then digested with a mixture of RNase A and T1 at a ratio of 1 unit of A/3 units of T1 for 2 h at 37 °C. Protected fragments were then denatured and resolved using a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gel electrophoresis. The protected and resolved products were then visualized by phosphorimaging using a Typhoon 9210 (Amersham Biosciences). Using the probes described, a protected fragment for the human TNP2 message was not detected in any assay, even when 50 μg of total transgenic RNA or 6 μg of normal human testes poly(A)+-enriched RNA obtained from normal males (7Choudhary S.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were used (data not shown). Image analysis was then carried out using the Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software suite. Statistical Analyses—A χ2 test was applied to binomially distributed data (52Conover W.J. Practical Nonparametric Statistics. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980: 143-212Google Scholar). This included assessing whether the transgene was passed with a similar frequency among transgenic lines. A Mann-Whitney test (53Conover W.J. Practical Nonparametric Statistics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980: 213-341Google Scholar) was employed to assess whether the levels of expression of each member of the endogenous and transgenic PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 protamine locus were similar between transgenic lines. MARs Convey a Selective Advantage for Transgene Passage—To assess how the MARs of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain impact expression, a series of transgenic constructs containing one, both, or no-MARs were created. The objective was to produce a series of single copy founders for each transgenic line. This is the most sensitive assay known to reveal position effects in higher ordered eukaryotic systems. The four transgenic constructs, no-MAR, 5′ MAR only, 3′ MAR only, and 5′ + 3′ MARs that encompass the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 region of the human genome are summarized in Fig. 1. The transgenic lines were maintained in a hemizygous state on a C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) background. All of the different lines were fertile and showed no obvious abnormal phenotype. Of the 270 mice born, 31 were transgenic, and 14 achieved germ line transmission. As shown in Table II, single copy transgenic animals were obtained from the 3′ MAR only and 5′ + 3′ MAR lines, whereas low, two-copy transgenic animals were created in all other lines. Surprisingly, each construct yielded transgenic animals with varied efficiency (p < 0.05). A greater number of transgenic animals than expected were produced when the no-MAR construct (27%; 8 of 30) and the 5′ MAR only construct (36%; 5 of 14) were injected. In comparison, fewer transgenic animals than expected were produced when the 5′ + 3′ MAR construct was injected (10%; 11 of 105). Moreover, once created, each construct was passed from the founder to the progeny with different efficiencies (p < 0.05). Only the 5′ + 3′ MAR construct founders passed their transgene at the expected Mendelian frequency (56%; 29 of 52). All others passed the transgene at 50% of the expected efficiency. This suggests that constructs bounded by MARs impart a selective advantage onto the integrated locus, since they exhibit a greater stability when integrated into the genome. This is further evidenced by the long term (at least 6-year) stability and expression of similar PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 transgenic constructs that bear both MARs (7Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.A.

Cell Genet. 2001; 93: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). They remain stably associated with the nuclear matrix that is intimately involved with both replication and transcription. These unique properties of the nuclear matrix probably facilitate and reflect the observed long term stable integration of MAR-containing constructs. MARs Act as Boundary Elements to the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 Locus—The spatial pattern of expression of the various members of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 gene cluster was assessed by ribonuclease protection. As shown in Fig. 2, in all cases, appropriate tissue-specific expression was recapitulated. Irrespective of transgene copy number, the PRM1 and PRM2 genes were exclusively expressed in testes but not in brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. The expression of the endogenous Prm1, Prm2, Tnp2, or 18 S rRNA genes was not altered even when their transgenic orthologs were expressed. A striking difference in the level of expression of the transgene was noted when founders within the no-MAR construct family were compared. As shown in Fig. 3C, transgenic expression could not be detected in founder F0155, although the transgene was present in the germ line and passed to subsequent generations (Table II). In contrast, founder F0147 (lane B) displayed an opposite effect. In the latter, both the PRM1 and PRM2 transcripts were detected at a significantly elevated level (p < 0.05) when compared with animals from the line bearing both MARs (Table III). This lack of expression and appropriate regulation was not observed in any of the other constructs. Without an end region MAR, the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 locus is subject to the chromosomal context at the site of insertion.Table IIIMARs act as boundary elementsNo-MAR5′ + 3′ MARMedianF0147 (25th, 75th quartile)F0155Median(25th, 75th quartile)%%%%PRM1:Prm120.13(12.36, 22.19)ND4.8aExpression was significantly lower, comparing the no-MAR constructs with 5′ + 3′ MAR constructs, as determined by the Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05.(3.36, 6.13)PRM2:Prm258.52(56.78, 61.78)ND33.51aExpression was significantly lower, comparing the no-MAR constructs with 5′ + 3′ MAR constructs, as determined by the Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05.(26.54, 50.69)a Expression was significantly lower, comparing the no-MAR constructs with 5′ + 3′ MAR constructs, as determined by the Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab 3′ MAR Modifies the Expression of the Locus—To examine whether a single flanking MAR exhibited a dominant effect, homogenous MAR-containing lines were created that bore neither the 5′ MAR or the 3′ MAR (Fig. 1). The expression of the various members of the protamine domain was then assessed by ribonuclease protection. As shown in Table IV, the single copy 3′ MAR only line showed a significant down-regulation of PRM1 and PRM2 genes (p < 0.05) when compared with the single copy 5′ + 3′ MAR line. This is in accord with the view that the 3′ MAR tempered expression of the locus. In comparison, the tandem arrayed two-copy 5′ MAR only line showed no significant change in transgenic expression (Table V) when compared with the single-copy 5′ + 3′ MAR line. This suggested that the 5′ MAR from the second copy of the tandemly arrayed two-copy 5′ MAR line functionally substituted for the deleted 3′ MAR, essentially recapitulating the native domain. Accordingly, the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain is functionally bound by upstream and downstream MARs.Table IV3′ MAR conveys suppression on the locus5′ + 3′ MAR3′ MAR onlyMedian(25th, 75th quartile)Median(25th, 75th quartile)%%%%PRM1:Prm122.65(18.30, 45.25)2.96aExpression was significantly lower, comparing the 5′ + 3′ MAR constructs with the 3′ MAR only constructs, as determined by the Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05.(2.64, 3.68)PRM2:Prm265.02(54.37, 76.33)19.19aExpression was significantly lower, comparing the 5′ + 3′ MAR constructs with the 3′ MAR only constructs, as determined by the Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05.(17.08, 24.56)a Expression was significantly lower, comparing the 5′ + 3′ MAR constructs with the 3′ MAR only constructs, as determined by the Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05.

https://openalex.org/W2041986555,"Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of receptors such as Fas/CD95 and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors DR4 and DR5 induce apoptosis by recruiting adaptor molecules and caspases. The central adaptor molecule for these receptors is a death domain-containing protein, FADD, which binds to the activated receptor via death domain-death domain interactions. Here, we show that in addition to the death domain, the C-terminal tails of DR4 and DR5 positively regulate FADD binding, caspase activation and apoptosis. In contrast, the corresponding region in the Fas receptor has the opposite effect and inhibits binding to the receptor death domain. Replacement of wild-type or mutant DR5 molecules into DR5-deficient BJAB cells indicates that some agonistic antibodies display an absolute requirement for the C-terminal tail for FADD binding and signaling while other antibodies can function in the absence of this mechanism. These data demonstrate that regions outside the death domains of DR4 and DR5 have opposite effects to that of Fas in regulating FADD recruitment and show that different death receptor agonists can use distinct molecular mechanisms to activate signaling from the same receptor. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of receptors such as Fas/CD95 and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors DR4 and DR5 induce apoptosis by recruiting adaptor molecules and caspases. The central adaptor molecule for these receptors is a death domain-containing protein, FADD, which binds to the activated receptor via death domain-death domain interactions. Here, we show that in addition to the death domain, the C-terminal tails of DR4 and DR5 positively regulate FADD binding, caspase activation and apoptosis.

A subfamily of these receptors contains a death domain (DD) that is essential for transducing the apoptotic signal. Fas (CD95) is the best characterized member of this family. Binding of Fas Ligand (FasL) to a preformed Fas trimer (1Siegel R.M. Frederiksen J.K. Zacharias D.A. Chan F.K. Johnson M. Lynch D. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J.

Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These activated receptors signal the apoptotic response by recruiting FADD to the cytoplasmic DD of the receptor to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). NMR studies of the Fas DD indicate that it consists of six anti-parallel α-helices followed by an unstructured tail that negatively regulates Fas activity (4Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). FADD consists of two distinct domains, a DD, which binds to the DD of Fas, and a death effector domain (DED), which binds to DEDs on caspase-8 and caspase-10 (5Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus binding of ligand to Fas results in the recruitment of FADD followed by caspases; the induced proximity of two or more initiator caspases results in their dimerization and activation (7Donepudi M. Sweeney A.M. Briand C. Grutter M.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H.

This leads to cleavage to a fully processed, active form of the caspase that can dissociate from the receptor complex. Once activated, these caspases can cleave and activate effector caspases such as caspase-3 to induce the characteristic phenotypes associated with apoptosis. Signaling by TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is less understood. Interest in TRAIL has arisen because of its reported ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells without affecting normal cells (9Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A.

There are two “signaling” receptors, DR4 and DR5, which, similar to Fas, contain DDs followed by a short C-terminal tail. Agonistic antibodies that specifically recognize these receptors provide another way to induce apoptosis (11Mori E. Thomas M. Motoki K. Nakazawa K. Tahara T. Tomizuka K. Ishida I. Kataoka S.

In addition, there are two “decoy” receptors DcR1 and DcR2, which have truncated or completely absent death domains (13LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and therefore can bind ligand but are unable to transduce the apoptotic signal (14Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M.

FADD is recruited to DR4 and DR5 (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A.

Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and FADD-deficient Jurkat cells do not undergo TRAIL-induced death (18Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Although molecules such as TRADD (19Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and DAP3 (20Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have been implicated as adaptors in the recruitment of FADD to DR4 and DR5, current models suggest that FADD binds directly to DR4 and DR5 (21Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the same surface of the FADD protein that binds to Fas (22Thomas L.R. Henson A. Reed J.C. Salsbury F.R. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32780-32785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we show that FADD can bind directly to DR4 and DR5. However, unlike binding of FADD to Fas in which the C-terminal tail of Fas inhibits FADD recruitment, the C-terminal tails of DR4 and DR5 are required for efficient FADD binding, caspase cleavage and apoptosis. To better understand the importance of the C-terminal tail we made DR5-deficient BJAB cells then introduced wild-type DR5 or a DR5 mutant that lacks the C-terminal tail. While most DR5 stimuli required the C-terminal tail for apoptotic signaling, one agonistic antibody was able to induce apoptosis in the absence of the C-terminal tail, indicating that the process of receptor activation is agonist-dependent. These data suggest a model for TRAIL signaling in which the C-terminal tail that is outside the death domain provides an additional regulatory role. Reagents—Antibodies and reagents were purchased from the following sources: caspase-8 and caspase-3 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), Anti-GFP (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-actin (Sigma), recombinant human TRAIL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Agonistic human monoclonal antibodies against DR4 (HGS-ETR1) and DR5 (HGS-ETR2 and R2-A) were provided by Human Genome Sciences (Rockville, MD). mAb631 (agonistic DR5) was from R&D Systems. Human IgG and mouse IgG, as well as anti-mouse and anti-human IgG Fc polyclonal antibodies were from Sigma. Plasmids—FLAG-tagged versions of DR4 and DR5 in pcDNA3.1 were used for cloning (20Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Full-length DR4 and DR5 cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-Puro (+). L334F DR5 was made by site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA-DR5. Amino acids 1–454 of DR4 and 1–400 of DR5 followed by a TAG stop codon were cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-Puro(-) to generate DR4ΔT (14 amino acids truncation) and DR5ΔT (12 amino acid truncation). pGB14 contains the Gal4 DNA binding domain in a YCp vector. DR4 Cyto (amino acids 272–469), DR4 CytoΔT (amino acids 272–454), DR5 Cyto (amino acids 209–412), DR5 CytoΔT (amino acids 209–400), Fas Cyto (amino acids 177–335) and Fas CytoΔT (amino acids 191–320) were made by PCR from the corresponding cDNAs and cloning the resulting products into pGB14, pBTM-116, pEGFP-C2, and pFLAG-C2. Full-length catalytically inactive caspase-8 was used to generate pGB14-Caspase8. pACT3 plasmids have been described previously (6Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Full-length FADD was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pFLAG-C2. A more complete description of plasmids, maps, and sequences are available upon request. TRAIL Receptor Surface Expression—Samples were prepared using the manufacturer's protocol and stained with antibodies against DR5 (R&D systems) or DR4, DcR1, and DcR2 (Alexis, San Diego, CA). Cell Lines—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. BJAB and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS. BJAB and Jurkat stable cell lines were generated by electroporating pcDNA3.1-Puro constructs and selecting for stable transformants as previously described (6Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DR5-deficient BJAB Cells—DR5-deficient BJAB cells were made by mutagenizing BJAB cells with 2 μg/ml ICR191 (Acros, St. Louis, MO) for 3 h. After a week of recovery, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml CHX and 1 μg/ml cross-linked mAb631 for 3 days. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and plated in growth media + 1 μg/ml mAb631. After several days, clonal populations were produced by limited dilution. Individual clones were tested for resistance to mAb631 and screened for DR5 surface expression. Immunoprecipitation—1.5 × 106 HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of pEGFP constructs plus 2 μg of FLAG constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors), and the soluble fraction was incubated with 30 μl of M2-agarose (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in TBS, and precipitated GFP fusions were detected by immunoblotting. Two-hybrid Assays—Strains Y190 (Mata his3 ade2 trp1 leu2 gal4 gal80 cyh2, LYS2::Gal1-HIS3 URA3::Gal1-LacZ) and DY6877 (Mata ade2 can1 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 URA3::8xLexA-LacZ) were used for directed two-hybrid assays. Cytotoxicity Assays—Jurkat or BJAB cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per ml in growth medium + 1.0 μg/ml cycloheximide. Ligands were serially diluted then added to each well. Agonistic DR4 (HGS-ETR1) and agonistic DR5 (mAb631 or HGS-ETR2) were cross-linked with an equal amount of anti-human or anti-mouse Fc before serial dilution. After 22 h, MTS reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 2 h. Percent survival was calculated relative to control wells containing no ligand or antibody. Caspase Activation—Jurkat or BJAB cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per ml in growth media + 1.0 μg/ml cycloheximide. Agonistic antibodies were cross-linked with an equal amount of anti-mouse or anti-human Fc and unless otherwise stated, used at the following concentrations: mouse or human IgG, mAb631, and HGS-ETR2 at 50 ng/ml; human IgG and HGS-ETR1 (αDR4) at 200 ng/ml; TRAIL was used at 50 ng/ml. Cells were incubated for 6 h, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, then harvested in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. DISC Immunoprecipitations—2 × 107 BJABDR5 DEF cells expressing the various forms of DR5 were treated with 1.0 μg/ml mAb631 or 0.5 μg/ml ETR2 cross-linked with the appropriate anti-Fc for 30 min. Precipitations were carried out using agarose-protein A/G beads essentially as described (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Direct Binding of FADD to DR4 and DR5 Requires the C-terminal Tail of Each Receptor—To test if FADD could bind directly to DR4 and DR5, the cytoplasmic domains of each receptor (Fig. 1A, DR4 Cyto and DR5 Cyto) were tested for their ability to interact with FADD in a directed two-hybrid assay. As it has been reported that the C-terminal tail of Fas inhibits FADD binding (23Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we made constructs that eliminated the corresponding regions of DR4 and DR5 (DR4 CytoΔT and DR5 CytoΔT). As previously reported (24Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar), FADD bound to the cytoplasmic region of Fas only when the C-terminal tail was removed. Surprisingly, the opposite was true for DR4 and DR5; FADD was able to bind only when the C-terminal tails of DR4 and DR5 were intact. This was of interest because removal of the C-terminal tail leaves the six α-helices of the death domains intact, suggesting that interaction of FADD with DR4 and DR5 is regulated by regions outside the receptor death domain. To test whether the C-terminal tail of DR4 and DR5 is required for interaction with FADD in mammalian cells, we performed co-precipitation assays in HeLa cells using FLAG-tagged FADD and GFP-tagged DR constructs. FLAG complexes were precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and interaction of each DR construct was detected by immunoblotting for GFP. Both DR4 Cyto and DR5 Cyto bound to FADD while DR fusions lacking the C-terminal tail did not (Fig. 1C). If the C-terminal tail of DR4 and DR5 is necessary for FADD binding, then overexpression of the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors should induce apoptosis while DR4 or DR5 lacking the C-terminal tails should not. To test this hypothesis, we transfected GFP-tagged DR5 constructs into HeLa cells. The DR5 cytoplasmic domain (DR5 Cyto) caused cells to round up and die while either GFP alone or the DR5 cytoplasmic domain without the C-terminal tail (DR5 CytoΔT) had no effect (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained with GFP-tagged versions of DR4 (data not shown). These data suggest that FADD binding and apoptosis through DR4 and DR5 require the C-terminal tail of the receptor. Surprisingly, this is the opposite of the Fas receptor where the C-terminal tail is inhibitory to FADD binding and receptor function (23Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal 14 Amino Acids of DR4 Are Required for Apoptosis and Caspase Activation—To test whether the 14 C-terminal amino acids of DR4 are necessary for transducing the apoptotic signal by receptor activation, we made BJAB cells that stably express GFP and DR4ΔT (removal of amino acids 455–469 from full-length DR4 constituting the C-terminal tail). We hypothesized that DR4ΔT should act as a dominant-negative and inhibit DR4 induced apoptosis because it can interact with endogenous receptors and bind ligand but should inhibit the apoptotic signal as it is unable to bind FADD. We obtained several DR4ΔT clones and the expression level of DR4 for two representative clones is shown in Fig. 2A. Because BJAB cells express both DR4 and DR5, we selectively induced TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis using agonistic monoclonal antibodies that are specific for each receptor. All agonistic antibodies are IgG1 subtypes and were cross-linked with anti-IgG antibody before treatment. BJAB-GFP and BJAB-DR4ΔT cells were treated with increasing amounts of a DR4 agonistic antibody (αDR4) and cytotoxicity was measured. Clones expressing DR4ΔT, which has an intact DD but no C-terminal tail were completely resistant to αDR4 while GFP-expressing cells were sensitive (Fig. 2B). To test if this was caused by the stable expression of DR4ΔT and not some other defect in apoptosis, the same cells were treated with an agonistic antibody against DR5 (αDR5). As shown in Fig. 2C, the dose responses for αDR5-induced cytotoxicity in cells expressing GFP and DR4ΔT are nearly identical indicating apoptotic signaling downstream of the DR4 receptor is intact. The immediate effect of ligand binding to a death receptor is the recruitment of FADD and procaspase-8. This leads to caspase-8 activation and proteolytic cleavage (8Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). If FADD is unable to bind to DR4ΔT, then cells expressing this construct should not process caspase-8 upon DR4 receptor activation. BJAB cells were treated with either nonspecific IgG or αDR4, and caspase-8 processing was examined by immunoblotting. Caspase-8 was processed from its proform into its p43 and p41 cleavage products as well as the p18 active subunit in BJAB cells expressing GFP whereas clones expressing DR4ΔT showed only very small amounts of the p43/p41 subunit (Fig. 2D). Caspase-3 processing was also examined as it is cleaved and activated by caspase-8. GFP-expressing cells showed high amounts of caspase-3 processing in response to αDR4 while DR4ΔT expressing clones showed very little. We conclude that the 14 C-terminal amino acids of DR4 that are outside the death domain are required for efficient FADD binding and activation of the apoptotic cascade. The C-terminal 12 Amino Acids of DR5 Are Required for Apoptosis and Caspase Activation—To test whether the C-terminal tail is required for DR5 function, we made BJAB cells that stably express DR5ΔT (full-length receptor lacking amino acids 401–412 constituting the C-terminal tail). The expression level of DR5 for two representative clones as well as GFP control cells is shown in Fig. 3A. Clones expressing DR5ΔT showed increased resistance to αDR5 compared with GFP cells (Fig. 3B) as indicated by an approximate 50-fold shift in the dose response. Apoptotic signaling was otherwise intact because these cells were still sensitive to αDR4 (Fig. 3C). The same cells were treated with nonspecific IgG or αDR5 and caspase processing was examined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3D, both caspase-8 and caspase-3 were processed into their active subunits in BJAB-GFP cells but not in the clones expressing DR5ΔT when stimulated with αDR5. We therefore conclude that similar to DR4, the C-terminal tail of DR5 is required for cytotoxicity and caspase processing. Identification of DR5-deficient BJAB Cells and Complementation with DR5 Transgene—Because experiments using dominant negative proteins rely on overexpression, we examined the effects of DR5ΔT in a DR5-deficient background. Because no DR5-deficient cell lines have been identified (13LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), we made DR5-deficient BJAB cells. BJAB cells were randomly mutagenized with ICR191 followed by selection for clones resistant to αDR5-induced death (Fig. 4A). Because resistance could be caused by loss of DR5 or some other component of the apoptotic pathway such as FADD or caspase-8, each clone was also tested for sensitivity to αDR4 and FasL. We reasoned that clones with no functional DR5 receptor should be sensitive to these two stimuli while those with defects in downstream signaling would be resistant. The subset of clones sensitive to DR4 and FasL were screened for loss of DR5 surface expression by FACS. A clone we designated BJABDR5 DEF did not express any detectable DR5, was resistant to mAb631 and sensitive to both αDR4 and FasL (Fig. 4, B–E). If the defect in BJABDR5 DEF cells is loss of DR5 expression rather than loss of receptor transport as has been recently observed (25Jin Z. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35829-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or unrelated anti-apoptotic defects, then replacement of DR5 into these cells should restore DR5 signaling. We introduced DR5 into BJABDR5 DEF cells and identified a clone that stably expressed surface DR5 at levels comparable to wild-type BJAB cells as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 4B). These cells showed similar cytotoxicity compared with wild-type BJAB cells when treated with αDR5, αDR4, and FasL (Fig. 4, C–E). Because replacement of DR5 into BJABDR5 DEF cells completely restores DR5 induced signaling, we conclude that the only DR5 signaling defect in BJABDR5 DEF cells is lack of DR5 expression. The C-terminal Tail of DR5 Is Required for Signaling in Response to mAb631 but Not HGS-ETR2—To test whether DR5ΔT had activity in the absence of endogenous DR5 receptor, DR5ΔT was stably expressed in BJABDR5 DEF cells. As a control for a DR5 receptor that cannot bind FADD because of a death domain defect, DR5 (L334F) was also expressed in the DR5-deficient background. A mutation of leucine 334 to phenylalanine in the death domain of DR5 is analogous to the lpr mutation in Fas, which abolishes receptor function by preventing FADD binding (19Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Neither DR5 (L334F) nor DR5ΔT are able to bind FADD as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells (Fig. 5A). To test whether these mutations completely destroyed protein function, we tested each DR5 construct for interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of wild-type DR5. DR5 forms homomeric complexes and this association occurs through interaction between the DR5 cytoplasmic domain (26Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Each DR5 construct co-precipitated with FLAG-DR5 indicating that the cytoplasmic domains of DR5 (L334F) and DR5ΔT are functionally intact (Fig. 5B). We next made cell lines stably expressing DR5 (L334F) or DR5ΔT. FACS analysis was used to identify clones expressing surface levels of DR5 (L334F) or DR5ΔT similar to BJABDR5 DEF-DR5 (Fig. 5C). Cytotoxicity in BJABDR5 DEF cells or clones expressing exogenous DR5, DR5 (L334F) and DR5ΔT was measured after treatment with several DR5 agonistic antibodies. When treated with mAb631, the agonistic DR5 antibody used in previous experiments, BJABDR5 DEF cells expressing wild-type DR5 were sensitive whereas cells expressing DR5ΔT or DR5 (L334F) were resistant (Fig. 5D). A similar pattern of sensitivity was observed when the same cells were treated with a second DR5 agonistic antibody, R2-A (data not shown). These observations were consistent with our previous data in which removal of the C-terminal tail from DR5 prevented signaling through the receptor. A different result was obtained when we treated cells with a third DR5 agonistic antibody, HGS-ETR2. BJABDR5 DEF cells expressing exogenous DR5 or DR5ΔT were sensitive (Fig. 5E) although DR5ΔT cells required higher doses of HGS-ETR2. In contrast, cells expressing DR5 (L334F) were completely resistant to HGS-ETR2. These data suggest that the tail of DR5 is not absolutely required for signaling induced by HGS-ETR2 as it is with other DR5 agonistic antibodies. Since DR5 (L334F) cells are resistant to every DR5 agonist but DR5ΔT cells are differentially sensitive we conclude that the death domain is essential while the tail of DR5 mediates sensitivity of the receptor to different agonists. Because HGS-ETR2 was able to induce apoptosis in BJABDR5 DEF cells expressing both DR5 and DR5ΔT, but mAb631 was able to induce apoptosis only in cells expressing DR5, we reasoned that these two antibodies might differentially recruit FADD to the truncated DR5 receptor. To test this hypothesis we performed DISC immunoprecipitation experiments with BJAB DR5 DEF cells or cells expressing DR5, DR5 (L334F), or DR5ΔT and immunoblotted for FADD. mAb631 recruited FADD to the DR5 receptor only in BJABDR5 DEF cells expressing wild-type DR5 (Fig. 5F). However, ETR2 was able to recruit FADD in cells expressing DR5 and cells expressing DR5ΔT. FADD was recruited to a lesser extent in cells expressing DR5ΔT compared with DR5 consistent with the dose response data in which DR5ΔT-expressing cells were sensitive to ETR2, but to a lesser extent than DR5-expressing cells. Next, we assessed caspase processing in response to saturating doses of mAb631 (1 μg/ml) and HGS-ETR2 (500 ng/ml). mAb631 was able to induce caspase-8 and caspase-3 processing only in BJABDR5 DEF cells expressing DR5 (Fig. 5G). Consistent with the dose response data, treatment with HGS-ETR2 resulted in the processing of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in BJABDR5 DEF cells expressing DR5, and cells expressing DR5ΔT. These data suggest that the C-terminal tail of DR5 is necessary for FADD recruitment through most stimuli. Because other stimuli such as the HGS-ETR2 antibody can overcome this defect and recruit FADD to induce caspase activation, diverse agonists to the DR5 receptor might activate the receptor through different mechanisms. TRAIL Signaling through DR5 Is Prevented by Removal of the C-terminal 12 Amino Acids—We next wished to assess whether TRAIL activation of DR5 requires the C-terminal tail similar to mAb631 or whether TRAIL can activate the receptor independent of the C-terminal tail like HGS-ETR2. To test any inhibitory effect associated with removal of the C-terminal tail in response TRAIL, we made Jurkat cells that stably express GFP or DR5ΔT. Jurkat cells express very low levels of DR4 (12Muhlenbeck F. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Schwenzer R. Hauser A. Schubert G. Scheurich P. Moosmayer D. Tschopp J. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32208-32213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) so almost all TRAIL signaling is through DR5. We identified several clones that expressed high levels of exogenous DR5ΔT all with similar responses to TRAIL; the expression level of DR5ΔT in a representative clone is shown in Fig. 6A. Jurkat cells expressing DR5ΔT showed decreased cytotoxicity compared with cells expressing GFP when treated with TRAIL (Fig. 6B). Apoptosis signaling was still intact in DR5ΔT Jurkat cells because all cell types were equally sensitive to death from FasL (Fig. 6C). When treated with TRAIL, Jurkat-GFP cells showed high levels of caspase-8 and caspase-3 processing, whereas cells expressing DR5ΔT showed very little (Fig. 6D). These data indicate that TRAIL signaling through DR5 requires the C-terminal tail similar to signaling with mAb631. Although there is much interest in TRAIL signaling because of its reported ability to kill tumor cells through FADD-dependent apoptosis while not affecting normal cells, the mechanism by which FADD is recruited to DR4 and DR5 is unclear. While some reports implicate TRADD (19Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) or DAP3 (20Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as an adaptor molecule to link FADD to DR4 and DR5, our data presented here and in a recent publication (22Thomas L.R. Henson A. Reed J.C. Salsbury F.R. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32780-32785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggests a model in which FADD can bind directly to the receptor. Because the C-terminal tail of Fas (amino acids 321–335) inhibits FADD binding to Fas, and FADD uses a similar surface for binding to both DR5 and Fas (22Thomas L.R. Henson A. Reed J.C. Salsbury F.R. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32780-32785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we thought that removal of the corresponding regions of DR4 and DR5 would enhance interaction of FADD with these receptors. Interestingly, the opposite result was obtained and removal of the C-terminal tails (14 amino acids from DR4 and 12 amino acids from DR5) inhibits FADD binding. Although Fas and TRAIL receptors are similar in that FADD is recruited directly, this suggests that the requirements for FADD binding are different. Removal of the C-terminal tails from DR4 and DR5 leaves the DD structurally intact because DR4 and DR5 mutants that lack the C-terminal tail are still able to bind their full-length counterpart. Thus, unlike the situation with Fas, the DDs of TRAIL receptors are not sufficient for FADD binding. Fas is the only mammalian death receptor with a solved structure for the DD (4Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and it has therefore served as a model for all other death receptors. Although a part of the C-terminal tail of Fas was removed in the solved structure, Huang et al. (4Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) observed that the region encompassing the death domain was well defined while the carboxyl terminal amino acids were disordered. Structural studies of the DR4 and DR5 intracellular domain will be important and may demonstrate that the corresponding C-terminal region of TRAIL receptors is more structured. DR4 and DR5 can form homomeric or heteromeric complexes (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), and this association occurs through interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of each receptor (26Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect that the tail-less DR4 receptor might partially block signaling through DR5 because this heteromeric complex should not bind FADD through the DR4ΔT cytoplasmic domain. However, we observed that signaling through DR5 that was activated by the DR5-specific antibody was unaltered in cells expressing DR4ΔT. The same was true for cells expressing DR5ΔT; responses to αDR4 were similar to those of GFP-expressing cells. This suggests that heteromeric complexes do not play an important role in apoptotic signaling through DR4 and DR5. In agreement with this view, Kischkel et al. (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) observed that there were fewer heteromeric complexes than homomeric complexes when the endogenous TRAIL DISCs were examined by immunoprecipitation. Quantitative differences between agonistic antibodies and FasL have been observed for the Fas receptor (27Huang D.C. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this case the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL could block death induced by Fas agonistic antibodies but not FasL suggesting that different agonists can signal through distinct mechanisms. Our data uncover a potential mechanism for such differential sensitivity in TRAIL signaling because different agonistic antibodies can display different requirements for regions in the intracellular domain of DR4 or DR5. Thus, binding of different agonists to the extracellular domain causes subtly different conformational changes in the intracellular domain that define the FADD binding surface of the receptor. We propose a model for TRAIL signaling in which the C-terminal tail plays a regulatory role in the recruitment of FADD to DR5 (and DR4). In this model, DR5 exists as a preformed trimer held together by interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of each receptor. In the absence of bound ligand the FADD binding surface of the trimers is not accessible to FADD (Fig. 7A). Binding of TRAIL or an agonistic antibody to the receptor trimer causes a conformational change that is normally facilitated by the C-terminal tail. This alteration exposes the FADD binding surface leading to the recruitment of FADD and initiation of the apoptotic cascade. In the absence of the C-terminal tail, binding of some ligands such as TRAIL or mAb631 is not sufficient to trigger this conformational change (Fig. 7B), FADD cannot be recruited and there is no apoptotic signal. However, some agonists such as HGS-ETR2 are able to overcome this layer of regulation and recruit FADD even in the absence of the C-terminal tail (Fig. 7C). These data indicate that activation of TRAIL receptors has mechanistic differences compared with activation of the Fas receptor and raise the possibility that it will be feasible to activate subtly different signaling mechanisms from the same receptor using different agonists. We thank Dr. Marcus Peter for providing BJAB cells and Minna Poukkula for help with DR4 and DR5 receptor staining."

Recently, SRF-3 was characterized as a nucleotide sugar transporter of the Golgi apparatus occurring exclusively in hypodermal seam cells, pharyngeal cells, and spermatheca. Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that srf-3 may have altered glyconjugates that may enable the mutant nematode to grow unaffected in the presence of the above pathogenic bacteria. Following analyses of N- and O-linked glycoconjugates of srf-3 and wild type nematodes using a combination of enzymatic degradation, permethylation, and mass spectrometry, we found in srf-3 a 65% reduction of acidic O-linked glycoconjugates containing glucuronic acid and galactose as well as a reduction of N-linked glycoconjugates containing galactose and fucose. These results are consistent with the specificity of SRF-3 for UDP-galactose and strongly suggest that the above glycoconjugates play an important role in allowing adhesion of M. nematophilum or Y. pseudotuberculosis biofilm to wild type C. elegans. Furthermore, because seam cells as well as pharyngeal cells secrete their glycoconjugates to the cuticle and surrounding surfaces, the results also demonstrate the critical role of these cells and their secreted glycoproteins in nematode-bacteria interactions and offer a mechanistic basis for strategies to block such recognition processes. srf-3 is a mutant of C. elegans that is resistant to infection by Microbacterium nematophilum and to binding of the biofilm produced by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis.

Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetically and developmentally well characterized organism that has been used as a model to study host-pathogen interactions. Many of these involve carbohydrate recognition, suggesting that chemical analyses of carbohydrate components involved in these processes may be important toward an understanding of the molecular basis for these interactions. The soil is the natural habitat for C. elegans, where it comes in contact with commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Among the latter are plant and animal pathogens such as Erwinia chrysantheimi, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Shewanella frigidimarina, Photorhabdus luminescens, Xenorhabdus nematophilus (1Couillault C.

Human pathogens can also infect C. elegans, including Gram-negatives, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5Darby C. Cosma C.L. Thomas J.H. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Host-pathogen interactions require bidirectional recognition factors, and often at least one of the components is a glycoconjugate (10Karlsson K.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 491: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Examples are bacterial toxins such as aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila, cholera from Vibrio cholerae, hemolysin from Escherichia coli, and the crystal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (11Rajamohan F.

C. elegans mutants resistant to this infection have been isolated and are defective in the bre gene family, one of which is a homolog of Drosophila melanogaster egghead (egh) and encodes a GDP-Man:βGlc-Cer β1,4-mannosyltransferase (bre-3); another encodes a UDP-GalNAc:β1,4N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (bre-4); and a third is a homolog of Drosophila brainiac (brn) and encodes a UDP-GlcNAc:Man N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (bre-5) (12Griffitts J.S.

Identification of these BRE activities of C. elegans provides striking evidence for the importance of carbohydrates in host-pathogen interactions of this nematode. The BRE proteins appear to be required for sensitivity to crystal proteins and offer a useful model to study invertebrate-host toxin interactions. Several of the above mentioned pathogens infect C. elegans by interacting with the cuticule and surrounding surfaces. Thus, M. nematophilum infects the posterior cuticule surface near the anal opening and adjacent rectal tissues, leading to reduced generation times and constipation (4Hodgkin J. Kuwabara P.E. Corneliussen B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis form a biofilm around the head region of C. elegans, preventing feeding and leading to starvation. C. elegans srf-2, -5, and -3 mutants, which have altered lectin binding affinity to the cuticule surface (2Darby C. Hsu J.W. Ghori N. Falkow S.

Berninsone P. Goebel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). SRF-3: GFP fusion protein shows tissue-specific expression at the spermatheca, hypodermal seam cells, and g1 and g2 glandular cells, with the last two cell types known to play a role in the biosynthesis of the cuticle and surrounding tissues (15Kramer J.M. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 471-500Google Scholar). Therefore, one might predict that in srf-3 a subset of glycans are altered, leading to the above described phenotypes. Isolation of N-Glycans—The glycoprotein-rich fraction was isolated from 10–15 g of C. elegans as previously described (16Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49143-49157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, following treatment of proteins with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, N-glycans were released with 8000 units/ml PNGase F (New England Biolabs) overnight at pH 8.5 and 37 °C. Free glycans were separated from the tryptic peptides by solvent precipitation (17Verostek M.F. Lubowski C. Trimble R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with 50% methanol at pH 5.5 followed by centrifugation at 3500 × g. The solutions, containing free glycans and some peptides, were subjected to rotary evaporation, and the resulting precipitate was suspended in distilled water and applied to Sep Pak C-18 cartridges. Glycans were collected by elution with distilled water. Adsorbed peptides were eluted with isopropyl alcohol, combined with those that had precipitated in 50% methanol, the mixture was dried, and the precipitate was suspended in mild base, pH 10.0. The pH was then adjusted to 5.5, and the mixture was digested with PNGase A. The above isolation procedure was then repeated to separate glycans from peptides. Free glycans were quantitated using the phenol sulfuric assay for neutral hexose standardized with mannose (18Duboius M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 350-356Google Scholar) except for those released by PNGase A, which were estimated by total ion intensity of MALDI 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; QoTOF, quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration TOF mass spectrometer; PNGase, peptide:N-glycanase.-TOF MS spectra compared with standardized samples. Isolation of O-Glycans—Subsequent to sequential PNGase F and A release of N-glycans, the above peptide/glycopeptide mixture was subjected to β elimination using standard protocols (19Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except that acidic glycans were eluted from AG-1X2 columns with 100 mm ammonium acetate following elution of neutral glycans from the same column with water. Solutions of the glycans were evaporated in a Savant speed vacuum apparatus prior to hydrolysis. Monosaccharide Analysis—Oligosaccharides were applied to porous graphitized carbon cartridges, washed with 3 ml of distilled water, and eluted with 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Monosaccharide analysis was performed on a Dionex high pH anion exchange chromatography system equipped with a MA-1 column, and content was determined using a linear calibration curve for each monosaccharide as previously described (19Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Permethylation of Oligosaccharides—Permethylation was done using a slight modification of the method of Ciucanu and Kerek (20Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) as previously described (16Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49143-49157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Analysis—MALDI-TOF MS was performed on a Bruker IV mass spectrometer in positive reflectron mode. Between 20 and 50 pmol of sample was applied to the MALDI target with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (20 mg/ml) in 20% acetonitrile in 10 mm sodium acetate. Between 150 and 200 shots from a nitrogen laser (337 nm) were summed. The laser pulse was 3 ns. Each analysis was performed in duplicate. The intensities of each molecular ion were averaged, and the S.E. was calculated. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation data were collected using an Applied Biosystems/MDS-Sciex QStar Pulsar quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration TOF mass spectrometer (QoTOF) with nanospray or MALDI (UV laser; nitrogen, 337 nm) sources (Applied Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The MALDI matrix was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and typically 50–200 laser shots were summed for each spectrum. The laser power used was 30–33 μJ. Nanospray data was collected using 1-μm nanospray tips, pulled with a Sutter model P-87 micropipette puller. Ion source voltage was 1200–1400 V. Nitrogen was used as the collision gas for MS/MS experiments. The range of operator-controlled collision voltages was 12–50 V for electrospray and 35–90 V for MALDI. Nomenclature is that of Domon and Costello (21Domon B. Costello C.E. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 397-409Crossref Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Rationale for Workup Strategy—Based on our knowledge that C. elegans srf-3 mutants are deficient in a Golgi apparatus transporter for UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc, we decided to assess the structures of N- and O-glycans released from protein extracts of whole mixed stages of srf-3 and wild type, parental N2 Bristol strain nematodes. Many of the C. elegans N- and O-glycan structures have been reported, thereby providing the basis for the comparisons of this study (16Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Staudacher E. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-Glycans from C. elegans can be released first with PNGase F, yielding most known N-glycans except those containing α1,3Fuc linked to the reducing end GlcNAc; thereafter, PNGase A treatment releases most remaining N-glycans. Although a subset of the N-glycans containing internally linked Gal are released with both of the above enzymes, the expectation, based on previous studies, was that these species should be enriched in the oligosaccharide fraction released by PNGase A (24Haslam S.M. Gems D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Haslam S.M. Dell A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, significant changes in Gal- or Fuc-containing N-glycans should be observable with this strategy, since previous studies with C. elegans suggest that Fuc addition to glycans often requires the previous addition of Gal (24Haslam S.M. Gems D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Haslam S.M. Dell A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). N-Glycans containing Golgi type GlcNAc or late additions may also be seen in the above N-glycan fractions. Previous studies showed that the major C. elegans O-linked glycans contain β1,3Gal bound to core Ser/Thr-linked GalNAc residues (23Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gal may be substituted by β1,2GlcA or β1–4,6Glc. The core GalNAc may also be substituted by β1,6Glc or β1,6Gal. Neutral and acidic O-glycans were therefore analyzed based on the prediction that in srf-3 mutants, all of the above O-glycan species may be affected qualitatively and quantitatively. N- and O-glycans were permethylated prior to MS analysis. This renders oligosaccharides chemically equivalent, with peak intensities generated in the mass spectrometer detector being similar over a broad mass range (29Harvey D.J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1999; 18: 349-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this approach, we found molecular ion intensities to vary within 0.7% S.E. of total spectral peak intensity when analyses were performed in duplicate. This reproducibility was maintained in samples originating from different nematode preparations, as shown below. PNGase F-released Glycans—In a preliminary study, monosaccharide analyses were performed on a PNGase F-released fraction of N2 wild type and srf-3 nematodes. The molar ratio of GlcN/Man/Gal/GalN/Fuc/Glc was 1:2:0.13:0.05:0.30:1.6 in wild-type and 1:1.6:0.07:trace:0.15:7.0 in srf-3 strains. The Gal, GalN, and Fuc content was lower in srf-3 than in wild type. Glc, which is often a contaminant of monosaccharide analysis, was higher in the srf-3 strain. Independently obtained duplicates of N-glycans released with PNGase F, followed by permethylation, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Fourteen oligosaccharides, shown in Fig. 1E and Table I, were obtained. The species of molecular ions at m/z 1754.0 and 1929.0 (Fig. 1, A–D) are diminished in the srf-3 mutants as shown by the asterisks in Fig. 1E. These two species are consistent with Fuc1–2Gal2Man3GlcNAc2, previously reported in C. elegans (24Haslam S.M. Gems D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Haslam S.M. Dell A.

A slight increase of Hex7–8HexNAc2 and complex Hex3–4HexNAc3 glycans was seen in srf-3 compared with wild type (Fig. 1E). The peaks at m/z 1905.9 and 1701.8 are most likely those of a glucose-containing polyhexose contaminant (Fig. 1; see below).Table IN-Glycans of C. elegans N2 Bristol and srf-3 strainsMeasured m/zCompositionaAll ions are sodium adducts.1171.7Man3GlcNAc21345.7Fuc1Man3GlcNAc21376.0Hex4GlcNAc21417.0Man3GlcNAc31550.0Fuc1Hex4GlcNAc21580.0Man5GlcNAc21663.0Man3GlcNAc41724.0Fuc2Hex4GlcNAc21754.0Fuc1Gal2Man3HexNAc21784.0Gal1Man5GlcNAc21866.4bGlycan molecular ions that are only observed in PNGase A releases and have not been previously reported.Hex4GlcNAc41929.0Fuc2Gal2Man3GlcNAc21988.0Man7GlcNAc22111.5bGlycan molecular ions that are only observed in PNGase A releases and have not been previously reported.Hex4HexNAc52173.3bGlycan molecular ions that are only observed in PNGase A releases and have not been previously reported.Fuc2Hex5HexNAc32192.4Man8GlcNAc22315.8bGlycan molecular ions that are only observed in PNGase A releases and have not been previously reported.Hex5HexNAc52277.0cGlycan molecular ions that are only observed in PNGase A releases and have been previously reported by Haslam et al.

Open table in a new tab When the above N-glycan mixtures were subjected to α1,2-mannosidase digestion, prior to permethylation and MALDI-TOF MS analyses, Hex7–9HexNAc2 decreased, whereas Hex5HexNAc2 increased, in both wild type and srf-3 (Fig. 2, A and B), demonstrating that abundant molecular ions in both strains are high mannose-containing glycans (Fig. 1 and Table I). Glycans with m/z 1754.0 and 1929.0, described above, were resistant to the above enzymatic treatment and most likely do not contain terminally linked α1,2-linked Man (Fig. 2A). The majority of Hex6HexNAc2, m/z 1784.0 (Fig. 1, B and D), of both strains is resistant to α1,2-mannosidase, demonstrating that it is not Man6GlcNAc2, which contains one terminal α1,2Man (Fig. 2, A and B). However, when the mixtures were subjected to jack bean α-mannosidase digestion, the Hex6HexNAc2 signal intensity was greatly diminished in both strains. High mannose glycans are expected to be digested with α-mannosidase to Man1–2GlcNAc2. Since, after this treatment, peak intensity for Hex3HexNAc2 remains, it is likely that a significant amount of this compound is derived from the Hex6HexNAc2 after loss of three mannose residues (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Jack bean α-mannosidase analysis of C. elegans N2 Bristol and srf-3 PNGase F released N-glycans.

The Hex6HexNAc2 peak was collected, identified as the major species by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 4A, m/z 1539.6), further purified by porous graphite chromatography, and subjected to hydrolysis for monosaccharide analysis. In this case, GlcN, derived from GlcNAc, is underrepresented as a result of derivatization during reductive amination with 2-aminobenzamide of the reducing end. The Hex6HexNAc2 sample yielded Gal:Man in a 1:3 molar ratio (Fig. 4B). A small peak for GlcN was also seen, as well as a major one for Glc, the latter being most likely a contaminant from the polyhexoses (m/z 1133.5 and 1295.5) in Figs. 1 and 4A. The above results lead us to postulate that the Hex6HexNAc2 was Gal1Man5GlcNAc2, with none of the Man being terminally α1,2-linked, and consistent with the retention of the five archetypal Man residues. A possible linkage sequence may be Manα1,6(Manα1,3)Man1,6(Gal1,XManα1,3)-Manβ1,4β1,-4GlcNAc2. This glycan was then analyzed by CID fragmentation using nanospray on the QoTOF mass spectrometer (Fig. 5). Abundant product ions corresponding to Y, B, and C fragments are obtained from cleavage of each glycosidic bond in the predicted Manα1,6(Manα1,3)Man1,6(Gal1,XManα1,3)-Manβ1,4β1,4GlcNAc2 structure. The 3,5A3 (m/z 764.80) cross-ring fragment and 2,5A3α/Y3β (m/z 794.31) secondary fragment are consistent with the Manα1,6(Manα1,3)Man1,6 moiety that was suggested by its sensitivity toward jack bean α-mannosidase digestion. Also, the B2α/Y4x (m/z 432.21, x = α′ and α″) secondary fragment is diagnostic of the disubstituted Man in the same Manα1,6(Manα1,3)Man1,6 moiety. The B4/Y3β (m/z 1084.49) and B3/Y3α (m/z 839.4) secondary fragments are diagnostic of the Gal1,XManα1,3 lower arm. Haslam et al. (24Haslam S.M. Gems D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have predicted the Gal-Man linkage in the likely related Fuc1–4Gal2Man3GlcNAc2 compounds to be Gal1,2Manα1,3. However, we could not confirm this assignment because the likely predictive cross-ring fragment ions were not unique values. The Gal1Man5GlcNAc2 fragmentation pattern, resistance to α1,2-mannosidase, loss of 3Man with jack bean α-mannosidase, and presence of Gal led us to postulate its structure as follows: Manα1,6(Manα1,3)Man1,6(Gal1,Manα1,3)Manβ1,-4β1,4GlcNAc2. We observed that some of these oligosaccharides are methylated in vivo, leading to their dispersion into a series of minor peaks that cause difficulties in their purification. This may explain our failure to detect these Gal-containing oligosaccharides in our original analysis of C. elegans N-glycans when using high field NMR (16Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B.

The abundance of Hex3HexNAc3–4 was slightly increased in srf-3 compared with wild type, demonstrating that the addition of GlcNAc was similar (Fig. 1 and Table II). Previous studies from our own and other laboratories had identified the other PNGase F-released glycans shown in Fig. 1E such as Hex3–5HexNAc2–4 as Man3–5GlcNAc2–4 (16Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E.

This shift, which is consistent with the reduced availability of UDP-Gal in these srf-3 mutants, was also observed previously, but less dramatically, in the PNGase F-released fraction (Fig. 1E). The major peaks observed in the PNGase A fraction in both wild type and srf-3 correspond to residual high mannose glycans Man7–9GlcNAc2 that were not completely released by PNGase F. Overall, in the above studies, the ion intensity is shifted toward GlcNAc-modified glycans; therefore, although SRF-3 transports UDP-GlcNAc, it is unlikely that the availability of this nucleotide sugar was reduced for the biosynthesis of PNGase A-releasable glycans in srf-3 mutants. Acidic O-Glycan Fraction—Acidic O-glycans were eluted from an AG-1X2 column with 100 mm ammonium acetate following neutral O-glycan elution with water. The total amount of acidic O-glycans of srf-3 was ∼3-fold less than wild type (106 versus 298 nmol/g) as determined by a phenol sulfuric assay. Most molecular ions detected in this fraction indicated the presence of HexA (Fig. 7 and Table II), consistent with the composition of GlcA-containing oligosaccharides previously reported for C. elegans (23Guerardel Y.

FYVE domains, which mediate the recruitment of signaling and membrane-trafficking proteins to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-containing endosomes, exhibit distinct subcellular localization despite minor structural variations within the family. Biophysical measurements, cellular imaging, and computational analysis of various FYVE domains showed that the introduction of a single cationic residue and a hydrophobic loop into the membrane binding region of the FYVE domains dramatically enhanced their membrane interactions. The results indicated that there is a threshold affinity for endosomal localization and that endosomal targeting of FYVE domains is sensitive to small changes in membrane affinity about this threshold. Collectively these studies provide new insight into how subcellular localization of FYVE domains and other membrane targeting domains can be regulated by minimal structural and environmental changes.

Numerous cellular processes such as signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal rearrangement require the exquisite targeting of peripheral proteins to various subcellular membranes. A large portion of this cellular membrane targeting is achieved by specific recognition of particular membrane lipids by proteins. A diverse group of membrane-targeting domains that specifically recognize different types of membrane lipids have been identified in the past decade. They include Bin Amphiphysin Rvs (BAR) (1Lee E.

Except for the C1 domain that binds diacylglycerol, these domains recognize phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, collectively known as phosphoinositides. Although much is known about the structural basis of stereospecific lipid head group recognition by these domains, less is known about the mechanisms by which they achieve efficient and reversible binding to the cell membranes containing their lipid ligands. In particular, there is much to learn about the structural and mechanistic basis of the regulation of the targeting of lipid-interacting domains to different intracellular membranes. Among various membrane-targeting domains, the FYVE domain serves as an excellent model to address these questions. This is because FYVE domains from different proteins exhibit drastically different subcellular localization behaviors (18Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H.

Ktistakis N. Davidson K. Anderson K.E. Manifava M. Ellson C.D. Lipp P. Bootman M. Coadwell J. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cooper M.A. Thuring J.W. Lim Z.Y. Holmes A.B. Stephens L.R.

Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) FYVE domains have been reported to autonomously translocate to endosomal membranes when expressed ectopically. It is therefore unclear as to how these three isolated domains achieve unique endosomal targeting properties and how FYVE domains, in general, contribute to the membrane targeting of their host proteins in different ways. In this study, we performed in vitro membrane binding measurements, subcellular localization measurements, and computational analyses of the FYVE domains of FENS-1, endofin, Hrs, Vps27p, and their respective mutants to elucidate the structural and mechanistic basis of unique endosomal targeting behaviors of the FENS-1 and endofin FYVE domains. These studies provide new insight into how distinctively different subcellular localization behaviors of FYVE domains are caused by minor structural variations in the membrane binding region and how subcellular localization of these membrane targeting domains can be regulated by minimal structural and environmental changes. Materials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), -phosphoserine (POPS), and -phosphoethanolamine (POPE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Inositol 1,3-bisphosphate (Ins(1,3)P2) was from A. G. Scientific. PtdIns(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P) were synthesized as described previously (33Kubiak R.J. Bruzik K.S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 2415-2418Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from Biacore AB. The human embryonic kidney 293 cell line, Zeocin, and ponasterone A were from Invitrogen. Mutagenesis and Protein Expression—Mutations of FYVE domains were performed by the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction method (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). Each construct was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector containing an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for protein expression. Recombinant FYVE domains were expressed and purified as described previously (27Stahelin R.V. Long F. Diraviyam K. Bruzik K.S. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26379-26388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The genes for FYVE domains and mutants were also subcloned into a modified pIND vector to contain a C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) construct as described previously (35Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Monolayer and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements— Surface pressure (π) of the lipid monolayers was measured as described previously (27Stahelin R.V. Long F. Diraviyam K. Bruzik K.S. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26379-26388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The kinetic SPR measurements were performed at 23 °C using a lipid-coated L1 chip in the BIACORE X system as described previously (36Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore AB) to determine ka and kd, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was then calculated using the equation Kd = kd/ka assuming 1:1 binding, i.e. protein + protein binding site on vesicle ↔ complex (36Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Equilibrium (steady-state) SPR measurements were performed as described previously (27Stahelin R.V. Long F. Diraviyam K. Bruzik K.S. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26379-26388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Saturating response values (Req) were then plotted versus protein concentrations (C), and the Kd value was determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis of the binding isotherm using the equation Req = Rmax/(1 + Kd/C). Fluorimetric Binding Measurements—The affinity of FYVE domains for Ins(1,3)P2 was determined by monitoring the decrease in Trp fluorescence intensity (ΔI) upon ligand binding. Ins(1,3)P2 was titrated into 3 μm FYVE domains in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.16 m KCl, and the Trp fluorescence emission peak (300-400 nm) was integrated with excitation wavelength set at 290 nm (I). The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined by non-linear least-squares fitting of the binding isotherm to a simple Langmuir-type saturation binding equation (37Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), ΔI/ΔImax=(I0−I)/(I0−If)=Po+Kd+Lo−(Po+Kd+Lo)2−4PoLo2Po(Eq. 1) where I0 and If are I values in the absence and presence of saturating concentration of Ins(1,3)P2, respectively, and Po and Lo are analytic concentrations of protein and Ins(1,3)P2, respectively. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments (38Laue T.M. Stafford W.F. II I Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) were performed on an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Samples were loaded into six-channel Epon charcoal-filled centerpieces using quartz windows. Measurements were done at 25 °C using four different speeds (16,000, 18,800, 23,500, and 31,000 rpm), detecting at 280 nm, with sufficient time for equilibrium to be reached in between each speed increase. All FYVE domains (10, 20, and 30 μm) were prepared in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.16 m KCl, which was also used as the reference buffer. Solvent density was calculated to be 0.9982 g/ml. From the amino acid composition of each FYVE domain, the partial specific volume was estimated to be 0.719 (endofin-FYVE), 0.715 (FENS-1-FYVE), and 0.712 (Hrs-FYVE) ml/g. Data were analyzed with the UltraScan 6.2 software to determine the molecular mass. Structural Modeling—The Drosophila Hrs FYVE domain (25Mao Y. Nickitenko A. Duan X. Lloyd T.E. Wu M.N. Bellen H. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was used as the structural template for building homology models for both endofin and FENS-1 FYVE domains. The alignment between the endofin and Hrs sequences and the homology model were both constructed with the automated homology model server 3D-Jigsaw (39Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J. Proteins. 1999; 37: 47-54Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between the endofin and Hrs FYVE domains is 42%. The alignment between the FENS-1 and Hrs FYVE domains was extracted from a multiple alignment of FYVE domain sequences constructed with ClustalW (40Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55386) Google Scholar); the sequence identity between the two FYVE domains is 36%. According to the alignment, the FENS-1 FYVE domain has an 11-residue insertion in the vicinity of the hydrophobic motif, which is conserved across FYVE domains and occurs immediately before the first β-strand observed in the FYVE domain structures (Fig. 1). Secondary structure prediction programs predict, with low confidence, that this region is either unstructured or partially α-helical (40Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55386) Google Scholar, 41Baldi P. Brunak S. Frasconi P. Soda G. Pollastri G.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). We used both Modeler6 (43Eswar N. John B. Mirkovic N. Fiser A. Ilyin V.A. Pieper U. Stuart A.C. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Yerkovich B. Sali A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and Nest (44Petrey D. Xiang Z. Tang C.L. Xie L. Gimpelev M. Mitros T. Soto C.S. Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kernytsky A. Schlessinger A. Koh I.Y. Alexov E. Honig B. Proteins. 2003; 53: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) to construct models for the FENS-1 FYVE domain based on the alignment extracted from the multiple sequence alignment. We implemented the loop prediction modules that are offered by both programs (45Xiang Z. Soto C.S. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 46Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Modeler6 predicted a fairly extended loop, while Nest predicted a more compact loop (a representative example of which is given in Fig. 2). The insert predicted by Nest scored better according to the structure evaluation tool Verify3D (47Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Overall, however, the analysis suggests that the insert is disordered, and its conformation may be affected by its interaction with the membrane surface. Electrostatic potential calculations were performed as described previously (27Stahelin R.V. Long F. Diraviyam K. Bruzik K.S. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26379-26388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Microscopy—A stable human embryonic kidney 293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all experiments as described previously (35Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Microscopy data were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. A 40×, 1.2 numerical aperture immersion objective was used for all experiments. Transfected cells were washed twice with 1 mm HEPES, buffer pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 6 mm sucrose. After washing, cells were overlaid with 150 μl of the same buffer. Suitable cells were selected for imaging, and a single image was taken. In control experiments, cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin for 30 min to determine the effects of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition on FYVE domain subcellular localization. For colocalization experiments, transfected cells expressing EGFP-FYVE domain constructs were incubated with 25 μg/ml human transferrin conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 633 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with the above buffer to remove excess dye and subjected to dual channel imaging. EGFP and Alexa Fluor 633 were excited optimally at 488 and 633 nm, respectively, and emission was measured using a band pass 505-530 nm filter for EGFP and a line pass 650 nm filter for Alexa Fluor 633 on separate channels. Structural Properties of FYVE Domains—When compared with other FYVE domains, FENS-1 (20Ridley S.H. Ktistakis N. Davidson K. Anderson K.E. Manifava M. Ellson C.D. Lipp P. Bootman M. Coadwell J. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cooper M.A. Thuring J.W. Lim Z.Y. Holmes A.B. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3991-4000PubMed Google Scholar), endofin (19Seet L.F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and SARA (22Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) FYVE domains have some unique structural features (see Fig. 1). SARA-FYVE and endofin-FYVE have highly homologous primary structures, and both contain a unique Lys residue in the turret loop, which is a Val in EEA1 and an Asn in Vps27p and Drosophila Hrs. FENS-1-FYVE has an 11-amino acid insertion next to the turret loop region. To understand how these unique structural properties of the three FYVE domains affect their membrane binding, we first performed structural modeling of the FYVE domains of endofin and FENS-1 based on the sequence homology to other FYVE domains with known tertiary structure (i.e. Vps27p, Hrs, and EEA1). We also calculated the electrostatic potentials for four FYVE domains used in this study. Since endofin-FYVE and SARA-FYVE are structurally similar, we characterized only endofin-FYVE in this study. Structural modeling suggests that endofin-FYVE (Fig. 2, first row) should have essentially the same structure as the Hrs and Vps27p FYVE domains (Fig. 2, third and fourth rows). However, it has a dramatically stronger positive potential than the other two FYVE domains with an overall charge of +13 compared with that of +7 for Vps27p and +10 for Hrs (28Diraviyam K. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Murray D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, compare row 1 with rows 3 and 4). Thus, this FYVE domain may achieve high affinity for the membrane through enhanced nonspecific electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids in the membrane in addition to its specific interaction with PtdIns(3)P. The FYVE domain sequence alignment (Fig. 1) as well as homology models (Fig. 2, second row) suggest that FENS-1-FYVE has an extended turret loop due to the 11-amino acid extension, which is rich in aromatic residues (Fig. 2, second row, green). It has been shown that aromatic residues, such as two Trp residues in FENS-1-FYVE turret loop, play an important role in membrane-protein interactions (36Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that the turret loop of the Hrs and Vps27p FYVE domains partially penetrates PtdIns(3)P-containing membranes and thereby increases membrane affinity (27Stahelin R.V. Long F. Diraviyam K. Bruzik K.S. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26379-26388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, it is expected that FENS-1-FYVE will have an exceptional ability to penetrate the membrane and exhibit high membrane affinity. A model structure of FENS-1-FYVE in Fig. 2 has a positive electrostatic potential profile in the membrane binding region that is comparable to those of the Hrs and Vps27p FYVE domains (Fig. 2, compare row 2 with rows 3 and 4), suggesting that its nonspecific electrostatic interactions with the membrane would be similar to those of the other two FYVE domains. In Vitro Membrane Binding Properties of FYVE Domains—To test whether the FYVE domains of endofin and FENS-1 have the predicted membrane binding properties, we characterized their in vitro membrane binding by two independent methods. First, we measured the interaction of different FYVE domains with phospholipid monolayers at the air-water interfaces that serve as a highly sensitive probe of the membrane penetrating capability of proteins (37Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 48Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1982; 30: 189-227Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this study, a monolayer composed of POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(3)P (63:20:15:2), which simulates the lipid composition of early endosomes, of a given surface pressure (π0) was spread at constant area, and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was monitored after the injection of FYVE domains into the subphase. In general, Δπ is inversely proportional to π0 of the phospholipid monolayer, and an extrapolation of Δπ versus π0 yields πc, which specifies an upper limit to the value of π0 of a monolayer into which a protein can penetrate (37Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114)"
https://openalex.org/W1982176828,"Centrin is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein closely related to the prototypical calcium sensor protein calmodulin. It is found in microtubule-organizing centers of organisms ranging from algae and yeast to man. In vitro, the C-terminal domain of centrin binds to the yeast centrosomal protein Kar1p in a calcium-dependent manner, whereas the N-terminal domain does not show any appreciable affinity for Kar1p. To obtain deeper insights into the structural basis for centrin's function, we have characterized the affinities of the C-terminal domain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin for calcium and for a peptide fragment of Kar1p using CD, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. Calcium binding site IV in C. reinhardtii centrin was found to bind Ca2+ ∼100-fold more strongly than site III. In the absence of Ca2+, the protein occupies a mixture of closed conformations. Binding of a single ion in site IV is sufficient to radically alter the conformational equilibrium, promoting occupancy of an open conformation. However, an exchange between closed and open conformations remains even at saturating levels of Ca2+. The population of the open conformation is substantially stabilized by the presence of the target peptide Kar1p-(239–257) to a point where a single ion bound in site IV is sufficient to completely shift the conformational equilibrium to the open conformation. This is reflected in the enhancement of the Ca2+ affinity in this site by more than an order of magnitude. These data confirm the direct coupling of the Ca2+ binding-induced shift in the equilibrium between the closed and open conformations to the binding of the peptide. Combined with the common localization of the two proteins in the microtubule organizing center, our results suggest that centrin is constitutively bound to Kar1p through its C-terminal domain and that centrin's calcium sensor activities are mediated by the N-terminal domain.

The microtubule-based cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells is regulated by a large multi-protein assembly termed the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), 1The abbreviations used are: MTOC, microtubule organizing center; CRC-C, 77-residue C-terminal fragment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin; CaM, calmodulin; cdc31p, the yeast homolog of centrin; K19, 19-residue cdc31p-binding domain of Kar1p; ANS, 8-anilino-1-anphthalenesulfonate; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence.1The abbreviations used are: MTOC, microtubule organizing center; CRC-C, 77-residue C-terminal fragment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin; CaM, calmodulin; cdc31p, the yeast homolog of centrin; K19, 19-residue cdc31p-binding domain of Kar1p; ANS, 8-anilino-1-anphthalenesulfonate; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. which organizes the number, direction, and polarity of the microtubules. In higher eukaryotes, the centrosome serves as the MTOC; in lower organisms, equivalent organelles exist, e.g. the basal body in algae and the spindle pole body in yeast. Despite compositional and structural heterogeneity, the MTOCs in all eukaryotes contain conserved protein components (Fig. 1). One of these conserved proteins is centrin (also known as caltractin), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that has been identified in a wide range of species (1Schiebel E. Bornens M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Genetic studies show that centrin is essential to the cell cycle-dependent duplication and segregation of the MTOCs (3Baum P. Furlong C. Byers B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5512-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Taillon B.E. Adler S.A. Suhan J.P. Jarvik J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, centrin-based fiber contraction also plays a fundamental role in microtubule severing at the time of flagellar excision (5Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Centrin is closely related to the archetypal EF-hand calcium sensor protein calmodulin (CaM), which also plays a role in centrosome function. Both proteins are comprised of two structurally independent globular domains connected by a flexible linker, each domain containing two helix-loop-helix calcium binding motifs (Fig. 2). However, centrin and CaM have markedly different calcium binding properties. CaM has four high affinity calcium binding sites with dissociation constants (Kd) ranging from 1 to 10 μm under physiological salt concentrations (6Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), well within the range for effective response to intracellular Ca2+ signals. In contrast, most centrins have one or more non-functional calcium binding sites. For example, mutational studies and predictions based on the amino acid sequences of the calcium binding loops both suggest that site II and site III in yeast centrin (cdc31p) are defective in binding calcium (7Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, the C-terminal domain of C. reinhardtii centrin (CRC-C) has substantially lower affinity for calcium than that observed for typical EF-hand calcium sensors such as CaM (8Veeraraghavan S. Fagan P.A. Hu H. Lee V. Harper J.F. Huang B. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28564-28571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The reduced affinity of CRC-C is ascribed to the replacement of a highly conserved glutamate with an aspartate at position 12 in calcium binding site III. Kar1p is one of the few known targets reported for centrin (9Biggins S. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Spang A. Courtney I. Grein K. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 863-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Like cdc31p, Kar1p is an essential component of the spindle pole body in yeast (Fig. 1). Biggins and Rose proposed that one of the functions of Kar1p was to localize cdc31p to the spindle pole body (9Biggins S. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The putative cdc31p-binding domain of Kar1p, Kar1p-(239–257), was identified by Schiebel and co-workers (10Spang A. Courtney I. Grein K. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 863-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that the corresponding 19-residue synthetic peptide (here designated K19) binds to cdc31p in a Ca2+-dependent manner in vitro (7Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Remarkably, mutational and biophysical studies strongly suggest that the interaction of cdc31p with Kar1p is mediated solely by its C-terminal domain, even though the macroscopic binding affinity for Ca2+ of this domain measured in vitro is outside the range for a normal Ca2+ sensor (7Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. Genetics. 2001; 157: 503-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the (Ca2+)2-CRC-C-K19 complex has recently been determined (12Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and reveals that CRC-C occupies an open conformation similar to that adopted by the CaM domains in their Ca2+-activated state (Fig. 2). That study also revealed how subtle differences in the sequence of residues at the target binding surface translate into the different target selectivities of centrin and calmodulin. In this report, we describe investigations of the calcium and peptide binding properties of CRC-C using CD, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal biochemical features in centrin that enable binding to Kar1p and provide insights into the molecular mechanism of centrin functions in the cell. Protein Preparation—The recombinant C. reinhardtii centrin C-terminal domain was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (8Veeraraghavan S. Fagan P.A. Hu H. Lee V. Harper J.F. Huang B. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28564-28571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 77-residue construct used in this study consists of residues Gly-95 through Phe-169 plus a remaining Gly-Ser sequence at the N terminus after removal of the His6 tag. Protein concentration was determined using the Advanced protein assay (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO). Preparation of apo CRC-C followed previously published procedures involving extensive Chelex treatment (8Veeraraghavan S. Fagan P.A. Hu H. Lee V. Harper J.F. Huang B. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28564-28571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the calcium titrations, appropriate buffers were also treated with Chelex 100 to minimize calcium contamination. Concentration of residual calcium was estimated to be <1 μm by atomic absorption (Galbraith Laboratories Inc., Knoxville, TN). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—K19, the 19-residue peptide (KKRELIESKWHRLLFHDKK) comprising the essential yeast centrin binding site in Kar1p (239–257) (10Spang A. Courtney I. Grein K. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 863-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was synthesized using solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. It was subsequently purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) on a Waters 600 system (Waters, Milford, MA). The purity of the peptide was established to be >95% by mass spectroscopy. The concentration of the peptide was determined from A280 measurements using a molar extinction coefficient of 5700 m–1 cm–1. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements were conducted on a Jasco J-810 (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) spectropolarimeter at 293 K with constant stirring. Samples contained 3 μm CRC-C in 150 mm KCl and 25 mm Tris at pH 7. For the calcium titration, small aliquots of a 9 mm CaCl2 solution were added to achieve calcium-to-protein molar ratios between 0.5:1 and 50:1. To verify the apo state of the protein, 300 μm EDTA was added to the calcium-free sample, and no discernible change in the CD spectra was observed. Subsequent titrations started with fresh apo protein samples free of EDTA. All spectra were the average of two scans over the range 190–260 nm with a step size of 0.2 nm and a bandwidth of 1 nm. The titration was repeated in the presence of a ∼1.2-fold molar excess of the K19 peptide. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All fluorescence experiments were performed on a Spex Fluorolog 1681 fluorometer (Spex Industries Inc., Edison, NJ) at 298 K, with all slit widths set to 2.0 mm. Excitation wavelengths were 374 and 285 nm for 8-anilino-1-anphthalenesulfonate (ANS) and K19, respectively. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a single scan over the range 450–550 nm for ANS or 300–400 nm for K19. For the conformational characterizations by fluorescence, small aliquots of appropriate dilutions of a 1.0 m CaCl2 standard solution were added to a sample containing either 40 μm ANS plus 4 μm decalcified CRC-C or 6 μm K19 plus 5 μm decalcified CRC-C, both in 150 mm KCl and 25 mm Tris at pH 7.1. For the ANS binding measurements, a control experiment was also performed, demonstrating that Ca2+ alone has no effect on ANS fluorescence. For measurement of K19 binding to CRC-C, small aliquots of appropriate dilutions of a 1 mm apo CRC-C stock solution in a buffer containing 150 mm KCl and 25 mm Tris at pH 7.1 were added to a 5 μm K19 peptide solution under identical buffer conditions and incubated with 1 mm EDTA, 5 μm Ca2+, or 5 mm Ca2+. The spectra were corrected for background fluorescence by subtracting out the spectrum of the buffer. In each titration, 20 data points were collected over a protein-to-peptide molar ratio of 0–10:1, except in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, in which case 15 data points were collected over protein-to-peptide molar ratios of 0–50:1. The peptide binding constants were obtained by fitting the fluorescence intensity at 320 nm to a single site binding model using the program Caligator (13Andre I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The fitting was carried out with an initial guess for Kd, and then the best fit to the data was obtained using this guessed value. The analysis was repeated with a wide range of initial guesses for Kd and invariably converged. The uncertainties in the Kd values are taken from the S.D. values of the multiple fits. To estimate the accuracy of the fits, theoretical binding curves were generated by simulations with different parameters adjusted. These simulations showed that reasonable estimates could be obtained when Kd values were within 10-fold of the protein concentration, albeit with diminishing precision as the difference between the protein concentration and Kd increases. High S.D. values indicate accuracy to only one significant figure and permit only an estimate of the upper or lower bound to be made. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR data were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer equipped with triple-resonance probe-heads and triple-axis pulsed field gradient accessories. 1H and 15N chemical shift assignments for Ca2+-bound CRC-C in the presence of K19 were reported previously (12Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 1H and 15N chemical shift assignments for Ca2+-bound CRC-C in the absence of the peptide were obtained from HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and CBCANH experiments (14Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar) acquired on a ∼1mm CRC-C sample uniformly enriched in 15N and 13C in a buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 25 mm Tris-d11 at pH 7. Some resonances were broadened beyond detection as a result of conformational exchange between closed and open conformations. Consequently, only 62 residues of 77 (∼80%) could be assigned. The samples used in the two calcium titrations initially contained ∼200 μm15N-enriched CRC-C in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl and 25 mm Tris-d11 at pH 7.1, either in the absence or presence of a 1.2-fold molar excess of the K19 peptide. Small aliquots of a 1 m CaCl2 standard solution were added to the protein solution, and two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded with spectral widths of 14.5 and 26.0 ppm in the 1H and 15N dimension, respectively. Change in pH during the titrations was negligible. Each data set was collected with 32 scans over 64 × 1024 complex points. Data were processed using Felix 2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) with linear prediction to 128 complex points in ω1, application of a 75°-shifted sine bell window function in each dimension, and zero filling to 256 × 2048 complex points before Fourier transformation. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid, and 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to 1H. The calcium binding parameters were determined by fitting the titration data to a two-site binding model using the program Caligator as described in the original paper (13Andre I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The analysis of the data was similar to that described above for fitting of the fluorescence data. The affinity of CRC-C for Ca2+ was investigated previously using the calcium-sensitive electrode method and one-dimensional proton NMR (8Veeraraghavan S. Fagan P.A. Hu H. Lee V. Harper J.F. Huang B. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28564-28571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The calcium electrode technique is limited in that it provides only the macroscopic calcium binding constants without yielding insight into the microscopic binding events. Although one-dimensional NMR can probe microscopic binding events, it is limited by the very small number of resonances that remain fully resolved during the entire course of a titration. To gain greater insight into Ca2+ binding and the associated effects on the conformational properties of CRC-C, CD, fluorescence, and two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC NMR were used to monitor calcium titrations of CRC-C. The two-dimensional NMR approach proved to be particularly powerful, because it enables a large number of site-specific spectral probes to be monitored simultaneously during the course of the titration. However, it is important to note that NMR is limited by sensitivity constraints to protein concentrations in the range of ∼10 μm and above and, thus, is not capable of providing accurate dissociation constants in the low micromolar range or less. To complement the studies on the free protein and obtain greater mechanistic insight into how centrin functions in the cell, the same biophysical approaches were used to investigate the binding of the K19 peptide fragment of Kar1p, one of the known centrin binding partners in the MTOC. Analysis of Changes in Structure from Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism was used to characterize the distribution of secondary structural elements in CRC-C and determine whether any changes occurred upon binding Ca2+ and/or K19. The far-UV light CD spectra of CRC-C at various [Ca2+]/[CRC-C] ratios are highly similar in shape, with two minima at 208 and 222 nm, typical of a protein rich in α-helix (Fig. 3A). An increase in molar ellipticity (monitored at 208 nm) is observed upon the addition of calcium, reaching a maximum of ∼15%. Similar observations have been made for cdc31p and other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (7Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Martin S.R. Lu A.Q. Xiao J. Kleinjung J. Beckingham K. Bayley P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of the well studied Ca2+ sensors CaM and troponin C, three-dimensional structures determined in the absence and presence of Ca2+ show that this effect is due to reorganization of the disposition of the helices within the EF-hand domains. For other proteins, particularly for those that are poorly structured in the apo state, the increased molar ellipticity is attributed to an increase in helical content associated with stabilization of the structure. The CD profile of mixtures of CRC-C and the peptide are similar to those of the free protein, indicating the predominance of helical secondary structure (Fig. 3B). There is a significant increase in molar ellipticity as the peptide is titrated into the protein solution, both in the absence and presence of Ca2+. Because the free peptide occupies a predominantly random coil conformation, as suggested by its CD spectrum (Fig. 3B), the higher overall value of CD molar ellipticity observed in the presence of CRC-C is attributable to induced helicity in K19. The change in the CD spectrum elicited by adding Ca2+ to the mixture of CRC-C and the K19 peptide is similar to that observed upon the addition of Ca2+ to the protein alone, i.e. the overall increase in the molar ellipticity through the course of the titration is comparable in magnitude. However, saturation of the change in molar ellipticity was achieved at a significantly lower [Ca2+]/[CRC-C] ratio in the protein-peptide mixture, suggesting that CRC-C has a higher affinity for Ca2+ in the presence of the peptide. Ca2+Binding-induced Changes in the Conformation of CRC-C—Calcium-induced exposure of hydrophobic surfaces has been shown to be a key step in signal transduction by EF-hand Ca2+ sensor proteins. A useful probe of such conformational changes is the hydrophobic fluorophore ANS (17Bayley P. Ahlstrom P. Martin S.R. Forsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Steiner R.F. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1121-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), because its fluorescence is altered when it binds to hydrophobic patches on the accessible surface of proteins. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, the fluorescence emission spectrum of ANS in the presence of apo CRC-C is almost identical to that of ANS by itself, indicating that apo CRC-C does not bind ANS. The addition of calcium leads to increases in the fluorescence intensity and concomitant blue shifts in the maximum wave-length of emission (λmax), indicating the exposure of hydrophobic patches on the molecular surface of CRC-C. It is of note that saturation of the ANS fluorescence change is not reached at 10 molar eq of Ca2+, or even when the titration is carried out to 100 molar eq (additional data not shown). Moreover, the overall change in fluorescence intensity is considerably smaller than that reported for the corresponding titration carried out on CaM (17Bayley P. Ahlstrom P. Martin S.R. Forsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Ababou A. Shenvi R.A. Desjarlais J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12719-12726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CRC-C may not adopt a fully open conformation or, more likely, that there is an equilibrium distribution between closed and open conformations even at such high levels of Ca2+. Binding of K19 and Changes in the Conformation of CRC-C— The K19 peptide contains a tryptophan residue, which is found to be buried in a deep hydrophobic pocket in the structure of the (Ca2+)2-CRC-C-K19 complex (12Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This intrinsic fluorophore provides a convenient probe for monitoring concomitant binding of the peptide with calcium-induced conformational changes in CRC-C. The Trp fluorescence emission spectra of K19 in the presence of CRC-C and various levels of Ca2+ are compared in Fig. 4B. The addition of apo CRC-C leads to only very slight changes in the fluorescence spectrum of K19, indicating that CRC-C does not bind the peptide with any appreciable affinity in the absence of calcium. Upon the addition of 1 eq of calcium, the fluorescence spectrum displays a substantial increase in intensity and a large blue shift (∼30 nm in λmax), indicative of strong interaction between the K19 peptide and CRC-C. Interestingly, the addition of calcium beyond 1 eq leads to little further change in the fluorescence spectrum, suggesting that the binding of a single Ca2+ ion is sufficient to activate CRC-C. Changes in Trp fluorescence can be quantified and fit to a standard binding curve to determine the affinity of K19 for CRC-C. The normalized Trp fluorescence intensity versus added CRC-C at various Ca2+ levels is plotted in Fig. 5. The best fits of these data to a simple one-site binding model yielded Kd values of 5.5 ± 0.8 × 10–7m in the presence of 1 eq of calcium and 1.2 ± 0.2 ×10–7m in the presence of saturating calcium. Interestingly, these are similar to Kd values reported for yeast centrin in the presence of calcium (7Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm EDTA, the titration is far from completion even with a final protein-to-peptide ratio of 50:1; therefore only a lower bound estimate of 10–4m can be obtained for Kd. The critical point from this study is the enhancement of the peptide binding affinity by three orders of magnitude or more, which clearly shows that calcium activates CRC-C for the binding of a target. The observation that the affinity of K19 for CRC-C with one calcium ion bound is nearly as strong as that for the fully calcium-saturated protein indicates that the filling of a single calcium site in CRC-C is sufficient to activate the protein and trigger target binding. Ca2+Affinities of CRC-C and the CRC-C-K19 Complex— NMR spectroscopy can be used to determine Ca2+ dissociation constants by monitoring the change in NMR signals upon the addition of Ca2+. The binding parameters can be derived by fitting plots of NMR chemical shift versus added Ca2+ to standard binding equations. Two Ca2+ titrations were performed using uniformly 15N-labeled CRC-C, one in the absence and one in the presence of K19. The observed resonances at each calcium concentration were assigned by tracking their movement all the way to the calcium-saturated state of CRC-C, for which almost complete backbone resonance assignments were made (see “Experimental Procedures”). Previous studies of CRC have shown that in the absence of Ca2+ the NMR spectrum is characteristic of a poorly folded, conformationally heterogeneous protein (8Veeraraghavan S. Fagan P.A. Hu H. Lee V. Harper J.F. Huang B. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28564-28571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As for the apo protein, the CRC-C spectrum at low levels of calcium loading was characterized by a large number of resonances broadened below the noise level. Consequently, it was not possible to monitor all CRC-C signals at all levels of calcium loading. Excluding peaks that did not display appreciable chemical shift changes over the course of the titration, 32 usable titration curves from 22 distinct residues distributed throughout the protein were obtained. In the presence of the K19 peptide, the spectral quality of CRC-C at low calcium levels was significantly higher, and a similar analysis of the data generated a total of 49 usable titration curves from 35 distinct residues distributed throughout the protein. Normalized chemical shift changes of selected residues as a function of the molar ratio of Ca2+ to protein are displayed in Fig. 6. The observation of clearly biphasic curves in both titrations reflects the presence of two discrete Ca2+ binding events. Fitting the titration data to a two-site model yielded the calcium dissociation constants Kd1 = 2 ± 2 × 10–5m and Kd2 = 3 ± 2 × 10–3m in the absence of the K19 peptide and Kd1 = 1 ± 1 × 10–6m and Kd2 = 2 ± 2 ×10–4m in the presence of K19. The very high uncertainties reflect the complexity of fitting the data from a system that has two binding constants separated by at least a factor of 100 and the fact that accurate and precise measurements of binding constants require experiments with protein concentrations in a comparable range. Hence, these results should be viewed as guidelines for interpreting the Ca2+ affinities. Despite the clear limitations in the values of the binding constants, the NMR data reliably show that the two binding constants differ by 100-fold or more in both the absence and presence of K19, consistent with a model of two independent sequential binding sites. In this model, the macroscopic Kd values can be regarded as the microscopic binding constants for each individual site (20Linse S. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The weaker affinity in each case is assigned to site III based on the presence of Asp-122 in place of the highly conserved glutamate residue in position 12 of the canonical EF-hand calcium binding loop. The coupling of the calcium and peptide binding events in CRC-C is reflected in the enhancement of the calcium affinity in each site by the presence of K19. Conformational Heterogeneity of CRC-C—In addition to providing insights into Ca2+ binding, the NMR titration data were also extremely useful for characterizing the conformational states of CRC-C at various levels of Ca2+ loading in the absence and presence of K1"
https://openalex.org/W2068346395,"The serine protease thrombin is known as a blood coagulation factor. Through limited cleavage of proteinase-activated receptors it can also control growth and functions in various cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (brain macrophages). A number of previous studies indicated that thrombin induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from microglial cells, suggesting another important role for the protease beyond hemostasis. In the present report, we provide evidence that this effect is not mediated by any proteolytic or non-proteolytic mechanism involving thrombin proper. Inhibition of the enzymatic thrombin activity did not affect the microglial release response. Instead the cyto-/chemokine-inducing activity solely resided in a high molecular weight protein fraction that could be isolated in trace amounts even from apparently homogenous α- and γ-thrombin preparations. High molecular weight material contained thrombin-derived peptides as revealed by mass spectrometry but was devoid of thrombin-like enzymatic activity. Separated from the high molecular weight fraction by fast protein liquid chromatography, enzymatically intact α- and γ-thrombin failed to trigger any release. Our findings may force a revision of the notion that thrombin itself is a direct proinflammatory release signal for microglia. In addition, they could be relevant for the study of other cellular activities and their assignment to this protease. The serine protease thrombin is known as a blood coagulation factor.

Thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5, factor IIa) is a serine protease catalyzing the cleavage of fibrinogen and the activation of several other components of the blood coagulation cascade (1Gingrich M.B.

By a very unusual mechanism of limited proteolysis, the N-terminal portion of a PAR can be cleaved off, resulting in the unmasking of a new N terminus, which serves as an intramolecular ligand. The autostimulation of PARs by their tethered ligand is coupled to cytosolic signaling events including G protein families, phospholipase C, or several protein kinases such as Src, p38, and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (1Gingrich M.B.

Consequently thrombin is considered not only a clotting but a growth and wound-healing factor exhibiting a complex spectrum of restorative activities.On the other hand, thrombin and other serum proteases are suspected to cause severe damage to CNS tissue upon disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (1Gingrich M.B.

The BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier ensure an organized exchange of molecules and limit the passage of cells between neural and extraneural compartments. Most serum proteins are normally denied CNS entry (5Wang H. Reiser G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14van Rossum D. Hanisch U.K. Delgado-Garcia J.M.

However, when the BBB integrity is compromised due to trauma, stroke, viral and bacterial infection, autoimmune diseases, or neurodegenerative processes, blood content can more or less inundate the tissue (1Gingrich M.B.

Blood-borne proteases seem to have a tremendous impact on the tissue. Brain cell injury associated with hemorrhage differs from pure ischemia, and the extent of CNS damage, for example upon stroke, is drastically reduced when certain protease activities are eliminated (13Xue M. Del Bigio M.R. Stroke. 2001; 32: 2164-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23Ohyama H. Hosomi N. Takahashi T. Mizushige K. Kohno M.

Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Microglial cells are major sensors and response elements in neuropathological scenarios of most heterogeneous etiology (25Hanisch U.K. Glia. 2002; 40: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 26Streit W.J. Glia. 2002; 40: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Microglia represent a CNS-intrinsic population of macrophage-like cells safeguarding innate defense. Inducible synthesis of chemoattractive and immunoregulatory factors and the ability to present antigen help the recruitment of leukocytes and the engagement of adaptive immune responses. While support for neuronal functions and protection of tissue integrity are beneficial contributions, deregulated or dysfunctional microglia can be critical or at least instrumental in a harmful way. Excessive or chronic reactions fuel destructive cascades upon trauma or during inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes (25Hanisch U.K. Glia. 2002; 40: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 26Streit W.J. Glia. 2002; 40: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar).Both the measures of defense as well as the detrimental consequences require the normally “resting” microglia to transform into alerted and finally reactive states. Challenges by foreign material or disturbances in the CNS homeostasis deliver the required signals (14van Rossum D. Hanisch U.K. Delgado-Garcia J.M. Herdegen T. Brain Damage and Repair: From Molecular Research to ClinicalTherapy. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands2004: 181-202Crossref Google Scholar, 25Hanisch U.K. Glia. 2002; 40: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Molecularly these signals derive from bacterial cell walls and DNA, viral envelopes, or CNS endogenous factors normally not seen by microglia or usually not found at such concentration (14van Rossum D. Hanisch U.K. Delgado-Garcia J.M. Herdegen T. Brain Damage and Repair: From Molecular Research to ClinicalTherapy.

However, only a few factors are identified thus far as to their (bio)chemical structure and mode of action.In principle, serum components could immediately inform microglia about disturbed BBB function or tissue injury (14van Rossum D. Hanisch U.K. Delgado-Garcia J.M. Herdegen T. Brain Damage and Repair: From Molecular Research to ClinicalTherapy. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands2004: 181-202Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed several serum proteins fulfil accessory functions in the cell surface interaction of bacterial toxins or themselves carry some microglia-activating potential. We previously showed in vitro that microglia are, indeed, a target of thrombin and that these cells express PARs (27Balcaitis S. Xie Y. Weinstein J.R. Andersen H. Hanisch U.K. Ransom B.R. Möller T. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 2373-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Möller T. Hanisch U.K. Ransom B.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). By a PAR-dependent mechanism, as indicated by hirudin sensitivity and kinetics of desensitization, thrombin stimulation resulted in intracellular calcium signals. Moreover the cells responded with proliferation and the release of cytokines, a major executive feature of activated microglia. Induction of cytokines by thrombin would agree with an assumed profile as a proinflammatory signal (5Wang H. Reiser G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Cocks T.M. Moffatt J.D. Trends Pharmacol.

Further experiments rapidly led us to conclude that neither PAR activation nor proteolytic or ligand-like activities of thrombin proper were essential. In the present report, we provide evidence that the release-inducing capacity of thrombin preparations resided in a minor fraction of associated protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES0Cell Culture Preparation and Treatment—Animals were kept and treated according to the Guidelines for Animal Care at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany. Primary microglial cultures were prepared from newborn mice (NMRI, purchased from Tierzucht Schönwalde GmbH, Schönwalde, Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) as described previously (29Häusler K.G. Prinz M. Nolte C. Weber J.R. Schumann R.R. Kettenmann H. Hanisch U.K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2113-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After 10–14 days of primary cultivation, microglial cells were separated from other cell types by shaking and placed in 96- or 24-well plates or Petri dishes at densities of 104, 5 × 104, or 2 × 106 cells/cavity. After a 30-min attachment period, cells were extensively washed with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and kept in culture for 1–3 days before being used. Cultures routinely consisted of ∼98% microglial cells as determined by staining with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Experiments were either carried out in FCS-containing DMEM or under serum-free conditions using macrophage serum-free medium supplemented with astrocyte-conditioned medium (30Prinz M. Kann O. Draheim H.J. Schumann R.R. Kettenmann H. Weber J.R. Hanisch U.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1078-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Primary cultures were stimulated for up to 24 h by addition of thrombin preparations (bovine, mouse, and human thrombin (catalog nos. T-3399, T-4648, T-7513, T-8397, and T-6884); human prothrombin (catalog no. F-5132); and bovine factor Xa (catalog no. F-2027) from Sigma and bovine and human α-thrombin, human γ-thrombin, bovine prothrombin, and bovine factor Xa from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Swansea, UK) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli K-235, Sigma). Thrombic activity is given in NIH units (except for γ-thrombin). In experiments on heat-inactivated thrombin, concentrated solutions of the protease (bovine α-thrombin) were incubated at 70 or 100 °C for various periods of time or at given temperature for 10 min, diluted to the final concentration, and then used to stimulate cells. Stimulations with thrombin preparations were also carried out in the presence of recombinant hirudin HV1 (Hirudo medicinalis, Calbiochem Merck Biosciences) and HV2 variants (Sigma), Z-d-Phe-Pro-methoxypropylboroglycinepinanediol ester, or d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) (Calbiochem).Enzymatic Assay for Thrombin Activity—H-d-Phenylalanyl-L-pipecolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline (2× HCl, 500 μm in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl) was used as a chromogenic substrate (Chromogenix, Milano, Italy and Hemochrom Diagnostica, Essen, Germany). Absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a microplate reader (1420 Victor, Wallac Oy). All tests were run in triplicate using substrate solution as a blank. Inhibitors were mixed with thrombin 15 min before the assay. Note that γ-thrombin, although it cannot properly bind fibrinogen, is able to cleave small synthetic substrates as used in this assay.Cyto- and Chemokine Measurements—Following microglial stimulations, culture supernatants were collected and stored at –70 °C for cyto- and chemokine measurements. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), total IL-12 (collecting the IL-12 forms p75, p40, and p402), KC (mouse equivalent of growth-related oncogene GROα (CXCL1)), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1 (CCL2)), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α (MIP-1α (CCL3)), MIP-1β (CCL4), MIP-2, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (CCL5)), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα (TNFSF1A)), and soluble TNF receptor II were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on mouse- and factor-specific antibody pairs and standards or complete enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits following the instructions of the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) (29Häusler K.G.

The color reaction was analyzed in a microplate reader (SLT, Spectra, LabInstruments Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Total protein was determined using the MicroBCA protein assay (Pierce).Viability Assays—Metabolic activity was assayed using WST-1 reagent (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate) based on the enzymatic cleavage of WST tetrazolium salt to formazan by the succinate-tetrazolium reductase system of the respiratory chain of intact mitochondria. The assay was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics), and the color reaction was measured in a microplate reader (1420 Victor, Wallac Oy) at 540 nm wavelength (29Häusler K.G.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 2104-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription-PCR/PCR—For detection of cytokine mRNA induction, microglial cells (2 × 106/Petri dish, 6-cm diameter, DMEM/FCS) were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or thrombin (10 units/ml) for 1 h. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly 2 ml of TRIzol reagent were used for the homogenization of the cells with the lysate pipetted several times to facilitate disruption. RNA was extracted by adding chloroform (0.2 volume eq), precipitated using 1 volume each of aqueous phase and isopropanol, and washed twice in 75% ethanol. Up to 5 μg of the isolated RNA were then used for cDNA synthesis. RNA was incubated with 1 μl of random primers (200–400 ng/μl) at 70 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then put on ice for 1 min. The reaction mixture consisting of 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mixture, 4 μl of 5× Superscript reverse transcription buffer, 0.5 μl of RNasin (10 units), and 2 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol (all purchased from Invitrogen) was added to the RNA/random primer mixture and left for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was started by addition of 1 μl of Super-Script reverse transcriptase (200 units, Invitrogen). The final mixture was incubated for 50 min at 42 °C followed by 15 min at 70 °C to stop the reaction. To degrade the RNA of DNA-RNA hybrids, the mixture was treated with 1 μl of 2 units/μl E. coli RNase H (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 20 min. PCR for cytokines was carried out with a CytoXPress Mouse Cytokine Sepsis Set 2 kit following the instructions of the manufacturer (BioSource, Camarillo, CA). PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.Microfiltration—Thrombin preparations were dissolved in 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 (≤1 mg/ml). 500 μl of the solution were loaded on a Microcon YM-100 filter unit with a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Millipore) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g until the complete volume had been passed through. The filtrate was stored, the filter unit was filled with 500 μl of buffer, shaken, and transferred onto a new test tube for another centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min). The washing cycle was repeated several times. At the end, the filter was placed upside down on a new tube, and the retentate was collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 3 min). Aliquots of the original solution, the various filtrates, and the retentate were subsequently analyzed for enzymatic and release-inducing activity.SDS-PAGE—Thrombin preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions using 12.5% gels and in-gel protein staining as described previously (31Hanisch U.K. Prinz M. Angstwurm K. Häusler K.G. Kann O. Kettenmann H. Weber J.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2104-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).FPLC—Thrombin preparations were separated by gel filtration on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column using a FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were prepared in elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), centrifuged, and filtered (0.2 μm). Aliquots were separated using elution buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein was detected by absorbance at 280 nm, and fractions were collected and stored for further analyses. A mixture of dextran blue (2000 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) was used for calibration. For studies on proteolytic stability, aliquots of the same sample were repeatedly separated under the same conditions.Mass Spectrometry—Microfiltration retentate from thrombin preparations was digested overnight at 37 °C in a solution of 25 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 8, containing 0.1 μg/μl trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Resulting tryptic peptides were concentrated on a vacuum centrifuge and submitted to mass spectroscopy. The tryptic peptides were separated using the Ultimate/Famos capillary liquid chromatography system (LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The sample was loaded onto a 300-μm-inner diameter × 1-mm C18 PepMap precolumn with a flow rate of 10 μl/min of 0.1% acetic acid using a Rheos 4000 liquid chromatography pump (Flux Instruments, Danderyd, Sweden). After 7 min of preconcentration and clean-up, the precolumn was automatically switched in-line with the 75-μm-inner diameter × 50-mm analytical column, and the peptides were separated with a gradient of 2–40% acetonitrile in 40 min (0.1% HCOOH) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The liquid chromatography system was connected to a mass spectrometer with a Protana platform (Protana, Odense, Denmark) using a 30-μm PicoTip from New Objective (Woburn, MA). Mass spectra were recorded using an LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermoquest, San Jose, CA) using Triple-Play function. A first full scan mass spectrum was measured for a m/z 615–2000 range. A second scan was used to measure more precisely the molecular weight of the most abundant peptide signal in the first scan. A third scan was used to measure the collision-induced mass spectrometry (MS)/MS spectrum of the selected peptide. The spray needle was set to 2.4–3 kV in the positive ion mode. The inlet capillary temperature was 200 °C. Other source parameters and the spray position were optimized for a myoglobin tryptic digestion. The peptides were identified with Excalibur and Sequest programs (Thermoquest, San Jose, CA).RESULTSThrombin Preparations Induce Cyto- and Chemokine Release in Microglia—Incubation of mouse microglia with preparations of bovine, mouse, and human thrombin resulted in a dose-dependent release of multiple cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 1, A–E, and Table I). Bacterial LPS, a commonly used agent to activate macrophages/microglia and to mimic Gram-negative infection (29Häusler K.G. Prinz M. Nolte C. Weber J.R. Schumann R.R. Kettenmann H. Hanisch U.K. Eur.

Release induced by thrombin preparations was normalized to the LPS-inducible release and expressed as percentage. Absolute values are given in Table II.

https://openalex.org/W2012165680,"Sequential stages in the life cycle of the ionotropic 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) were resolved temporally and spatially in live cells by multicolor fluorescence confocal microscopy. The insertion of the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein into the large intracellular loop delivered a fluorescent 5-HT3R fully functional in terms of ligand binding specificity and channel activity, which allowed for the first time a complete real-time visualization and documentation of intracellular biogenesis, membrane targeting, and ligand-mediated internalization of a receptor belonging to the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Fluorescence signals of newly expressed receptors were detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum about 3 h after transfection onset. At this stage receptor subunits assembled to form active ligand binding sites as demonstrated in situ by binding of a fluorescent 5-HT3R-specific antagonist. After novel protein synthesis was chemically blocked, the 5-HT3 R populations in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi cisternae moved virtually quantitatively to the cell surface, indicating efficient receptor folding and assembly. Intracellular 5-HT3 receptors were trafficking in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the cell surface at a velocity generally below 1 μm/s and were inserted into the plasma membrane in a characteristic cluster distribution overlapping with actin-rich domains. Internalization of cell surface 5-HT3 receptors was observed within minutes after exposure to an extracellular agonist. Our orchestrated use of spectrally distinguishable fluorescent labels for the receptor, its cognate ligand, and specific organelle markers can be regarded as a general approach allowing subcellular insights into dynamic processes of membrane receptor trafficking.

A fundamental concern in neurobiology is the study of processes involved in expression, assembly and subcellular trafficking of neuroreceptors. Of particular interest are members of the large family of ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC) 1The abbreviations used are: LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; 5-HT, serotonin; 5-HT3R, serotonin 5-HT3A receptor; nACh, nicotinic acetylcholine; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor; GR65630, 3-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)propanone; GR-Cy5, 1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-[3-amino-[N-(Cy5)amido]propyl]-4H-carbazol-4-one; GR-Flu, 1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-(3-amino-(N-fluoresceinthiocarbamoyl)propyl)-4H-carbazol-4-one; GR-Rho, 1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-[3-amino-[N-(rhodamine B)thiocarbamoyl]propyl]-4H-carbazol-4-one; mCPBG, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)biguanide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. that include nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), serotonin (5-HT3R), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA), glycine, and ionotropic glutamate receptors (1Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2Barnard E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All of them are oligomeric membrane proteins composed of subunits, which surround an ion channel that opens upon neurotransmitter binding to the receptor. The structural relationship between the different LGICs suggests that their assembly and trafficking involves similar molecular events (3Green W.N. Millar N.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 280-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In general, it is thought that subunit assembly and ligand binding site formation occurs shortly after biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by trafficking to the plasma membrane (4Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S. Yu X.M. Hall Z.W. J.

Methodologies allowing the dynamic observation of these processes as well as a direct probing of receptor functions in intracellular compartments have still to be elaborated. In the present study, we focus on the ionotropic 5-HT3R as a representative member of the LGICs and explore new strategies to monitor receptor biogenesis in real time starting with the delivery of their coding DNA into living cells. We will resolve events, occurring after the receptors “birth” from those leading to cell membrane insertion of mature receptors and finally to ligand-induced re-absorption of receptors into the cell reflecting the end point of the receptors lifespan. Improved understanding of these processes can provide valuable information for the therapeutic targeting of LGICs at specific stages in their life cycle. The ionotropic 5-HT3R is known to mediate fast signal transduction across synapses in the nervous system. Homopentameric complexes of recombinant 5-HT3 receptors exhibit high cell surface expression levels in heterologous systems (9Pick H. Preuss A.K. Mayer M. Wohland T. Hovius R. Vogel H.

To date the direct intracellular analysis of 5-HT3 receptors has been limited to antibody labeling methods (8Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A.

However, these technologies are not adequate for visualizing receptors in live cells and cannot be used to label intracellular receptors in non-permeabilized cells. Here we fuse the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) to the 5-HT3Rto visualize the entire sequence of stages in the life of the receptor. The green fluorescent protein and its spectral variants have been widely used as molecular reporters to monitor gene expression, localization, and trafficking of proteins in living cells (13Chalfie M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15850-15864Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) will be demonstrated as a powerful tool allowing the multicolor analysis of receptor biosynthesis, trafficking, and ligand-dependent receptor internalization. Materials—Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany), kits for plasmid and DNA fragment purification were from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany), restriction endonucleases (ClaI, HindIII and NotI) were from New England Biolabs. The radioligand 3-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1-(1-[3H]methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)propanone ([3H]GR65630; 85.5 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; the agonist serotonin (5-HT) was obtained from Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland), and quipazine and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)biguanide (mCPBG) were from Tocris-Cookson (Langford, UK). The fluorescent ligands GR-Cy5 (1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-[3-amino-[N-(Cy5)amido]propyl]-4H-carbazol-4-one), GR-Flu (1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-(3-amino-(N-fluorescein-thiocarbamoyl)-propyl)-4H-carbazol-4-one) and GR-Rho (1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-[3-amino-[N-(rhodamine B)thiocarbamoyl]-propyl]-4H-carbazol-4-one) were prepared as described elsewhere (21Tairi A.P.

The plasmids pEYFP-ER, pEYFP-Golgi, pEYFP-Tub, and pEYFP-Actin were purchased from Clontech. Other chemicals were from Sigma. DNA Constructs—All constructs are based on a vector containing the short splicing variant of the murine 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A subunit cDNA (23Werner P. Kawashima E. Reid J. Hussy N. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Humbert Y. Jones K.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) preceded by the human cytomegalovirus gene promoter, as described before (9Pick H. Preuss A.K. Mayer M. Wohland T. Hovius R. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The vector p5HT3R-ECFP, containing the ECFP-labeled receptor, was obtained as follows: the original vector was first mutated using the oligonucleotides 5′-CTG ATG ACT GCT CAA TCG ATG CCA TGG GAA ACC-3′ and 5′-GGT TTC CCA TGG CAT CGA TTG AGC AGT CAT CAG-3′, adding a ClaI restriction site in the large cytoplasmic loop sequence between the third and fourth predicted membrane-spanning domains. ECFP was introduced between Ser359 and Ala360 of the receptor (corresponding to Swiss-Prot entry p23979, mature sequence numbering) to give 5-HT3R-ECFP. The ECFP insert was obtained by PCR amplification on the template pECFP-N1 (Clontech) using the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-CCA TCG ATA TGG TGA GCA AGG GCG AGG-3′ and 5′-CCA TCG ATC TTG TAC AGC TCG TCC ATG CCG-3′ and ligated into the receptor ClaI restriction site. The restriction sites HindIII and NotI were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the 5-HT3R-EGFP sequence by PCR amplification using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGA TAA GCT TCA CCA TGC GGC TCT GCA TCC CGC AGG TG-3′ and 5′-GCT GTG CCC ACG CGG CCG CTC AAG AAT AAT GCC AAA TGG ACC AGA G-3′, and the purified 2197-bp fragment was subcloned into the HindIII/NotI cut vector pEAK8 (Edge BioSystems, Gaithersburg, MD), yielding the vector p5HT3R-ECFP. The vector p5HT3R was obtained by subcloning the non-mutated receptor gene into the plasmid pEAK8 between HindIII and NotI, using the same oligonucleotides as for constructing p5HT3R-ECFP. The plasmid constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Permeabilization—Adherent human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and N1E-115 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.2 and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), respectively, using plastic flasks from TPP AG (Trasadingen, Switzerland). The cultures were split regularly and kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For electrophysiology and confocal microscopy measurements, respectively, cells were seeded in 35-mm cell culture dishes and 6-well plates containing 22-mm diameter glass coverslips at a density of 150,000 cells/ml and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiencies were determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy on cell samples which were cotransfected with an enhanced GFP (pEGFP-N1; Clontech) reporter DNA. Fixation of cells was achieved by 10-min incubation at room temperature in a solution containing 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Subsequent permeabilization was performed by 5-min incubation in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Triton X-100 was used for cell permeabilization because this detergent was shown not to interfere with ligand binding affinity (12Green T. Stauffer K.A. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6056-6061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Hovius R. Tairi A.P. Blasey H. Bernard A. Lundstrom K. Vogel H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with PBS between incubations. Radioactive Binding Assays—Receptor concentrations as well as ligand affinities were measured by radioligand binding assay. 100 μl containing ∼1 × 106 cells resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in solutions of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with varying concentrations of the specific antagonist [3H]GR65630 in a final volume of 1 ml. A rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters (presoaked for 15 min in 0.5% (w/v) polyethylenimine) followed by two washes with 3 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 terminated the incubation. Filters were then transferred into scintillation vials and 4 ml of Ultima Gold (Packard, Meridan, CT) was added. The radioactivity was measured in a Tri-Carb 2200CA liquid scintillation counter (Packard). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm quipazine. Binding assay on permeabilized cells were processed as above, except that the cells were pre-treated with 0.1% saponin in 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4 for 5 min at room temperature before radioligand binding. All experiments were done in triplicate. The dissociation constant Kd of [3H]GR65630 and the Hill coefficient n were calculated by fitting the experimental data to the following binding equation.[GR65630]bound=[5-HT3R]1+(Kd/[GR65630]free)n(Eq. 1) Electrophysiology—We used the standard patch-clamp technique in whole-cell voltage clamp to –60 mV employing an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Lambrecht, Germany). For data acquisition and storage the software PULSE 8.3 (HEKA Elektronik GmbH) was used. Borosilicate glass pipettes were heat polished and had resistances of 2–5 MΩ. Pipettes were filled with 140 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3. The external solution was 147 mm NaCl, 12 mm glucose, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. Ligands dissolved in the external solution were applied with a RSC-200 or the MSC-200 perfusion system (BioLogic, Claix, France). During experiments the cells were continuously perfused. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Data were evaluated by fitting to the Hill following equations,I=Imax/{1+(EC50/[agonist])n}(Eq. 2) I=I0/{1+(IC50/[antagonist])−n}(Eq. 3) where I is the peak current at a certain ligand concentration, Imax is the maximal peak current achievable, I0 is the peak current in absence of any antagonist, EC50 and IC50 are the half-maximal effective and inhibitory concentrations, respectively, and n is the Hill coefficient. For antagonist-agonist competition experiments, cells were perfused with granisetron-containing solutions for 3 min before the addition of serotonin (5-HT) at a concentration of 30 μm. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—Laser scanning confocal micrographs were recorded using 458/488-, 543-, and 633-nm laser lines on a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG) equipped with a 63× water objective (1.2 numerical aperture). Detection and distinction of fluorescence signals was achieved by appropriate filter sets using a multitracking mode. Scanning speed and laser intensity were adjusted to avoid photobleaching of the fluorescent probes and damage or morphological changes of the cells. The microscope was equipped with a microcultivation system (Incubator S, CTI controller 3700 digital, Zeiss) to control temperature, humidity, and CO2 for maintaining physiological conditions during long-term experiments. Image analysis and fluorescence signal quantification was performed using Zeiss LSM software. We investigated the time course of 5-HT3R plasma membrane expression by analyzing non-permeabilized HEK293 cell samples at different times after transfection via radioligand binding assay. 5-HT3R cell surface expression increased over time and reached a maximum number of 2.6 × 106 receptors per cell 34 h after transfection (Fig. 1). When these cells were permeabilized with saponin it was possible to detect in addition to cell surface receptors also 5-HT3R-specific ligand binding activity in the cytoplasm, which accounted for about 40% of the total ligand binding sites. In N1E-115 cells, which endogenously express 5-HT3 receptors, about 60% of the ligand binding activity was localized inside the cell (Table I). These results indicate that a substantial fraction of intracellular receptors is capable of binding 5-HT3R-specific ligands before plasma membrane integration. We then analyzed intracellular 5-HT3R formation and trafficking in more detail. To observe in real-time 5-HT3R biosynthesis after cell delivery of its coding DNA, we inserted the coding sequence of the ECFP into the large cytoplasmic loop between the third and fourth predicted membrane-spanning domains of the receptor (Fig. 2A). The preserved functionality of the fusion construct was confirmed by radioligand binding assay and whole cell patch clamp measurements (Table II).Table IRadioactive binding of [3H]GR65630 to 5-HT3R on whole cells (1Betz H.

The receptor-derived fluorescence signal could be colocalized with a spectrally distinguishable enhanced yellow fluorescent ER marker (Fig. 2B), which was transfected together with the ECFP-tagged receptor DNA. In parallel experiments, we were able to overlap fluorescence images arising from the receptor with EYFP targeted to the Golgi apparatus at ∼4 h after transfection (Fig. 2C). Receptor trafficking from the appearance in the Golgi to plasma membrane insertion occurred in about 30 min. The integration of mature receptors into the plasma membrane could be confirmed by binding of a fluorescence-labeled 5-HT3R-specific antagonist (Fig. 2D). Although the fluorescence emitted from the 5-HT3R-ECFP is primarily an indication of a folded ECFP marker protein, it allows also monitoring of 5-HT3 receptor biogenesis, since the ECFP label is directly integrated into the receptor sequence. Information about the assembly of 5-HT3R subunits can be assessed via detection of the formation of the ligand binding sites. It has been shown for the structurally related acetylcholine receptor (25Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) as well as by amino acid sequence homology studies on the 5-HT3R (26Maksay G. Bikadi Z. Simonyi M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that the ligand binding sites are located between neighboring subunits; in consequence, ligand binding can only be observed once the subunits are fully assembled to a functional pentameric receptor. After monitoring 5-HT3R biosynthesis in cytoplasmic compartments we investigated the presence of intracellular 5-HT3-specific ligand binding sites, which indicate the functional assembly of receptor subunits. Ligand binding to intracellular 5-HT3 receptors was first investigated by permeabilizing fixed HEK293 cells at different times after transfection and subsequent labeling with fluorescent ligands. The binding specificity of those ligands to 5-HT3 receptors in intracellular compartments was confirmed by ligand displacement experiments (see supplemental data). ECFP-labeled 5-HT3Rs were localized in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus by comparing fluorescence images of the receptor with those of organelles labeled with EYFP as described above. The diffusion of a Cy5-labeled 5-HT3R-specific antagonist (GR-Cy5) into permeabilized cells allowed us to detect ligand binding activity in ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3). This reports on receptor assembly at an early stage of expression in the ER. The GR-Cy5 fluorescence signal located in the Golgi was stronger than in the ER indicating substantially higher amounts of assembled 5-HT3 receptors in the Golgi apparatus. The amount of 5-HT3R ligand binding sites on the cell surface receptors as compared to those formed inside the cell was then evaluated by double ligand binding experiments (Fig. 3, G–I). Fluorescent rhodamine-labeled antagonist GR-Rho was applied to non-permeabilized cells expressing 5-HT3R-ECFP to label the receptors located on the plasma membrane. After fixation and permeabilization of the cells, the antagonist GR-Cy5 was applied to label the receptors inside the cell. Due to the low off-rate of GR-Rho from 5-HT3R, it was not replaced by GR-Cy5, as described before (9Pick H. Preuss A.K. Mayer M. Wohland T. Hovius R. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and thus allowed us to visualize and to distinguish between extra- and intracellular ligand binding sites. Analyzing images arising from the fluorescence of Cy5- and rhodamine-labeled ligands in consecutive confocal cross-sections covering the whole cell revealed that 43 ± 14% of the receptor binding sites were located on the plasma membrane and the rest inside the cell (value averaged on 20 cells). This value is in the same range as obtained by radioligand binding assays on cell populations (average on 1 × 106 cells). Receptor trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane was then analyzed in detail by imaging 5-HT3R-ECFP-expressing HEK293 cells (frame rate of 2 images/s; Fig. 4, A and B). The ECFP label allowed us to detect vesicle-like structures carrying 5-HT3 receptors in their membrane, which moved inside the cytoplasm. The velocity of these carrier vesicles was generally below 1 μm/s, measured as the distance between the pixel coordinates in consecutive images. The receptor-carrying vesicles seemed to be located in tubulin-rich regions visualized by cotransfecting EYFP-labeled tubulin (pEYFP-Tub). To verify whether tubulin filaments are required for 5-HT3 receptor transport to the plasma membrane, we studied the influence of colchicine on receptor trafficking (Fig. 4, C and D); colchicine is known to inhibit microtubule formation (28Weisenberg R.C. Borisy G.G. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4466-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 29Sherline P. Leung J.T. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 5 h after adding 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to cells, which interferes with the translation machinery (31Wettstein F.O. Noll H. Penman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 87: 525-528PubMed Google Scholar), the receptors were almost completely located on the cell membrane. However, when the cells were treated 2 h before with 50 μg/ml colchicine, the receptors did not completely localize at the membrane, demonstrating that the tubulin filaments are required for proper receptor trafficking and final membrane insertion. We then investigated the effects of agonist application on the subcellular distribution of 5-HT3 receptors. 34 h after transient expression of 5-HT3R-ECFP, HEK293 cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 5 h to stop new protein synthesis and in turn allowing delivery of intracellular receptors to the cell membrane and thus depleting intracellular receptor fluorescence. Subsequent incubation of non-permeabilized cells with 12 nm GR-Cy5 yielded a complete spatial overlap of the ECFP receptor and the GR-Cy5 ligand fluorescence signals on the cell surface (Fig. 5, A–E). The fluorescent antagonist could be replaced by adding an excess (500 nm) of the non-fluorescent 5-HT3R-specific agonist mCPBG. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the cells were intensively washed with PBS buffer. We then applied the fluorescent antagonist GR-Cy5 for a second time using the same conditions as before (Fig. 5, F–J). The absence of fluorescence labeling on the cell surface wa"

In this study, we investigated the effect of C-3-G on proliferation and differentiation of human melanoma cells. Both morphological and functional parameters were evaluated, using electron and confocal microscopy, cytofluorometric analysis, HPLC assay, Western blot analysis, and enzymatic assay, as appropriate. A treatment with a single dose of C-3-G decreased cell proliferation without affecting cell viability and without inducing apoptosis or necrosis. The mitotic index and cell percentage in S phase were significantly lower in C-3-G treated cells compared with untreated control. C-3-G treatment induced, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, melanoma cell differentiation characterized by a strong increase in dendrite outgrowth accompanied with a remodeling of the microtubular network, a dramatic increase of focal adhesion and an increased expression of ""brain specific"" cytoskeletal components such as NF-160 and NF-200 neurofilament proteins. C-3-G treatment also induced increase of cAMP levels and up-regulation of tyrosinase expression and activity resulting in an enhanced melanin synthesis and melanosome maturation. Up-regulation of the melanoma differentiation antigen Melan-A/MART-1 in treated cells respect to the untreated control was also recorded. Data obtained provide evidence that a single treatment with C-3-G is able to revert the human melanoma cells from the proliferating to the differentiated state. We conclude that C-3-G is a very promising molecule to include in the strategies for treatment of melanoma; also because of its nutritional relevance."

Our study has focused on the GH10 xylanase CjXyn10A from Cellvibrio japonicus, which contains an extended calcium binding loop that confers proteinase resistance and thermostability. Three rounds of error-prone PCR and selection identified a treble mutant, D262N/A80T/R347C, which in the absence of calcium is more thermostable than wild type CjXyn10A bound to the divalent metal. D262N influences the properties of the calcium binding site, A80T fills a cavity in the enzyme, increasing the number of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, and the R347C mutation introduces a disulfide bond that decreases the free energy of the unfolded enzyme.

Microorganisms utilize polymeric substrates by secreting hydrolytic enzymes into the extracellular milieu.

An elegant example of this variation in stability is found in the glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase family; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; CjXyn10A, xylanase 10A from C. japonicus; CfCjXyn10A, CjXyn10A in which residues Asn-252 to Ser-272 of the Cellvibrio xylanase were replaced with amino acids Arg-253 to Ala-258 of the C. fimi xylanase CfXyn10A; CmXyn10B, xylanase 10B from C. mixtus; CtXyn10A, xylanase 10A from C. thermocellum; prefix of gal-, amino acid encoding by the multiple cloning region of pUC19; prefix of cf, amino acid derived from CfXyn10A loop 7; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; GdmCl, guanidine hydrochloride; MUCase, activity against 4-methylumbellijeryl-β-d-cellobioside. 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase family; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; CjXyn10A, xylanase 10A from C. japonicus; CfCjXyn10A, CjXyn10A in which residues Asn-252 to Ser-272 of the Cellvibrio xylanase were replaced with amino acids Arg-253 to Ala-258 of the C. fimi xylanase CfXyn10A; CmXyn10B, xylanase 10B from C. mixtus; CtXyn10A, xylanase 10A from C. thermocellum; prefix of gal-, amino acid encoding by the multiple cloning region of pUC19; prefix of cf, amino acid derived from CfXyn10A loop 7; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; GdmCl, guanidine hydrochloride; MUCase, activity against 4-methylumbellijeryl-β-d-cellobioside. 10 xylanases expressed by the mesophilic bacteria Cellvibrio japonicus and Cellvibrio mixtus. C. japonicus expresses three GH10 xylanases; two are secreted into the extracellular environment (CjXyn10A and CjXyn10C), whereas CjXyn10D is translocated into the periplasm (2Emami K. Nagy T. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4124-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). C. mixtus also produces a periplasmic GH10 xylanase, CmXyn10B, which displays 90% sequence identity with CjXyn10D (1Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Clarke J.H. Prates J.A. McKie V.A. Nagy T.

Although recombinant CjXyn10A and CjXyn10C, in common with the other extracellular GH10 xylanases characterized to date, display thermostability and resistance to proteinase attack (3Fontes C.M.

In view of the close sequence similarity but significant difference in stability, CjXyn10A and CmXyn10B represent particularly useful models for interrogating the structural basis for stability in extracellular enzymes. Both enzymes display a typical (β/α)8 barrel with the substrate binding cleft running along the full-length of the enzymes (7Harris G.W. Jenkins J.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M.

CmXyn10B is the most active GH10 xylanase described to date against both xylooligosaccharides and a range of xylans, whereas CjXyn10A displays properties that are typical of extracellular family 10 enzymes (8Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Nagy T. Clark S.J. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

CjXyn10A displays resistance to proteinase attack and thermal inactivation at temperatures <65 °C in the presence of calcium; however, removal of the divalent metal ion causes a dramatic increase in thermo and proteolytic inactivation (6Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P. O'Donnell A.G. Pickersgill R.W. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17523-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Structural and site-directed mutagenesis studies of CjXyn10A show that calcium confers stability by binding to an extended loop (designated loop 7) between β-strand 7 and α-helix 7 (6Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P. O'Donnell A.G. Pickersgill R.W. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17523-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The metal ion makes co-ordinating bonds with the OD1 of Asp-262, OD1 and OD2 of Asp-256, OD1 of Asn-261, and the carbonyl groups of Asn-253 and Asn-258, with the octahedral geometry completed by a water molecule. The calcium binding site of CjXyn10A displays relatively low affinity (KD ∼100 μm) for the metal, and thus, it is unclear how the utilization of the metal ion as a major stability determinant confers a significant selective advantage. Thermostability is an important phenotype of industrial enzymes. Not only does it decrease enzyme costs by extending the life of the biocatalysts, but many biotechnological processes, several of which utilize xylanases (e.g. paper pulp and animal feed sectors) operate at elevated temperatures (10Georis J. de Lemos Esteves F.

Sci. 1999; 78: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although calcium often plays a key role in the thermostability of enzymes, the inclusion of the metal ion is problematic as the formation of inorganic precipitates has deleterious effects on fermentation and downstream processing, whereas the accumulation of calcium salts in some products, such as beer, is not acceptable (12Haki G.D. Rakshit S.K. Bioresour. Technol. 2003; 89: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in multienzyme industrial processes, exemplified by the biotransformation of starch into fructose, calcium may confer thermostability on some enzymes (amylases) while inhibiting other biocatalysts (xylose/glucose isomerase) (13Fuxreiter M.

Here we have used a directed-protein evolution approach to interrogate mechanisms by which random mutations can increase the stability of CjXyn10A and have evaluated the extent to which the information can be harnessed to develop generic principals for stabilization strategies of industrially relevant GH10 xylanases that do not rely on the presence of divalent metal ions. Bacterial Strains, Plasmid Construction, and Growth Conditions— The Escherichia coli strains TUNER:pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) and JM83 (17Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11446) Google Scholar) were used in this study. The plasmid vectors used were pUC19 (18Norrander J. Kempe T. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar) and pET16b (Novagen). The recombinant plasmids were as follows. pNX1 encodes the catalytic domain of C. japonicus Xyn10A (residues Gly-1 to Arg-347), designated CjXyn10A, appended to the first 19 residues encoded by the multiple cloning region of pUC19 (9Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P. O'Donnell A.G. Pickersgill R.W. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17523-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas pNX3 encodes MACRSTLEDRSP-CjXyn10A, which was used in crystallography experiments. The DNA encoding this enzyme was constructed by PCR using primers listed in Supplemental Table 1S and pNX1 as the template DNA. The amplified 1054-bp sequence, containing NcoI and BamHI sites at the termini, was cloned into NcoI/BamHI-restricted pET16b to generate pNX3. MACRSTLEDRSP-CjXyn10A comprises the catalytic domain of CjXyn10A (Gly-1 to Arg-347) containing an extended N-terminal sequence of MACRSTLEDRSP. The plasmid pNX4 encodes the mature form of C. mixtus Xyn10B (CmXyn10B) (8Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Nagy T. Clark S.J. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J.

Generation of Site-directed Mutants of CjXyn10A, CfCjXyn10A, CtXyn10A, and CmXyn10B—Mutants were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using pNX1, pNX3, pNX4, and pCT1214 as template DNA. The primers that were employed in the mutagenesis PCRs are shown in Table 1S. The complete sequence of DNA encoding the xylanase mutants were determined by MWG using M13 and T7 forward and reverse primers and appropriate custom sequencing primers. Construction and Screening of Error-prone PCR Libraries—Each round of PCR comprised three successive error-prone PCRs using the following protocol. The PCRs contained 450 pm M13 forward and reverse primers, 3.9 mm MgCl2, 5 ng of template DNA, 220 μm dATP, 2.4 mm dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP, and 2.5 units of BioTaq™ (DNA polymerase from Thermos aquaticus). The PCRs were made up to 100 μl, overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil, and then incubated in a Technicon thermcycler at 94 °C for 3 min and then 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min for 30 cycles followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The product generated from the first PCR was appropriately diluted and used as the template in the second PCR, and the product of the second PCR was used as the template in the third PCR. The final amplified product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into similarly restricted pUC19, and the recombinant DNA molecules were transformed into E. coli SURE (Stratagene) using electroporation. The resultant clones, comprising the error-prone PCR library, were plated onto LB-agar plates at a density of ∼2000 colonies per plate and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The plates were then sealed with Parafilm and incubated at the appropriate non-permissive temperature for 30 min. The plates were then chilled at –20 °C for 10 min, after which they were overlaid with 50 mm potassium phosphate-12 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.8% agar and 0.5% Blue-Xylan (Megazyme International, County Wicklow, Ireland) and incubated at the permissive temperature of 37 °C for 3 h. Residual xylanase activity was assessed by looking for clear haloes around the colonies within a blue background. Plasmid DNA was recovered from identified colonies using the Qiagen gel extraction and miniprep plasmid kits. Enzyme and Stability Assays—The activity of CjXyn10A against 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-cellobioside (MUCase activity) was determined as described previously (6Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A.

Xylanase activity was performed essentially as described by Charnock et al. (9Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the substrate used was 0.2% glucuronoxylan. Each assay was performed in triplicate. The activity of CmXyn10B against 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-cellobioside was as described by Pell et al. (8Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Nagy T. Clark S.J. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9597-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thermo inactivation studies used the methods of Spurway et al. (6Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P. O'Donnell A.G. Pickersgill R.W. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17523-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and residual activity was assessed by assaying MUCase activity. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and isothermal titration calorimetry were carried out as described previously (6Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P. O'Donnell A.G. Pickersgill R.W. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17523-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Titration of Thiol Groups—The number of free cysteine residues was determined by the method of Ellman et al. (23Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21190) Google Scholar). Enzyme (60 μm) denatured in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 6.4 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 mm EDTA was degassed extensively by stirring under a vacuum. To both the protein and a blank (lacking the enzyme) was added 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), which had also been extensively degassed, to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the increase in A412 nm was determined. When 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reacts with a cysteine an equimolar quantity of 5-thio-2-nitro-benzoic acid is released, which has a molar extinction coefficient of 13,700 m–1 cm–e. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Trypsin Digest Peptide Mapping—Wild type and mutants of CmXyn10B (1 mg/ml) were digested with trypsin (added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml) in 100 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 6.8. Approximately 25 ng of the digested protein in water was subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. The number and mass of the theoretical peptides generated by trypsin were determined using the ExPasy molecular biology server, Peptide Cutter tool (ca.expasy.org/tools/peptide-mass.html). Intermolecular Disulfide Assay Using SDS-PAGE—Duplicated protein samples were unfolded in 8 m urea and 8 m urea containing 1 m β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 45 min. Bromphenol was added to a final concentration of 0.01%, the samples were electrophoresed on 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Guanidinium Chloride Denaturation—Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was carried out using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. For far-UV CD spectra (260–220 nm) the bandwidth was set to 2 nm, scanning speed was set to 20 nm/min, and 0.2-mm-path length stoppered cuvettes (Hellma) were used. The concentration of the proteins was 2.0 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. All spectra shown are averages of five scans with the bandwidth set to 1 nm. Stock solutions of guanidine hydrochloride were determined by refractive index, and the dilutions were confirmed by weight. The ΔG of the folding step was determined by least squares analysis of the in-folding transition including the pre-transition and post-transition slopes (24Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thompson J.A. Creighton E.D. Protein Structure; A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Pure proteins, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were washed into water by repeated dilution (40 volumes of water) and concentration in a VIVASPIN 10-kDa concentrator. The wild type and mutant proteins of CjXyn10A were screened by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using the PEG/Ion and Crystal screens (Hampton Research). Crystals grew in ∼2–4 days at 18 °C. Drops contained 1 or 2 μl of protein (20 mg/ml) mixed with 1 μl of mother liquor. Single crystals were harvested and cryo-protected in 15% ethylene glycol before flash-freezing in boiling liquid nitrogen. Wild type MACRSTLEDRSP-CjXyn10A and the mutant D262N were crystallized in 0.2 m MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 15% ethylene glycol, whereas A80T/D262N/R347C was crystallized in 0.6 m MgNO3, 5 mm CaCl2, 15–25% polyethylene glycol 3350. Data for native and mutant forms of CjXyn10A were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14-EH4 using a ADSC Quantum-4 charge-coupled device as detector. All data were processed and scaled with the HKL suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38432) Google Scholar) and all other computing used the CCP4 suite (26Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. Structure Solution and Refinement—MACRSTLEDRSP-CjXyn10A and its derivatives were solved by molecular replacement using the CCP4 version of the program AMoRe. Data in the resolution range 20–3.0 Å with an outer radius of Patterson integration of 25 Å, and the protein atoms of the catalytic core domain of CjXyn10A (1clx.pdb) as the search model. Before refinement, 5% of the observations were immediately set aside for cross-validation analysis (27Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3853) Google Scholar) and were used to monitor various refinement strategies such as the weighting of geometrical and temperature factor restraint and the insertion of solvent water during maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13810) Google Scholar). Manual corrections of the model using the X-FIT routines of the program QUANTA (Accelrys) were interspersed with cycles of maximum-likelihood refinement. The coordinates and observed structure factors were deposited at the Macromolecular Structures Data base (EBI, Cambridge, UK), and the data statistics are presented in Supplemental Table 2S. Error-prone PCR of Wild Type CjXyn10A—Error-prone PCR was used to introduce random mutations using a regime that generated libraries of xylanase mutants in which ∼50% of the enzymes generated in the first round displayed catalytic activity at 37 °C (permissive temperature). Sequencing of 20 clones picked at random revealed an average mutation rate of three amino acid substitutions in the encoded xylanases. The frequency of mutations was as follows: AT → TA, 84%; GC → AT, 10%; AT → GC, 6%. The error-prone PCR library, comprising 100,000 clones, was screened for bacteria expressing thermostable xylanases in the absence of calcium. After incubation at 70 °C for 15 min (conditions that completely inactivate wild type CjXyn10A), three colonies expressed a functional xylanase (Table I). The sequence of the genes encoding the thermostable xylanases all contained a nucleotide change in the codon for Asp-262 leading to the introduction of the D262N mutation. The observation that both codons for asparagine were evident in the selected colonies, one of which contained an additional silent mutation, indicate that the thermostable xylanases were derived from independent amplification events.Table IThermostablizing mutations isolated from error-prone PCR librariesEnzymeRound of PCRMutant nameAmino acid changesCodon changeCjXyn10A1D262NaThese mutants were used as the template to construct the following error-prone PCR library.D262NGAT262AACCjXyn10A1D262ND262NGAT262AATCjXyn10A1D262N/A69AD262NGAT262AATGCT69GCACjXyn10A2D262N/A80TaThese mutants were used as the template to construct the following error-prone PCR library.A80TGCC80ACCCjXyn10A2D262N/A80TA80TGCC80ACCCGC146CGACjXyn10A2D262N/A80VA80VGCC80GTCCjXyn10A3D262N/A80T/R347CR347CCGT347TGTCjXyn10A3D262N/A80T/R347C/A98TR347C, A98TCGT347TGTGCC98ACCCjXyn10A3D262N/A80T/R347C/Y145F/I160FR347C,Y145F, I160FCGT347TGTTAT145TTTATC160TTCGTC287GTACjXyn10A3D262N/A80T/R347C/A224TR347C, A224TCGT347TGTGCC224GCTCTG320CTAGTA194GTGCjXyn10A3D262N/A80T/R347C/G138S/I242VR347C, G138S, I242VCGT347TGTGGT138AGUATC242GTCCfCjXyn10A1CfD257N/P85ScfD5N/P85SGACcf257AACCCC85TCCCfCjXyn10A1CfP255SaThese mutants were used as the template to construct the following error-prone PCR library.cfD5NGACcf257AACCfCjXyn10A2CfP255S/A80T/N195SA80T, N195SGCC80ACCAAC195AGCCfCjXyn10A2CfP255S/A80TaThese mutants were used as the template to construct the following error-prone PCR library.A80TGCC80ACCCfCjXyn10A2CfP255S/A80VA80VGCC80GTCCfCjXyn10A2CfP255S/A80VA80VGCC80GTCGTC82GTGTCA58TCCCfCjXyn10A3CfP255S/A80V/cfT254AcfT2AACGcf255GCGAAA280AAGGGT155GGCfCjXyn10A3CfP255S/A80T/cfT254A/R139HcfT2A, R139HACGcf254GCGCGC139CACTTC100TTTGCT15GCCa These mutants were used as the template to construct the following error-prone PCR library. Open table in a new tab One of the xylanase clones containing the D262N mutation, designated d262n, was subjected to a second round of error-prone PCR, which generated ∼100,000 colonies, with 30% displaying functional xylanase activity at the permissive temperature. The mutant library was again screened for clones that express a thermostable xylanase by incubating the colonies at 75 °C for 15 min, conditions that inactivate d262n. Three clones were shown to express a xylanase that retained activity after treatment at 75 °C. The sequence of cjxyn10A in these mutants revealed two amino acid substitutions in the encoded xylanases; D262N/A80T or D262N/A80V (Table I). One of these clones (designated d262n/a80t) was subjected to a third round of error-prone PCR, and again, a library of around 105 clones was constructed, of which only 25% displayed xylanase activity at the permissive temperature of 37 °C. Screening the bacterial colonies at 78 °C for 120 min, which completely inactivates CjXyn10A expressed by d262n/a80t, generated five clones that display xylanase activity at the non-permissive temperature. The five mutants, containing between one and three amino acid substitutions, in addition to D262N/A80T (mutations in the enzyme encoded by the template DNA) all processed the mutation R347C. One of these clones, defined as d262n/a80t/r347c, was chosen for further study. Error-prone PCR of CfCjXyn10A—Because the introduction of the D262N mutation into loop 7 increases the thermostability of CjXyn10A, we assessed whether a derivative of the xylanase, designated CfCjXyn10A, in which the extended calcium binding loop (residues Asn-252 to Ser-272 in CjXyn10A) was replaced with the much smaller, calcium-independent loop from the GH10 C. fimi xylanase CfXyn10A (residues Arg-253, Thr-254, Pro-255, Ser-256, Asp-257, Ala-258, which are prefixed by cf) provided a better template for the introduction of stabilizing amino acid changes in the absence of the divalent metal ion. CfCjXyn10A was shown previously to be less thermostable than wild type CjXyn10A (6Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P"

The polytopic transmembrane domain can mediate anion exchange in the absence of nearly the entire NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain (8Grinstein S. Ship S. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys.

Whereas the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of erythroid AE1 is important for its binding to multiple cytoskeletal proteins, glycolytic enzymes, and hemoglobin (10Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T.

In contrast, non-erythroid, Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchange in many cell types is sensitively regulated by changes in pHi (e.g. Refs. 15Reinertsen K.V. Tonnessen T.I. Jacobsen J. Sandvig K.

Similarly, recombinant cardiac AE3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes is responsive to changes in pHi (19Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Structure-function experiments have indicated that an operationally defined AE2 “pH sensor site” that enhances pHo sensitivity of anion transport is localized to the transmembrane domain (13Zhang Y. Chernova M.N. Stuart Tilley A.K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5741-5749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that the extracellular proton sensitivity (pHo(50) value) of AE2-mediated 36Cl- influx (∼7.0 under conditions of unclamped pHi) was acid-shifted by up to 0.7 units following various truncations of the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domain. This result suggested the presence, between aa 99 and 510 of the 705-aa AE2 NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, of a “pH modifier site” that modulates anion transport activity of the transmembrane domain. More recently, 36Cl- efflux assays in AE2-expressing oocytes revealed that pH sensitivity of the transporter requires the integrity of two non-contiguous regions of the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain: the highly conserved aa 336–347 (20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the less well conserved region of aa 391–510 (19Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved residues aa 336–347 play a similar role in pH-dependent regulation of the AE3 polypeptide and are likely to be important in other SLC4 transporters, as well (20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).In the present work we extend our mutagenic analysis to the AE2 NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain residues that precede and follow the highly conserved aa 336–347 sequence, as guided by our earlier sequential deletion studies (18Jiang L. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Parkash J. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C845-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that several non-contiguous regions of the AE2 NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain contain conserved amino acids whose mutation alters the regulation of anion exchange activity by pHi and/or by pHo. Homology modeling suggests that a substantial subset of these residues contributes to at least one pH-sensitive surface of this domain. A preliminary report of this work has been published (21Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Kerr N. Alper S.L. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 304aCrossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Na36Cl was purchased from ICN (Irvine, CA). Other chemical reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma, Calbiochem, or Fluka. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Taq DNA polymerase and dNTPs were from Promega (Madison, WI) or Invitrogen.Solutions—ND-96 medium consisted of (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, and 2.5 sodium pyruvate, pH 7.40. Flux media lacked sodium pyruvate. pH values of 7.0, 8.0, and 8.5 in room air flux media were achieved with 5 mm HEPES. 5 mm MES was used for room air flux media of pH values 5.0 and 6.0. In Cl--free solutions, NaCl was replaced isosmotically with 96 mm sodium isethionate, and equimolar potassium, calcium, and magnesium gluconate substituted for the corresponding Cl- salts. CO2/HCO3−-buffered solutions of pH 7.4 were saturated with 5% CO2, 95% air at room temperature for ∼1 h, and differed from Cl--free ND-96 in the replacement of 24 mm sodium isethionate with 24 mm NaHCO3. The pH of CO2/HCO3−-buffered solutions was verified prior to each experiment. Addition to flux media of the weak acid salt, sodium butyrate, was as an equimolar substitution for NaCl.Mutant AE2 cDNAs—Murine AE2 encoded in plasmid pΔX (13Zhang Y. Chernova M.N.

The AE2 hexa-Ala bloc substitution mutants (A)6357–362, (A)6391–396, (A)6397–402, and (A)6403–408 were constructed by a four-primer PCR method as described (13Zhang Y. Chernova M.N.

Integrity of PCR products and ligation junctions was confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands. AE2 mutant D578K was constructed using the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and sequenced only at the site of the mutation. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Biosynthesis (Woodlands, TX) or Sigma (Haverhill, UK); primer sequences are available upon request.cRNA Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Mature female Xenopus (Xenopus One, Madison, WI, or Blades, UK) were maintained and subjected to partial ovariectomy as described (12Humphreys B.D. Jiang L. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1295-C1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stage V–VI oocytes were manually defolliculated following incubation of ovarian fragments with 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 60 min in ND-96 solution containing 50 ng/ml gentamycin and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate. Oocytes were injected on the same day with cRNA or with H2O in a volume of 50 nl. Capped cRNA was transcribed from linearized cDNA templates with the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis in formaldehyde, and RNA concentration was estimated by A260. Injected oocytes were then maintained for 2–6 days at 19 °C.36Cl-Efflux Measurements—Individual oocytes in Cl--free ND-96 were injected with 50 nl of 130 mm Na36Cl (10,000–12,000 cpm). Following a 5–10-min recovery period, the efflux assay was initiated by transfer of individual oocytes to 6-ml borosilicate glass tubes, each containing 1 ml of efflux solution. At intervals of 3 min, 0.95 ml of this efflux solution was removed for scintillation counting and replaced with an equal volume of fresh efflux solution. Following completion of the assay with a final efflux period in the presence of the anion transport inhibitor DIDS (200 μm), each oocyte was lysed in 100 μl of 2% SDS. Samples were counted for 3–5 min such that the magnitude of 2 S.D. was <5% of the sample mean.Experimental data were plotted as ln (% cpm remaining in the oocyte) versus time. 36Cl- efflux rate constants were measured from linear fits to data from the last three time points sampled for each experimental condition. All single time point values for 36Cl- efflux from AE2 cRNA-injected oocytes into chloride medium exceeded 150 cpm. Efflux cpm values for water-injected oocytes (40–90 cpm) were indistinguishable from those for AE2 cRNA-injected oocytes in the presence of DIDS. Both of these values exceeded machine background values of 20 cpm (peak 30 cpm). Within each experiment, water-injected and AE2 cRNA-injected oocytes from the same frog were subjected to parallel measurements. On each experimental day, 36Cl- efflux activity of the tested mutant AE2 polypeptides was compared at pHo 7.4 to wild-type AE2 activity (“basal activity”). Each AE2 mutant was tested in oocytes from at least two frogs, and most in oocytes from three frogs. These data are summarized in Supplemental Materials Table I.Measurement of pHo Dependence of 36Cl-Efflux—Individual oocytes maintained in Cl--free solution at pHo 7.4 were exposed sequentially to (Cl- containing) ND-96 at pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 8.5, then to a solution at pH 8.5 in the presence of DIDS (13Zhang Y.

Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rate constants measured at each pHo value for wild-type AE2 and for the tested AE2 mutants in each individual experiment were fit (Sigma Plot) to the following first-order logistic sigmoid equation,v=(Vmax×10−K)/(10−K+10−x)+d(Eq. 1) where v = AE2-mediated Cl- efflux rate constant, Vmax = the maximum AE2-mediated Cl- efflux rate constant, x = pHo at which the rate constant was measured, K = pHo(50), the pHo at which v is half-maximal, and d = y axis point of intersection. Any value of d > 0 leads to an underestimate of the degree of acidic shift of the pHo(50) value for the particular AE2 mutant compared with the wild-type AE2 pHo(50).Rate constants for each mutant were normalized to the fit parameter Vmax calculated for each individual oocyte (100%), and the normalized data were fit to the same equation (Equation 1). Mean pHo(50) values for individual mutants were compared with wild-type AE2 by Student's unpaired t test. The level of significance was taken as p < 0.05. The pHo dependence of wild-type AE2-mediated 36Cl- efflux did not differ when the experiment was performed with the order of pHo change reversed or randomized (20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). pHo dependence was also unchanged when pHi was clamped during pHo variation by simultaneously changing the butyrate concentration in the bath (20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All pHo(50) data for wild-type and mutant AE2 polypeptides are summarized in Supplemental Materials Table I.Measurement of pHi Dependence of 36Cl-Efflux—To vary pHi at constant pHo, 36Cl--injected oocytes were preincubated for 30 min prior to the start of the experiment in pH 7.4 Cl--free solution containing 40 mm sodium butyrate. 36Cl- efflux was then initiated by transfer of oocytes into Cl--containing solution in the continued presence of butyrate. The oocytes were then transferred into efflux medium containing Cl- but lacking weak acid. In these conditions, pHi increases 0.50 ± 0.03 units after butyrate removal, with a time constant of ∼6 min, and butyrate is neither an inhibitor of nor a substrate for AE2 (19Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In our previous work, we defined the pHi sensitivity of AE2 activity as the -fold increase in the rate constant for 36Cl- efflux following a rise of pHi (induced by butyrate removal) (Supplemental Materials Fig. S1, left panel). This method of data presentation places no upper limit on the value for stimulation. It is, however, influenced more by small differences in the low 36Cl- efflux rate constant measured in the presence of butyrate (i.e. at low pHi) than by changes in the higher, and better resolved, efflux rate constant measured subsequently in its absence (at high pHi). In the present work, we have therefore adopted a more conservative presentation of pHi sensitivity, namely, the fractional reduction in the 36Cl- efflux rate constant associated with a reduction of pHi. Note that this value is the reciprocal of the value previously reported for the same assay. The ratio is referred to as the “normalized 36Cl- efflux rate constant” in response to 40 mm butyrate, and reflects the response to acidic pHi at unchanged pHo. Mean values of this normalized 36Cl- efflux rate constant for each AE2 mutant were compared with that of wild-type AE2 tested simultaneously by Student's unpaired t test. The level of significance was taken as p < 0.05. All normalized 36Cl- efflux rate constants in units of % are summarized for wild-type and mutant AE2 polypeptides in Supplemental Materials Table I.Modeling kAE2 Cytoplasmic NH2-terminal Structure—The crystal structure of a portion of the human erythroid AE1 cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domain (10Zhang D.

Geno3D (geno3d-pbil.ibcp.fr) was provided with the AE1 template (GenBank™ pdb1hynQ-0) to generate a predicted structure for AE2 cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domain aa 317–610, and rendered with DeepView/SwissPDB viewer 3.7 (us.expasy.org/spdbv/). DeepView's Nearest Neighbor function was applied to detect amino acids predicted to reside within defined Å distances of any residue of interest. Ion pair interaction distances were interpreted according to ion-pair distances measured in a series of polypeptides of known structure (23Kumar S. Nussinov R. Biophys.

Chernova M.N. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, aa 312–317 includes two prolines that comprise a potential SH3 domain binding site, as well as two potentially titratable histidine residues. We mutated each residue individually to Ala and assessed the effects on Cl-/Cl- exchange of varying pHo or pHi. Fig. 1B indicates that most mutants exhibited 36Cl- efflux activity at pHo 7.4 comparable with that of wild-type AE2. Fig. 1C profiles 36Cl- efflux activity (normalized as described under “Materials and Methods”) as a function of pHo for wild-type AE2, the two AE2 mutants P313A and H317A, and the double mutant H314A/H317A. The pHo value at which the rate constant for wild-type, AE2-mediated 36Cl- efflux was half-maximal (pHo(50)) at 6.75 ± 0.05 (n = 24; Fig 1, C and E). The single mutant P313A and the double mutant H313A/H317A each exhibited a pHo dependence indistinguishable from that of wild-type AE2, whereas the pHo(50) value of the AE2 mutant H317A was shifted to a more acidic pH value of 6.20 ± 013 (n = 11, p < 0.05). Fig. 1E summarizes, for all mutants tested, the pHo(50) values measured from data like that shown in Fig. 1C. Although mutagenesis of either His314 or His317 led to an acid-shift in pHo(50) value, the double mutant H314A/H317A exhibited wild-type regulation by pHo.We next investigated the effect of changing pHi at a constant pHo upon activity of the same set of AE2 mutants. Bath addition and removal of the weak acid, butyrate, respectively, decreases and increases oocyte pHi (19Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1D shows a representative efflux trace in which 36Cl- efflux via wild-type AE2, and via the mutants P313A, H317A, and H314A/H317A, was reduced at low pHi (butyrate addition) and subsequently stimulated when pHi was elevated (by butyrate removal). Fig. 1F summarizes similar experiments for all mutants tested, results are expressed as the 36Cl- efflux rate constant at low pHi (in the presence of 40 mm butyrate) normalized to that measured at high pHi (following extracellular butyrate removal, see “Materials and Methods” and Supplemental Materials Fig. S1). The data do not suggest involvement of the proline and histidine residues in pHi-dependent regulation of AE2 activity, because their mutation to alanine did not prevent reduction of 36Cl- efflux at low pHi. Note that while the AE2 mutants, H314A and H317A, were altered in their sensitivity to pHo their sensitivity to pHi was unchanged (Fig. 1F). The data also indicate that pH-dependent regulation of AE2 does not require binding of a SH3 domain-containing protein at this site, because the proline mutants exhibited normal sensitivity to both pHi and pHo.Individual Mutations within AE2 aa 318–323 Identify Residues Important for Regulation of Cl-Transport by pHo and pHi—Our previous study using hexa-Ala bloc substitutions implicated aa 318–323 as important for the regulation of AE2 activity by pH (20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the AE2 mutant (A)6318–323 expressed too low an activity at pHo 7.4 to allow study of inhibition by extracellular acidification. Therefore, we re-evaluated this region by alanine scan of the individual residues (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that all mutants studied retained 36Cl- efflux activity at pHo 7.4, sufficient for an analysis of pH sensitivity. Fig. 2C shows that the AE2 mutant, E318A (open circles), exhibited a pHo dependence similar to that of wild-type AE2 (filled circles), except for its incomplete inhibition at pHo 5.0. In contrast, the AE2 mutant F320A (filled squares) and the double mutant E318A/E322G (open squares) displayed acid-shifted pHo(50) values of 5.83 ± 0.12 (n = 10, p < 0.05) and 6.20 ± 0.13 (n = 7, p < 0.05), respectively. Because both of these mutants also exhibited incomplete inhibition at pHo 5.0, these pHo(50) values represent maximal estimates.Fig. 2Systematic mutagenesis of AE2 residues 318–323 identifies amino acids important for regulation of Cl- transport by pHo and pHi.

Two individual mutations (F320A and L323A) and the (inadvertently derived) double mutation E318A/E322G led to significant shifts in pHo(50) values relative to that of wild-type AE2. Alanine substitution of other residues did not significantly shift pHo(50) values. Mutation of the hydrophobic phenylalanine (Phe320) to the similarly sized but more hydrophilic tyrosine (as in the corresponding position of mAE1) also acid-shifted the pHo(50) value, but to a lesser degree. Note that, although individual mutations of glutamate 318 or 322 to alanine had no effect on the pHo(50) value, there was an acid-shift for the double mutant.We next tested the pHi sensitivity of the same AE2 mutants. Fig 2D shows a representative experiment in which 36Cl- efflux via wild-type AE2 and the mutant E318A was inhibited at low pHi (in the presence of butyrate) and subsequently stimulated by an elevation of pHi (induced by extracellular butyrate removal). In contrast, mutants F320A and E318A/E322G both showed a significantly reduced inhibition at low pHi (and therefore a reduced stimulation upon elevation of pHi). Fig. 2F summarizes the pHi sensitivity of all the point mutants tested here in comparison with wild-type AE2. The mutants F320A, F320Y, and L323A, and the double mutants E318A/E322G and E318V/E322A each displayed a decrease in 36Cl- efflux activity at low pHi (in the presence of 40 mm butyrate) that was significantly lower than wild-type. This loss of inhibition by acid pHi was also manifest in AE2 F320A-mediated Cl−/HCO3− exchange (not shown). These data therefore identify multiple amino acid residues whose mutation alters wild-type regulation of AE2 activity by both pHi and pHo. The next segment of AE2, aa 324–335, was not further examined because the AE2 mutants A(6)324–329 and A(6)330–335 exhibited wild-type regulation by both pHo and pHi (20Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N.

https://openalex.org/W1979425616,"Activation of G protein-coupled receptors by agonists involves significant movement of transmembrane domains (TMD) following agonist binding. The underlying structural mechanism by which receptor activation takes place is largely unknown but can be inferred by detecting variability within the environment of the ligand-binding pocket, which is a water-accessible crevice surrounded by the seven TMD helices. Using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method, we identified the residues within the third TMD of the wild-type angiotensin II (AT1) receptor that contribute to the formation of the binding site pocket. Each residue within the Ile103–Tyr127 region was mutated one at a time to a cysteine. Treating the A104C, N111C, and L112C mutant receptors with the charged sulfhydryl-specific alkylating agent methanethiosulfonate-ethylammonium (MTSEA) strongly inhibited ligand binding, which suggests that these residues orient themselves within the water-accessible binding pocket of the AT1 receptor. Interestingly, this pattern of acquired MTSEA sensitivity was altered for TMD3 reporter cysteines engineered in a constitutively active AT1 receptor. Indeed, two additional mutants (S109C and V116C) were found to be sensitive to MTSEA treatment. Our results suggest that constitutive activation of the AT1 receptor causes a minor counterclockwise rotation of TMD3, thereby exposing residues, which are not present in the inactive state, to the binding pocket. This pattern of accessibility of residues in the TMD3 of the AT1 receptor parallels that of homologous residues in rhodopsin. This study identified key elements of TMD3 that contribute to the activation of class A G protein-coupled receptors through structural rearrangements.

The octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AngII) 1The abbreviations used are: AngII, angiotensin II; AT1 receptor, angiotensin II type-1 receptor; hAT1, human AT1; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TMD, transmembrane domain; SCAM, substituted-cysteine accessibility method; MTSEA, methanethiosulfonate-ethylammonium; Sar, sarcosine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is the active component of the renin-angiotensin system. It exerts a wide variety of physiological effects, including vascular contraction, aldosterone secretion, neuronal activation, and cardiovascular cell growth and proliferation (1de Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Virtually all the known physiological effects of AngII are produced through the activation of the AT1 receptor, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (2Miura S. Saku K. Karnik S.S. Hypertens. Res. 2003; 26: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Burnier M. Circulation. 2001; 103: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). GPCRs all possess seven transmembrane domains (TMD), which provide structural support for signal transduction. The AT1 receptor interacts with the G protein Gq/11, which activates a phospholipase C, which in turn generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4Balla T.

Chem. 1984; 259: 14448-14457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate causes the release of Ca2+ from an intracellular store, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. Like other GPCRs, the AT1 receptor undergoes spontaneous isomerization between its inactive state (favored in the absence of agonist) and its active state (induced or stabilized by the agonist) (6Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The rotation or translation of TMD helices caused by rigid body movement occurs during the activation of GPCRs (7Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that TMD3, TMD5, TMD6, and TMD7 may participate in the activation process of the AT1 receptor by providing a network of interactions through the AngII-binding pocket (10Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Inagami T. J. Hypertens. 1997; 15: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The dynamics of this network are thought to be modified following agonist binding, thereby forcing the receptor to form new interactions between the TMDs. Based on homology with the high resolution structure of rhodopsin, the archetypal GPCR (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), it was expected that the binding site of the AT1 receptor would involve the seven, mostly hydrophobic TMDs and would be accessible to charged water-soluble ligands, such as AngII. For this receptor, the binding site would thus be contained within a water-accessible crevice, the binding pocket, extending from the extracellular surface of the receptor to the transmembrane portion. Using a photoaffinity labeling approach, we directly identified ligand contact points within the second extracellular loop and the seventh TMD of the AT1 receptor (12Boucard A.A. Wilkes B.C. Laporte S.A. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9662-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Laporte S.A. Boucard A.A. Servant G. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Escher E.

Interestingly, numerous mutagenesis studies have provided the basis for a model in which an interaction between Asn111 in TMD3 and Tyr292 in TMD7 maintains the AT1 receptor in the inactive conformation. The agonist AngII would disrupt this interaction and promote the active conformational state (15Joseph M.P. Maigret B. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. Scheraga H.A. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 381-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In support of this model, it was further shown that substitution of Asn111 for a residue of smaller size (Ala or Gly) confers constitutive activity on the AT1 receptor (16Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J.

Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) is an ingenious approach for systematically identifying the residues in a TMD that contribute to the binding site pocket of a GPCR. Consecutive residues within TMDs are mutated to cysteine, one at a time, and the mutant receptors are expressed in heterologous cells. If ligand binding to a cysteine-substituted mutant is unchanged when compared with wild-type receptor, it is assumed that the structure of the mutant receptor, especially around the binding site, is similar to that of the wild type and therefore that the substituted cysteine lies in a similar orientation to that of the wild-type residue. In TMDs, the sulfhydryl of a cysteine oriented toward the binding site pocket should react faster with a positively charged sulfhydryl reagent such as methanethiosulfonate-ethylammonium (MTSEA) than sulfhydryls facing the interior of the protein or the lipid bilayer. Two criteria are used for identifying engineered cysteines on the surface of the binding site pocket: (i) the reaction with MTSEA alters binding irreversibly and (ii) the reaction is retarded by the presence of ligand. We previously used this approach to identify the residues in TMD7 that form the surface of the binding site pocket in the wild-type AT1 receptor and in the constitutively active N111G-AT1 receptor (22Boucard A.A.

Here we report the application of SCAM to probe TMD3 in the wild-type and constitutively active receptors. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, bacitracin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. The sulfhydryl-specific alkylating reagent MTSEA (CH3SO2-SCH2CH2NH3+) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The cDNA clone for the human AT1 receptor subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Sylvain Meloche (Université de Montréal). Lipofectamine™ 2000 and culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen. 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (specific radioactivity ∼1500 Ci/mmol) was prepared with Iodo-GEN® (Perbio Science, Erembodegem, Belgium) according to the method of Fraker and Speck (23Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) and as reported previously (24Guillemette G. Escher E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5591-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Numbering of Residues in TMD3—Residues in TMD3 of the human AT1 receptor were given two numbering schemes. First, residues were numbered according to their positions in the human AT1 receptor sequence. Second, residues were also indexed according to their position relative to the most conserved residue in the TMD in which it is located (25Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). By definition, the most conserved residue was assigned the position index “50,” e.g. in TMD3, Arg126 is the most conserved residue and was designated Arg126(3.50), whereas the upstream residue was designated Asp125(3.49) and the downstream residue was designated Tyr127(3.51). This indexing simplified the identification of aligned residues in different GPCRs. Oligodeoxynucleotide Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the wild-type AT1 receptor with the overlap PCR method (Expand high fidelity PCR system; Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, forward and reverse oligonucleotides were constructed to introduce cysteine mutations between Ile103(3.27) and Tyr127(3.51). PCR products were subcloned into the HindIII-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. Site-directed mutations were then confirmed by manual and automated DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish. When the cells reached ∼90% confluency, they were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000. After 24 h, transfected cells were trypsinized, distributed into 12-well plates, and grown for an additional 24 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin before the MTSEA treatment and binding assay. Binding Experiments—COS-7 cells were grown for 36 h after transfection in 100-mm culture dishes, washed once with PBS, and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle. Broken cells were then gently scraped into washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% bacitracin, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor). Saturation binding experiments were done by incubating broken cells (20–40 μg of protein) for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII in a final volume of 500 μl. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]AngII. Bound radioactivity was separated from free ligand by filtration through GF/C filters presoaked for at least 3 h in binding buffer. Receptor-bound radioactivity was evaluated by γ counting. Treatment with MTSEA—The MTSEA treatment was performed according to the procedure of Javitch et al. (19Javitch J.A. Li X. Kaback J. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Two days after transfection, the cells, which were grown in 12-well plates, were washed with PBS and incubated for 3 min at room temperature with freshly prepared MTSEA at the desired concentrations (typically from 0.5 to 6 mm) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS. Intact cells were then incubated in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm125I [Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 90 min at room temperature. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was evaluated by γ counting. The percentage of fractional binding inhibition was calculated as (1 - (specific binding after the MTSEA treatment/specific binding without the treatment)) × 100. Protection against MTSEA Reaction by [Sar1,Ile8]AngII—Transfected cells grown in 12-well plates were washed once with PBS and incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm [Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 1 h at 16 °C (to avoid internalization of receptors). The cells were washed to remove excess ligand and then treated with MTSEA. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and once with an acidic buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm acetic acid, pH 3.0) to dissociate bound ligand. They were then incubated for 3 h at 16 °C in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII. The percentage of protection was calculated as [(inhibition in the absence of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII) - (inhibition in the presence of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII)/(inhibition in the absence of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII)] × 100. Molecular Modeling—All calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane2 work station. The theoretical structure of the hAT1 receptor was generated by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1F88). A pairwise sequence alignment between the two primary structures was performed using the Homology program of Insight II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Once the structurally conserved regions (TMDs) were identified, the coordinates were transferred to the sequence of the hAT1 receptor. The structures of the loops of hAT1 were modeled using the loop generation program of Insight II. The potential energy of the model structure of hAT1 was minimized using the molecular modeling package of Insight II/Discover with a consistent valence force field (26Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Two disulfide bridges, Cys18–Cys274 and Cys101–Cys180, were used as distance restraints. A distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4 was used with a simple harmonic potential for bond length energy. No cross-term energies were included, and the peptide bonds were forced to planarity. Data Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.D. Binding data (Bmax and Kd) were analyzed with the Kell program (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO), which uses a weighted nonlinear curve-fitting routine. Binding Properties of Mutant Receptors Bearing Cysteines in TMD3—To identify the residues in TMD3 that face the binding site pocket of the AT1 receptor, we mutated 24 consecutive residues between Ile103(3.27) and Tyr127(3.51) to cysteine, one at a time. Each mutant receptor was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. To assess the conservation of the global conformation of these receptors after the substitutions, pharmacological parameters describing the equilibrium binding of the radiolabeled competitive ligand 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII such as Kd and Bmax were determined (Table I). All the mutant receptors exhibited high binding affinity for 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (similar to that of the wild-type AT1 receptor) except for Y113C(3.37), which had a moderate 6-fold decrease in binding affinity. Mutants S105C(3.29), V108C(3.32), and S109C(3.33) did not demonstrate any detectable binding activity and were not used for the SCAM analysis. Bmax values for all detectable receptors ranged from 210 fmol/mg to 1.3 pmol/mg.Table IBinding properties of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII to cysteine-substituted hAT1 mutant receptors Cells transfected with the appropriate receptor were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding affinities (Kd) and maximal binding capacities (Bmax) are expressed as the means ±S.D. of values obtained in n independent experiments performed in duplicate.

We verified whether the wild-type AT1 receptor, which contains 10 endogenous cysteines (Fig. 1), was sensitive to the MTSEA treatment. Fig. 2 shows that the various concentrations of MTSEA had very little effect (no more than a 20% reduction) on the binding properties of the wild-type AT1 receptor, indicating that the endogenous cysteines made a relatively small contribution to the binding site pocket. A 3-min treatment with 0.5 mm MTSEA (Fig. 3A) strongly inhibited the binding properties of mutants A104C(3.28) and L112C(3.36), whereas it had only a minor effect on the binding properties of the other mutant receptors. At higher MTSEA concentrations, the binding properties of mutant N111C(3.35) were also slightly affected (Fig. 3B). Overall, the most reactive cysteines were those substituted for Ala104(3.28) and Leu112(3.36), whereas the cysteine substituted for Asn111(3.35) was less reactive.Fig. 2MTSEA treatment of the wild-type (WT) AT1 receptor and sensitive reporter cysteine-bearing mutant receptors.

We first determined the pharmacological properties of the 23 cysteine-substituted mutant receptors. Within the N111G-AT1 receptor background, 20 cysteine-substituted mutants conserved a high binding affinity for the competitive ligand 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (Table II), whereas one mutant (Y113C(3.37)-N111G-AT1 receptor) displayed a moderate 5-fold decrease in binding affinity. The S105C(3.29)-N111G-AT1 and V108C(3.32)-N111G-AT1 receptors did not have any detectable binding activity and were not used for the SCAM analysis. Interestingly, the S109C(3.33) mutation that caused a drastic loss of binding affinity in the wild-type receptor background did not cause a significant loss of binding affinity (1.9 nm) when engineered in the N111G-AT1 receptor background. Bmax values for all detectable receptors ranged from 311 fmol/mg to 1.8 pmol/mg (Table II).Table IIBinding properties of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII to cysteine-substituted hAT1 mutant receptors bearing the N111G mutation Cells transfected with the appropriate receptor were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding affinities (Kd) and maximal binding capacities (Bmax) are expressed as the means ±S.D. of values obtained in n independent experiments performed in duplicate.

Cysteine-substituted N111G-AT1 receptor mutants were also treated with increasing concentrations of MTSEA, and their binding properties were assessed with 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII. Fig. 4 also shows that the MTSEA treatment caused a large decrease in binding to the V116C(3.40)-N111G-AT1 mutant, whereas it caused a large increase in binding to the Y113C(3.37)-N111G-AT1 mutant. Fig. 5 summarizes the effect of the MTSEA treatment on the different cysteine-substituted N111G-AT1 receptor mutants. As observed in the wild-type background, mutants A104C(3.28)-N111G-AT1 (binding inhibition of 63%) and L112C(3.36)-N111G-AT1 (binding inhibition of 54%) were very sensitive to 0.5 mm MTSEA. Interestingly, two other mutants (Y113C(3.37)-N111G-AT1 and V116C(3.40)-N111G-AT1) were also very sensitive to MTSEA (Fig. 5A), whereas a third mutant, S109C(3.33)-N111G-AT1, had a low sensitivity to MTSEA treatment (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Effect of MTSEA on different mutant N111G-AT1 receptors bearing a reporter cysteine in TMD3.

The cells were then washed with an acid buffer to dissociate the bound ligand. The receptors were then assayed for binding with the radiolabeled competitive ligand. Fig. 6 shows how a preincubation with the competitive ligand [Sar1,Ile8]AngII protected mutant receptors A104C(3.28), L112C(3.36), N111G-A104C(3.28), N111G-S109C(3.33), N111G-L112C(3.36), and N111G-V116C(3.40) from the inhibitory effect of MTSEA, with protection levels ranging from 58 to 91%. Unexpectedly, pretreatment of the N111G-Y113C(3.37) receptor mutant with [Sar1,Ile8]AngII potentiated the effect of MTSEA on the binding properties of this mutant by a further 35% (Fig. 6). The rationale of this study, which relied on SCAM analysis, was to gain an insight into the orientation of TMD3 of the AT1 receptor by identifying the residues accessible to MTSEA within the binding site pocket. Mapping these residues in the ground state receptor and the constitutively active N111G background allowed us to measure relative changes in the position of certain residues, thus providing valuable information with which to infer a structural change underlyi"

Identification of the primary β-secretase gene, BACE1, provides a unique opportunity to examine the role this unique aspartyl protease plays in altering Aβ metabolism and deposition that occurs in AD. The current experiments seek to examine how modulating β-secretase expression and activity alters APP processing and Aβ metabolism in vivo. Genomic-based BACE1 transgenic mice were generated that overexpress human BACE1 mRNA and protein. The highest expressing BACE1 transgenic line was mated to transgenic mice containing human APP transgenes. Our biochemical and histochemical studies demonstrate that mice overexpressing both BACE1 and APP show specific alterations in APP processing and age-dependent Aβ deposition. We observed elevated levels of Aβ isoforms as well as significant increases of Aβ deposits in these double transgenic animals. In particular, the double transgenics exhibited a unique cortical deposition profile, which is consistent with a significant increase of BACE1 expression in the cortex relative to other brain regions. Elevated BACE1 expression coupled with increased deposition provides functional evidence for β-secretase as a primary effector in regional amyloid deposition in the AD brain.

The primary constituent of the senile plaques is amyloid-β (Aβ) (2Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4244) Google Scholar), a peptide of 39–42 amino acids derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Aβ deposition proceeds in a characteristic pattern within the brain with the appearance of plaques first in the basal neocortex, followed by deposition in the frontal cortex, and hippocampal formation until all areas of the cortex contain deposits at end stage AD (3Braak H. Braak E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The generation of Aβ from APP involves three proteases with distinct activities, termed α-, β-, and γ-secretase. APP cleavage follows two pathways: cleavage by α-secretase generates C-terminal fragment-α (CTF-α), precluding the formation of Aβ upon subsequent γ-secretase cleavage. Alternatively, cleavage by β-secretase at Asp1 or Glu11 of the Aβ sequence (4Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y.

These studies are significant in considering therapeutics for Aβ elimination, but it is still unclear how alterations in BACE1 levels, and activity may play a role in AD pathology in vivo. To gain insight into how the modulation of BACE1 activity affects AD pathogenesis, we have utilized genomic-based transgenic methods to model AD pathology in vivo. Here we report the characterization of a human BACE1 transgenic line that produces human BACE1 mRNA and protein in mice. In addition, we show that animals expressing human BACE1 and human mutant APP have altered production of APP C-terminal fragments and increased levels of Aβ peptides. Finally, we report that human BACE1 and human APP transgenic animals exhibit an altered brain regional pattern of Aβ production and deposition, which reflects the relative levels of BACE1 protein in these brain regions. These studies demonstrate that overexpression of human BACE1 alters the APP processing pathway and directly impacts the regional pattern of Aβ deposition. Our findings suggest that modulation of human BACE1 expression, and activity may play a significant role in AD pathogenesis. Animals and Genetic Crosses—All animals were handled according to official guidelines (IACUC). Animals were bred on a mixed C57BL/6J × SJL background. BACE1 transgenic animals were crossed to APP transgenics (Tg2576), which contain the Swedish mutant human APP cDNA (kindly provided by K. Hsiao, University of Minnesota). Progeny of this cross were sacrificed at 2–3 months of age for biochemical analysis and at 12 months of age for Aβ immunohistochemistry and age-dependent biochemical analyses. Human BACE1 Genomic Analysis—Human BACE1 was mapped to human chromosome 11q23.3 (4Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y.

Sequence-tagged sites (STSs) and gene markers on 11q23.3 were used to identify the precise genomic localization of human BACE1. The human BACE1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. AF190725) was used to search the human genome by NCBI Blast (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) to identify genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing the full-length human BACE1 gene. In addition, BAC-end sequence (available from www.tigr.org/tdb/humgen/bac_end_search/bac_end_intro.shtml) and the published genome assembly (genome.cse.ucsc.edu/) were valuable resources in determining locus coverage for each clone. Sequencing was performed by Cleveland Genomics (Cleveland, OH) if no end sequence was available. Genomic clones identified in silico were further verified by PCR with STSs A005A12, WI-7101, D11S1340, D11S939, and BAC vector arm primers.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), purified BAC DNA was passed through a CL4B Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with injection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) and the DNA collected in 12 elution fractions. The appropriate fraction containing the BAC was diluted to a concentration ranging between 0.6–1.0 ng/μl. Generation of BACE1 Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice were generated by direct microinjection of BAC DNA into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs. This method was performed as described (19Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1994: 217-251Google Scholar). The embryos injected were F2 progeny of a C57BL6/SJL F1 cross and were surgically transferred into the oviducts of a pseudopregnant CD-1 female. Founder mice transgenic for BAC clones corresponding to the human BACE1 locus were identified by PCR from mouse tail DNA. Genotyping markers to identify founders were the STS A005A12, which is located ∼4 kilobases downstream of BACE1 exon 9, and a custom primer, which is located 10 kilobases upstream of BACE1 exon 1, with the sequence 5′-TGGAGAGTAATTTGCAATGCC-3′ and 3′-TTTGAATCCAAGGTTTTGCC-5′. Southern Blot Hybridization—Genomic DNA was prepared from a human BACE1 PCR-positive transgenic mouse tail and a nontransgenic mouse tail using a standard salting out procedure (20Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17972) Google Scholar). BAC 794I11 was purified as described above. Southern blots containing BamHI-digested genomic tail DNA (10 μg) and BAC DNA (∼100 ng) were prepared as described (21Sambrook J.a.R. David W. Argentine J. Third Edition Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001: 23-64Google Scholar). Both 32P-labeled human BACE1 cDNA and 32P-labeled human repetitive Alu element probes were used. The 1.1-kbp human BACE1 cDNA specific to the 3′-end of BACE1 (IMAGE clone 490377, GenBank™ no. AA136283) was obtained from Research Genetics (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The 284 bp Alu element utilized was described previously (22Lamb B.T. Sisodia S.S. Lawler A.M. Slunt H.H. Kitt C.A. Kearns W.G. Pearson P.L. Price D.L. Gearhart J.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Hybridization was done at 65 °C with Church and Gilbert Solution (500 mm NaPO4,1mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS). Blots were washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from transgenic and nontransgenic mouse brain, pancreas, kidney, liver, colon, spleen, lung, testes, and ear by polytron homogenization of tissue in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Each RNA preparation (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed in the presence of 50 pmol of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and Reverse Transcriptase™ (Invitrogen Life Technologies). After reverse transcription, 1/20 of the reverse transcriptase reaction was incubated in a PCR reaction with 50 pmol of primers with sequence 5′-GGAGGGAGCATGATCATTGG-3′ and 5′-ACAGTCGTCTTGGGACGTGG-3′ for 20 cycles at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. These primers recognize both mouse and human Bace1/BACE1 transcripts and amplify a 446-bp product that spans exons 4–8 of the gene. PCR products were purified and then digested with BglII restriction enzyme, which digests the mouse Bace1 product uniquely into two fragments (324 and 122 bp in size), leaving human BACE1 product uncleaved. For quantitation of total human BACE1 transcripts relative to mouse Bace1 transcripts in brain tissue, included in the PCR reaction was 50 pmol of exon 8 primer, which was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. After determining the linear range of the PCR reaction between reverse transcriptase products and BACE1 PCR product, the last cycle (cycle 20) was spiked with [γ-32P]ATP-BACE1-exon 8 primer. Resulting BglII PCR products were fractionated on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and then dried and exposed to phosphorimager. Tissue Preparation and Biochemical Analysis—Protein was isolated from 2-month-old transgenic and nontransgenic mouse brain tissues by polytron homogenization in 1% CHAPS solution in phosphate-buffered saline with 1× protease inhibitors (pepstatin, 1 μm; leupeptin, 4.5 μg/ml; aprotinin, 30 μg/ml; phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm). For analysis of BACE1 protein expression, 20 μg of total protein were resolved on 8% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Two antibodies were used to analyze BACE1 protein expression: 1) α-BACE-3599, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 46–136 of human BACE1 (5Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D. Wen H. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 233-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by P. Wong, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University), and 2Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4244) Google Scholar) 00/6, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 485–501 of human BACE1 (23Holsinger R.M. McLean C.A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Evin G. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). For analysis of APP C-terminal fragments, 20 μg of total protein were resolved on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Brain tissue extracts were blotted with 369, a polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of APP (kindly provided by S. Gandy, M.D., Ph.D., Thomas Jefferson University). All protein blots were probed with either anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences) or peroxidase-labeled protein A (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) secondary antibodies and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of soluble and insoluble protein pools, brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulb) from 12-month-old animals were homogenized in 0.1 m carbonate/50 mm NaCl (pH 11.5) buffer with protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) as previously described (24DeMattos R.B. O'Dell M.A. Parsadanian M. Taylor J.W. Harmony J.A. Bales K.R. Paul S.M. Aronow B.J. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). After homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to another tube and neutralized to pH 7.4 with 1 m Tris, pH 6.8. The pellet was further homogenized in 5 m guanidine-HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 as previously described (25Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Western Blot Quantitation—BACE1 protein expression was quantitated by comparing the amount of BACE1 protein in transgenic and nontransgenic brain tissue extracts relative to a standard curve of Bace1 expression. After incubation with ECL, the signal was captured with a fluorescence imager (Fluor-S-Max Imaging Machine, Bio-Rad) for each sample in triplicate and used to determine the fold increase of human BACE1 protein expression. APP C-terminal fragments were quantitated by comparing the relative ratio of CTF-β to the total amount of C-terminal fragments generated for each animal. After exposing blots to film, the films were scanned and APP C-terminal fragment bands were quantitated by image densitometry using Image-Quant 1.20 software (Molecular Dynamics). Sandwich ELISA for Aβ—Brain extracts from 2-month-old animals were analyzed for levels of Aβ peptides as previously described (26Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Sandwich ELISAs were used with antibodies detecting the different species of Aβ ending in 40 amino acids. Specifically, BNT-77/BA-27 was used to capture and detect Aβ peptides x-40. Brain region extracts from 12-month-old animals (described above) were analyzed for levels of Aβ peptides using Aβ1–40 ELISA (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). Dilution ranges were determined for carbonate (soluble) and guanidine (insoluble) extracts and standards were serially diluted in the same sample dilution buffer containing protease inhibitors. The values were read using fluorometric plate reader Wallac 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wellesly, MA). Aβ40 concentrations were determined based on sample values relative to the serially diluted standards representing a standard curve of known Aβ40 concentration. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and sample values are expressed as pmol of Aβ40/gram brain tissue weight. Immunohistochemistry—For Aβ immunostaining, half-brains were immersion-fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The methods for Aβ immunostaining were performed as previously described by Kulnane and Lamb (27Kulnane L.S. Lamb B.T. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Brain sections were stained with 6E10 (Senetek, Napa, CA), a mouse monoclonal antibody that is directed against Aβ-(1–17). For BACE1 immunostaining, animals were anesthetized with Avertin (0.02 cc/gm of body weight) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After perfusion, whole brains were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for > 24 h and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Sagittal sections were cut on a sliding microtome and stored at -80 °C. Brain sections were treated with avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and blocked in 10% normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Sections were stained with B279 rabbit polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by R. Yan, Ph.D., Cleveland Clinic Foundation), directed toward amino acids 295–310 of human BACE (28Yan R. Han P. Miao H. Greengard P. Xu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36788-36796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which shares identical sequence with mouse Bace1. All sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were prepared according to standard methods using Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with the chromogen 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin. For BACE1 immunofluorescence, cryosections were stained with B279 primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. For double immunofluorescence, cryosections were stained with B279 BACE1 antibody and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-NeuN MAB377 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). After several washes, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (for BACE1 signal) and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse (for NeuN signal) secondary antibodies were added to the incubation buffer (Molecular Probes) and mounted with Vecta-Shield Hard Set containing DAPI counterstain (Vector Laboratories). Aβ Plaque Quantitation—Digital images of brain sections were captured with Qimaging Micropublisher and Qcapture v2.64 (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). Amyloid deposition was assessed in brain regions ranging from primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, primary, and secondary visual cortex, and hippocampus. For quantitative analysis of Aβ deposition, five sections from each animal were analyzed with Image-Pro Plus v4.5 (Mediacybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD). The five sections spanned mouse brain Bregma locations from lateral 0.84 mm to lateral 2.40 mm (29Paxinos G.F. Keith B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 108-121Google Scholar). Plaque counts were determined following specific criteria for an immunopositive plaque, namely color, percent area, roundness, length, and width. Length and width criteria were fixed at minimal restrictions of ≥5 μm per plaque. These analyses were performed blinded to genotype. Statistical Analysis—Two-tailed Student's t tests were utilized for statistical analyses when variances for each sample population were equal. Two-tailed Student's t test with Welch's correction was used to adjust for unequal variances between sample populations. One-way ANOVA was utilized to compare BACE1 expression across brain regions. All data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 2.0 statistical software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Identification of Human BACE1 Genomic Clones—Based on the mapping of BACE1 previously reported (30Saunders A.J. Kim T.-W. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1255aCrossref Google Scholar), we were able to detect the position of the BACE1 locus on human chromosome 11q23.3 (Fig. 1A). Examination of the genomic and published protein sequence indicated that BACE1 spans nine exons, extending across ∼30,541 base pairs. Using the human genomic sequence available and known nearby genes on chromosome 11, we were able to identify several genomic clones with extensive coverage of the BACE1 genomic locus. We used sequence-tagged sites (STS) mapping techniques with four STSs to pinpoint the extent of genomic clone coverage for BACE1. Further analysis of the BAC Fingerprint Data Base (genome.wustl.edu/projects/human) and the genome survey sequence ([email protected]) data base revealed three BAC clones that localized to the BACE1 gene region, BACs 794I11 (GenBank™ accession no. AP000761), 677N11 (GenBank™ accession no. AC020997), and 407N16 (Fig. 1A). BAC 794I11 contains ∼45 kilobases upstream of the ATG start site for BACE1 and ∼99 kilobases downstream of the BACE1 poly(A) tail. BACs 677N11 and 407N16 contains ∼40 kilobases upstream of the 5′-end of BACE1. These BACs also contain ∼38 kilobases downstream of the 3′-end of BACE1 (shown in Fig. 1A). Thus, these three clones, which cover the entire BACE1 locus, were determined suitable to generate BACE1 transgenic mice. Expression and Activity of Human BACE1 in Mice—Upon pronuclear microinjection of each BACE1 BAC clone, we recovered at least one founder mouse for each clone (Fig. 1A). Each of these transgenic lines was analyzed for construct integration, copy number, and BACE1 expression levels. As our previous studies indicated that genomic-based transgenes exhibited copy number dependence (22Lamb B.T. Sisodia S.S. Lawler A.M. Slunt H.H. Kitt C.A. Kearns W.G. Pearson P.L. Price D.L. Gearhart J.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we chose to focus on transgenic line 794I11-3 in the current study as this line exhibited the highest copy number and level of BACE1 expression, as described below. To confirm the integrity of the BAC in PCR-positive animals for line 794I11-3, Southern blot hybridization with the human Alu repeat probe revealed that 794I11-3 transgenics exhibit an identical human-specific Alu profile to that of the purified BAC clone (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, Southern blot hybridization with a human BACE1 cDNA specific for the 3′-end of BACE1 revealed the expected 12.4-kbp band in animals transgenic for BAC794I11 when digested with BamHI (Fig. 1B). These results confirm BAC 794I11 has integrated intact in this transgenic line. The level of human BACE1 mRNA expression in transgenic line 794I11-3 was analyzed using an reverse transcriptase-PCR assay with conserved oligonucleotides that amplify both mouse and human BACE1 transcripts across exons 4–8. The resulting products were digested with a restriction enzyme that cleaves the mouse products and leaves the human products undigested. This RT-PCR analysis revealed the coexpression of mouse and human Bace1/BACE1 in multiple tissues including brain, pa"
https://openalex.org/W2038665119,"The phosphate group of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (E2-P) of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a) was studied with infrared spectroscopy to understand the high hydrolysis rate of E2-P. By monitoring an autocatalyzed isotope exchange reaction, three stretching vibrations of the transiently bound phosphate group were selectively observed against a background of 50,000 protein vibrations. They were found at 1194, 1137, and 1115 cm–1. This information was evaluated using the bond valence model and empirical correlations. Compared with the model compound acetyl phosphate, structure and charge distribution of the E2-P aspartyl phosphate resemble somewhat the transition state in a dissociative phosphate transfer reaction; the aspartyl phosphate of E2-P has 0.02 Å shorter terminal P–O bonds and a 0.09 Å longer bridging P–O bond that is ∼20% weaker, the angle between the terminal P–O bonds is wider, and –0.2 formal charges are shifted from the phosphate group to the aspartyl moiety. The weaker bridging P–O bond of E2-P accounts for a 1011–1015-fold hydrolysis rate enhancement, implying that P–O bond destabilization facilitates phosphoenzyme hydrolysis. P–O bond destabilization is caused by a shift of noncovalent interactions from the phosphate oxygens to the aspartyl oxygens. We suggest that the relative positioning of Mg2+ and Lys684 between phosphate and aspartyl oxygens controls the hydrolysis rate of the ATPase phosphoenzymes and related phosphoproteins.

We suggest that the relative positioning of Mg2+ and Lys684 between phosphate and aspartyl oxygens controls the hydrolysis rate of the ATPase phosphoenzymes and related phosphoproteins. Phosphorylation is one of the fundamental regulatory mechanisms in biology (1Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1997; 29: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It also governs the catalytic mechanism of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) (2Hasselbach W. Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar), where it controls the ordered sequence of catalytic steps to ensure the efficiency of the overall catalytic reaction. Here we study one of the ATPase phosphoenzyme intermediates by monitoring an enzyme-catalyzed isotopic exchange reaction at the phosphate group with infrared spectroscopy. The result is an infrared spectrum at “atomic resolution” in a crowded spectral region. It observes selectively the transiently bound phosphate group, a group that cannot be studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Our approach can be extended to other phosphoproteins and reveals here the molecular cause of an important property of the phosphoenzyme studied. The Ca2+-ATPase (2Hasselbach W. Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar) pumps two Ca2+ ions against a concentration gradient across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, which relaxes a flexed muscle (for reviews see Refs. 3Andersen J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Hasselbach W. Bonting S.L. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Membrane Transport.

The energy for this active transport process is provided by the substrate ATP, which phosphorylates the ATPase at Asp351 to form at least two consecutive phosphoenzymes, Ca2E1-P and E2-P. The Ca2+ transport step is associated with the conversion from Ca2E1-P to E2-P. These phosphoenzymes have different catalytic properties; while the first phosphoenzyme intermediate Ca2E1-P dephosphorylates with ADP to reform ATP, the second phosphoenzyme E2-P reacts with water. This switch of catalytic specificity ensures the efficiency of the pump process, because the specificity of Ca2E1-P is such that the energy provided by ATP is not wasted before Ca2+ is transported. After Ca2+ transport, E2-P hydrolyzes remarkably faster than the model compound acetyl phosphate in water. The time constant for E2-P hydrolysis is between 10 and 100 ms near 25 °C depending on the pH (9McIntosh D.B. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Vieyra A. Scofano H.M. Guimaraes-Motta H. Tume R.K. de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys.

Naturforsch. 1977; 32: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas that of acetyl phosphate is 105 s (25 °C, pH 6.8) (13Di Sabato G. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 4400-4405Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This 106–107-fold acceleration of the reaction by the enzyme is essential for the fast progression of the pump cycle and therefore for the efficient removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. Obviously, the environment of the phosphate group is important in controlling the dephosphorylation properties. It has been found to become more hydrophobic in the transition from Ca2E1-P to E2-P (14De Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4253-4261Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Dupont Y. Pougeois R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and this seems to account for an increased hydrolysis rate of E2-P as compared with Ca2E1-P (Ref. 16De Meis L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 17De Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of dephosphorylation has, however, not been elucidated. We were interested in how the environment of the phosphate group controls its catalytic properties and used infrared spectroscopy to study the phosphate group of E2-P in detail. Infrared spectroscopy has proved valuable for the investigation of protein catalysis (18Zscherp C. Barth A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Wharton C.W. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Mäntele W. Trends Biochem.

Biophys. 2002; 35: 369-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar) because it allows measurement of interaction strengths and bond lengths at a level of sensitivity that exceeds even that of x-ray crystallography and NMR (25Deng H. Callender R. Gremlich H.U. Yan B. Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy of Biological Materials. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2001: 477-515Google Scholar). Since the early days of infrared spectroscopy on proteins, the power of selective isotopic labeling has been exploited to observe a specific group in a large protein (26Belasco J.G. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Alben J.O. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because of the mass effect on vibrational frequencies, infrared absorption bands of a labeled group are shifted with respect to those of the unlabeled group and can be identified in the spectrum. Specific labeling is usually necessary to identify a specific group in the spectrum, because otherwise the absorption of this group will be hidden under the overwhelming absorption of other groups. For the investigation of protein reactions, another necessity in most cases is the use of reaction-induced infrared difference spectroscopy, where the reaction of interest is started in the infrared cuvette. We release a biological compound of interest from a biologically inactive photosensitive precursor (caged compounds), for example ATP from caged ATP 1The abbreviations used are: caged ATP, P3-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ATP; vu, valence unit(s). (Ref. 28Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 29Barth A. Zscherp C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By calculating the difference between the infrared absorption before and after start of the reaction, only those groups are detected that participate actively; the absorption of the vast majority of passive groups cancels. Here we combine and extend both approaches to observe selectively the phosphate group of E2-P; [γ-18O3]ATP released from [γ-18O3]caged ATP transfers the labeled γ-phosphate to the ATPase, which then accumulates a labeled E2-P phosphoenzyme under appropriate experimental conditions. This phosphoenzyme catalyzes an isotopic exchange with water at the phosphate oxygens (9McIntosh D.B. Boyer P.D.

This approach has proved to be of limited sensitivity for detecting the E2-P phosphate vibrations (36Barth A. Biopolymers. 2002; 67: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The approach here is to combine selective labeling of a protein with the induction of an autocatalyzed isotopic exchange (36Barth A. Biopolymers. 2002; 67: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus we obtain directly a difference spectrum between labeled and unlabeled E2-P in a single time-resolved experiment. We observe selectively three stretching vibrations of the phosphate group of a protein with nearly 50,000 normal modes of vibration. The vibrational frequencies identified reveal a shift of electron density from the P–O bond that connects protein and phosphate to the terminal P–O bonds. This weakens the link to the protein and accelerates hydrolysis of E2-P. The approach used here to study one of the Ca2+-ATPase phosphoenzymes can be extended to other phosphoenzymes, if necessary with the help of auxiliary proteins to induce phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. Time-resolved Fourier transform infrared measurements were performed at 10 °C, and the samples were prepared as described previously (37Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

All of the spectra were normalized to an identical protein concentration using the amide II absorbance (31Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Correlation of Vibrational Frequency with Bond Valence—Deng et al. (38Deng H. Wang J. Callender R. Ray W.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 1022: 3617-3623Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have defined a fundamental frequency for the stretching vibration for phosphates, which for PO32− is ν=[(νs2+2νas2)/3]12, with νs and νas being the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the terminal P–O bonds, respectively. The frequency of the asymmetric stretching vibration is weighted by a factor of 2 because this vibration is doubly degenerate. The fundamental frequency is less dependent on the geometry of the phosphate group than the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the terminal P–O bonds themselves (38Deng H. Wang J. Callender R. Ray W.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 1022: 3617-3623Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We slightly extend the approach by Deng et al. to phosphate groups in asymmetric environments by defining the fundamental frequency as follows: ν=[(ν12+ν22+ν32)/3]12 where ν1, ν2, and ν3 are the frequencies of the terminal P–O bonds that we have observed for the E2-P phosphoenzyme. In this equation three different frequencies appear for the three terminal P–O vibrations because the degeneracy of the asymmetric stretching vibrations is lifted by the asymmetric environment of the E2-P phosphate group. The fundamental frequency can be used to calculate the bond valence of P–O bonds using the following formula (38Deng H. Wang J. Callender R. Ray W.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 1022: 3617-3623Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar),s=[0.175×ln(224500cm−1/ν˜)]−4.29(Eq. 1) where s is the bond valence in vu, and ν is the wavenumber that corresponds to the fundamental frequency. In our case, where the phosphate group is in an asymmetric environment, the bond valence s represents the average bond valence of the three terminal P–O bonds. The bond valence of the bridging P–O bond was calculated by subtracting the summed bond valences of the terminal P–O bonds from 5, the atomic valence of phosphorus. The average bond valence of external bonds (noncovalent bonds to the environment) to the terminal phosphate oxygens was calculated by subtracting the average bond valence of the terminal P–O bonds from 2, the atomic valence of oxygen. Correlation of Bond Valence with Bond Length—Bond valences can be derived from bond lengths in such a way that they sum up to the atomic valence within a few percentages (39Brown I.D. Shannon R.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1973; 29: 266-282Crossref Scopus (1326) Google Scholar) for a large number of oxides. We used Equation 2 (40Brown I.D. The Chemical Bond in Inorganic Chemistry: The Bond Valence Model. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002Google Scholar) with the parameters (41Brown I.D. Wu K.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct.

B. 1998; 1022: 3617-3623Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar),s=L1N/LsN(Eq. 2) where s is the bond valence measured in vu, Ls is the bond length of a bond with bond valence s, and L1 is the bond length of a bond with a bond valence of 1 vu. L1 and N are constants for a given type of bond (39Brown I.D. Shannon R.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1973; 29: 266-282Crossref Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 41Brown I.D. Wu K.K. Acta Crystallogr.

Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This work also established a marker band for E2-P near 1194 cm–1 that was later assigned to the phosphate group (32Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22170-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present work, sample conditions and temperature were fine-tuned so that the E2-P concentration is constant over several minutes. During that time the ATPase dephosphorylates and rephosphorylates several times leading to oxygen exchange between water and phosphate group (30Kanazawa T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3163-3172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If water and phosphate oxygen isotopes are different, an isotope exchange at the E2-P phosphate group is the consequence of oxygen exchange that can be followed by infrared spectroscopy (36Barth A. Biopolymers. 2002; 67: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Several isotope exchange experiments were performed using [γ-16O3]caged ATP in [18O]water, [γ-18O3]caged ATP in [16O]water, [γ-18O1]caged ATP in [16O]water, and [γ-18O1]caged ATP in [18O]water. Control samples contained [γ-16O3]caged ATP in [16O]water or [γ-18O3]caged ATP in [18O]water. Fig. 1 shows infrared difference spectra of E2-P formation from Ca2E1 (Ca2E1 → E2-P) in which the E2-P spectrum was recorded before and after isotope exchange. The bold line spectra were recorded before isotope exchange, and the thin line spectra were recorded afterward. The spectra overlap well above 1300 cm–1 where phosphates do not absorb, which confirms that the E2-P concentration is constant during the experiment. Below 1300 cm–1, spectra before and after exchange differ because of band shifts that are the result of the isotope exchange reaction. The spectra in Fig. 1a were obtained with unlabeled caged ATP in [18O]H2O, and the first, bold spectrum is characteristic of [16O3]E2-P as indicated by the marker band at 1194 cm–1 (32Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22170-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Within 3 min, this band decays because of isotope exchange at the phosphate group, and the thin line spectrum is obtained. The absorbance changes associated with isotope exchange are very small. This is expected because they are caused by frequency shifts of the terminal P–O stretching vibrations which account for 3 vibrations of 50,000 protein vibrations. The isotope exchange experiment shown in Fig. 1b was carried out in the reverse direction; the ATPase was phosphorylated with [γ-18O3]caged ATP, which produced [18O3]E2-P first and [16O3]E2-P after oxygen exchange with [16O]H2O. Consequently the first spectrum (bold line) shows only a small signal at 1194 cm–1, which has increased in the thin line spectrum after isotope exchange. The comparison of the spectra in panels a and b of Fig. 1 demonstrate the excellent reproducibility of the infrared difference spectra. To show the isotope exchange associated absorbance changes more clearly, the bold and thin line spectra of Fig. 1 were subtracted. The spectra obtained are shown in Fig. 2 and are named isotope exchange spectra. Fig. 2a shows the 16O3 → 18O3 exchange spectrum, with positive bands being caused by [18O3]E2-P and negative bands being caused by [16O3]E2-P. The featureless spectrum above 1300 cm–1 demonstrates again that the E2-P concentration is constant to a very high degree in this experiment. In addition to bands caused by isotope exchange, other reactions might contribute to the spectrum. To distinguish these bands from isotope exchange bands, the exchange experiment was performed in the reverse direction (18O3 → 16O3), which should lead to a mirror image spectrum when compared with that in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows two of these 18O3 → 16O3 exchange spectra. As expected for the isotope exchange spectrum, bands appear at the same positions as in Fig. 2a but with the opposite sign. The spectra show also bands caused by the slow steady state hydrolysis of ATP near 1250 and 1060 cm–1 (28Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis rate is sensitive to the concentration of Me2SO, which is difficult to control precisely during the preparation of infrared samples. Therefore the hydrolysis rate varied between experiments. The bold line spectrum is the average of all experiments, and the thin line spectrum is the average of experiments with slow hydrolysis. A weighted subtraction of the spectrum of all samples from the spectrum of samples with slow hydrolysis was calculated to subtract the hydrolysis bands from the exchange spectrum (data not shown). The criterion for appropriate subtraction was a flat spectrum around 1250 cm–1 where a strong hydrolysis band is observed. This correction did not abolish the sharp bands between 1200 and 1090 cm–1, which shows that they are not associated with hydrolysis. However, the subtraction reduced the relative amplitudes of the bands below 1105 cm–1. Before discussing the spectra in more detail, further controls are shown in Fig. 2c. Fig. 2c shows several control spectra. For the two full line spectra no isotope exchange is expected because the isotopes of γ-phosphate of ATP and water are the same (18O in the thin line spectrum and 16O in the bold line spectrum). The dashed line spectrum shows an experiment where the ATPase was inhibited by the addition of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. These spectra demonstrate that the sharp bands between 1200 and 1090 cm–1 in Fig. 2 (a and b) are only observed when the isotopes of γ-phosphate of ATP and water are different and when the ATPase is active. Therefore bands with opposite signs in Fig. 2 (a and b) are attributed to isotope exchange at the phosphate oxygens of E2-P. These bands are easily identified in Fig. 2d where the isotope exchange spectrum of Fig. 2a and that with slow hydrolysis of Fig. 2b are shown. The comparison highlights the mirror image property of the two spectra in the region between 1200 and 1090 cm–1. The mirror image property is not perfect for the amplitudes of positive bands at 1159 and 1091 cm–1 in the bold line spectrum. Correction for hydrolysis of the 18O3 → 16O3 exchange spectrum as discussed above improved the mirror image property by reducing slightly the amplitude of the 1091 cm–1 band. However, we prefer to show the original data here. Another reason for the small deviation from the ideal mirror image property could be incomplete isotope exchange in one of the spectra. We think that isotope exchange is complete for the 18O3 → 16O3 exchange as discussed below. However, it might not be complete for the 16O3 → 18O3 exchange. In these samples, the flat spectrum around 1250 cm–1 indicates very slow steady state hydrolysis of ATP. Therefore, E2-P was more stable in these samples than in samples for the 18O3 → 16O3 exchange with the possible consequence that isotope exchange is not complete during the observation time. To improve further the quality of the exchange spectrum, the two spectra in Fig. 2d were subtracted and divided by two. This cancels contributions to the spectrum that are unrelated to isotope exchange and enhances those related to isotope exchange. The resulting spectrum is shown in Fig. 2e. Negative bands in this spectrum are due to [16O3]E2-P and are found at 1194, 1137, and 1115 cm–1. Identification of [18O3]E2-P bands is less clear because positive bands are less prominent. The largest positive bands are observed at 1157 and 1091 cm–1. We propose that upon 16O3 → 18O3 exchange the band at 1194 cm–1 shifts to 1157 cm–1 and that at 1115 cm–1 shifts to 1091 cm–1. The band at 1137 cm–1 likely shifts to around 1115 cm–1 where it partially cancels the [16O3]E2-P band, which explains the small amplitude of the 1115 cm–1 band compared with the other two [16O3]E2-P bands. Small bands in the spectrum can be caused by substrates of E2-P or by a small percentage of Ca2E1-P. As a further test for the robustness of our isotope exchange spectrum, we conducted experiments with singly labeled caged ATP, [γ-18O1]caged ATP, which are shown in Fig. 3a. The bold line shows the experiment in [16O]water reflecting 18O116O2 → 16O3 exchange (absorbance of [16O3]E2-P minus that of [18O116O2]E2-P), and the thin line shows the experiment in [18O]water reflecting 18O116O2 → 18O3 exchange (absorbance of [18O]E2-P minus that of [18O116O2]E2-P). A discussion of the individual band shifts in the spectra of Fig. 3a is beyond the scope of this work. One band, however, is worth mentioning here. Near 1195 cm–1, a relatively large positive band is observed in the bold line spectrum but only a small band in the thin line spectrum. This indicates that the amplitude of this band is relatively large for [16O3]E2-P but small for [18O116 O2]E2-P, which therefore can be used as a marker band for complete exchange in an 18O3 → 16O3 exchange experiment. The large amplitude of this band in the thin line spectrum of Fig. 2d demonstrates that 18O3 → 16O3 exchange is complete or close to complete in this experiment. The spectra for partial isotope exchange can be used to mathematically obtain a second spectrum for full exchange. By subtracting the two spectra, the contribution of [18O116O2]E2-P cancels, and the absorbance of [18O3]E2-P minus that of [16O3]E2-P is obtained. This spectrum is shown as a thin line in Fig. 3b and compared with the experimental spectrum for full 16O3 → 18O3 exchange from Fig. 2e. The match between these spectra is very good and confirms the above attribution of bands to isotope exchange. The spectral positions of the phosphate bands are unaffected by the presence of Me2SO in our samples; band positions in isotope exchange spectra were the same for 10–30% Me2SO. In experiments not designed to monitor isotope exchange, the 1194 cm–1 band was observed at the same position in the presence and absence of Me2SO in spectra like those shown in Fig. 1. Infrared Bands of the E2-P Phosphate Group—Three bands of the E2-P phosphate group have been identified: those at 1194, 1137, and 1115 cm–1. They are associated with the P–O stretching vibrations of the PO3 moiety. The spectral positions of the phosphate bands are different from those of the model substance acetyl phosphate in water, which shows only two bands at lower wavenumbers: that of the symmetric stretching vibration at 983 cm–1 and that of the degenerated asymmetric vibration at 1132 cm–1. The observation of three bands for E2-P is due to an asymmetric environment around the phosphate group that lifts the degeneracy. The band at 1194 cm–1 has been identified before as a phosphate band (32Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22170-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by comparing spectra obtained with labeled and unlabeled caged ATP.

The synthesis takes place mainly in the liver and, in humans, the α-1-m gene has been mapped to chromosome 9 in a region where other lipocalin genes are clustered (4Kaumeyer J.F. Polazzi J.O.

As for all other species, it encodes also bikunin, the light chain of a plasma proteinase inhibitor family (7Lindqvist A. Rouet P. Salier J.P. Akerstrom B. Gene. 1999; 234: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the precursor polypeptide chain contains an internal basic tripeptide recognized by a specific endoprotease. The cleavage occurs in the Golgi apparatus before secretion and, so far, no functional correlation between the lipocalin and bikunin has been found. α-1-m is then catabolized in the proximal tubule cells of the kidneys, and its concentration increases in urines of patients with renal failure (8Mendez E. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Grubb A. Leyva-Cobian F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1472-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The protein has thus been recognized as a very sensitive marker for proximal tubular dysfunction (9Grubb A. Clin. Nephrol. 1992; 38: S20-S27PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its relative abundance in the urines of hemodialyzed patients, the majority of the structural and biochemical studies (reviewed in Ref. 10Akerstrom B. Logdberg L. Berggard T. Osmark P. Lindqvist A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 172-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have been carried out using the protein isolated from this source. The molecule has unique features that, so far, remain unexplained: it has a strong tendency to bind to other proteins, which results in the formation of complexes that are too large allow removal from the circulation via glomerular filtration. Furthermore, it carries a set of covalently linked chromophores that give it a peculiar yellow-brown color, fluorescence properties, and both charge and size heterogeneity. Although the nature of the bound compound has not been established, the single free cysteine (11Escribano J. Grubb A. Calero M. Mendez E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15758-15763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and three lysines (12Berggard T. Cohen A. Persson P. Lindqvist A. Cedervall T. Silow M. Thogersen I.B. Jonsson J.A.

In a previous study we isolated α-1-microglobulin from amniotic fluid (5Amoresano A. Minchiotti L. Cosulich M.E. Campagnoli M. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Gianazza E. Galliano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and observed that its light yellow color was not more intense than that of the other proteins from the same source, which suggested the presence of a lower degree of chromophore modification with respect to the urinary protein. We therefore decided to examine the possibility that the intense coloration, and related properties, of the urinary protein might be associated with uremia, a condition in which a great number of endogenous metabolites that are ordinarily excreted in urine accumulate in blood. Among these are the products of tryptophan metabolism that occur via the kynurenine pathway. Several recent reports have shown that the degradation of tryptophan is altered in patients with chronic renal failure and that there is an increased level of kynurenine (Kyn) that is further converted into a series of compounds with neurotoxic properties (13Pawlak D. Pawlak K. Malyszko J. Mysliwiec M. Buczko W. Int. Urol. Nephrol. 2001; 33: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Kyn and its derivatives are also present in the lens (14Truscott R.J.

The modification involves histidine, lysine, and, to a lesser extent, cysteine residues and appears to play a role in cataract formation. In addition, the binding of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-OHKyn) oxidation products is accompanied by aggregation and the formation of higher molecular weight species (16Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11455-11464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present work we show that 3-OHKyn and its autoxidation products form covalent adducts with human α-1-m and that the modification, affecting more extensively the protein isolated from the urine of patients with renal failure, accounts for the peculiar optical properties as well as for the charge and size heterogeneity of the lipocalin. Materials and Methods—Amino acid derivatives (N-α-t-Boc-l-histidine, N-α-t-Boc-l-lysine, and N-α-t-Boc-l-cysteine) were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem AG. 3-Hydroxykynurenine and l-kynurenine sulfate were from Sigma. All organic solvents and acids were HPLC grade, and Milli Q water was used in the preparation of HPLC solutions. All other chemicals were of analytical quality. Protein Purification—α-1-Microglobulin was isolated from the urines (2 liters) of hemodialyzed patients as previously described (5Amoresano A. Minchiotti L. Cosulich M.E. Campagnoli M. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Gianazza E. Galliano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Human amniotic fluid was obtained from discarded amniocentesis samples collected in the weeks 16–18. The pooled fluid (3 liters) was saturated to 80% with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitated proteins, after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h, were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, dialyzed against the same buffer and fractionated by gel filtration on a 4 × 100 cm Sephadex G100 column. Proteins eluting after the albumin peak were pooled, equilibrated in 6.25 mm Bis-Tris-propane, pH 7.5, and separated on a 2.6 × 30 cm high performance Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer (buffer A) and connected to an Äkta Purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). The elution was performed with a 375-min linear gradient from 0 to 100% of 6.25 mm Bis-Tris-propane, pH 9.5, 350 mm NaCl (buffer B), and monitored at 280 and 360 nm. The α-1-microglobulin-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and submitted to gel filtration on a Superdex G-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The preparations from urine and amniotic fluid yielded 90 and 8 mg, respectively. Human albumin was isolated from fresh serum (17Galliano M. Minchiotti L. Porta F. Rossi A. Ferri G. Madison J. Watkins S. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8721-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The homogeneity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing and non-reducing conditions and by N-terminal sequence determination in a Hewlett-Packard model G 1000 A sequencer (Centro Grandi Strumenti, University of Pavia). Gel Electrophoresis—Isoelectric focusing was performed using the immobilized pH gradient system (18Gianazza E. Astrua-Testori S. Giacon P. Righetti P.G. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 332-339Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) on laboratory-made polyacrylamide gels cast on GelBond with a 4–7 linear pH gradient obtained with acrylamido buffer solutions (Fluka). The gel was rehydrated in 8 m urea containing 0.5% carrier ampholites in the pH range 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences), and the separation was run in the Multiphor II horizontal system (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was performed as reported by Laemmli (19Laemli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using a Mini PROTEAN II Cell (Bio-Rad). UV-visible and Fluorescence Spectra—UV-visible spectra were acquired on a Shimadzu UV 1601 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a LS 50 PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 390 nm, and the fluorescence was measured between 400 and 650 nm with a scan rate of 100 nm/min and 3 accumulations. Excitation and emission slits were set to 5 nm. Samples were equilibrated in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Modification of Amniotic Fluid α-1-m and HSA with Kyn and 3-OH-Kyn—Amniotic fluid α-1-m and human serum albumin (HSA) were treated with Kyn according to Garner et al. (20Garner B. Shaw D.C. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To 3 mg of the proteins, suspended in 2 ml of 25 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, 2.2 mm l-kynurenine sulfate salt was added, and the mixture was allowed to react in the dark for 48 h at 37 °C under argon. The same protocol was used for the reaction with 3-OHKyn except that the incubation was made under oxygen for 5 days to allow the formation of the autoxidative products (16Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11455-11464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After incubation unreacted material was eliminated by gel filtration on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Preparation of Standard Adducts—The amino acid adducts were prepared by reacting N-α-t-Boc-l-lysine, N-α-t-Boc-l-histidine, and N-α-t-Boc-l-cysteine with l-kynurenine according to Vazquez et al. (15Vazquez S. Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Jamie J.F. Sheil M.M. Truscott R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4867-4873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The derivatives were deprotected and separated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a Vydac C18 column equilibrated in 4 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5 (solvent A), and resolved with a linear gradient 0–50% of solvent B (80% acetonitrile/H2O, 4 mm ammonium acetate). Individual peaks were collected and lyophilized. Aliquots were then dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and submitted to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) of lysylkynurenine (Lys-Kyn), at m/z 338 [M+H]+, yielded ion fragments at m/z 209, 203, 192, 147, and 128. ESI-MS/MS of histidylkynurenine (His-Kyn), of m/z 347 [M+H]+, yielded ion fragments at m/z 192, 174, and 156. Using the same protocol the protected amino acids were reacted with 3-OHKyn, and the adducts were separated by RP-HPLC and submitted to ESI-MS/MS. Acid Hydrolysis—The proteins (3 mg) were hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl for 24 h at 110 °C in evacuated hydrolysis tube and lyophilized. Samples were then dissolved in 400 μl of 4 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, and, after the pH was adjusted to 6.5 with 0.5 m NaOH, resolved by RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column as described for the standard amino acid adducts. The elution was monitored at 360 nm, and the colored peaks were manually collected and lyophilized. For LC-ESI/MS analyses, lyophilized samples were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were obtained using an LCQ DECA ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source and controlled by Xcalibur software 1.3 (Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Experiments were carried out in positive ion mode under constant instrumental conditions: source voltage 4.5 kV, capillary voltage –20 V, capillary temperature 200 °C, tube lens voltage –5 V. The system was run in automated LC-MS mode, and the HPLC used was a Surveyor LC system (Thermo-Finnigan) equipped with a Waters Simmetry300™ C18, 3.5 mm, 2.1 × 100 mm column. Samples (20 μl) were applied at an injection speed of 8 μl/s and resolved by means of a 0–50% linear 100-min gradient using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water as solvent A and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as solvent B. External calibration of the mass scale was achieved by injection of caffeine (m/z 195), MRFA tetrapeptide (m/z 524), and Ultramark (m/z 1022, 1122, 1222, 1322, 1422, 1522, 1622, 1722, and 1822). Mass spectra were acquired in the m/z range of 300–1000 atomic mass units by scanning the magnetic field in 200 ms. MS/MS spectra were obtained by collision-induced dissociation; studies in the ion trap were performed with an isolation width of 3 Thomson (m/z), the activation amplitude was around 35% of ejection radio frequency amplitude that corresponds to 1.58 V. Electrophoretic and Optical Properties of Amniotic Fluid and Urinary α-1-m—α-1-Microglobulin was isolated from urines of hemodialyzed patients and from amniotic fluid and was found to be homogeneous on the basis of the N-terminal sequence determination and SDS-PAGE analysis, which showed the presence of a 30-kDa band (Fig. 1). However, after prolonged storage, the urinary protein showed a marked propensity to form SDS-resistant dimers and higher order oligomers while the amniotic fluid form remained unchanged (data not shown). Dimers of the urinary protein (Fig. 1, lane 2) become evident almost immediately after the last gel filtration purification step in Tris-HCl buffer 20 mm, pH 8.0, whereas oligomer formation was observed only after several months of storage in the same buffer (Fig. 1, lane 3). The isoelectric focusing patterns (Fig. 2) display several discrete bands in the range between pH 4.0 and 5.4 in agreement with the well known charge heterogeneity of the protein that, in earlier reports, was named “HC,” the acronym meaning “heterogeneous in charge.” However, the smear of the sample toward the anode, which was yellow-brown in the gel before staining, could only be noticed in the urinary protein pattern (Fig. 2, lane 1). We have previously reported that the presence of a highly heterogeneous mixture of differently branched glycans and the existence of three different polypeptide chains, due to varying degrees of proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus, contribute to the extensive charge heterogeneity of these proteins (5Amoresano A. Minchiotti L. Cosulich M.E. Campagnoli M. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Gianazza E. Galliano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the bands focusing in the anodic side of the gel, which were almost absent in the amniotic fluid form (Fig. 2, lane 2), appeared to be correlated with the degree of coloration of the urinary protein. The UV-visible spectrum of the yellow-brown protein isolated from urine displays the characteristic broad absorbance band in the visible region between 300 and 600 nm. When analyzed in detail, the spectrum of a concentrated solution (10 mg/ml) of the protein shows the presence of shoulders, approximately at 350, 420, and 490 nm (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence spectrum of urinary α-1-m exhibited a maximum emission intensity at 455 nm (Fig. 4, line 2), whereas the amniotic fluid counterpart had a lower absorbance at 360 nm, almost none above 450 nm (Fig. 3B, line1), and an emission spectrum with the same shape but a lower intensity (Fig. 4, line 1). The relative amount of bound chromophore was estimated by measuring the ratio between the absorbance at 360 and 280 nm. The value of 0.48 was obtained for the urinary protein and of 0.21 for the amniotic fluid counterpart. These results indicate that, although the optical and electrophoretic properties of the two proteins share common features, the lipocalin from the urine of hemodialyzed patients contains greater quantities and more heterogeneous forms of the covalently linked compound. In addition, the optical properties of the unknown chromophore are similar to those of kynurenine derivatives (21Vazquez S. Garner B. Sheil M.M. Truscott R.J. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 32: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar): the main products of tryptophan metabolism, whose concentration is found increased in the plasma, and tissues of patients with renal failure (13Pawlak D.

The latter has been shown to undergo autoxidation resulting in the formation of hydroxanthommatin (HXan) (with maxima at 450 and 490 nm), xanthommatin (Xan) (maximum at 436 nm) (Fig. 5) and 4,6-dihydroxyquinolinequinone carboxylic acid (maxima at 350 and 460 nm) as predominant species (21Vazquez S.

Binding to proteins produces an enhancement of the fluorescence yield and a blue shift in the band position of the emission spectrum of ∼20 nm (24Churchich J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 285: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Absorption spectra of native and modified α-1-microglobulin.

It is known that deamination of the amino acid side chain of Kyn yields an unsaturated ketone that is susceptible to attack by nucleophilic amino acids, such as His, Lys, and Cys and that the process is favored when the pH is increased to 9.5 (25Hood B.D. Garner B. Truscott R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The amniotic fluid α-1-m was treated with Kyn in carbonate buffer at pH 9.5 (15Vazquez S. Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Jamie J.F. Sheil M.M. Truscott R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4867-4873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and, after gel filtration at pH 7.0, the modification was verified following the optical properties of the adduct. The UV-visible spectrum of α-1-m shows that, following incubation, a more pronounced absorption maximum appears at 360 nm (Fig. 3B, line 2) and that the fluorescence intensity is increased, with a maximum emission at 457 nm (Fig. 4, line 3). The reaction with Kyn was carried out, under the same conditions, on a control sample of human albumin. The HSA-Kyn adduct became light yellow and acquired the same optical properties observed for the modified lipocalin (data not shown). These results show that amniotic α-1-microglobulin, as well as HSA, reacts with Kyn. The reaction promoted an enhancement of the fluorescence emitted by the amniotic fluid protein but the band position remained invariant and very close to that of the protein isolated from the urine of hemodialyzed patients. The UV-visible spectrum of the latter, which is considerably more complex, compared with that of the modified amniotic fluid protein, indicates the presence of a set of Kyn-derived chromophores. It has been shown that kynurenine adducts with His, Lys, and, to a lesser extent, with Cys residues are stable under the conditions used for total hydrolysis of proteins and can be analyzed by RP-HPLC following the absorbance at 360 nm (15Vazquez S. Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Jamie J.F. Sheil M.M. Truscott R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4867-4873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Aliquots (3 mg) of amniotic α-1-m and of HSA were subjected to acid hydrolysis prior and after incubation with Kyn (Mr 208), and the hydrolysates were analyzed by RP-HPLC and LC-ESI/MS. Reference standard adducts of His, Lys, and Cys were prepared according to Vazquez et al. (15Vazquez S. Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Jamie J.F. Sheil M.M. Truscott R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4867-4873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and examined by RP-HPLC and LC-ESI/MS to facilitate their identification in the protein samples. The HPLC traces showed the absence of any colored peak in the hydrolysate of native HSA (Fig. 6A, line a), whereas some minor peaks absorbing at 360 nm were present in the hydrolysate of the native amniotic α-1-m (Fig. 6C). After treatment with Kyn a major colored peak, corresponding to Lys-Kyn derivative, and a second, less intense, eluting as His-Kyn derivative, were found in both samples (data not sown). The hydrolysates were then examined by LC-MS and correlation between the absorbance at 360 nm (Fig. 7A), and the extracted ion currents for the protonated molecular ions confirmed their identification as the Lys-Kyn (m/z 338) and the His-Kyn (m/z 347) derivatives. The ESI-MS/MS spectra of the adducts showed the presence of the expected ion fragments. Elimination of the imine side chain of deaminated kynurenine bound to a Lys residue, according to its major decomposition pathway (26Vazquez S. Truscott R.J. O'Hair R.A. Weimann A. Sheil M.M. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2001; 12: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), explains the presence of the ion at m/z 203 (Fig. 7B) and confirms the site of the covalent attachment (15Vazquez S.

These results establish that, following reaction with Kyn, the Lys and His residues of amniotic α-1-m and of HSA form colored adducts that can be identified after acid hydrolysis by HPLC monitoring of the absorbance at 360 nm. No such absorbance is present in the hydrolysate of native human serum albumin that can thus be used as a reference to monitor the modification. The relative amount of the modified amino acids in the hydrolysates reflects the residue abundance in the proteins. The low stability of the adduct and the presence of only one free Cys in the sequence of both α-1-m and albumin account for the undetectability of such adduct.Fig. 7LC/MS analysis of amniotic fluid α-1-microglobulin incubated with Kyn and submitted to acid hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2064476297,"In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which a peptide mimicking the third cytoplasmic loop of the vasopressin V2 receptor inhibits signaling. This loop was synthesized as a cyclic peptide (i3 cyc) that adopted defined secondary structure in solution. We found that i3 cyc inhibited the adenylyl cyclase activity induced by vasopressin or a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate. This peptide also affected the specific binding of [3H]AVP by converting vasopressin binding sites from a high to a low affinity state without any effect on the global maximal binding capacity. The inhibitory actions of i3 cyc could also be observed in the presence of maximally uncoupling concentration of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate, indicating a direct effect on the receptor itself and not exclusively on the interaction between the Gs protein and the V2 receptor (V2-R). Bioluminescence resonance energy-transfer experiments confirmed this assumption, because i3 cyc induced a significant inhibition of the bioluminescence resonance energy-transfer signal between the Renilla reniformis luciferase and the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein fused V2-R. This suggests that the proper arrangement of the dimer could be an important prerequisite for triggering Gs protein activation. In addition to its effect on the receptor itself, the peptide exerted some of its actions at the G protein level, because it could also inhibit guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate-stimulated AC activity. Taken together, the data demonstrate that a peptide mimicking V2-R third intracellular loop affects both the dimeric structural organization of the receptor and has direct inhibitory action on Gs.

These receptors promote ligand dependent GDP/GTP exchange in the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein leading to the activation of effectors. It is well established that intracellular loops of these receptors are important structural elements for their coupling to the heterotrimeric G proteins (1Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Yet the precise understanding of the mechanisms by which GPCRs regulate G protein activity remains limited because of the general difficulties in characterizing the structure of integral membrane proteins. One approach considered to circumvent these problems is the use of synthetic peptides mimicking receptor cytosolic domains to probe the events responsible for G protein activation. For the rat vasopressin V1a receptor, a peptide mimicking its second intracellular loop was found to specifically inhibit vasopressin-specific binding (2Demene H. Granier S. Muller D. Guillon G. Dufour M.N. Delsuc M.A. Hibert M. Pascal R. Mendre C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8204-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In other cases, short peptides mimicking GPCR third intracellular loops were found to act on the coupling between the receptor and the G protein (3Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G.

Kendall H. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inhibitory actions observed in most studies, Okamoto and colleagues showed that a soluble peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of the human β2-adrenergic receptor third cytoplasmic loop activated the Gs protein in cell-free conditions (10Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Inagaki M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1991; 67: 723-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Palmitoylated peptides (called pepducins) derived from the third cytoplasmic loop of the protease-activated receptors were recently found to target the receptor-G protein interface to either stimulate or inhibit G proteins (11Covic L. Gresser A.L. Talavera J. Swift S. Kuliopulos A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although it is generally assumed that these peptides function by competitively inhibiting or mimicking the interactions between the receptor and their cognate G proteins, their precise mechanism of action remains unknown. Expressed in the kidney and belonging to the GPCR family, the V2 vasopressin receptors (V2-R) are involved in the antidiuretic response by promoting water reabsorption. These receptors are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC) via Gαs and thus promote cAMP production (12Orloff J. Handler J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1962; 41: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies involving mutational and/or chimeric approaches provided considerable insight into the structural elements involved in receptor/G protein interactions. For instance, Erlenbach and Wess (13Erlenbach I. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26549-26558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) provided evidence for the importance of the V2-R third intracellular loop for coupling to Gs and consequently for AC activation. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that GPCRs exist and function as dimeric entities (14Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 15Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Infrared-laser atomic-force microscopy studies have revealed that the native arrangement of rhodopsin in mouse disc membranes is formed of paracrystalline arrays of dimers (16Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Moreover, Banères et al. (17Baneres J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) have established that one heterotrimeric Gαβγ protein interacts with one leukotriene B4 receptor (BLT1) dimer to form a pentameric complex and suggested that receptor dimerization could be crucial for signal transduction. The functional importance of GPCR dimerization is also supported by studies carried out with chimera receptors able to complement each other, suggesting the existence of both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in GPCRs (18Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). When considering the specific case of V2-R, Zhu and Wess pointed out that N-terminal V2-R fragments were able to display dominant-negative effects on the wild-type V2-R activity as a result of their heterodimerization with the full-length V2-R (19Zhu X. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15773-15784Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). More recently, Terrillon et al. (20Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) confirmed by bioluminescence resonance energy-transfer (BRET) experiments that these intermolecular interactions truly reflected V2-R homo-dimerization occurring in living cells. A previous study showed that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the TM6 of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) could inhibit the receptor function by preventing its dimerization (21Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Maggio et al. (22Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) also proposed that the muscarinic receptor dimerization might depend on the presence of a long third intracellular loop. Taken together, these observations suggest that in addition to interfering directly with receptor-G protein coupling, small peptides derived from GPCR transmembrane domains or the third cytoplasmic loop could also affect the receptor dimerization process or proper dimer arrangement. To better understand the mechanism of action of such peptides, we synthesized a cyclic peptide mimicking the V2-R third intracellular loop (i3 cyc) and tested its functional properties. We found that the i3 cyc peptide could inhibit receptor signaling at least in part by interfering with V2-R dimer structural organization. Fmoc-Rink amide and pseudo-proline dipeptide building blocks were obtained from NovaBiochem (Laüfelfingen, Switzerland). Tritiated [Arg8]-vasopressin (60 Ci/mmol) ([3H]AVP) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences. [Arg8]-vasopressin was obtained from Bachem. [125I]CGP64213 was synthesized from ethyl-(1,1-diethoxy-ethyl) phosphonate as described elsewhere (23Froestl W. Mickel S.J. von Sprecher G. Diel P.J. Hall R.G. Maier L. Strub D. Melillo V. Baumann P.A. Bernasconi R. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3313-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and labeled to a specific radioactivity of >2000 Ci/mmol (ANAWA AG, Wangen, Switzerland). [125I](–)-Iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP), [α-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol), and [3H]cAMP (32 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. To mimic the constraints imposed by transmembrane helices, we synthesized the third intracellular loop of the rat V2-R under a cyclic form (i3 cyc). We chose the sequence corresponding to Gln225–Leu274. These residues putatively correspond to a close contact (an 8.5-Å distance was evaluated between Cα atoms) and to an orientation compatible with side-chain to side-chain cyclization. We also synthesized the linear peptide i3 lin, which corresponds to the open chain form of the i3 cyc peptide. Two other peptides were used to rule out the possibilities of nonspecific or artifactual effects of i3 cyc: the cyclic peptide i2 (i2 cyc) and the i3 linear peptide (i3 endo), which correspond to the sequence Thr146–Ser167 of the rat V1a receptor second intracellular loop and to the sequence Thr279–Lys306 of the rat ETA endothelin receptor third intracellular loop, respectively. These peptides were prepared using solid phase procedures (the detailed procedure for the synthesis of i3 cyc peptide is available in the Supplementary Data). The loading of the TentaGel S-NH2 resin (initially 0.28 mmol/g) was reduced to 0.12 mmol/g by coupling the corresponding amount of Fmoc-Rink amide linker (benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate and N-ethyldiisopropylamine). Acetic anhydride was then used to cap unreacted amino groups. To suppress aggregation, pseudo-proline building blocks (24Mutter M. Nefzi A. Sato T. Sun X. Wahl F. Wohr T. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 145-153PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wöhr T. Wahl F. Nefzi A. Rohwedder B. Sato T. Sun X. Mutter M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9218-9227Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar) were used as structure-disrupting agents at different stages of the solid phase synthesis of such a long peptide. Thus, residues 11–12, 39–40, and 45–46 were introduced as Fmoc-Ala-Ser(ψMe,Mepro)-OH, Fmoc-Val-Ser(ψMe,Mepro)-OH, and Fmoc-Lys-Thr(ψMe,Mepro)-OH, respectively, and coupled to the resin using a coupling reagent consisting of benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, N-ethyldiisopropylamine, and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole. The i3 cyc CD spectra were obtained on a Jobin Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter. The spectra were scanned at room temperature in a quartz optical cell with a 0.03-cm path length. Baseline spectra for each solvent were obtained before the peptide spectra. The i3 cyc peptide was diluted at a concentration of 75 μm in a 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, containing either 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (50%; v/v) or dodecylphosphocholine (10%; w/w). V2-R-Rluc, V2-R-YFP—Sense and antisense primers were made to both introduce an AgeI site at the end of the human V2-R coding sequence expressed in pRK5 vector and remove the stop codon. Like-wise, an AgeI site was created at the beginning of the Rluc coding sequence expressed in pRL-CMV vector (Promega). The pEYFP (BD Biosciences Clontech) and pRL-CMV vectors were cut with AgeI and XbaI, respectively, to excise the YFP and Rluc coding region and insert them in frame into the pRK5-V2-R vector to yield the pRK5-V2-R-YFP and pRK5-V2-R-Rluc constructs, respectively (20Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). GbR1-Rluc, GbR2-YFP—The human GbR1 coding sequence amplified without its stop codon between two XbaI sites was ligated in frame into the XbaI site of the pCDNA-3.1-hRluc vector (20Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). pCDNA-3 plasmid encoding the GbR2-YFP construct was a generous gift of Glaxo-SmithKline (Stevenage, UK). β2AR-Rluc, β2AR-YFP—The human β2AR coding sequence amplified without its stop codon between two XhoI and HindIII sites was inserted in frame into the yellow variant pGFP-N1-Topaz vector (PerkinElmer) to give the pGFP-β2AR-YFP construct (26Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). The human His-β2AR coding sequence amplified without its stop codon by PCR was subcloned into PCR Blunt II Topo Vector (Invitrogen), cut with HindIII/KpnI, and inserted in frame into the pCDNA-3.1-hRluc vector (27Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by direct DNA sequencing. HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 500 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Calcium phosphate precipitation and G418 selection pressure (450 μg/ml) were used to produce stable HEK 293T cell lines expressing β2-AR-Rluc. For all transient expression, 2 × 106 cells were plated in each 100-mm Petri dish, and transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Mellon P. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cell membranes were prepared for radioligand binding, adenylyl cyclase assays, and BRET measurements as described previously (20Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 2 mm MgCl2), homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer, and centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended in an appropriate volume of membrane buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2) and protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford. Membranes were used immediately or stored at –80 °C. Rat brain and kidney membranes were prepared as described previously (29Andres M. Trueba M. Guillon G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, the different tissues were minced and homogenized in three volumes of an isotonic buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm MgCl2 with 15 strokes of a tight glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the pellet was resuspended in a hypotonic buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm MgCl2. Cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in the hypotonic buffer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then homogenized with 10 strokes of a tight glass Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was resuspended in an appropriate volume of membrane buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.3 mm MgCl2), and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. Membranes were used immediately or stored at –18 °C in presence of 40% glycerol. Just before the use of frozen membranes, glycerol was removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assessed by measuring the conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]cAMP as described previously (30Butlen D. Guillon G. Rajerison R.M. Jard S. Sawyer W.H. Manning M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 1006-1017PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, membranes (20 μg of protein per assay) from rat kidney or HEK 293T cells transiently co-expressing V2-R-Rluc + V2-R-YFP were pre-incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a 180-μl incubation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 1 μm cAMP, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 0.66 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm creatine kinase, 1 mm creatine phosphate, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm sodium azide, 0.1 μm ouabain, and 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]cAMP with or without (basal) the compounds to be tested. 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP per assay was then added for a further 6 min to a final volume of 200 μl. cAMP levels were determined by measuring the conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]cAMP. Labeled cAMP and ATP were separated by sequential chromatography on Dowex and alumina columns. 32P and 3H radioactivities present in the cAMP fractions were then determined. [α-32P]cAMP content was normalized according to the recovery of exogenous [3H]cAMP, which was previously added in the incubation buffer. Guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) assays were conducted as described previously (31Kniazeff J. Saintot P.P. Goudet C. Liu J. Charnet A. Guillon G. Pin J.P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, rat kidney membrane preparations (10 μg of protein per assay) were pre-incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with or without 10 μm i3 cyc in an incubation mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 μm GDP, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in the presence (total AVP-stimulated condition) or absence (total basal condition) of 100 nm AVP (final volume, 150 μl). [35S]GTPγS was then added in the medium and incubated for an additional 15 min. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled GTPγS, did not represent more than 6% of the total [35S]GTPγS binding under both basal and AVP-stimulated conditions. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 ml of cold washing solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2) and immediately filtered onto Whatman glass fiber filter (0.8–1.2 μm) previously presoaked for 2 h in a 50mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The filters were then rinsed three times with 4 ml of washing solution, and the remaining radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The specific [35S]GTPγS binding related to hormone effect was calculated as the difference between the total [35S]GTPγS bound in the AVP-stimulated condition and the total [35S]GTPγS bound in the basal condition. The specific basal [35S]GTPγS binding was calculated as the difference between the total basal binding and the corresponding nonspecific binding values. [35S]GTPγS binding experiments with membranes from HEK293T cells transiently expressing GbR1, GbR2, and Gαo were performed in 96-well filtration plates previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. Membranes (5 μg/well) were prepared as described above and were pre-incubated 15 min at 30 °C with or without 10 μm i3 cyc (final volume, 20 μl). The plate was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C after the addition of 60 μl of an incubation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm GDP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 nm [35S]GTPγS in presence (total stimulated condition) or absence (total basal condition) of 100 μm baclofen. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled GTPγS. After vacuum filtration, plate-filter washing (three times with 250 μl of 50 mm Tris) and drying, the radioactivity was measured using a 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Wallac). The specific [35S]GTPγS binding related to hormone effect was calculated as described above. [3H]AVP binding to plasma membrane preparations was performed as described previously (29Andres M. Trueba M. Guillon G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, membranes (10 μg of protein per assay) from rat kidney or HEK 293T cells transiently co-expressing V2R-Rluc + V2R-YFP were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 125 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Increasing amounts of synthetic peptides, 100 μm GTPγS, or a combination of these effectors were added in the medium when necessary. Then, either a fixed concentration (competition experiments) or increasing amounts of [3H]AVP (saturation binding experiments) were added in the medium. In both cases, the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional period of 45 min at 30 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an excess of unlabeled AVP (1 μm). Brain membranes (10 μg of protein per assay) were pre-incubated 15 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with or without 10 μm i3 cyc. [125I]CGP64213 (0.1 nm) was added in the incubation medium, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 60 min. Nonspecific binding was determined using 1 μm GABA (32Galvez T. Urwyler S. Prezeau L. Mosbacher J. Joly C. Malitschek B. Heid J. Brabet I. Froestl W. Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Membranes (10 μg of protein per assay) from HEK 293T cells stably expressing β2-AR-Rluc were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 180 μl of a buffer containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02 mg/ml ascorbic acid with or without 10 μm i3 cyc. [125I]CYP (0.2 nm) was added in the incubation medium, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional period of 75 min. Nonspecific binding was determined using 6 μm isoproterenol. The reactions were stopped by adding 4 ml of cold washing solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2), and immediately filtered onto a Whatman glass fiber filter (0.8–1.2 μm) previously presoaked for 2 h with 10 mg/ml BSA. The filters were then rinsed three times with 4 ml of washing solution, and the remaining radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The specific binding was calculated as the difference between the total and nonspecific values. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and detached with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. Total fluorescence and luminescence signals were determined using a Fluorocount and Luminocount (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) to assess the expression level of the YFP and Rluc fusion constructs. Membranes were then prepared as described above before being incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in an incubation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01 mg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, with or without the compound to be tested. Incubated membranes were distributed in a 96-well microplate (12 μg of protein per well) and Coelenterazine h (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) added to a final concentration of 5 μm. Readings were collected using a multi-detector plate reader FUSION (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences), allowing the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 440–500 nm and 510–590 nm windows. The BRET ratio is defined as [(emission at 510–590)-((emission at 440–500) × Cf)]/(emission at 440–500), where Cf corresponds to (emission at 510–590)/(emission at 440–500) for the Rluc construct expressed alone in the same experiment. Synthesis of i3 cyc—To synthesize i3 cyc, we used a r-V2-R model derived from the rhodopsin coordinates (Protein Data Bank accession number 1F88) to select the appropriate N- and C-terminal residues at the cytoplasmic ends of TMs 5 and 6, respectively. A chemoselective ligation strategy was devised to synthesize a cyclic form of the peptide (described in Supplementary Data). Therefore, the N- and C-terminal residues (Gln225 and Leu274) of the i3 loop were replaced with Gly and S-carboxymethyl cysteine, respectively, to reproduce a distance similar to that evaluated for the r-V2-R model (Fig. 1). The Met266 and Met272 of the r-V2-R were also replaced with Nle43 and Nle49 in the peptide to avoid any possibility of methionine oxidation. Because the cyclization strategy was predicted to alter the orientation of the Gln2 side chain in the peptide, this residue was introduced as d-Gln. Finally, i3 cyc was purified by high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight) (see Supplementary Data). i3 cyc Structure—In phosphate buffer alone, i3 cyc adopted a random conformation as indicated by a minimum of ellipticity observed at 198 nm. The addition of dodecylphosphocholine, a molecule known to induce the formation of membrane-mimicking micelles at a concentration higher than its critical micellar concentration led to a CD spectra right-shift with two marked minima at 208 and 224 nm. These minima are typical features of the presence of an appreciable amount of α-helices as secondary structures (22% as calculated by the K2D software: http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/~andrade/k2d.html). This effect was even more pronounced for the CD spectrum performed in the presence of 50% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, an organic solvent known to preferentially induce the formation of α-helices (36% of α-helices as calculated by the K2D software) (see Supplementary Data).

https://openalex.org/W2089684530,"Muscarinic toxin 7 (MT7) is a mamba venom protein antagonist with extremely high selectivity for the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. To map the sites for the interaction of MT7 with muscarinic receptors we have used chimeric M1:M3 receptors and site-directed mutagenesis of the M3 and M4 receptor subtypes. Two Glu residues in M1, one in extracellular loop 2 and one in extracellular loop 3, were found to be important for the high affinity binding of MT7. Substitution of the corresponding Lys residues in the M3 receptor with Glu converted the M3 mutant to an MT7 binding receptor, albeit with lower affinity compared with M1. A Phe → Tyr substitution in extracellular loop 2 of M3 together with the 2 Glu mutations generated a receptor with an increased MT7 affinity (apparent Ki = 0.26 nm in a functional assay) compared with the M1 receptor (apparent Ki = 1.31 nm). The importance of the identified amino acid residues was confirmed with a mutated M4 receptor constructs. The results indicate that the high selectivity of MT7 for the M1 receptor depends on very few residues, thus providing good prospects for future design and synthesis of muscarinic receptor-selective ligands.

MTs are peptides of 65 or 66 amino acids including eight cysteines which form internal disulfide bridges to generate a characteristic compact protein core structure with three protruding loops (12Ségalas I.

This so-called three-finger motif is common to many toxin molecules from snake venoms and has by evolution generated a wealth of molecules with high specificity simply by variation of mainly the loop sequences (12Ségalas I.

Johansson G. Mbugua P.M. Karlsson E. Biochim. Biophys.

This has led to the identification of receptor subtype non-selective MTs, such as MTα from Dendroaspis polylepis (18Jolkkonen M. Van Giersbergen P.L. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Oras A. Satyapan N. Adem A. Karlsson E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), modestly receptor subtype selective MTs, such as MT3 (19Jolkkonen M. van Giersbergen P.L.

MT7 binds to muscarinic M1 receptors in the pico- to nanomolar range when assayed with radioligand binding with no detectable binding to the other subtypes, except for a low affinity (micromolar) binding to M4 receptors (9Max S.I.

Fruchart-Gaillard C. Menez A. Servent D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite the well characterized pharmacological profile of the MTs, virtually no information is available concerning the structural basis for interaction with the receptors. There are several reasons for this. One is that the natural source of MTs is limited, and because especially MT7 is also very scarcely expressed in the venom (11Jolkkonen M. Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden1996Google Scholar, 23Carsi J.M. Potter L.T. Toxicon. 1999; 38: 187-198Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the availability for research is limited. This has during the last years been partially overcome by the production of recombinant MT7 in insect cells (20Näsman J. Jolkkonen M. Ammoun S. Karlsson E. Åkerman K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in yeast (21Krajewski J.L. Dickerson I.M. Potter L.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 725-731PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by chemical synthesis (22Mourier G. Dutertre S. Fruchart-Gaillard C. Menez A. Servent D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Another reason is the lack of high resolution structure of muscarinic receptors and, as a logical consequence, a receptor-MT complex. Considering the large size of the MT ligands and the very high affinity, one can assume that several sites of contact exist between the receptor and the toxin molecule. This has in the case of acetylcholinesterase and fasciculin, which is structurally closely related to MTs, been demonstrated by resolving the crystal structure of the bound complex (24Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutagenesis studies of this protein pair also have demonstrated that rather few of the interactions are important for high affinity binding (26Marchot P. Prowse C.N. Kanter J. Camp S. Ackermann E.J. Radic Z. Bougis P.E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3502-3510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Marchot P. Bourne Y. Prowse C.N. Bougis P.E. Taylor P. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that the high selectivity of MT7 for M1 receptors might be due to a limited number of receptor-toxin interactions based on the following. (i) Comparison of the primary sequences of different MTs with different receptor selectivity profiles suggests that rather few amino acid differences can have a large impact on the selectivity, (ii) the close homology between muscarinic receptor subtypes, especially in the ligand binding transmembrane domains, suggests that a common binding site for all MTs may exist and that the high affinity binding and selectivity comes from additional specific interactions with more divergent receptor domains, such as the extracellular domains. Our aim was, thus, to identify interaction sites for MT7 in the receptor structure. For this we chose the MT7 non-binding M3 receptor as a target for mutagenesis. Initial screening was performed with chimeric M1:M3 receptors to identify larger domains involved in the binding. The results show that a limited number of mutations in the extracellular loops 2 and 3 of the M3 receptor converts it to a high affinity MT7 binding receptor. The generality of the results was further confirmed by mutagenesis of the M4 receptor. Materials—[3H]NMS (84 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes. Carbamoylcholine chloride (carbachol) and atropine sulfate was from Sigma. MT7 purified from D. angusticeps was a kind gift from Dr. E. Karlsson (Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden). Other chemicals used were of analytical grade quality. Chimeric Constructs and Mutagenesis—The human M1 receptor with a signal sequence-flag amino-terminal extension, which contains a cleavable signal sequence previously shown to enhance expression and a FLAG epitope (28Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the human M3 and human M4 receptors have been described earlier (20Näsman J. Jolkkonen M. Ammoun S. Karlsson E. Åkerman K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Kukkonen J.P. Näsman J. Ojala P. Oker-Blom C. Åkerman K.E.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). All chimeric constructs and site-directed mutagenesis constructs were generated using the PCR technique with in-house-synthesized specific oligonucleotide primers with desired mutations. Subcloning was performed using the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene) or the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen), and the correct sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing. M1:M3-I was a fusion at the unique ClaI restriction site in M3 (nt +396) with M1 sequence (M3 (amino acids 1–133):M1 (amino acids 91–460)). M1:M3-II was a fusion at the second NheI restriction site in M1 (nt +519) with M3 sequence (M3 (amino acids 1–216):M1 (amino acids 174–460)). M1:M3-IV, which contained a signal sequence-flag extension like the M1 receptor, was a fusion at a generated BsmI restriction site in M1 (nt +586) with M3 sequence (M1 (amino acids 1–195):M3 (amino acids 239–590)). M1:M3-V was similar to M1:M3-IV except that Lys-523 in M3 was changed to a Glu, utilizing the PvuII site of M3 (nt +1556) for PCR subcloning. M1:M3-VI was similar to M1: M3-II except that Lys-213 in M3 was changed to a Glu, utilizing the NheI fusion site for PCR subcloning. M3-E was generated by fusing the intact M3 sequence with M1:M3-V at the unique AatII site (nt +1328). For further site-directed mutagenesis of the M3 receptor, an NheI site (nt +648) was generated to facilitate subcloning, leading to a change of the Pro-Pro dipeptide in the M3 sequence to a corresponding Leu-Ala dipeptide in M1 receptor (M3LA). M3LA-E was generated by fusing the M3LA sequence with M3-E at the unique AatII site and M3ELA-E by fusion of M1:M3-VI with M3LA-E at the NheI site. M3ELAQ-E, M3ELAY-E, and M3ELAQY-E were constructed by insertion of PCR fragments with desired mutations into M3ELA-E between the NheI and AatII sites. M4ELY was constructed by fusion of two PCR fragments with an introduced XbaI site (nt +540), which also generated the Pro-181 to Leu mutation. The Lys-177 to Glu mutation was included in the 5′ fragment, and Phe-186 to Tyr was included in the 3′ fragment. For the fura-2-Ca2+ assay with the M4 receptor constructs we generated a chimeric Gα11:Gαi protein, referred to as G11αi5. cDNA for bovine Gα11 (GαL2) in pVL1393 (30Nakamura F. Kato M. Kameyama K. Nukada T. Haga T. Kato H. Takenawa T. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6246-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. T. Haga (University of Tokyo, Tokyo). The cDNA was transferred to pBluescript KS, and the sequence coding for the last five amino acids was exchanged to αi sequence by fusion of a pair of overlapping oligonucleotides to the PstI site (nt +1049). All new constructs described above, except for M1:M3-IV, were finally transferred to the pFastBac1 vector for generation of recombinant baculovirus with the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). M1:M3-IV was originally constructed for another purpose in the pLucGRBac vector (31Jansson C.C. Karp M. Oker-Blom C. Näsman J. Savola J.M. Åkerman K.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and baculovirus was generated by cotransfection of vector and linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) into Sf9 cells. Cell Culture and Recombinant Expression—Sf9 cells were routinely grown in glass spinner bottles at 27 °C in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 80 units/ml streptomycin (Sigma). The assay buffer used in functional experiments was composed of 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 7.3 mm NaH2PO4, 63 mm sucrose, and 20 mm MES, pH-adjusted to 6.3. For recombinant protein expression Sf9 cells were plated on tissue culture dishes and allowed to attach. A high titer virus stock was then added to give a multiplicity of infection of 3–5. For the functional assay the infections were allowed to proceed for 26–28 h, and cultures were infected for radioligand binding for 48 h. Functional Assay—Receptor-expressing cells were assayed essentially as described in Kukkonen et al. (29Kukkonen J.P. Näsman J. Ojala P. Oker-Blom C. Åkerman K.E.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were detached from plates, centrifuged 150 × g for 4 min, resuspended in a smaller volume growth medium, and incubated for 20 min with 4 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester at room temperature. Thereafter cells were centrifuged 150 × g for 4 min, washed once in assay buffer, resuspended in assay buffer, and divided into aliquots. The aliquots were briefly spun down in a microcentrifuge, the medium was removed, and cell pellets were stored on ice until use. Before fluorescence recording, the cells were resuspended in assay buffer with or without MT7 for 5 min. Thereafter the cells were placed in a cuvette in a thermostatted (27 °C) cuvette holder with magnetic stirring in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International), and fluorescence recording at alternating 340 and 380 nm (excitation) and 510 nm (emission) was started. Different concentrations of carbachol were added in a cumulative fashion, and calibration of each experiment was performed with 0.04% Triton X-100 to measure Fmax and 11 mm EGTA to measure Fmin. Intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were calculated from fluorescence obtained at 340 nm according to [Ca2+]i = (F – Fmin)/(Fmax – F) × 255 nm (the calculated Kd for fura-2-Ca2+ complex at 27 °C (32Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1410-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the extracellular fura-2 fluorescence being subtracted from the F values. Radioligand Binding—Infected cells from monolayer culture were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline solution, centrifuged 1500 × g, and stored as pellets at –80 °C until use. For binding experiments the cells were resuspended in binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. 50–100 μg of protein of the homogenate was incubated with different concentrations (0.01–10 nm) of [3H]NMS in a volume of 150 μl for 45 min at room temperature to determine Kd for [3H]NMS and Bmax values. Atropine (10 μm) was used to determine nonspecific binding. The inhibition curves for MT7 were obtained by preincubation of homogenates with different concentrations (0.001–100 nm) of MT7 diluted in binding buffer containing 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml for 45 min at room temperature. Thereafter, 0.5 nm [3H]NMS was added, and incubation was continued for another 45 min. To determine [3H]NMS dissociation from prebound receptor-ligand-MT7 complex, the order of addition was reversed. Homogenates were first incubated for 30 min with 1.5 nm [3H]NMS, after which 10 nm MT7 or vehicle was added for another 30 min, and dissociation was determined at different times after the addition of 1 μm atropine. All reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through prewashed GF/B filters followed by 5 washes with cold buffer containing 180 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in a microplate harvester (Packard Instrument Co.). Radioactivity on filters was determined in a microplate scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Data Analysis—Non-linear curve-fitting of the dose-response data was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). The apparent Ki values in the functional assay were obtained from data fitted to the equation Δ[Ca2+] = [A]Δ[Ca2+]max/([A](1 + [I]/Ki′) + EC50(1 + [I]/Ki)), where [A] and [I] are the concentrations of agonist and inhibitor, respectively, EC50 is the [A] producing half-maximal stimulation, and Ki and Ki′ are the surmountable (“competitive”) and the insurmountable (“noncompetitive”) inhibition constants, respectively. The Ki value gives a measure of the right shift of the dose-response curve, and the Ki′ value gives a measure of the suppression of the maximum response. The equation was applied earlier to functional antagonism analysis of muscarinic receptor-induced Ca2+ increases (33Kukkonen J. Åkerman K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34Kukkonen J.P. Näsman J. Rinken A. Dementjev A. Åkerman K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study only the apparent Ki values are given because, whereas the apparent Ki values were similar irrespective of MT7 concentration used, the apparent Ki′ values for several constructs varied significantly. This could be due to complex inhibition patterns like the ones displayed by atropine on the M1 and M5 receptors, where the insurmountable part of the inhibition appears to saturate, and only the surmountable antagonism can, thereafter, be increased with increasing antagonist concentrations (34Kukkonen J.P. Näsman J. Rinken A. Dementjev A. Åkerman K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The observed insurmountable inhibition was nevertheless taken into account with all constructs in calculation of the apparent Ki values. The IC50 values from radioligand binding data was obtained by one site competition fitting using GraphPad Prism. Measurements of [Ca2+]i responses were done using suspensions of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Activation of M1 receptors with carbachol resulted in an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i as determined from fura-2 fluorescence (Fig. 1A). The basal Ca2+ level was 101 ± 7 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3). In this heterologous expression system, the Ca2+ responses are very stable in the continuous presence of agonist, declining very slowly toward the basal level. The addition of MT7 during the stable phase resulted in inhibition of the receptor-mediated response in the same manner as with atropine, with a restoration of cellular basal Ca2+ level (Fig. 1A). Preincubation with MT7 resulted in a total blockage of response to low concentrations of carbachol but was competitively relieved at higher agonist concentrations (Fig. 1B). Using similar assay conditions, we next examined the dose-dependent inhibition of the M1 receptor with MT7 (Fig. 2A). The inhibition appeared to be both insurmountable, in terms of depression of response maxima, and surmountable, in terms of right-shifted dose-response curves. The calculated apparent Ki value for MT7 was 1.31 ± 0.36 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 5). We used the M1 receptor construct with a signal sequence-flag amino-terminal extension that is expressed at higher levels and gives greater responses compared with the native M1 (29Kukkonen J.P. Näsman J. Ojala P. Oker-Blom C. Åkerman K.E.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal extension did not affect the inhibition pattern of MT7 (data not shown). The M3 receptor was not inhibited by MT7 up to 100 nm (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Dose-dependent inhibition of muscarinic receptors by MT7. Sf9 cells expressing muscarinic acetylcholine receptors were assayed for carbachol (CCh)-induced Ca2+ increases. A, M1 receptor in the absence and presence of 10, 30, and 100 nm MT7.

The functional assay data for all constructs are compiled in Table I. The M1:M3-I construct did not show significantly altered MT7 affinity, but M1:M3-II and M1:M3-IV displayed an ∼10-fold decrease in MT7 affinity and no obvious insurmountable inhibition (Fig. 4, A and B). Because the M1 and M3 receptors are very homologous in the transmembrane regions, we hypothesized that the outer loops are involved in the binding. Comparison of primary sequences of outer loops 2 and 3 showed that there are several amino acid differences in these regions between M1 and M3 receptors (Fig. 5). Quite dramatic differences are represented by the negatively charged Glu-170 in loop 2 and Glu-397 in loop 3 of the M1 receptor, the corresponding residues in the M3 receptor being positively charged lysines. Mutations of these Lys residues to Glu in the chimeric constructs M1:M3-VI and M1:M3-V rescued the M1:M3-II and M1:M3-IV, respectively, in terms of MT7 affinity (Fig. 4, C and D). The M1:M3-VI construct displayed an even lower surmountable apparent inhibition constant as compared with the M1 receptor and a substantial insurmountable inhibition by MT7.Table IFunctional characteristics of expressed receptor constructsReceptor constructControlMT7Carbachol EC50Max. increase in [Ca2+]iFunctional inhibition App. Kiμmnmnm (n)M12.9 ± 0.9279 ± 431.31 ± 0.36 (5de Weille J.R.

We show that the t peptide induces the misfolding of a fraction of AChE subunits, even when mutations disorganized the cluster of aromatic residues or when these residues were replaced by leucines, indicating that this effect is due to hydrophobic residues. Mutations in the aromatic-rich region affected the cellular fate of AChE in a similar manner, with or without mutations that prevented dimerization. Degradation was decreased and secretion was increased when aromatic residues were replaced by leucines, and the opposite occurred when the amphiphilic α helix was disorganized.

In mammals, alternative splicing of a single gene gives rise to different variants (types R, H, and T), which possess the same catalytic activity but different tissue-specific distributions (1Massoulié J.

The catalytic subunits of type T (AChET), which are predominant in the nervous system and muscles, are characterized by a C-terminal peptide of 40 amino acids called the t peptide (4Massoulié J. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Morel N. Simon S. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The t peptide enables AChET subunits to assemble into dimers and tetramers and to associate with structural proteins possessing a proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD), the collagen ColQ, and the transmembrane protein PRiMA (proline-rich membrane anchor) (5Krejci E.

These proteins anchor PRAD-linked tetramers of cholinesterase in the basal lamina of neuromuscular junctions and in neuronal membranes, respectively. The t peptide behaves as an autonomous interaction domain in its association with a PRAD and therefore has been called the tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization domain (WAT) (8Simon S. Krejci E. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Its homo- and hetero-oligomerization properties depend on two major features, which are conserved in all vertebrates: 1) a series of seven aromatic residues (Trp10, Phe14, Trp17, Tyr20, Trp24, Phe28, and Tyr31) and 2) a cysteine near its C terminus (Cys37) (9Belbeoc'h S. Falasca C. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1476-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic and crystallographic studies showed that the t peptide is organized as an amphiphilic α-helix in which all of the aromatic residues are grouped on one side (10Bon S. Dufourcq J. Leroy J. Cornut I. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 2Dvir, H., Harel, M., Bon, S., Liu, W. Q., Vidal, M., Garbay, C., Sussman, J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23977-23984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of AChET dimers depends on contact between subunits at the level of two α-helices from each catalytic domain (α7,8 and α10), forming the “four-helix bundle” (17Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar), and on the formation of a disulfide bridge between the C-terminal cysteines of two t peptides (18Morel N. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37379-37389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but it does not require the aromatic residues of the t peptide. It has been shown that rat AChET subunits, which carry a mutation in the α10 helix (F535A, 9 amino acids upstream of the t peptide), are deficient in dimerization despite the presence of Cys37 (18Morel N. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37379-37389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the formation of homomeric or PRAD-linked tetramers depends on the cluster of aromatic residues. It is facilitated by intercatenary disulfide bonds but also occurs in their absence (9Belbeoc'h S. Falasca C. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1476-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The presence of a t peptide induces an intracellular degradation of AChET subunits, which is strongly increased with the F535A mutation (AChE*), unless they assemble with a PRAD-containing N-terminal fragment of ColQ (QN), forming PRAD-linked complexes. This degradation process follows the ER-associated degradation pathway. It can be blocked by proteasome inhibition and is reduced by inhibiting ER-mannosidase I, indicating that sugar chains are involved in its mechanism (19Belbeoc'h S. Massoulié J. Bon S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3536-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the t peptide seems to play a role in delaying protein secretion. Indeed, we recently showed that deletion of the last two residues increased the secretion of Torpedo AChET, suggesting that its C terminus behaves as a weak retention signal, perhaps facilitating the assembly of oligomers. This may be due to the similarity of the C-terminal tetrapeptide (CAEL) with the classical endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, KDEL (9Belbeoc'h S. Falasca C. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1476-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Velan B. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22719-22725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we designed mutations to assess the importance of the cluster of aromatic residues in the α-helical structure and of the aromatic versus hydrophobic nature of these residues in rat AChET subunits. We investigated the synthesis, secretion, degradation, and interaction with a PRAD for wild type and F535A mutants with and without the C-terminal Cys37. We showed that distinct features of the t peptide determine these different processes. Mutagenesis and Transfection—cDNAs encoding the AChET subunit of rat AChE and an N-terminal fragment of ColQ (QN) were inserted in the pEFBos expression vector (21Mizushima, S., and Nagata, S. (1990) 18,5322Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the QN protein is 5′-ESTFLDKAFSLQAALLPMEHKKRSVNKCCLLTPPPPPMFPPPFFTETNILQEVDLNNLPLEIKPTEPS-3′ (6Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (the signal peptide is not shown; the PRAD and the two cysteines are underlined are in boldface). Site-directed mutagenesis was realized with the method of Kunkel (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The C2 mutant was derived by deletion of most of the C-terminal peptide from the H variant of AChE, leaving a cysteine at position 6 downstream of the common catalytic domain (23Coussen F. Ayon A. Le Goff A. Leroy J. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27881-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected in COS cells with the DEAE-dextran method, as described previously (24Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), usually with 4 μg of DNA/100-mm dish. The cellular and secreted activities were generally measured 3 or 4 days after transfection. Titration of AChE Active Sites by DEPQ—Samples of 50 μl containing 15–30 mOD units (1/1000 optical density unit) of cellular or secreted AChE activity were treated with 10, 20, and 30 μl of 0.125 nm DEPQ for 1 h at room temperature. The remaining AChE activity was then determined with the Ellman colorimetric method (25Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21333) Google Scholar). Soman, Cycloheximide, and Brefeldin A—To study the neosynthesis of AChE, steady-state cultures of transfected cells (3 or 4 days after transfection) were treated with the membrane-permeant inhibitor soman (pinacolylmethylphosphonofluoridate) 5 × 10–7m for 30 min, which irreversibly inhibited the cellular enzyme. After extensive washing, the recovery of AChE activity at 37 °C was determined by collecting cells at various times. The secretion of active AChE was also monitored, and aliquots of the culture medium were taken and replaced with fresh medium. To investigate AChE degradation, cycloheximide (200 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium of transfected cells to block protein synthesis and brefeldin A (7 μg/ml) was added to block secretion. Acetylcholinesterase Extraction and Quantification—Intracellular and membrane-bound enzyme was extracted for 30 min at 20 °C in a TMg buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2) followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The medium containing the secreted enzyme was also centrifuged to remove cell debris. Enzyme activity was quantified at 414 nm with the colorimetric method of Ellman using a Labsystem Multiskan RC automatic plate reader. Electrophoresis—Non-denaturing electrophoresis was realized in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (250 × 120 × 2 mm) containing 0.25% Triton X-100 or 0.25% Triton X-100 + 0.05% Na+ deoxycholate (DOC) as previously described (26Bon S. Toutant J.P. Méflah K. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of horizontal gels was performed in a refrigerated apparatus (40 V/cm) for 2 h. Enzymatic activity was revealed directly on the gel by the method of Karnovsky and Roots (27Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—After 3 days of transfection, cells were rinsed and incubated for 45 min in a medium without methionine followed by a 30-min labeling with [35S]methionine and cysteine (Redivue, Amersham Biosciences). After rinsing, the cells were chased in a complete medium, the medium was collected, and the cells were extracted at different times. The cell extract and the medium were incubated overnight with a polyclonal antibody raised against AChE (A63) (28Marsh D. Grassi J. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and immunoadsorbed at 4 °C on protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma). The radiolabeled enzyme was detached from the beads in a buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol and loaded on 7% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS for electrophoresis. After migration, the gels were dried and radioactive AChE protein was revealed with a Fuji image analyzer. Prediction of Secondary Structure—The secondary structure of mutated t peptides was predicted according to Rost (29Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the PredictProtein site (maple.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/). Mutations in the t Peptide—We introduced mutations in the t peptides of rat AChET and of the dimerization-defective mutant carrying the F535A mutation in the α10 helix (AChE*), as illustrated in Fig. 1A. We modified the cluster of aromatic residues of the t peptide in various ways. The segment containing these residues was deleted in the Del10–31 and Stp10 mutants, the seven aromatic residues were replaced by leucines in the 7L mutant, and two phenylalanine residues (Phe14 and Phe28) were replaced by tryptophans in the 5W mutant. In the “scrambled” (Scr) mutant, the positions of the seven aromatic residues were exchanged with those of other residues so that they could be dispersed around the helix (Fig. 1B). In the Scr mutant, the composition of the t peptide and the positions of acidic and basic residues were not modified to maintain potential salt bridges, which may stabilize the helical structure of its oligomeric associations. The 10–31 region is predicted to form an α-helix in the case of the 7L, 5W, and Scr mutants as in the wild type t peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this paper, WT refers to the wild type aromatic region of the t peptide combined or not with the F535A mutation in the catalytic domain (AChE or AChE*) and with mutations in the C-terminal tetrapeptide, which contained a cysteine or a serine at position 37 (indicated by indices C or S, for example: 5WC, 5WS). In the stop39 mutant, we removed the last two residues (Asp-Leu) so that the C terminus would be Ser-Ser. We also replaced the last four residues by the canonical ER retention signal KDEL. For comparison, we studied mutants lacking the t peptide consisting of the catalytic domain only (C1) or of the catalytic domain followed by a short peptide containing a cysteine (C2). We found that C1 formed exclusively monomers, whereas C2 was largely dimerized.Fig. 3Effect of mutations in the aromatic-rich region on the levels of cellular and secreted AChE activity. The mutants contained a wild type or a dimerization-deficient catalytic domain noted, respectively, as AChE (plain bars) and AChE* (hatched bars) and possessed Cys37 or not (C37S) as indicated. The cellular and secreted activities were measured after 3 days of transfection. Because of variation in transfection efficiencies, the values obtained in each experiment were normalized to those obtained for the wild type (AChE-WTC), which was always used as a control taken at 100%. The values indicated are the means ± S.E. of at least three totally independent transfection experiments. Note that secretion was increased by the deletion of the aromatic-rich region (C1, C2, stop10, or Del) and, to a lesser degree, by the 7L mutation. Because the synthesis of AChE protein was the same for all of the mutants as shown in Fig. 6A and all of the mutants possessed the same catalytic activity (data not shown), the differences observed reflect the production of the active enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1Mutations analyzed in this study.A, mutations in the C-terminal t peptide of rat AChE in the presence or absence of mutation F535A (respectively noted AChE* and AChE). This mutation, located in the C-terminal10 α helix of the catalytic domain, compromises dimerization through the four-helix bundle. In mutant C1, the entire t peptide was deleted, and in mutant C2, it was replaced by the first seven residues from the C-terminal peptide of the AChEH splice variant containing a cysteine (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this paper, WT refers to the wild type aromatic-rich region. B and C, wheel diagrams of the 9–32 segment of the wild type and Scr mutant. The preceding mutations were combined with mutations in the C-terminal tetrapeptide (underlined), replacement of Cys37 by a serine as noted by an index (e.g. WTC or WTS), deletion of the last two residues with the C37S mutation (e.g. WTSS), and replacement of the last four residues by the ER retention signal KDEL (e.g. WTKDEL).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All of the mutants produced active AChE. We compared the activities of these mutants by titrating their active sites with an irreversible inhibitor, DEPQ. We found that the catalytic turnover per site was identical for cellular and secreted enzymes and was not affected by the presence of the F535A mutation, by the presence or absence of the t peptides, or by the different mutations that were introduced in the t peptide (data not shown). Dimerization Requires Cys37, Whereas Tetramerization with or without QN Mainly Depends on the Aromatic Cluster—Fig. 2A shows the electrophoretic patterns obtained in non-denaturing electrophoresis for the different mutants of rat AChET subunits expressed in transfected COS cells with or without QN. As previously described (6Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30), cellular extracts from cells expressing wild type AChET subunits contained monomers (T1), dimers (T2), and a small proportion of tetramers (T4), whereas the culture medium contained comparable proportions of monomers, dimers, and tetramers. When the cells co-expressed AChET subunits with the QN protein, both cell extract and medium contained QN-linked tetramers (T4-QN). The molecular forms of AChE produced with the 5WC mutant were very similar to those obtained with the wild type, although the formation of homomeric tetramers (T4) was slightly reduced. When this mutant was co-expressed with QN, the formation of T4-QN complexes was reduced. The ScrC mutant produced monomers and dimers but no tetramers, either homomeric or associated with QN. This mutant was secreted at a very low level, either without or with QN. Cells expressing the 7LC mutant also produced monomers and dimers but secreted mostly dimers. It did not form any tetramer, but a slowly migrating component (perhaps hexamers) appeared in the medium (Fig. 2, A and B). The Scr and 7L mutants illustrate the necessity of an aromatic cluster for tetramerization. Without Cys37, dimerization was abolished in all of the cases. The WTS subunits (which only differed from the wild type by the C37S mutation) mainly produced monomers (T1) together with lower levels of tetramers (T4) and T4-QN complexes than the wild type. The ScrS and 7LS mutants only produced monomers. It is noteworthy that the 5WS mutant did not form homomeric tetramers or QN-linked tetramers, in contrast to the 5WC mutant. This shows that intercatenary disulfide bonds contribute to the stability of both homomeric and QN-associated tetramers. Tetramerization was also abolished in the case of the dimerization-deficient AChE*T subunits containing the Scr and 7L mutations with or without Cys37. Transfected cells co-expressing AChE*-5WC with QN secreted T4-QN complexes but at a lower level than with the wild type, and these complexes were not detectable in cellular extracts. The AChE*-5WS mutant, similar to AChE-5WS, did not form such heteromeric complexes. In Fig. 2, A and B, the relative intensities of AChE bands in the medium reflect the relative levels of activity of the different mutants, as documented below. For example, the Del and 7L mutants were more actively secreted than the WT, 5W, and particularly Scr mutants. The Amphiphilicity of Monomers and Dimers Depends on a Cluster of Hydrophobic Residues in the t Peptide—Fig. 2B shows the influence of a charged detergent, DOC, on the migration of AChE molecular forms in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. The migrations were normalized to those of the DelS and DelC mutants, which do not possess the cluster of hydrophobic residues and constitute non-amphiphilic standards. The migration of amphiphilic molecules such as the wild type monomers and dimers was slower in the presence of Triton X-100 alone compared with Triton X-100 plus DOC. Only those produced by the ScrC mutant retained a fast migration under these conditions. Fig. 2C shows the ratio of migration in the presence and absence of DOC as an index of amphiphilicity. We obtained similar values for cellular and secreted molecular species. Dimers were systematically less accelerated by DOC than monomers, as expected if their aromatic clusters partially had occluded each other, and tetramers were non-amphiphilic (data not shown). The wild type and 5W mutants presented similar values, the 7L mutants were significantly less sensitive to the detergents, and the Scr mutants were essentially not affected. Thus, the amphiphilic character depends on the clustering of hydrophobic residues. It is interesting that leucines provide a weaker amphiphilic character than tryptophans, which most authors classify as less hydrophobic. Influence of the Aromatic-rich Segment on Cellular and Secreted AChE Activities—Fig. 3 shows the levels of AChE activity obtained in cellular extracts and in the medium for the different mutants expressed in COS cells normalized to those obtained for the wild type AChET subunit. When Cys37 was present, the cellular enzymatic activity was increased to 130 and 160% for ScrC and 5WC, respectively, whereas the corresponding secreted activity was reduced to 30 and 50%. On the contrary, the cellular activity was reduced to 40% or less for 7LC, whereas the corresponding secreted activity was increased to 150%. Secretion was increased even higher for the DelC mutant (280%) and reached the same level as that for the truncated mutants, which lacked the t peptide, either without a C-terminal cysteine, (C1: 220%) or with cysteine near the end of the catalytic domain, allowing dimerization (C2: 270%). The cellular activities of these mutants were either slightly increased (110% for DelC) or decreased (70% for C2). In the absence of cysteine Cys37, both cellular and secreted activities were lower, suggesting an increased degradation, but the effects of the mutations were qualitatively similar. Thus, secretion was strongly increased when the aromatic sector was removed (Del, C1, or C2) and to a lesser extent when aromatic residues were replaced by leucines (7L). In contrast, secretion was reduced and we observed an increase of the cellular activity when two phenylalanines were replaced by tryptophans (5W). Also, this effect was stronger when the clustering of aromatic residues was suppressed by changing their positions (Scr). The cellular activity obtained with the dimerization-deficient mutant AChE* carrying a wild type t peptide with or without Cys37 was <40% wild type, and secretion was almost abolished compared with that of the C2* mutant, indicating a strong degradation as previously reported (18Morel N. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37379-37389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the Scr mutation did not increase the cellular activity, possibly because of intracellular degradation, the effects of the different mutations in the t peptide were remarkably similar to those observed without the F535A mutation. It is particularly noteworthy that the dimerization-deficient mutants AChE*-7LC and AChE*-7LS were significantly secreted, in contrast to AChE*-WTC and AChE*-WTS. Cells expressing the wild type AChE produced and secreted somewhat more activity than cells expressing the C37S mutant; however, Fig. 4 shows that the ratio of secreted to cellular activities were the same, suggesting that the cysteine exerts no retention effect, in agreement with the fact that monomers possessing the CSDL C terminus were actively secreted along with disulfide-linked dimers. In the case of the dimerization-deficient mutants (AChE*), the ratio of secreted to cellular activities was clearly lower with a cysteine for WT, Scr, and 5W mutants, but it was equal for 7LC and 7LS as well as for DelC and DelS. Effect of the C-terminal Extremity of the t Peptide on Secretion—We compared mutants in which the cysteine was replaced by a serine (SSDL) with mutants lacking the last two residues (stop39, ending with Ser-Ser) and with mutants in which the last four residues were replaced by the classical ER retention signal, KDEL. These C-terminal endings were combined with the different mutations of the aromatic-rich region as described in Fig. 1A. The KDEL tetrapeptide increased the cellular activity but only moderately for 5W with or without mutation F535A (Fig. 5A). It reduced the secreted activity in all of the mutants but only marginally for 7L (Fig. 5B). The stop39 mutation increased the secretion of WT and Scr but had no clear effect on 7L, 5W, or Del. This mutation did not affect the cellular activity of WT, 7L, or Del and decreased it very weakly for 5W and quite significantly for Scr. The ratio of secreted to cellular activities provided a more convenient index of these effects (Fig. 5C). This ratio was decreased by KDEL in all cases but less markedly for 7L. The stop39 mutation increased it for WT, Scr, and 5W but not for Del and 7L. Synthesis of AChE Protein and Production of AChE Activity—Metabolic labeling experiments showed that all of the mutant proteins were synthesized at the same rate, as expected, because the vectors and the coding sequences were identical with the exception of a few codons in the region encoding the short non-catalytic C-terminal t peptide. In effect, we found that, after incorporation of radioactive amino acids for a short period, the amount of labeled AChE protein immunoprecipitated by the specific antibody A63 was the same for all mutants. This is illustrated in Fig. 6A for WTS, DelS, WTS*, and DelS*, showing that it is not influenced by the F535A mutation or by the presence of the aromatic-rich region of the t peptide. The relative intensities of the bands obtained after 20 or 40 min were the same within 5%. This incorporation was not modified after irreversible inhibition of preexisting cellular AChE by soman, a cell-permeant organophosphate inhibitor (data not shown). We also studied the recovery of AChE activity after its inhibition by soman. Within two hours after washing the inhibitor, the cell activity increased linearly, recovering ∼25% original cell content per hour in the case of WTS. Fig. 6B shows that the prese"

This study investigated the role of lysosomal mannose 6-phosphorylated proteins in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis. We report that fibroblasts isolated from patients affected with inclusion-cell disease (ICD), having a deficient activity of almost all lysosomal hydrolases, are resistant to the toxic effect of TNF. These mutant cells exhibited a defect in TNF-induced caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and release of cytochrome c. In contrast, TNF-induced p42/p44 MAPK activation and CD54 expression remained unaltered. Human ICD lymphoblasts and fibroblasts derived from mice nullizygous for Igf2 and the two mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptors, Mpr300 and Mpr46, which develop an ICD-like phenotype, were also resistant to CD95 ligand and TNF, respectively. Moreover, correction of the lysosomal enzyme defect of ICD fibroblasts, using a medium enriched in M6P-containing proteins, enabled restoration of sensitivity to TNF. This effect was blocked by exogenous M6P but not by cathepsin B or L inhibitors. Altogether, these findings suggest that some M6P-bearing glycoproteins modulate the susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. As a matter of fact, exogenous tripeptidyl peptidase 1, a lysosomal carboxypeptidase, could sensitize ICD fibroblasts to TNF. These observations highlight the hitherto unrecognized role of some mannose 6-phosphorylated proteins such as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 in the apoptotic cascade triggered by TNF.

Lysosomes are cytoplasmic organelles that form part of a complex intracellular recycling system involved in the degradation of macromolecules. Interest in lysosomes and lysosomal enzymes is justified by the fact that over 50 lysosomal storage diseases have been described in humans, resulting from the lack or deficient activity of lysosomal hydrolases, transporters, or integral membrane proteins (1Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 2Winchester B. Vellodi A. Young E. Biochem. Soc.

Very recently, the concept that alteration of programmed cell death could be related to the development of cell and tissue lesions seen in lysosomal storage diseases, and particularly in neurological diseases, has emerged but still remains to be elucidated (for review see Ref. 5Tardy C. Andrieu-Abadie N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Indeed, although active lysosomal proteases normally reside in the lysosome and carry out nonselective degradation of proteins, several lines of evidence indicate that some of them may participate in the control of cell death triggered by cytotoxic drugs (6Johnson D.E.

Similarly, studies on cathepsin B-knockout mice have underscore the role of this cysteine protease in TNF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury (30Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H.

Pathol. 2001; 159: 2045-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, recent findings have challenged this concept. A series of studies failed to show a requirement for cathepsins or other lysosomal proteases in the cell death machinery but rather suggested a role of these enzymes in cell growth and tissue homeostasis. Indeed, homozygous cathepsin D-deficient mice exhibit increased apoptosis in the thymus (32Saftig P. Hetman M. Schmahl W. Weber K. Heine L. Mossmann H. Koster A. Hess B. Evers M. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3599-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), thalamus (33Nakanishi H. Zhang J. Koike M. Nishioku T. Okamoto Y. Kominami E. von Figura K. Peters C. Yamamoto K.

Peters C. Figura K. Saftig P. Uchiyama Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similar neuronal storage and death have been found in cathepsin D-deficient sheep (35Tyynela J. Sohar I. Sleat D.E. Gin R.M. Donnelly R.J. Baumann M. Haltia M. Lobel P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2786-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). An increased photoreceptor cell death has also been noticed in a transgenic mouse model expressing an enzymatically inactive cathepsin D (36Rakoczy P.E. Zhang D. Robertson T. Barnett N.L. Papadimitriou J. Constable I.J. Lai C.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1515-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice lacking cathepsins B and L display brain atrophy because of massive apoptosis of selected neurons in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar Purkinje and granular cell layers (37Felbor U. Kessler B. Mothes W. Goebel H.H. Ploegh H.L. Bronson R.T. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7883-7888Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Elsewhere, another lysosomal protease, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1, might also be involved in cell death signaling, because overexpression of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 could protect human neuroblastoma cells against apoptotic death (38Cho S. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Conversely, its inhibition increases the susceptibility of these cells to apoptosis (39Cho S. Dawson P.E. Dawson G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These divergent observations prompted us to address the hitherto unresolved question regarding the involvement of lysosomes in apoptosis. To this end, we took advantage of a genetic model, i.e. cells isolated from patients affected with mucolipidosis II. This disorder, also called inclusion-cell disease (ICD), is characterized by the deficient activity of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, resulting in the synthesis of lysosomal enzymes that lack mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) residues (40Hasilik A. Waheed A. von Figura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 41Reitman M.L. Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1574-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These lysosomal enzymes fail to bind to the M6P receptors (MPRs) in the trans-Golgi network and are therefore not targeted to the lysosomal compartment but rather quantitatively secreted (42Wiesmann U. Vassella F. Herschkowitz N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1090-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This results in gross cellular deficiencies of most lysosomal enzymes and is associated with severe clinical manifestations in the first few years of life (43Kornfeld S. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Clinical, biochemical, and morphological similarities between human ICD, and two conditions in animals have been reported, including in a cat (44Bosshard N.U. Hubler M. Arnold S. Briner J. Spycher M.A. Sommerlade H.J. von Figura K. Gitzelmann R. Vet. Pathol. 1996; 33: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in triple-deficient mice nullizygous for Igf2 and the two MPRs, Mpr300 and Mpr46 (45Dittmer F. Hafner A. Ulbrich E.J. Moritz J.D.

Pohlmann R. von Figura K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study evaluated the importance of lysosomal proteases in TNF-induced apoptosis of human or murine ICD cells. We show that TNF-induced cell death was strongly inhibited in ICD fibroblasts as compared with control cells. This phenomenon is likely due to functional inefficiency of some lysosomal hydrolases resulting from their nonlysosomal compartmentalization. Indeed, the apoptosis defect could be partially corrected when the activity of lysosomal hydrolases was restored in ICD fibroblasts, after binding to the MPRs, indicating the importance of these enzymes in cell death. The participation of tripeptidyl peptidase 1, a lysosomal serine-carboxypeptidase, in TNF-induced apoptosis is demonstrated. Reagents—Human recombinant TNF was purchased from Peprotech-Tebu (Le-Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-CD95 (clone CH-11) was from Beckman-Coulter (Marseille, France), and CD95 ligand was recovered in the culture medium of transfected Neuro2a cells, which overexpress a murine CD95 ligand (47Shimizu M. Fontana A. Takeda Y. Yagita H. Yoshimoto T. Matsuzawa A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7350-7357PubMed Google Scholar). Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was from Bachem (Voisins-Le-Breton-neux, France). RPMI 1640 Glutamax, DMEM, trypsin-EDTA, fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Other reagents, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and d-mannose 6-phosphate, were supplied from Sigma (Lisle d'Abeau, France). Cell Culture—Human SV40-transformed skin fibroblasts were derived from normal individuals or from patients affected with ICD (48Chatelut M. Harzer K. Christomanou H. Feunteun J. Pieraggi M.T.

These cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in DMEM containing Glutamax (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and heat-inactivated FCS (10%) (48Chatelut M.

Human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cell lines were derived from control subjects or from patients affected with ICD and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. CHO cells engineered to overexpress and secrete TPP1 (CHO-TPP1) (50Lin L. Lobel P. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. P. Lobel (Piscataway, NJ) and cultured in DMEM. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cell viability was evaluated by using the tetrazolium-based MTT assay (51Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). Fluorogenic DEVD Cleavage Enzyme Assay—After incubation with TNF and cycloheximide, cells were sedimented and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Reaction mixtures contained 100 μl of cell lysates and 100 μlof40 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC. After 30-min incubation at room temperature, the amount of the released fluorescent product aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) was determined at 351 and 430 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Release of Cytochrome c—After incubation with TNF and cycloheximide, cells were sedimented and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). After swelling for 10 min on ice, cells were homogenized by 15 strokes of a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was then centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and Western blotting by using 1 μg/ml anti-cytochrome c mAb (BD Biosciences). Western Blot Analyses—Equal amounts of proteins were separated in a 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected using an ECL detection system (Pierce). Caspase-3 was detected by using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (a gift from Dr. Nicholson, Merk-Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Pointe Claire-Dorval, Quebec, Canada); caspase-8 with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum given by Dr. Peter, The Ben May Institute for Cancer Research (Chicago, IL); Bid and PARP by using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling, Le-Perray-en-Yvelines, France); p42/p44-phosphorylated MAPK by using a mouse monoclonal antiserum (Cell Signaling); and XIAP by using a mouse monoclonal antiserum (BD Biosciences). Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling. An anti-β-actin (Sigma) or an anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology-Tebubio) were used as controls for protein loading. Lysosomal Enzyme Assays—β-Hexosaminidase, β-galactosidase, and β-glucuronidase activities were determined using 0.5 mg/ml of the appropriate 4-methylumbelliferyl derivative substrate (Sigma) at pH 4.5 (β-hexosaminidase) or 3.7 (β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase), in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 (52Little L. Alcouloumre M. Drotar A.M. Herman S. Robertson R. Yeh R.Y. Miller A.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad dye reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cathepsin B activity was assayed with 5 μm Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (Calbiochem) in the presence or absence of 5 μm CA-074Me (Calbiochem), a specific inhibitor of cathepsin B. Cell pellets were homogenized in 250 μl of sodium acetate buffer (0.3 m, pH 5) with 0.1% Triton X-100, 60 mm acetic acid, 4 mm EDTA, and 8 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Reaction mixtures contained 100 μl of cell suspension and 100 μl of substrate preparation. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 100 mm sodium chloroacetate. The amount of the released fluorescent product AMC was determined by fluorometry. Cathepsin L activity was assayed with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC 20 μm (Bachem) in the presence of 5 μm CA-074Me. Cell pellets were homogenized in 500 μl of sodium acetate buffer (0.1 m, pH 4.5) with 2 mm EDTA and 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Reaction mixtures contained 100 μl of cell suspension and 100 μl of substrate preparation. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped and the amount of AMC was determined as described above for cathepsin B. Tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) activity was assayed with 100 μm H-Ala-Ala-Phe-AMC (Bachem). Cell pellets were homogenized in 500 μl of sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 4) with 0.1% Triton X-100, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Reaction mixtures contained 150 μl of supernatant and 50 μl of substrate preparation. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped and the amount of the released fluorescent product AMC was determined by fluorometry. Flow Cytometry Analyses—TNFR1 expression was analyzed on resting cells. For the analysis of CD54 expression, cells were incubated in medium containing 1% FCS for 24 h in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml TNF. Then, cells were detached using phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA, sedimented at 4 °C, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-human TNF-R1 (R&D Systems, Lille, France) or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-human CD54 (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Isotype control monoclonal antibody (Immunotech) was used as a negative control. Cytometric analyses were performed on a FAC-Scan (BD Biosciences) cytometer. Enzymatic Correction Assay—Fibroblasts from wild-type or triple-deficient mice were incubated for 72 h in DMEM containing 1% FCS. Then, the culture medium of these cells was harvested (centrifuged and filtrated) and added to ICD fibroblasts for 48 h. Similar experiments were carried out using the medium of CHO or CHO-TPP1 cells. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001). I-cell Disease Fibroblasts Are Partially Resistant to TNF Toxicity—To investigate the role of lysosomal hydrolases in TNF-induced cell death, we compared the effects of TNF on human SV40-transformed (Fig. 1, A–C) or untransformed (Fig. 1D) fibroblasts derived from normal individuals with those on fibroblasts isolated from ICD patients, in which the activity of almost all lysosomal enzymes is severely impaired (53Tardy C.

The cytotoxic effect of TNF on control cells, in the presence of cycloheximide, was time (Fig. 1A)- and dose (Fig. 1C)-dependent. Under all conditions tested, ICD fibroblasts were more resistant to the lethal effect of TNF than their normal counterparts. This finding was confirmed on several cell lines derived from different normal subjects or patients affected with ICD (Fig. 1, B and D), suggesting that some lysosomal enzymes are key effectors of TNF-induced cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts. In addition, ICD fibroblasts were also partially resistant to staurosporine-induced cell death (53Tardy C. Tyynela J. Hasilik A. Levade T. Andrieu-Abadie N. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because TNFR1 is a well known death receptor able to activate the caspase cascade (54Beyaert R. Van Loo G. Heyninck K. Vandenabeele P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 214: 225-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 55Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar), the implication of lysosomal proteases in the apoptotic cell death induced by TNF in ICD transformed fibroblasts was examined. Executioner caspase activity, as measured by the cleavage of the fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate DEVD-AMC, increased in normal cells within 2 h, peaking at 4 h post-treatment (Fig. 2). Activation of caspase-3 (i.e. the decrease in the procaspase form and appearance of cleaved forms) was further demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D) and by measuring the cleavage of PARP, a well known substrate of caspase-3 (Fig. 3E). Of interest was the finding that these TNF-induced apoptotic events were impaired in ICD cells. TNF treatment of normal cells also resulted in cleavage of the initiator caspase-8 (Fig. 3A), which occurred quite concomitantly to that of effector caspases (Fig. 3D). The cleavage of caspase 8, as monitored by the disappearance of the proform (not shown) and increase in the cleaved forms, was accompanied by the disappearance of Bid, a member of the Bcl-2 family known as a substrate of caspase-8 (Fig. 3B). Progressive release of cytochrome c was also seen in cytosolic, mitochondria-free extracts from TNF-treated control cells (Fig. 3C). Processing of both caspase-8 and Bid, as well as the release of cytochrome c in the cytosol, were considerably reduced in ICD fibroblasts, further supporting the role of some lysosomal proteins in the apoptotic cascade initiated by TNF with a site of action likely lying upstream of mitochondria. Finally, TNF-induced apoptosis in control fibroblasts was accompanied by a decrease in the content of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (XIAPs), which are endogenous inhibitors of the terminal caspase cascade. This phenomenon was not observed in mutant cells derived from ICD patients (Fig. 3E).Fig. 3The TNF-induced apoptosis cascade is altered in I-cell disease fibroblasts. Control and ICD transformed fibroblasts were treated for the indicated periods with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and 50 ng/ml TNF. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot for caspase-8 cleavage (A), Bid proform disappearance (B), release of cytochrome c in the cytosol (C), caspase-3 cleavage (D), XIAP proform disappearance (E), and PARP cleavage (F). An anti-β-actin was used as a control for protein loading. Results are representative of three to six independent experiments. Similar results were obtained with the ICD2 cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TNF-induced p42/p44 MAPK Activation and TNFR1 or CD54 Expression Are Not Impaired in I-cell Disease Fibroblasts—To rule out the possibility that all TNF-induced signaling pathways were affected in ICD cells in an unspecific manner, other biological activities of this cytokine on fibroblasts, such as p42/p44 MAPK activation and CD54 expression, two well established effects of TNF (56Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar), were assessed. Fig. 4 shows that p42/p44 MAPK activation, observed after 15 min of exposure to TNF, appeared unaffected in ICD cells as compared with normal cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the expression of adhesion molecules such as CD54 triggered by TNF on fibroblasts was not abolished in deficient cells (Fig. 4B). Of note, ICD and normal cells expressed similar levels of TNF receptor 1 at the plasma membrane (44% versus 41% in ICD and control cells, respectively) (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that lysosomal enzymes are preferentially implicated in TNF-induced apoptotic pathways but do not interfere with other TNF activities. I-cell Disease Human Lymphoblasts and Murine Fibroblasts Are Also Resistant to Cell Death—To further evaluate the role of lysosomes in apoptosis, we investigated the lethal effect of CD95, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily (57Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cells derived from patients affected with ICD. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, the dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of an agonistic anti-CD95 antibody was considerably reduced in ICD lymphoblasts. The resistance of ICD lymphoblasts was further confirmed by examining the cytotoxic effect of recombinant CD95 ligand (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that the resistance of ICD cells to death inducers is not cell-type specific. We then analyzed the respo"

The molecular nature of multimerin 1 factor V binding has not been determined, although multimerin 1 is known to interact with the factor V light chain. We investigated the region in factor V important for multimerin 1 binding using modified enzyme-linked immunoassays and recombinant factor V constructs. Factor V constructs lacking the C2 region or entire light chain had impaired and absent multimerin 1 binding, respectively, whereas the B domain deleted construct had modestly reduced binding. Analyses of point mutated constructs indicated that the multimerin 1 binding site in the C2 domain of factor V partially overlaps the phosphatidylserine binding site and that the factor V B domain enhances multimerin 1 binding. Multimerin 1 did not inhibit factor V phosphatidylserine binding, and it bound to phosphatidylserine independently of factor V. There was a reduction in factor V in complex with multimerin 1 after activation, and thrombin cleavage significantly reduced factor V binding to multimerin 1. In molar excess, multimerin 1 minimally reduced factor V procoagulant activity in prothrombinase assays and only if it was added before factor V activation. The dissociation of factor V-multimerin 1 complexes following factor V activation suggests a role for multimerin 1 in delivering and localizing factor V onto platelets prior to prothrombinase assembly.

The dissociation of factor V-multimerin 1 complexes following factor V activation suggests a role for multimerin 1 in delivering and localizing factor V onto platelets prior to prothrombinase assembly. Activated coagulation factor V is a key non-enzymatic cofactor that is an essential component of the prothrombinase complex (1Kane W.H. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N.

The active form of factor V, factor Va, is generated through consecutive cleavages by thrombin or factor Xa at residues Arg-709, Arg-1018, and Arg-1545, which produce factor Va heterodimers containing a heavy chain (A1 and A2 domains) and light chain (A3, C1, and C2 domains). The B domain of factor V, which facilitates thrombin cleavage and enhances factor V anticoagulant activity, is released on activation (3Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J.

Several differences have been noted in the functional properties of platelet and plasma factor V (reviewed in Ref. 12Gould W.R. Silveira J.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol.

Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia2001: 157-169Google Scholar), but the contributions of MMRN1 1 to these differences are unknown. MMRN1 is recognized to bind factor V, factor Va, and the isolated light chain of factor Va (11Hayward C.P. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cieutat A.M. Moore J.C. Bainton D.F. Nesheim M.E. Kelton J.G.

Studies of activated platelets show that factor V-MMRN1 complexes dissociate after exposure to thrombin (11Hayward C.P. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cieutat A.M. Moore J.C. Bainton D.F. Nesheim M.E.

Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is notable in light of the ∼40% amino acid sequence similarity shared by factor V and factor VIII in their light chain domains, which contain homologous regions for binding to phosphatidylserine (PS), and in factor VIII, the binding site for VWF (13Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

However, despite similarities between factors V and VIII, no significant homology has been found between MMRN1 and VWF, the multimeric proteins that bind these cofactors (15Hayward C.P. Hassell J.A.

Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A β-sheet protruding loop in the factor Va C2 domain containing two tryptophan residues (Trp-2063 and Trp-2064) was identified to be a key region for these functions (17Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H.

The intent of our present study was to identify the region of factor V important for MMRN1 binding and its possible overlap with the factor Va phospholipid binding site in the C2 domain. We report that the factor V light chain and its C2 region are important for MMRN1 binding and that the binding of factor V to MMRN1 is enhanced by the B domain. We also report that activation of factor V by thrombin alters the binding of factor V to MMRN1, analogous to the way activation of factor VIII alters its binding to VWF (13Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman Factor V Constructs—Recombinant factor V constructs that were tested for MMRN1 binding included full-length wild-type factor V and constructs lacking the B domain (dB), the entire light chain (dLC), C2 region of the light chain (dC2), both C2 and B domains (dBC2) (16Ortel T.L. Devore-Carter D. Quinn-Allen M. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4189-4198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a dB chimera construct that contained the C2 region of factor VIII (chimera) (20Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Keller F.G. Peterson J.A. Larocca D. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15898-15905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also tested were 30 dB constructs with charge to alanine point mutations in the C2 domain (18Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), three full-length constructs containing altered residues in the N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence (21Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13584-13591Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and four full-length constructs with mutated residues in the phospholipid-binding loop of the C2 domain (17Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) and Binding Assays—Recombinant MMRN1 free of human factor V was expressed, affinity purified, and quantitated as described previously (22Hayward C.P. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for use in binding assays. The recombinant MMRN1 contained 18.5 μg of MMRN1 per unit of antigen (amount contained in 109 pooled normal platelets) (10Hayward C.P. Fuller N. Zheng S. Adam F. Jeimy S. Horsewood I. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kane W.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 92: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because of variability in MMRN1 polymer size, molar concentrations of recombinant MMRN1 were calculated based on the amounts of MMRN1 subunits (average subunit size was 186 kDa).For ELISA, microtitre plates (Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplate number 442404, Corning Life Sciences, Concord, MA) were blocked (2 h at room temperature) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Samples were diluted in the same buffer with 0.05% Tween (PBST-BSA), and 3 mm CaCl2 was added for thrombin cleavage experiments. Wells were washed three times with PBST between incubations (1 h at room temperature).Factor V constructs used for binding assays were quantitated by a modification of a previously described ELISA (23Hayward C.P. Weiss H.J. Lages B. Finlay M. Hegstad A.C. Zheng S. Cowie A. Masse J.M. Harrison P. Cramer E.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in which the human factor V heavy chain antibody HC-5146 (1 μg/well, Haemtech Technologies, Inc., Essex Junction, VT) was substituted for factor V detection. To test MMRN1 binding to factor V, the assay was further modified as follows: factor V (10 ng/well) was immobilized by polyclonal capture (1 μg/well sheep anti-human factor V, Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, ON), before serial incubations with MMRN1 (0.5 μg/well), monoclonal antibody JS-1 (0.2 μg/well) (22Hayward C.P. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (0.04 μg/well, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), and the peroxidase substrate Colorburst® Blue (100 μl/well, Alerchek, Inc., Portland, ME). Additional assays were conducted to test possible overlap between the MMRN1 binding site and characterized C2 domain epitopes (17Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) recognized by monoclonal antibodies HV-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) which blocks factor Va PS-binding and procoagulant activity, and 6A5, which inhibits factor Va procoagulant activity (20Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Keller F.G. Peterson J.A. Larocca D. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15898-15905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these assays, captured factor V was preincubated with 10 μg/ml antibody or control, normal mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.. San Francisco, CA), and bound MMRN1 was detected using rabbit anti-MMRN1 (1: 1000 dilution, (22Hayward C.P. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) followed by peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (0.04 μg/well, Jackson Immunoresearch). Any measured background binding of MMRN1 to wells without added factor V was subtracted from test results. Wells without added factor V or MMRN1 confirmed the specificity of binding assays for factor V-MMRN1 complexes, as they typically bound <1% of the added binding protein.Factor V binding to immobilized MMRN1 was tested using non-treated polystyrene microtiter plates (Corning Life Sciences, number 3631), which gave no detectable background factor V binding. For this assay, wells were precoated with affinity-purified recombinant MMRN1 (1 μg/well) before adding factor V (5 ng/well). Bound factor V was quantitated using HC-5146, as in the modified factor V ELISA. Analyses of wells without added MMRN1 or factor V confirmed the specificity of this assay for factor V-MMRN1 complexes. For some experiments, recombinant factor V was pretreated with or without 1 unit/ml thrombin (37 °C for 20 min in PBST-BSA containing 3 mm CaCl2, Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and the binding of factor V, Va, and the B domain to MMRN1 was evaluated using monoclonal antibodies against the B domain (0.1 μg/well MK-30, Ref. 24Dahlback B. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1984; 10: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), heavy chain (1 μg/well HC5146), or light chain (1 μg/well 6A5). Western blotting (samples analyzed with heavy and light chain antibodies after separation on reduced 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels) confirmed full cleavage of factor V in the thrombin-treated samples. Results for all binding assays were expressed as a percentage of value obtained for the corresponding wild-type factor V (full-length or dB) or untreated full-length wild-type factor V for the thrombin cleavage experiments.The effect of thrombin on preformed factor V-MMRN1 complexes was evaluated using a previously described ELISA (23Hayward C.P. Weiss H.J. Lages B. Finlay M. Hegstad A.C. Zheng S. Cowie A. Masse J.M. Harrison P. Cramer E.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, factor V-MMRN1 complexes were generated in vitro by preincubating 1 μg/ml MMRN1 with 0–100 ng/ml of full-length or dB wild-type factor V (30 min for 37 °C) before adding thrombin (0 or 1 units/ml final concentration in 25 mm Tris-HCl with 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, 10 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4, 37 °C for 20 min) and assaying for residual complexes.Phospholipid Binding Assay—MMRN1 and factor V binding to phospholipids was studied using microtiter wells precoated with 3 μg/ml bovine brain l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (Sigma) as described previously (16Ortel T.L. Devore-Carter D. Quinn-Allen M. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4189-4198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. MMRN1 bound to PS was detected with JS-1 and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Factor V (wild-type and dB) bound to PS was detected using sheep anti-human factor V (1 μg/well) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (0.04 μg/well, Jackson Immunoresearch). For some determinations, factor V (100 ng/ml wild-type or dB) was tested after a 2-h preincubation with affinity-purified recombinant MMRN1 (0–22 μg/ml). Analysis of wells without PS confirmed that these assays measured protein binding to PS.Prothrombinase Assays—Phospholipid vesicles used for prothrombinase assays were prepared using 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-choline (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL), and phospholipid concentrations were determined as described (25Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5714-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids (3:1 ratio of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine) were suspended in chloroform, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer with 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 10 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4. Lipid suspensions were passed several times through a membrane extruder (Liposofast, Avestin, Inc. Ottawa, Ontario) equipped with polycarbonate filters to produce vesicles with an average diameter of 100 nm.Factor V procoagulant activity was examined by prothrombinase assays described previously (18Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with minor modifications, using recombinant wild-type factor V and final concentrations of 0.5–20 μm phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles, 1.4 μm prothrombin (Haemtech Technologies, Inc.), and 5 nm factor Xa (Haemtech Technologies, Inc.). The purified MMRN1 for these assays was stored in 10 mg/ml BSA/PBS to minimize losses. Factor V (0–400 pm to provide 0–40 pm final concentration in prothrombinase reactions) was tested after preincubation (30 min at 37 °C) without or with a molar excess of purified MMRN1 (up to 4 μg/ml final concentration after sample dilution in prothrombinase reactions, which was ∼400 times the molar amount of factor V and more than the 20-fold molar excess of MMRN1: factor V in platelets (10Hayward C.P. Fuller N. Zheng S. Adam F. Jeimy S. Horsewood I. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kane W.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 92: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). After the preincubation, factor V was activated with thrombin (5 nm final concentration, 37 °C) before adding 1 μm of the irreversible thrombin inhibitor Pefabloc® SC (Roche Applied Science, Laval, Quebec) and diluting samples 10-fold to measure factor Va procoagulant activity. For other determinations, MMRN1 (same final concentrations) was added after factor V activation by thrombin. Results for prothrombinase assays were expressed as the percentage of factor Va activity for samples without added MMRN1.Statistical Analysis—Analyses of variance followed by Fischer's test of least significant difference were used to determine which mutant factor V constructs had significantly reduced MMRN1 binding relative to the corresponding full-length or dB wild-type factor V and the MMRN1 concentrations that reduced factor V binding to PS. Paired, one-tailed Student's t tests were used to determine whether factor V C2 domain antibodies inhibited MMRN1 binding, whether thrombin treatment reduced factor V-MMRN1 binding and dissociated preformed factor V-MMRN1 complexes, and whether MMRN1 inhibited factor Va activity in prothrombinase assays.RESULTSBinding of MMRN1 to Factor V Constructs—Analyses of MMRN1-factor V binding using the assay with immobilized factor V indicated that some domain deleted forms of factor V had impaired MMRN1 binding. Although the dB construct had mildly reduced MMRN1 binding, the dC2 construct had only 10% residual binding, and the dLC, dBC2 constructs, and the chimera construct had no detectable MMRN1 binding (Fig. 1, p < 0.05).Analyses of the point-mutated, full-length constructs confirmed that the factor V C2 region contained residues important for MMRN1 binding. Four site-directed, full-length C2 mutant constructs had reduced MMRN1 binding (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05). Of these, constructs with mutations at residues W2063 and W2064, which are important for high-affinity binding of factor V to PS (17Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2000; 11: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), had about 20% less MMRN1 binding (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05). A similar decrease in MMRN1 binding was evident for a construct with an S → T substitution at residue 2183 (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05). This substitution has been shown previously to increase the efficiency of N-linked glycosylation at position 2181, which impaired factor V-PS binding (21Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B.

Bars show means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Constructs with significantly reduced MMRN1 binding relative to WT FV (A) and dB FV (B) are indicated (*, p < 0.05), and of these the constructs known to be misfolded (described in Ref. 18Kim S.W.

Seven C2 mutant constructs with reduced MMRN1 binding (indicated in Fig. 2B) were reported previously to be incorrectly folded (18Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that their abnormal MMRN1 binding could be an artifact. Further evaluation of the MMRN1 binding properties of full-length and dB point mutated factor V constructs using the binding assay with immobilized MMRN1 (data not shown) confirmed results obtained by assays of MMRN1 binding to immobilized factor V. Together, the data implied that the MMRN1 binding site in the C2 domain of factor V involved four discontinuous segments, including residue 2187 and regions between residues 2060–2080, 2114–2116, and 2157–2161 (Fig. 2B). Only part of the region implicated in MMRN1 binding overlapped PS and HV-1 binding sites (Fig. 2B).In PS binding assays, MMRN1 was identified to bind to PS independently of factor V (Fig. 3A). In addition, MMRN1 did not significantly reduce the binding of full-length (Fig. 3B, p = 0.3) and dB (data not shown) factor V to PS, even at high concentrations (Fig. 3B, 400-fold molar excess of MMRN1 to factor V). Nonetheless, antibody HV-1, which blocks factor V binding to PS, significantly reduced MMRN1 binding to factor V (p < 0.01), whereas antibody 6A5 and normal mouse IgG did not (Fig. 4). When factor V residues important in binding HV-1 and 6A5, MMRN1, and PS were highlighted in a three-dimensional model of the factor V C2 domain (Fig. 5), the MMRN1 binding site was identified to be distinct from the 6A5 binding site, and it spanned a region that overlapped but was larger than the site important for PS binding and procoagulant function.Fig. 3Binding of MMRN1 and wild-type FV to immobilized PS. In A, MMRN1 binding (without added FV) to wells precoated with (+) or without (-) PS is indicated by OD450.In B, FV binding to PS was measured after preincubation without or with MMRN1 (up to 400-fold molar excess of MMRN1) and expressed as the percentage bound without MMRN1 (means ± S.E. of three independent experiments). MMRN1 binding to PS occurred without FV (A) and MMRN1 did not significantly inhibit FV binding to PS (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Inhibitory effects of FV C2 domain antibodies on FV-MMRN1 binding. FV was preincubated with the monoclonal antibodies HV-1, 6A5, or control mouse IgG before evaluating MMRN1 binding. Data are shown as the % of binding without antibody (means ± S.E. of three independent experiments). Only HV-1 significantly reduced MMRN1 binding to FV (**, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Location of MMRN1 binding sites on the crystal structure of the C2 domain of FV. (The three-dimensional structure data for the C2 domain of factor V can be accessed through the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank under accession code 1CZT.) Highlighted in the upper panel are residues involved in binding MMRN1 (blue, excludes residues associated with misfolded mutations), 6A5 (green), and other residues not involved in MMRN1 binding (yellow). The lower panel indicates 6A5 (green), HV-1 (purple), and PS (purple) binding residues. Models on the left have been rotated 180° relative to those on the right. Regions in FV important in MMRN1 binding overlapped but were larger than the areas important for PS and HV-1 binding.

Following thrombin activation, wild-type factor V (Fig. 6) and point mutated constructs (not shown) showed significantly reduced MMRN1 binding (p < 0.01) in assays that used antibodies against the heavy chain and light chain to detect bound factor V and Va. The assay that used the factor V B domain antibody to detect components bound to MMRN1 showed more striking reductions after thrombin cleavage (Fig. 6, p < 0.001), further suggesting that the light chain was more important than the B domain for MMRN1 binding.
