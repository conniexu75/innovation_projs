https://openalex.org/W2066696278,"We have identified proteins that interact with H-Ras using a two hybrid system screen of a mouse cDNA library. Approximately 50% of the clones identified encoded portions of the c-Raf and A-Raf serine/threonine kinases. Overlaps among these clones define a conserved 81 residue region of the N-terminus of Raf as the Ras interaction region. We show that Raf interacts with wild-type and activated Ras, but not with an effector domain mutant of Ras or with a dominant-interfering Ras mutant. Using purified bacterially expressed fusion proteins, we show, furthermore, that Ras and the N-terminal region of Raf associate directly in vitro and that this interaction is dependent on GTP bound to Ras."

https://openalex.org/W1967413976,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) interacts with cells through two types of binding molecules, IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1R I) and IL-1R II. The function of IL-1R II is unknown. In studies using monoclonal antibodies, IL-1 prolonged the in vitro survival of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) through IL-1R I, and IL-4 antagonized the action of IL-1 by inducing expression and release of IL-1R II. Dexamethasone also induced expression and release of the IL-1R II in PMN. These results, together with the effect of antibodies to IL-1R on IL-1-induced production of cytokines in monocytes, indicate that IL-1 acts on myelomonocytic cells through IL-1R I and that IL-1R II inhibits IL-1 activity by acting as a decoy target for IL-1. The existence of multiple pathways of regulation emphasizes the need for tight control of IL-1 action."

https://openalex.org/W2054526083,"The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk, formerly bpk or atk), is crucial for B cell development. Loss of kinase activity results in the human immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, characterized by a failure to produce B cells. In the murine X-linked immunodeficiency (XID), B cells are present but respond abnormally to activating signals. The Btk gene, btk, was mapped to the xid region of the mouse X chromosome by interspecific backcross analysis. A single conserved residue within the amino terminal unique region of Btk was mutated in XID mice. This change in xid probably interferes with normal B cell signaling mediated by Btk protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2035614594,"The role of genetics in male sexual orientation was investigated by pedigree and linkage analyses on 114 families of homosexual men. Increased rates of same-sex orientation were found in the maternal uncles and male cousins of these subjects, but not in their fathers or paternal relatives, suggesting the possibility of sex-linked transmission in a portion of the population. DNA linkage analysis of a selected group of 40 families in which there were two gay brothers and no indication of nonmaternal transmission revealed a correlation between homosexual orientation and the inheritance of polymorphic markers on the X chromosome in approximately 64 percent of the sib-pairs tested. The linkage to markers on Xq28, the subtelomeric region of the long arm of the sex chromosome, had a multipoint lod score of 4.0 (P = 10-5), indicating a statistical confidence level of more than 99 percent that at least one subtype of male sexual orientation is genetically influenced."
https://openalex.org/W1990073151,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to cellular receptors is required for the survival of some neural cells. In contrast to TrkA, the high-affinity NGF receptor that transduces NGF signals for survival and differentiation, the function of the low-affinity NGF receptor, p75NGFR, remains uncertain. Expression of p75NGFR induced neural cell death constitutively when p75NGFR was unbound; binding by NGF or monoclonal antibody, however, inhibited cell death induced by p75NGFR. Thus, expression of p75NGFR may explain the dependence of some neural cells on NGF for survival. These findings also suggest that p75NGFR has some functional similarities to other members of a superfamily of receptors that include tumor necrosis factor receptors, Fas (Apo-1), and CD40."

https://openalex.org/W1966408108,"Mice that bear the X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) mutation have a B lymphocyte-specific defect resulting in an inability to make antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens. A backcross of 1114 progeny revealed the colocalization of xid with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (btk) gene, which is implicated in the human immune deficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Mice that carry xid have a missense mutation that alters a highly conserved arginine near the amino-terminus of the btk protein, Btk. Because this region of Btk lies outside any obvious kinase domain, the xid mutation may define another aspect of tyrosine kinase function."
https://openalex.org/W2121070193,"The transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is expressed in multiple isoforms on all nucleated hematopoietic cells, resulting from alternative splicing of variable exons. We generated mice with a mutation in the variable CD45 exon 6, using homologous recombination. In mice homozygous for the CD45-exon6 mutation, B cells and most T cells did not express CD45. Development of B cells appeared normal, although Igμ-induced proliferation was completely abrogated. Thymocyte maturation was blocked at the transitional stage from Immature CD4+CD8+ to mature CD4+ or CD8+ cells, and only a few T cells could be detected in peripheral lymphoid organs. Clonal deletion of superantigen-reactive T cells still occurred. Cytotoxic T cell responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus were absent in CD45-exon6−/− mice. These data imply that CD45 is differentially required for the development and function of B and T lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2010035436,"The three-dimensional solution structure of a complex between the DNA binding domain of the chicken erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 and its cognate DNA site has been determined with multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The DNA binding domain consists of a core which contains a zinc coordinated by four cysteines and a carboxyl-terminal tail. The core is composed of two irregular antiparallel beta sheets and an alpha helix, followed by a long loop that leads into the carboxyl-terminal tail. The amino-terminal part of the core, including the helix, is similar in structure, although not in sequence, to the amino-terminal zinc module of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain. In the other regions, the structures of these two DNA binding domains are entirely different. The DNA target site in contact with the protein spans eight base pairs. The helix and the loop connecting the two antiparallel beta sheets interact with the major groove of the DNA. The carboxyl-terminal tail, which is an essential determinant of specific binding, wraps around into the minor groove. The complex resembles a hand holding a rope with the palm and fingers representing the protein core and the thumb, the carboxyl-terminal tail. The specific interactions between GATA-1 and DNA in the major groove are mainly hydrophobic in nature, which accounts for the preponderance of thymines in the target site. A large number of interactions are observed with the phosphate backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1995957606,"The primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to control movements of different body parts from somatotopically organized cortical territories. Electrical stimulation suggests, however, that territories controlling different fingers overlap. Such overlap might be artifactual or else might indicate that activation of M1 to produce a finger movement occurs over a more widespread cortical area than usually assumed. These possibilities were distinguished in monkeys moving different fingers. Recordings showed that single M1 neurons were active with movements of different fingers. Neuronal populations active with movements of different fingers overlapped extensively. Control of any finger movement thus appears to utilize a population of neurons distributed throughout the M1 hand area rather than a somatotopically segregated population."

https://openalex.org/W2046202438,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are highly polymorphic membrane glycoproteins that bind peptide fragments of proteins and display them for recognition by CD4+ T cells. To understand the effect of human MHC class II polymorphism on peptide-MHC interaction, we have isolated M13 phage from a large M13 peptide display library by selection with DRB1*0401 and DRB1*1101 molecules, as recently described for DRB1*0101. Sequence analysis of the peptide-encoding region of DR-bound phage led to the identification of position-specific anchor residues, defining motifs for peptide binding to DR molecules. The three DR motifs share two anchor residues at relative positions 1 and 4, while allele-specific anchor residues have been identified at position 6. These results provide a biophysical basis for both the promiscuity and the specificity of peptide recognition by DR molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2044336492,"Many cellular recognition events in the immune system are initiated by aggregation of cell surface receptors that lack intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Receptor-associated kinases related to the src protooncogene product have been found to be essential for cellular activation and may interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the antigen receptor chains. We show here that anti-CD16 antibody-mediated clustering of chimeric transmembrane proteins bearing a CD16 extracellular domain and a Src family kinase intracellular domain is not sufficient to initiate a cellular activation signal in T cells, whereas clustering of similar chimeras bearing Syk or ZAP-70 kinase sequences triggers calcium mobilization. Aggregation of the Syk chimera alone, or coaggregation of chimeras bearing Fyn and ZAP-70 kinases, suffices to initiate cytolytic effector function. The pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by clustering of the Syk chimera is similar to the pattern induced by aggregation of T cell receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1974976899,"Concentrations of plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) are inversely correlated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The two most abundant protein constituents of HDL are apolipoproteins A-I and A-II (apoA-I and apoA-II). ApoA-I is required for assembly of HDL and, when overexpressed in transgenic mice, confers resistance to early atherosclerosis. The present studies reveal that transgenic mice that overexpress mouse apoA-II had elevated HDL-cholesterol concentrations but, nevertheless, exhibited increased atherosclerotic lesion development as compared to normal mice. The HDL in the transgenic mice was larger and had an increased ratio of apoA-II to apoA-I. Thus, both the composition and amount of HDL appear to be important determinants of atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2076606225,"In this study we describe the cellular distribution of the SH2 and SH3 domains of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) and of the adaptor protein GRB2 following their microinjection into living rat embryo fibroblasts. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that a truncated protein composed of the SH2 and SH3 domains of PLC-gamma was localized to the actin cytoskeleton. A similar localization pattern was observed when only the SH3 domain of PLC-gamma was microinjected. In contrast, a truncated protein composed of only the SH2 domains of PLC-gamma exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Microinjected GRB2 protein was localized primarily to membrane ruffles, as was GRB2 protein containing SH2 loss-of-function point mutations. Hence, the localization of GRB2 to membrane ruffles does not require interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated moieties. However, GRB2 proteins with SH3 loss-of-function point mutations exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. These results indicate that SH3 domains are responsible for the targeting of signaling molecules to specific subcellular locations."
https://openalex.org/W2006287134,"Microinjection of antibodies against a synthetic peptide of a non-clathrin-coated vesicle-associated coat protein, beta-COP, blocks transport of a temperature-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (ts-O45-G) to the cell surface. Transport is inhibited upon release of the viral glycoprotein from temperature blocks at 39.5 degrees C (endoplasmic reticulum [ER]) and 15 degrees C (intermediate compartment), but not at 20 degrees C (trans-Golgi network). Ts-O45-G is arrested in tubular membrane structures containing p53 at the interface of the ER and the Golgi stack. This is consistent with inhibition of acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance of ts-O45-G in injected cells. Secretion of endogenous proteins and maturation of cathepsin D are also inhibited. These data provide in vivo evidence that beta-COP has an important function in biosynthetic membrane traffic in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038644462,"Female-specific splicing of Drosophila doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA is regulated by the products of the transformer (tra) and transformer 2 (tra2) genes. In this paper we show that Tra and Tra2 act by recruiting general splicing factors to a regulatory element located downstream of a female-specific 3' splice site. Remarkably, Tra, Tra2, and members of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of general splicing factors are sufficient to commit dsx pre-mRNA to female-specific splicing, and individual SR proteins differ significantly in their ability to participate in commitment complex formation. Characterization of the proteins associated with affinity-purified complex formed on dsx pre-mRNA reveals the presence of Tra, Tra2, SR proteins, and additional unidentified components. We conclude that Tra, Tra2, and SR proteins are essential components of a splicing enhancer complex."

https://openalex.org/W2072168817,"It is thought that fish generate the power needed for steady swimming with their anterior musculature, whereas the posterior musculature only transmits forces to the tail and does negative work. Isolated red muscle bundles driven through the length changes and stimulation pattern that muscles normally undergo during steady swimming showed the opposite pattern. Most of the power for swimming came from muscle in the posterior region of the fish, and relatively little came from the anterior musculature. In addition, the contractile properties of the muscle along the length of the fish are significantly adapted to enhance power generation."
https://openalex.org/W1994503514,"In humans, the left side of the face (right hemisphere of the brain) is dominant in emotional expression. In rhesus monkeys, the left side of the face begins to display facial expression earlier than the right side and is more expressive. Humans perceive rhesus chimeras created by pairing the left half of the face with its mirror-reversed duplicate as more expressive than chimeras created by right-right pairings. That the right hemisphere determines facial expression, and the left hemisphere processes species-typical vocal signals, suggests that human and nonhuman primates exhibit the same pattern of brain asymmetry for communication."

https://openalex.org/W1979936737,"Structure determination of macromolecules in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy involves the fitting of atomic models to the observed nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data. Complete cross-validation has been used to define reliable and unbiased criteria for the quality of solution NMR structures. The method is based on the partitioning of NOE data into test sets and the cross-validation of statistical quantities for each of the test sets. A high correlation between cross-validated measures of fit, such as distance bound violations and NMR R values, and the quality of solution NMR structures was observed. Less complete data resulted in poorer satisfaction of the cross-validated measures of fit. Optimization of cross-validated measures of fit will likely produce solution NMR structures with maximal information content."
https://openalex.org/W1989320161,"The primary function of lung surfactant is to form monolayers at the alveolar interface capable of lowering the normal surface tension to near zero. To accomplish this process, the surfactant must be capable of maintaining a coherent, tightly packed monolayer that avoids collapse during expiration. The positively charged amino-terminal peptide SP-B1-25 of lung surfactant-specific protein SP-B increases the collapse pressure of an important component of lung surfactant, palmitic acid (PA), to nearly 70 millinewtons per meter. This alteration of the PA isotherms removes the driving force for ""squeeze-out"" of the fatty acids from the primarily dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monolayers of lung surfactant. An uncharged mutant of SP-B1-25 induced little change in the isotherms, suggesting that a specific charge interaction between the cationic peptide and the anionic lipid is responsible for the stabilization. The effect of SP-B1-25 on fatty acid isotherms is remarkably similar to that of simple poly-cations, suggesting that such polymers might be useful as components of replacement surfactants for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2111622916,"The temperature sensitivity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) from T. californica was used to identify steps in AChR subunit folding and oligomerization. Assembly intermediates were isolated by lowering to an assembly-permissive temperature. The earliest identifiable assembly intermediates, alpha beta gamma trimers, form minutes after subunit synthesis. alpha beta gamma delta tetramers are formed slowly by the addition of delta subunits to trimers, and finally a second alpha subunit is added to form alpha 2 beta gamma delta pentamers. Between these oligomerization steps, subunits fold as monitored by alpha-bungarotoxin-binding site formation, appearance of antigenic epitopes, changes in apparent molecular weight, and changes in detergent solubility. Subunit folding requires specific combinations of subunits and correlates in time with subunit additions, suggesting that these subunit folding events contribute to subunit recognition site formation during assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2059297143,"Transcription initiation factor TFIIB recruits RNA polymerase II to the promoter subsequent to interaction with a preformed TFIID-promoter complex. The domains of TFIIB required for binding to the TFIID-promoter complex and for transcription initiation have been determined. The carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of TFIIB, which contains two direct repeats and two basic residue repeats, is sufficient for interaction with the TFIID-promoter complex. An extra 84-residue amino-terminal region, with no obvious known structural motifs, is required for basal transcription activity. Basic residues within the second basic repeat of TFIIB are necessary for stable interaction with the TFIID-promoter complex, whereas the basic character of the first basic repeat is not. Functional roles of other potential structural motifs are discussed in light of the present study."

https://openalex.org/W2073027158,"The phenotype of the autosomal recessive mutation scat includes severe intermittent bleeding, depletion of platelets, and circulating anti-platelet antibodies. In this study, we have mapped the scat mutation to mouse chromosome 8 and shown that the immune component is a secondary consequence of the gene defect. Surprisingly, the phenotype of the scat/scat pups depends on the genotype of the mother. Maternal homozygosity prevents disease transmission; crosses between scat homozygotes produce few affected young, while the expected frequency is generated from normal (+/+) mice bearing scat/scat ovaries. The results suggest a novel method of maternal-fetal interaction that relies neither on transfer of maternal mitochondria nor on parental imprinting. We conclude that contribution from the maternal wild-type allele is required for expression of the scat phenotype in homozygotes."
