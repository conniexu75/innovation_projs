Unfortunately, the technological and methodological advances of the past two decades have outpaced the accrual of data, which is particularly challenging given the relatively few centers that have the necessary facilities and capabilities. The PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) addresses this challenge by aggregating independently acquired non-human primate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets and openly sharing them via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI). Here, we present the rationale, design, and procedures for the PRIME-DE consortium, as well as the initial release, consisting of 25 independent data collections aggregated across 22 sites (total = 217 non-human primates). We also outline the unique pitfalls and challenges that should be considered in the analysis of non-human primate MRI datasets, including providing automated quality assessment of the contributed datasets.

Translational, comparative neuroscience research enables a bridging of knowledge gaps across species as well as invasive and noninvasive approaches. A growing body of research has documented the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies to support in vivo examination of brain organization and function in non-human primates (Vanduffel et al., 2014Vanduffel W.

These advances are timely given the growing prominence of large-scale national and international initiatives focused on advancing our understanding of human brain organization and the ability to generate novel therapeutics for neurology and psychiatry (Bargmann and Newsome, 2014Bargmann C.I. Newsome W.T. The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative and neurology.JAMA Neurol. 2014; 71: 675-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite the clear demonstrations of feasibility and utility, the field of non-human primate neuroimaging is still developing. Numerous unique challenges related to the acquisition and processing of non-human primate data are still being addressed (e.g., Seidlitz et al., 2018bSeidlitz J. Sponheim C. Glen D. Ye F.Q. Saleem K.S. Leopold D.A. Ungerleider L. Messinger A.

Perhaps most challenging is the limited availability of data. Here, we introduce the PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) to create an open science resource for the neuroimaging community that will facilitate the mapping of the non-human primate connectome. To accomplish this, we aggregate a combination of anatomical, functional, and diffusion MRI datasets from laboratories throughout the world and make these data available to the scientific community. It merits emphasis that PRIME-DE supports an ongoing process that will remain open to new contributions of data from macaques and other non-human primate species. At present, PRIME-DE contains 25 collections aggregated across 22 sites; to date, data from 217 primates are included (see Table 1 for information on each institution). Contributions will continue to be accepted and shared on a rolling basis.Table 1Experimental DesignInvestigatorsSpeciesaDetailed species information is available on the PRIME-DE site and in Navarrete et al., 2018SubjectsStateContrast AgentStructural T1Structural T2Resting State fMRINaturalistic Viewing fMRITask fMRIField mapDiffusion MRIAMUBelin, Brochier, SeinMM4AnesthetizedNo✔✔––––✔CaltechRajimehr, TsaoMM2AwakeYes–––96 min–––ECNU (C)Aihua ChenMM10AnesthetizedNo✔––––––ECNU (K)bECNU (K) provided magnetic resonance spectroscopyKwok, ZhouMM4AnesthetizedNo✔✔8 min–––✔Institute of Neuroscience (IoN)WangMM, MF8AnesthetizedNo✔–20–40 min––✔–Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc JeannerodBen Hamed, HibaMM8Anesthetized/AwakeYes✔–✔–✔–✔Lyon Neuroscience Research CenterHadj-Bouziane, Meunier, GuedjMM1Anesthetized/AwakeYes/No✔✔13 min––––McGill UniversityMok, Rudko, ShmuelMM, MF3AnesthetizedNo✔✔–––––Mount Sinai (P)Croxson, FleysherMM, MF9AnesthetizedNo✔✔43 min––✔✔Mount Sinai (S)Croxson, Fleysher, Froudist-Walsh, Damatac, NagyMM5AnesthetizedNo✔✔––––✔NKISchroeder, MilhamMM2Anesthetized/AwakeYes/No✔76–155 min55–345 min–––NIMH (L)cThe usage agreement is DUA for those sites, CC-BY-NC-SA for all other sitesLeopold, RussMM3AwakeYes✔✔30–150 min170 min–––NIMH (M)cThe usage agreement is DUA for those sites, CC-BY-NC-SA for all other sites,dNIMH (M) provided cortical thickness and brain templateMessinger, Jung, Seidlitz, UngerleiderMM3Anesthetized/AwakeYes✔–10−15 min––––Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN)Klink, RoelfsemaMM2AnesthetizedNo✔✔9.7 min––––NeuroSpinJarraya, DehaeneMM3AnesthetizedYes/No✔–✔––––NewcastlePetkov, Nacef, Thiele, Poirier, Balezeau, Griffiths, Schmid, RiosMM14Anesthetized/AwakeNo✔✔21.6 min––––OHSUSullivan, FairMM2AnesthetizedYes/No✔✔480 min––––PrincetonKastner, PinskMM2Anesthetized✔✔–––✔✔RockefellerSchwiedrzik, Freiwald, ZarcoMM, MF6AnesthetizedYes✔–80 min––✔SBRIProcyk, Wilson, AmiezMM, MF22AnesthetizedNo✔✔✔––––UC DavisBaxter, Croxson, MorrisonMM19AnesthetizedNo✔✔13.5 min––✔✔Univ. of Minnesota (UMN)Yacoub, HarelM2Anesthetized–✔–27 min––✔✔Univ. of OxfordcThe usage agreement is DUA for those sites, CC-BY-NC-SA for all other sitesSallet, Mars, RushworthMM20AnesthetizedNo✔–53.43 min––––NIN Primate Brain Bank/Utrecht UniversityNavarrete, Blezer, Todorov, Lindenfors, Laland, ReaderMultiplea51Post-mortemYes/No✔––––––Univ. of Western Ontario (UWO)Everling, MenonMM12AnesthetizedNo✔✔60 min––––General information about PRIME-DE data collections contributed prior to the time of publication.

For species information, MM: Macaca mulatta; MF: Macaca fascicularis; M: Macaca. To promote usage of a standardized data format, we organized all data using the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format (Gorgolewski et al., 2017Gorgolewski K.J. Alfaro-Almagro F. Auer T. Bellec P. Capotă M. Chakravarty M.M. Churchill N.W. Cohen A.L. Craddock R.C. Devenyi G.A. et al.BIDS apps: improving ease of use, accessibility, and reproducibility of neuroimaging data analysis methods.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005209Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All PRIME-DE datasets can be accessed through the PRIME-DE site (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html). Prior to downloading the data, users are required to establish a user account on NITRC and register with the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI; anticipated time: <1 min). With one exception, for each of the PRIME-DE collections, at least one structural MRI (sMRI) is available for each unique ID number (see Table 1). Eighteen of the collections contain at least one corresponding resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) dataset, and three of the collections contain naturalistic viewing fMRI (NV-fMRI). In addition, one collection from the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH (M)) also provided cortical thickness data and R-fMRI data aligned to an anatomical template. Corresponding diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets are available for nine collections. Field map images for fMRI correction are available for six collections. Consistent with its popularity in the imaging community and prior usage in INDI efforts, the NIFTI file format was selected for storage of the PRIME-DE MRI datasets. Table 2 lists the specific MRI scanners and head coils utilized for each collection. Specific MRI sequence parameters for the various data collections are summarized in Tables S1, S2, S3, and S4 and detailed on the PRIME-DE website. Across collections, R-fMRI acquisition durations varied from 8 to 155 min per subject. In two collections, subjects were in an awake state. In five collections, subjects were scanned both awake and under anesthesia. One collection scanned 51 post-mortem specimens. In the remaining 17 collections, subjects were scanned under anesthesia. For the three collections with NV-FMRI, acquisition durations varied from 55 to 375 min. See Figures 3 and 4 for example structural and functional images from the different sites aligned in a common space.Table 2Scanner InformationSiteManufacturerModelField Strength (T)Head coil # channelsAMUSiemensPrisma3Body transmit array, 11 cm loop receiving coilCaltechSiemensTim Trio38ECNU (C)SiemensTim Trio3–ECNU (K)SiemensTim Trio31-channel surface coilInstitute of Neuroscience (IoN)SiemensTim Trio38-channel phased-array transceiver coilsInstitut des Sciences Cognitives Marc JeannerodSiemensSonata/Prisma1.5/38-channel custom head coils/association of independent circular coilsLyon Neuroscience Research CenterSiemensSonata/Prisma1.5/3Custom-made 10 cm loop receiving coil 2 × L11 and 1 × L7 Siemens loop-receiving coilMcGill UniversitySiemensTim Trio3Custom-made 8-channel phased-array receive coilMount Sinai (P)PhilipsAchieva3Single loop receive coil (T1 and T2) 4-channel phased-array receive, transmit through body coil (resting state and diffusion)Mount Sinai (S)SiemensSkyra38-channel phased-array receive with a single loop transmitNKISiemensTim Trio3Custom-made 8-channel phased-array receive coil (KU Leuven) with a custom 16-channel pre-amplifier (MRcoils)NIMH (L)BrukerBiospecVertical4.78NIMH (M)BrukerBiospecVertical4.71–4Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN)PhilipsIngenia3Custom-made 8-channel phased-array receive coil (KU Leuven) with a custom 16-channel pre-amplifier (MRcoils).NeuroSpinSiemensTim Trio/PrismaFit31chTxRxcoil/1Tx-8RxchcoilNewcastleBrukerVertical Bruker4.74–8OHSUSiemensTim Trio3Knee coil 15 channelPrincetonSiemensPrisma VE11C3Siemens Loop Coil, Large (11 cm)RockefellerSiemensTIM Trio + AC88 gradient38-channel phased-array receive with a single-loop transmitSBRISiemensSonata/Prisma1.5/3Custom made 10 cm loop receiving coil 2 × L11 and 1 × L7 Siemens loop receiving coilUC DavisSiemensSkyra34Univ. of Minnesota (UMN)SiemensSyngoB17716-channel transmit/receive + 6 receive onlyUniv. of Oxford––3A four-channel phased-array coilNIN Primate Brain Bank/Utrecht UniversityVarian/SiemensSmall-bore scanner/Magnetom trio9.4/3–Univ. of Western Ontario (UWO)SiemensMagnetom7Custom-made 24-channel phased-array receive coil with an 8-channel transmit coilInformation on scanner and head coil for PRIME-DE data collections contributed prior to the time of publication.

Contributors to PRIME-DE will be able to set the sharing policy for their data in accord with their preferences and institutional requirements. For each sample, the contributor will set the sharing permissions for their data using one or more the following three policies:(1)Creative Commons – Attribution-Non-Commercial Share Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). Standard INDI data sharing policy. Prohibits use of the data for commercial purposes.(2)Creative Commons – Attribution (CC-BY) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Least restrictive data sharing policy.(3)Custom Data Usage Agreement. Users must complete a data usage agreement (DUA) prior to gaining access to the data. Contributors can customize the agreement as they see fit, including determining whether or not signatures from authorized institutional official are required prior to executing the DUA. Note: this option was created to facilitate potential contributors whose institution requires completion of a formal interinstitutional agreement in order to share non-human primate data. Of note, one lesson learned from the human neuroimaging literature is that such agreements are not dissuasive, as is evidenced by the success of the Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al., 2013Van Essen D.C. Smith S.M. Barch D.M. Behrens T.E.J. Yacoub E. Ugurbil K. WU-Minn HCP ConsortiumThe WU-Minn Human Connectome Project: an overview.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 62-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar) and the NKI-Rockland Sample (Nooner et al., 2012Nooner K.B. Colcombe S.J. Tobe R.H. Mennes M. Benedict M.M. Moreno A.L. Panek L.J. Brown S. Zavitz S.T. Li Q. et al.The NKI-Rockland sample: a model for accelerating the pace of discovery science in psychiatry.Front. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Consistent with the established policy of INDI, all data contributed to PRIME-DE was made available to users regardless of data quality; users should check data quality before inclusion in their analyses. The rationale of this decision has been the lack of consensus on optimal quality criteria in regards to specific measures or their combinations and cutoffs—a reality that is even more pronounced in non-human primate imaging given the variation in data quality and characteristics across scan protocols. Of note, a benefit of sharing data with differing levels of quality data is also important for those working to develop methods for evaluating, and at times overcoming, such variations. Following the tradition of recent INDI data-sharing consortia, a collection of automated, reference-free quality assurance measures, known as the Preprocessed Connectome Project Quality Assurance Protocol (PCP-QAP; Shehzad et al., 2015Shehzad Z. Giavasis S. Li Q. Benhajali Y. Yan C. Yang Z. Milham M. Bellec P. Craddock C.

These measures focus on structural and temporal (when appropriate) aspects of the datasets. Table 3 provides a brief description of the measures included, and Figures 1 and 2 depict a subset of QAP results (Magnotta et al., 2006Magnotta V.A. Friedman L.

As would be expected, measures of head motion are notably smaller for sites using anesthetized scan sessions than for awake (NIMH (L), NIMH (M), NKI, Newcastle, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center). Importantly, the measures provided are not intended to be definitive for the field or all encompassing; rather, they are included to spur interest in the potential utility and further development of automated measures.Table 3Description of PCP QAP MeasuresSpatial MetricsDescriptionReferencesContrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (sMRI only)MGM intensity—MWM intensity/SDair intensity.

An essential property of these stem cells is their ability to self-renew to preserve the size of the stem cell pool over time. However, the cellular mechanisms that regulate this homeostatic self-renewal remain poorly understood. It remains generally unclear how stem cell self-renewal is regulated in the context of continual cell turnover (e.g., differentiation, cell death, etc.) to buffer against excess or insufficient cell divisions, such as in cancer or degenerative diseases, respectively. Work with epithelial tissues ranging from cultured cells to the developing mouse and zebrafish epidermis suggests that proliferation drives the delamination of nearby cells through a density-dependent mechanism (Eisenhoffer et al., 2012Eisenhoffer G.T.

This coordination of behaviors is thought to maintain stem cell numbers and local density over time, allowing constitutive stem cell divisions to be compensated by the later exit of neighboring cells via delamination. We do not know whether this relationship between self-renewal and differentiation also occurs in fully developed adult tissues. The ability to investigate this question depends on the tracking of co-existing stem cells as they execute both differentiation and self-renewal behaviors. However, to date, this type of simultaneous, high-resolution spatiotemporal mapping of stem cell fates has not been possible in live adult mammals. The mouse skin epithelium offers a well-studied regenerative system in which to investigate the regulation of stem cell fates. Epidermal stem cells reside in an underlying basal layer, where they either self-renew within this compartment or differentiate by delaminating upward to contribute to the watertight barrier of the skin (Gonzales and Fuchs, 2017Gonzales K.A.U.

Collectively, these studies have shown that epidermal stem cells are equipotent, meaning they are equally capable to undergo self-renewal or terminal differentiation (Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E.

Spatiotemporal coordination of stem cell commitment during epidermal homeostasis.Science. 2016; 352: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Despite these advances in delineating stem cell potential, we still fail to understand the physiological cues of self-renewal in the context of other fate decisions taking place in neighboring stem cells as well as how these cues ensure a precise balance of stem cell activity. Here we sought to directly interrogate epidermal stem cell self-renewal in relation to other cell fate decisions taking place in the surrounding tissue. We used an innovative imaging approach to map the timing and location of all self-renewal and differentiation events taking place in large epidermal regions. By combining spatiotemporal mapping of cell fates with newly developed statistical analyses, we find that cell fate choices are locally coordinated, with a lag time of 1 to 2 days. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the developing epidermis (Miroshnikova et al., 2018Miroshnikova Y.A. Le H.Q. Schneider D. Thalheim T. Rübsam M. Bremicker N. Polleux J. Kamprad N. Tarantola M. Wang I. et al.Adhesion forces and cortical tension couple cell proliferation and differentiation to drive epidermal stratification.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we show that, during homeostasis, differentiation of epithelial stem cells from the basal epidermal layer leads to neighboring cell size increase, cell cycle progression, and, ultimately, cell division. Finally, we show that experimentally induced exit from the stem cell compartment is sufficient to drive local stem cell self-renewal. Altogether, this study identifies differentiation as the homeostatic driver of stem cell self-renewal in the mammalian epidermis. To begin to interrogate homeostatic regulation of stem cell self-renewal, we examined whether this behavior was occurring randomly with relation to surrounding stem cell activity. To address this question, we needed the ability to track every cell fate decision and evaluate it in the context of all other stem cell behaviors taking place around it. We therefore developed a spatiotemporal map of all division and differentiation events occurring within a large region of tissue and over a long period of time. Building upon the live imaging approaches developed in our lab (Rompolas et al., 2012Rompolas P. Deschene E.R. Zito G. Gonzalez D.G. Saotome I. Haberman A.M. Greco V.

Protoc. 2015; 10: 1116-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we devised a whole-tissue tracking approach based on serial revisits of the same epidermal tissue over time (Figure 1A). Using mice expressing epidermal cortical and nuclear fluorescent markers (K14-actinGFP [Vaezi et al., 2002Vaezi A. Bauer C. Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E.

Combining this imaging with the development of a semi-automated tracking method, we recorded 1,527 divisions and 1,540 differentiation events, representing a comprehensive record of all epidermal cell fate decisions across six regions from five mice (Figure 1A; Video S1). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/88f38a43-bb52-4276-8848-ea5488ee072b/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Right: result of whole cell population tracking. Colors represent clones from the initial timepoint, and the regions of colors represent the voronoi diagram calculated from the position of the cells (local maxima in K14-H2BCerulean signal intensity). 1 frame = 12 hours. With these data, we were able to test whether stem cells might control their rates of self-renewal in response to differentiation of neighboring stem cells or vice versa. We reasoned that the record of division and differentiation events would show whether such control occurs rapidly, leading to instantaneous fate balance, or slowly, leading to a lag in fate balance. It would also reveal whether stem cells respond directly to the fate of neighboring cells or indirectly to the integrated activity of many stem cells (Yamaguchi et al., 2017Yamaguchi H. Kawaguchi K. Sagawa T. Dynamical crossover in a stochastic model of cell fate decision.Phys. Rev. E. 2017; 96: 012401Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Finally, such data could also reveal whether cell fate probabilities are “hard-wired” in epidermal tissue (e.g., as odds of a coin flip), as proposed previously (Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E. Doupé D.P. Klein A.M. Winton D.J. Simons B.D. Jones P.H. A single type of progenitor cell maintains normal epidermis.Nature. 2007; 446: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, Simons and Clevers, 2011Simons B.D. Clevers H. Strategies for homeostatic stem cell self-renewal in adult tissues.Cell. 2011; 145: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In such a case, each stem cell would commit to its fate in an autonomous manner, with division and differentiation remaining only balanced over large fields of cells by the law of large numbers. We first determined whether stem cells were compensating for the activity of their neighbors at all, and if so, how quickly they did this. For this, we focused on the extent to which division and differentiation behaviors were imbalanced over time. Although we observed both behaviors occurring in each imaged region and at each 12-hr time point, the number of cells dividing and differentiating over a given 12-hr period varied widely. Moreover, there was a significant discrepancy between the number of cells performing each activity between time points (Figures 1A and 1B), indicating the absence of any fast or instantaneous compensatory response of stem cells over this short interval. However, when we extended our analysis to a window of 7 days, we found that division and differentiation events occurred in nearly equal numbers, suggesting that stem cells might be responding to the activity of their neighbors over this longer period of time. Importantly, the imbalance between division and differentiation events in small regions of the tissue (22.5 μm × 22.5 μm) was significantly closer to zero than would be expected if each stem cell were autonomously deciding to divide or differentiate (SD about zero of 2.9 events versus 5.7 events, p < 0.0001; see STAR Methods for details). This ruled out the possibility that stem cell fates are autonomous in the epidermis, as proposed previously and modeled by us and others (Klein and Simons, 2011Klein A.M. Simons B.D.

Spatiotemporal coordination of stem cell commitment during epidermal homeostasis.Science. 2016; 352: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Instead, they appear to invoke mechanisms to actively balance their fates over time. We then asked whether stem cells were responding to their local neighbors or to a broad neighborhood by scoring how often a cell behavior (division or differentiation) is close to another behavior that is the same or the opposite. Interestingly, we found that, within a 2-day window, nearest neighbor pairs of fate decision points were more likely to be opposite fates than would be expected by random chance (Figures 1C and 1D) (p < 0.0001, permutation test). Correspondingly, direct neighbors that execute the same fates were found less frequently than expected. Such coordination became weaker when looking at next-nearest neighbors but was still significant. Consistent with our previous work (Rompolas et al., 2016Rompolas P. Mesa K.R. Kawaguchi K. Park S. Gonzalez D. Brown S. Boucher J. Klein A.M. Greco V. Spatiotemporal coordination of stem cell commitment during epidermal homeostasis.Science. 2016; 352: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the fates of sibling pairs tended to be the same rather than the opposite. Together, these observations suggested that compensatory coordination between stem cell fates, which is key to balancing cell numbers over long periods of time, were occurring between neighboring pairs rather than between sibling pairs. To precisely quantify the timing and spatial extent over which stem cells sense and respond to activity in the tissue, we devised a quantitative test that reveals whether the imbalance between the number of division and differentiation events differs from a null “non-response” hypothesis over any given time interval and any area of tissue. The methodology of this test defines the imbalance between the number of division and differentiation events as a function of window size w and time t, ΔN(w,t) (Figure 2A). We quantified ΔN(w,t) at many different spatial positions and over time to calculate its fluctuation (or Var[ΔN(w,t)]) and then compared this fluctuation with a null hypothesis randomizing the location of all division and differentiation events (Figures S2A–S2C). Over a short time window (1 day) and after randomizing the location of all division and differentiation events, all cell fate choices appear to lack coordination, as expected (Figures 2B, 2C, S2D, and S2E). In contrast, at a 4-cell diameter (w = 4 cells, 27 μm), the variance of ΔN(w,t) departs clearly from random at later times (more than 2 days), indicating that stem cells are coordinating their behaviors within their local neighborhood (Figures 2B and 2C). Strikingly, even when considering smaller distances w and time periods of less than 3 days, the variance of ΔN(w,t) remains distinct from random (Figures 2B and 2C). Fitting Var[ΔN(w,t)] to a generalized stochastic model with a coordination length scale l and timescale τ, we found that the timescale of coordination was approximately 1 to 2 days, whereas its length scale corresponded to the size of a single cell (∼4 μm; Figures 2B, 2C, S2D, and S2E; see STAR Methods for detail of the analysis). Thus, homeostatic self-renewal and differentiation are balanced by stem cells counteracting the fate of their neighbors, with a lag time of 1–2 days. To test this local coordination of behaviors, we used a second method to mark and follow geometrically defined regions in the basal layer over time. We used a recently described photo-activatable fluorescent reporter (K14H2B-PAmCherry) (Rompolas et al., 2016Rompolas P. Mesa K.R. Kawaguchi K. Park S. Gonzalez D. Brown S. Boucher J. Klein A.M. Greco V. Spatiotemporal coordination of stem cell commitment during epidermal homeostasis.Science. 2016; 352: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to label circular regions (50 μm in radius, 108 cells on average) designed to capture multiple local neighborhoods of stem cells and their first- and second-degree neighbors and followed them for 3 consecutive days (Figures 2D and S2G). By counting the cells in the basal and suprabasal layers at each time point, we obtained the rates of division and differentiation as 0.23 events per day per basal layer cell (Figure 2E), consistent with rates obtained from previous tracking methods (Rompolas et al., 2016Rompolas P. Mesa K.R. Kawaguchi K. Park S. Gonzalez D. Brown S. Boucher J. Klein A.M. Greco V. Spatiotemporal coordination of stem cell commitment during epidermal homeostasis.Science. 2016; 352: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As a quantitative measure of behavioral coordination, we calculated the variance in the number of labeled basal cells per patch. In the absence of any local fate coordination within labeled patches, each basal cell should undergo independent stochastic dynamics, as proposed previously (Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E. Doupé D.P. Klein A.M. Winton D.J. Simons B.D. Jones P.H. A single type of progenitor cell maintains normal epidermis.Nature. 2007; 446: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), leading to a linear increase in variance of approximately 80 cells2 after 3 days (Figure 2E). However, strikingly, we observed very little variation in the number of cells contained within each circle after 3 days (Figures 2F; variance of 22 cells2). This clear deviation from the behaviors predicted by independent stochastic dynamics confirms that stem cells are indeed responding by self-renewing and/or differentiating to counteract local changes in cell number (Figure 2G). So far, we have demonstrated that neighboring stem cells locally balance self-renewal and differentiation rates; however, it remained unclear whether this relationship was a result of divisions driving local differentiation, as observed in the developing epidermis (Miroshnikova et al., 2018Miroshnikova Y.A. Le H.Q. Schneider D. Thalheim T. Rübsam M. Bremicker N. Polleux J. Kamprad N. Tarantola M. Wang I. et al.Adhesion forces and cortical tension couple cell proliferation and differentiation to drive epidermal stratification.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To test for this scenario in the adult basal layer, we focused on individual cells that either divided or differentiated and followed the subsequent behaviors of the cells directly surrounding them (Figure 3A). To overcome the noise from simultaneous and highly frequent divisions and differentiations in the tissue (Figure 1A; Video S1), we needed to average over hundreds of fate choice events to determine the overall imbalance of fates taking place between neighbors. If cell division leads to the differentiation of a neighbor, then there should be a net imbalance of one extra differentiation event in the cells directly surrounding the original division, whereas the fates of neighbors surrounding a differentiating cell should, on average, be perfectly balanced (Figure 3B). These expectations reverse when differentiation leads to neighbor division, whereas a mixed scenario should lead to neighbor cell fate imbalances following both types of events (Figure 3B). Strikingly, the net imbalance across all dividing and differentiating cells showed a clear and unexpected unidirectional bias, with one excess stem cell division among cells directly neighboring a differentiation event but no reciprocal compensation around dividing cells (Figures 3C and S2F). Our results thus indicate that, in contrast to the embryonic scenario, homeostatic self-renewal in the adult epidermis is driven by neighboring stem cell differentiation events and not vice versa. To functionally test this ordering of events, we reasoned that, if differentiation is indeed a driver of self-renewal, then manipulations that cause ectopic differentiation events should lead to a later compensatory increase in division. To test this hypothesis, we employed epidermal tape stripping, a method known to promote epidermal differentiation events through removal of the outermost terminally differentiated layers of the skin (Potten et al., 2000Potten C.S. Barthel D. Li Y.Q. Ohlrich R. Matthé B. Loeffler M. Proliferation in murine epidermis after minor mechanical stimulation. Part 1. Sustained increase in keratinocyte production and migration.Cell Prolif. 2000; 33: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although this approach has long been known to also increase stem cell division (Pinkus, 1951Pinkus H. Examination of the epidermis by the strip method of removing horny layers. I.

Dermatol. 1951; 16: 383-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), whether this wave of proliferation occurs subsequent to altered differentiation rates is not known. Thus, we sought to test our model by using groups of K14H2B-PAmCherry-labeled cells to interrogate the sequence of events that occurs directly following tape stripping (Figure 4A). Tracking of labeled cells revealed a significant increase in differentiation rates within 12 hr of the procedure compared with unperturbed control cells (Figure 4B). Notably, although tape stripping also increased the abundance of mitotic figures in the tissue as expected, this effect occurred subsequent to the rise in differentiation (Figure 4C). We next predicted that, if differentiation is upstream and independent of s"

These results define a genetically addressable form of dendritic inhibition that is highly experience dependent and indicate that in addition to disinhibition, salient stimuli are encoded at elevated levels of distal dendritic inhibition. Layer 1 (L1) is a unique site in the neocortex. It is immediately recognizable, as it contains relatively few somata and is instead comprised primarily of the apical dendrites of local pyramidal neurons (PNs) and a number of long-range projections that convey contextual, top-down information (Douglas and Martin, 2004Douglas R.J. Martin K.A. Neuronal circuits of the neocortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 419-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C. Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5457) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that L1 is a key site where information about the behavioral relevance of a stimulus is received and integrated with the representation of its bottom-up attributes in lower layers (Cauller, 1995Cauller L. Layer I of primary sensory neocortex: where top-down converges upon bottom-up.Behav. Brain Res. 1995; 71: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Larkum, 2013Larkum M.E. The yin and yang of cortical layer 1.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 114-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This process is thought to occur in the distal dendrites of PNs, which show highly specialized information processing capacities such as regenerative events called dendritic spikes (Helmchen et al., 1999Helmchen F.

Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In line, recent in vivo studies have highlighted the important role of dendritic spikes during sensorimotor integration, motor learning, and perception (Cichon and Gan, 2015Cichon J. Gan W.B. Branch-specific dendritic Ca(2+) spikes cause persistent synaptic plasticity.Nature. 2015; 520: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2016Takahashi N. Oertner T.G.

Nonlinear dendritic integration of sensory and motor input during an active sensing task.Nature. 2012; 492: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In turn, dendritic computations are powerfully controlled by inhibition (Major et al., 2013Major G. Larkum M.E. Schiller J. Active properties of neocortical pyramidal neuron dendrites.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Stuart and Spruston, 2015Stuart G.J. Spruston N. Dendritic integration: 60 years of progress.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The best-understood source of distal dendritic inhibition in L1 originates from projections of somatostatin (SST)-positive Martinotti cells located in deeper layers (Higley, 2014Higley M.J. Localized GABAergic inhibition of dendritic Ca(2+) signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Yavorska and Wehr, 2016Yavorska I. Wehr M. Somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in cortical circuits.Front. Neural Circuits. 2016; 10: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SST-interneurons (INs) receive little thalamic input but instead are strongly driven by recurrent excitation from the local PNs and are therefore thought to provide dendritic inhibition that is proportional to the ongoing activity in the PN network (Adesnik et al., 2012Adesnik H.

A neural circuit for spatial summation in visual cortex.Nature. 2012; 490: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Yavorska and Wehr, 2016Yavorska I. Wehr M. Somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in cortical circuits.Front. Neural Circuits. 2016; 10: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A second source of inhibition in L1 that is far less understood derives from the sparse set of L1-INs. These cells receive input from a range of top-down projections, including the cholinergic system, higher-order thalamus, and cortico-cortical feedback in rodents (Bennett et al., 2012Bennett C.

This suggests that, like distal dendritic excitation, inhibition from L1 INs may also be governed by internally generated activity representing, for instance, the behavioral relevance of sensory information (Letzkus et al., 2015Letzkus J.J.

Here, we establish Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (NDNF; Kuang et al., 2010Kuang X.L. Zhao X.M. Xu H.F. Shi Y.Y. Deng J.B. Sun G.T. Spatio-temporal expression of a novel neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) in mouse brains during development.BMC Neurosci. 2010; 11: 137Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as a highly selective marker for L1 INs in the adult auditory and prefrontal cortex and generate a tamoxifen-inducible Cre allele as well as a Flp allele to specifically target these neurons. We report data on the molecular properties and the synaptic input and output organization of auditory cortex L1 NDNF-INs, with a focus on their prominent interaction with SST-INs both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, to induce auditory cortex plasticity, we employ associative fear conditioning (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar, Weinberger, 2007Weinberger N.M. Associative representational plasticity in the auditory cortex: a synthesis of two disciplines.Learn. Mem. 2007; 14: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) to identify and characterize plastic changes of L1 NDNF and SST-IN responses during expression of behavioral memory. To identify a selective marker for L1-INs, we used a subtractive approach on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated by sequencing of ribosome-bound RNAs purified from genetically defined subtypes of cortical neurons that express a Cre-dependent epitope tagged ribosomal protein (i.e., RiboTag; Mardinly et al., 2016Mardinly A.R.

USA. 2009; 106: 13939-13944Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a marker of L1 GABAergic INs must be highly enriched in the RNAs isolated from Gad2-Cre mice (Taniguchi et al., 2011Taniguchi H. He M. Wu P. Kim S. Paik R. Sugino K. Kvitsiani D.

Lin Y. et al.A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 995-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) as compared to RNAs purified from cortical excitatory neurons (Emx1-Cre mice; Gorski et al., 2002Gorski J.A. Talley T. Qiu M. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Jones K.R. Cortical excitatory neurons and glia, but not GABAergic neurons, are produced in the Emx1-expressing lineage.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6309-6314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from three nonoverlapping subtypes of INs that together account for ∼85% of all INs and are largely absent from L1 (Figure 1D, SST, parvalbumin [PV], and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP] neurons, labeled by the respective Cre lines; Hippenmeyer et al., 2005Hippenmeyer S. Vrieseling E. Sigrist M. Portmann T. Laengle C. Ladle D.R. Arber S.

Lin Y. et al.A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 995-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Indeed, a transcriptome-wide search identified six genes that are substantially enriched in Gad2-derived RNAs compared to all the other RNAs (i.e., Gad2Max/[Emx1/Pv/Sst/Vip]Max ≥ 4; Figure S1A). Out of these candidates Ndnf is the only gene that is expressed at appreciable levels (Figures S1B and S1C), making it a promising candidate marker for L1 INs. Consistent with this, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that Ndnf-expressing cells are highly concentrated in L1 in an expression pattern that is very different from the well-described IN subtypes (Figures 1C and 1D). Direct comparison to pan-GABAergic and pan-glutamatergic markers further revealed that nearly all Ndnf cells are GABAergic and that the few Ndnf cells that are Gad1 negative are likely non-neuronal, as most of them also do not express VGlut1 (Figure S1C). Together, these data indicate that Ndnf is a specific marker of L1 INs in the adult cortex. These findings are consistent with recent studies that used single-cell RNA-seq to analyze the molecular composition of cortical neurons (Cadwell et al., 2016Cadwell C.R. Palasantza A. Jiang X. Berens P. Deng Q. Yilmaz M. Reimer J. Shen S. Bethge M. Tolias K.F. et al.Electrophysiological, transcriptomic and morphologic profiling of single neurons using Patch-seq.Nat.

We next used triple FISH to directly compare the expression of Ndnf and Gad1 with multiple markers of (L1) IN subtypes emerging from these studies (Figures 1E–1H). We find that Ndnf is expressed in roughly two-thirds of all L1 INs and that L1 NDNF-INs do not overlap with the IN populations defined by Pv, Sst, Vip, or Calb2 (Calretinin). In contrast, expression of Ndnf showed large overlap with Reln (Reelin) and Npy (Neuropeptide Y) and slightly weaker colocalization with nNos, markers that, unlike Ndnf, are also expressed widely in lower cortical layers and are thus less suitable for selective identification of L1 INs. Taken together, these data demonstrate that out of the genes analyzed, Ndnf is by far the most selective marker for L1 INs. In addition, co-expression of Reln, Npy, and nNos suggests that L1 NDNF-INs may correspond to eNGCs (see Discussion; Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015Overstreet-Wadiche L. McBain C.J. Neurogliaform cells in cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z.

Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). This is further supported by the low co-expression of Ndnf with Npas1 (Figures 1F–1H), which has been reported to be absent from eNGCs but expressed in L1 SBCs (Cadwell et al., 2016Cadwell C.R. Palasantza A. Jiang X. Berens P. Deng Q. Yilmaz M. Reimer J. Shen S. Bethge M. Tolias K.F. et al.Electrophysiological, transcriptomic and morphologic profiling of single neurons using Patch-seq.Nat.

Ardlie K. et al.Massively parallel single-nucleus RNA-seq with DroNc-seq.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we generated a knockin mouse allele in which a tamoxifen-inducible version of Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the endogenous Ndnf locus (Ndnf-Ires-CreERT2; Figure S1D). When crossed to a reporter strain (Ai9; Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3877) Google Scholar), this allele drives reporter expression only in the presence of tamoxifen (Figure S1E), indicating tight temporal control of Cre activity and thereby differing from previously generated NDNF-Cre mice (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B. Gray L.T. Sorensen S.A. Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Similar to endogenous Ndnf expression (Figures 1C and 1D), tdTomato-labeled neurons are found primarily in L1 (Figure S1E), and nearly all of these tdTomato-labeled L1 INs co-express endogenous Ndnf (Figures S1I and S1J). Similar to previous results (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B. Gray L.T. Sorensen S.A. Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), this line also labels blood vessels throughout the cortex when used in conjunction with Ai9 reporter mice (Figures S1E and S1G). Importantly, when used in combination with conditional adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) constructs our knockin allele labels very selectively only L1 NDNF-INs (Figures 1I, S1E, S1F, and S1H). To further extend our experimental capabilities, we went on to generate a second knockin mouse allele in which Flp recombinase is expressed under the control of the endogenous Ndnf locus (Ndnf-Ires-FlpO; Figure S1D). This line displayed similar selectivity for L1 (Figures S1E and S1H) and similar selectivity and fidelity for labeling Ndnf-positive neurons as the Cre line (Figures S1I and S1J), indicating that both mouse alleles are powerful tools for circuit dissection. Moreover, we addressed the specificity of a previously generated bacterial artificial chromosome/clone (BAC)-transgenic line in which EGFP expression is driven from the Ndnf locus (Gong et al., 2003Gong S. Zheng C. Doughty M.L. Losos K. Didkovsky N. Schambra U.B. Nowak N.J. Joyner A. Leblanc G. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar) and found that it faithfully recapitulates the endogenous expression of Ndnf in L1 (Figures S1I and S1J), whereas ectopic labeling was observed in deeper layers (Figure S1E). Finally, we addressed whether Ndnf is a useful marker for L1 INs outside of the auditory cortex. Analogous experiments in the pre- and infra-limbic areas of the prefrontal cortex (PL and IL, respectively) indicated that Ndnf expression is highly enriched in L1 INs (Figures S2A and S2B) and displays similar co-localization with other markers as in the auditory cortex (Figures S2C–S2E). Further experiments indicate that L1 NDNF-INs are faithfully addressed by both mouse alleles in the prefrontal cortex (Figure S2F). Together, these data demonstrate that our newly generated mouse lines allow for the specific labeling and manipulation of L1 NDNF-INs in the adult cortex. As a first step toward understanding how signaling by L1 NDNF-INs affects the function of the local circuit in the auditory cortex, we determined the localization of their output synapses. AAV-mediated transduction of Ndnf-Ires-CreERT2 mice with a synaptophysin-GFP fusion protein (Oh et al., 2014Oh S.W. Harris J.A. Ng L. Winslow B. Cain N. Mihalas S. Wang Q. Lau C. Kuan L. Henry A.M. et al.A mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) revealed that by far the greatest output of these INs remains within L1 (Figures 2A and S3A). In addition, a second smaller and broader peak of synapse density is present approximately 300 μm from the pia spanning L3 and L4. To identify the postsynaptic partners of these synapses, we crossed Ndnf-Ires-CreERT2 animals with a mouse line labeling inhibitory INs (Peron et al., 2015Peron S.P. Freeman J. Iyer V. Guo C. Svoboda K. A cellular resolution map of barrel cortex activity during tactile behavior.Neuron. 2015; 86: 783-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). After AAV-mediated expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR-2), this enabled reliable and precise light activation of L1 NDNF-INs in acute brain slices of adult auditory cortex (Figure 2B) that elicited inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSCs) in ChR-2 negative L1 INs, L2/3 Ins, and L2/3 PNs (Figures 2C and 2D) with indistinguishable, short latencies (Figure S3D). While inputs to L1 INs and L2/3 PNs displayed similarly slow rise and decay times, the kinetics of IPSCs in L2/3 INs was significantly faster (Figures 2C and 2D). The strongest input was observed in L2/3 PNs, which together with the observed synapse localization indicates that one important effect of L1 NDNF-INs may be inhibition of distal PN dendrites within L1. Consistent with this, inputs to L2/3 PNs were also observed when optogenetic stimulation was restricted to L1 under block of action potential firing (Figures 2E and 2F; Petreanu et al., 2009Petreanu L. Mao T. Sternson S.M. Svoboda K. The subcellular organization of neocortical excitatory connections.Nature. 2009; 457: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), directly demonstrating distal dendritic inhibition. Together, these data indicate that L1 NDNF-IN output synapses are concentrated in L1 and display broad connectivity to other circuit elements and reveal inhibition of distal PN dendrites as a major consequence of L1 NDNF-IN activation. A second, intensely studied source of inhibition in distal PN dendrites derives from the projection of SST-positive Martinotti cells to L1 (Figure 2G, Higley, 2014Higley M.J. Localized GABAergic inhibition of dendritic Ca(2+) signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Yavorska and Wehr, 2016Yavorska I. Wehr M. Somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in cortical circuits.Front. Neural Circuits. 2016; 10: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We therefore next asked how the two forms of dendritic inhibition might differ. Despite greater amplitudes of SST-IN inputs to L2/3 PNs (which might partly be due to more efficient optogenetic stimulation of these cells; Figure S3I), we found that L1 NDNF-IN IPSCs mediate greater charge transfer due to their much more prolonged kinetics (Figures 2H and 2I). In addition, L1 NDNF-IN input displayed slower rise times and onset latencies than SST IPSCs (Figures 2I and S3J), which were not due to differences in recording quality (Figure S3N). The long decay times of L1 NDNF-IN IPSCs may indicate a contribution of GABAB receptors at these synapses, which have been demonstrated to contribute strongly to transmission from NGCs (Tamás et al., 2003Tamás G. Lorincz A. Simon A. Szabadics J. Identified sources and targets of slow inhibition in the neocortex.Science. 2003; 299: 1902-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Indeed, application of the selective GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 55845 (3 μM) markedly reduced the decay time of IPSCs mediated by L1 NDNF-INs, whereas SST input recorded under the same conditions remained unchanged (Figures 2J, 2K, and S3K). Importantly, inhibition from L1 NDNF-INs displayed much slower rise and decay times than SST IPSCs even under GABAB receptor block (Figures 2J and 2L), suggesting additional sources for these kinetic differences (see Discussion). Together, the present results indicate that inhibition from two distinct sources controls the activity of PN dendrites and identify L1 NDNF-INs as a genetically addressable source of inhibition in distal PN dendrites that differs markedly from the well-understood SST Martinotti cell input in terms of kinetics and underlying receptors. Consistent with the interpretation that the two forms of dendritic inhibition are optimized for low- versus high-frequency signaling, L1 NDNF-IN input to PNs also displayed stronger short-term depression than SST Martinotti cell input (Figure S3M). This is in line with the observed short-term depression of NGC synapses (Capogna and Pearce, 2011Capogna M. Pearce R.A.

Sleep is a common biological state observed in many, if not most, animals, in which they exhibit periods of prolonged immobility, reduced responsiveness, and discrete patterns of central brain activity (Allada and Siegel, 2008Allada R.

The functions of sleep are still uncertain and have been a topic of scientific inquiry in mammals for decades. More recently, these functions have also been studied in Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for human function because of its highly conserved genes and relatively simple nervous system (Allada and Siegel, 2008Allada R.

Sleep is regulated by a homeostatic mechanism and by the circadian clock (Borbély et al., 2016Borbély A.A. Daan S. Wirz-Justice A. Deboer T. The two-process model of sleep regulation: a reappraisal.J. Sleep Res. 2016; 25: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, Ho and Sehgal, 2005Ho K.S. Sehgal A. Drosophila melanogaster: an insect model for fundamental studies of sleep.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 393: 772-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The homeostatic mechanism determines the duration of sleep based on prior sleep-wake history (Borbély and Achermann, 1999Borbély A.A. Achermann P. Sleep homeostasis and models of sleep regulation.J. Biol. Rhythms. 1999; 14: 557-568PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous circadian clock contributes to the maintenance of a regular 24-hr sleep/wake cycle, effectively directing the time at which organisms prefer to sleep. The clock is generally sensitive to environment changes like light and transmits information to higher brain regions to control behavior at certain circadian times (Allada and Chung, 2010Allada R. Chung B.Y. Circadian organization of behavior and physiology in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 605-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The core clock brain network is composed of 75 pairs of neurons symmetrically located in both hemispheres, which express essential circadian genes such as period and timeless to generate 24-hr rhythms (Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017Dubowy C. Sehgal A. Circadian rhythms and sleep in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 2017; 205: 1373-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Clock neurons can be categorized as follows: the small and large ventral lateral neurons (LNvs), the dorsal lateral neurons (LNds), dorsal neurons (DN1s, DN2s, and DN3s), and the lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) (Allada and Chung, 2010Allada R.

Taghert P.H. Organization of the Drosophila circadian control circuit.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R84-R93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The small LNvs (s-LNvs) are also known as morning cells (M cells) and regulate Drosophila morning locomotor activity and free-running rhythms, whereas the fifth s-LNv and the LNds are evening cells (E cells) because they regulate evening activity (Grima et al., 2004Grima B.

Rhythms. 2000; 15: 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A subset of glutamatergic DN1s are downstream of the core pacemakers and have an additional function (Zhang et al., 2010aZhang L. Chung B.Y. Lear B.C. Kilman V.L. Liu Y. Mahesh G. Meissner R.A.

Circadian neuron feedback controls the Drosophila sleep--activity profile.Nature. 2016; 536: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This feedback mechanism and the clock neuronal circuitry maintain the normal Drosophila sleep/wake cycle. Compared to this well-understood circadian circuit of the fly, the neural and molecular underpinnings of sleep outside of this circuit are less defined. Several widely dispersed brain regions have been proposed as centers for sleep/wake regulation, which include the mushroom body (Guo et al., 2011Guo F. Yi W. Zhou M. Guo A.

Sleep drive is encoded by neural plastic changes in a dedicated circuit.Cell. 2016; 165: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). More specifically, a ring substructure of the EB contains the EB-R2 neurons and appears to play an essential role in regulating sleep homeostasis. Those neurons exhibit greater excitability and switch to burst-firing mode after sleep deprivation, which generates and maintains high sleep drive as well as an increased arousal threshold (Liu et al., 2016Liu S. Liu Q. Tabuchi M. Wu M.N. Sleep drive is encoded by neural plastic changes in a dedicated circuit.Cell. 2016; 165: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these EB-R2 and the dFSB neurons are recurrently connected via helicon cells to regulate sleep homeostasis (Donlea et al., 2018Donlea J.M. Pimentel D. Talbot C.B. Kempf A. Omoto J.J. Hartenstein V. Miesenböck G. Recurrent circuitry for balancing sleep need and sleep.Neuron. 2018; 97: 378-389.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Importantly, there has been no comprehensive functional or anatomical investigation of a connection between these sleep-relevant fly brain regions and the Drosophila circadian circuit. In this paper, we show that circadian wake and sleep signals from DN1 circadian neurons are conveyed by two separate output circuits with distinct anatomical projection patterns. The wake-promoting pathway projects to the dorso-medial protocerebrum, the so-called pars intercerebralis (PI) region, whereas the sleep-promoting DN1 pathway sends neurites to the anterior region to synapse onto a subgroup of tubercular-bulbar neurons (TuBus) located in the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU) neuropil. These anterior-projecting DNs (APDNs) also increase neuronal activity of TuBus, which then project specifically to the superior bulb region (BUsup). These neurons are in turn functionally connected to EB ring neurons (EB-R2/R4m) of the central complex, which are known to regulate sleep drive and arousal level (Lebestky et al., 2009Lebestky T. Chang J.S. Dankert H. Zelnik L. Kim Y.C. Han K.A. Wolf F.W. Perona P. Anderson D.J.

Liu Q. Tabuchi M. Wu M.N. Sleep drive is encoded by neural plastic changes in a dedicated circuit.Cell. 2016; 165: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of the APDNs can induce calcium oscillations in the cell bodies of EB ring neurons as well as their axonal ring structure. Inhibition and activation experiments indicate that this APDN- TuBusup-EB circuit regulates sleep drive and the sleep-wake arousal in adult Drosophila. To further characterize the role of specific circadian neurons in sleep and wake regulation, we performed an activation screen. Because there are only a handful of GAL4 drivers that exclusively label circadian neuron subsets, we also used an intersectional strategy that included the classical circadian driver Clk856-GAL4 (Figure 1A). Our immunohistochemistry results as well as previous studies (Gummadova et al., 2009Gummadova J.O. Coutts G.A. Glossop N.R. Analysis of the Drosophila Clock promoter reveals heterogeneity in expression between subgroups of central oscillator cells and identifies a novel enhancer region.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2009; 24: 353-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) confirmed that this driver expresses in most central clock neurons in adult flies (Figure 1B, left panel). To characterize the expression patterns and behavioral output of other circadian neuron drivers, we made a stable line (Clk856-GAL4, LexAop-FLP; UAS-FRT-stop-FRT-CsChrimson.mVenus) to cross with different LexA lines from the FlyLight library collection (Pfeiffer et al., 2008Pfeiffer B.D. Jenett A. Hammonds A.S. Ngo T.T. Misra S. Murphy C. Scully A. Carlson J.W. Wan K.H. Laverty T.R. et al.Tools for neuroanatomy and neurogenetics in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9715-9720Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The LexA drives the expression of flippase, which excises the stop codon and activates the expression of functionally red-shifted and YFP-tagged channelrhodopsin-CsChrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014Klapoetke N.C. Murata Y. Kim S.S. Pulver S.R. Birdsey-Benson A. Cho Y.K. Morimoto T.K. Chuong A.S. Carpenter E.J. Tian Z. et al.Independent optical excitation of distinct neural populations.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) within the intersectional territory (Figure 1A). After 3 days of baseline recording and ATR feeding in the Flybox, different subsets of circadian neurons were activated for 24 hr with 5 Hz pulsed red light (Guo et al., 2017Guo F. Chen X. Rosbash M. Temporal calcium profiling of specific circadian neurons in freely moving flies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E8780-E8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Acute activation of different circadian neurons triggers different behavioral responses (Figure 1C). A persistent wake-promoting/sleep-reducing effect occurred during the LED stimulation period whenever the expression pattern included E cells (Figure S1C), consistent with our previous conclusion that E cells are major activity-promoting circadian neurons (Guo et al., 2014Guo F. Cerullo I. Chen X. Rosbash M.

Rosbash M. Temporal calcium profiling of specific circadian neurons in freely moving flies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E8780-E8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, activating subsets of the DN1s and DN3s significantly increased sleep (Figure 1C). The Clk856-GAL4 ∩ R65D05-LexA line marked Ast-A-positive circadian neurons, including LPNs, and had the strongest sleep-promoting effect (Figure S1B). This phenotype is consistent with a recent report characterizing the important role of Ast-A-expressing neurons in sleep regulation (Chen et al., 2016Chen J. Reiher W. Hermann-Luibl C. Sellami A. Cognigni P. Kondo S. Helfrich-Förster C. Veenstra J.A. Wegener C. Allatostatin A signalling in Drosophila regulates feeding and sleep and is modulated by PDF.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12: e1006346Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The remaining LexA lines also labeled sleep-promoting circadian neurons and showed selective and consistent expression within the DN1s and DN3s (Figures S1 and S2), indicating that they contribute to one or more sleep-promoting circadian circuits. To better understand the anatomy of these sleep-promoting circadian neurons, we performed double immunostaining (anti-PDF and anti-GFP) on two strong sleep-promoting lines: Clk856-GAL4 ∩ R18H11-LexA and Clk856-GAL4 ∩ R67F03-LexA (Figures 2A and 2B ). Both lines clearly and consistently labeled subsets of circadian DN1s and DN3s based on anatomy of circadian neurons (Figure S2). R18H11 is a traditional circadian driver line derived from the Pdfr gene, and R67F03 is derived from the Ast-C gene (Jenett et al., 2012Jenett A. Rubin G.M. Ngo T.T. Shepherd D. Murphy C. Dionne H.

Jeter J. et al.A GAL4-driver line resource for Drosophila neurobiology.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 991-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). These neurons have posterior branches that overlap with dorsal projections of sLNvs (M cells) and LNds (E cells), consistent with previous results indicating that sleep-promoting DN1s inhibit wake-promoting M and E cells (Guo et al., 2016Guo F.

Circadian neuron feedback controls the Drosophila sleep--activity profile.Nature. 2016; 536: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, both lines have major branches that spread into the anterior brain region called the SLP (superior lateral protocerebrum) (Videos S1 and S2), hence the name APDNs. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/81e2330f-04ec-4fd9-9db0-392a22b1002d/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Clk856-GAL4 ∩ R18H11-LexA Labeled DNs Have a Characteristic Anterior Projection, Related to Figure 2Confocal stack of antibody staining of GFP (gray) and PDF (red) of the DNs common between the Clk856-GAL4 and the R18H11-LexA. Activation of APDNs strongly promotes sleep in the LED day compared to both control strains. They sleep less during the night of the LED day, probably because of an arousal effect of the LED (Figures 2A and 2B). Moreover, some sleep-promoting effects of the APDNs were visible during the baseline day. This may be due to entrainment light activation of CsChrimson expressed in DN3s. These neurons are located closer to the surface of the brain, and there was no baseline day effect when CsChrimson was expressed only in DN1s (Figure 2D). Despite the similarities of these anterior-projecting branches, the two sets of DNs have distinct morphological differences around the PI region. Clk856-GAL4 ∩ R18H11-LexA DNs form a tight neuropil in the PI region (Figures 2A and S2A), whereas Clk856-GAL4 ∩ R67F03-LexA DNs barely have visible fibers in this region (Figures 2B and S2B). To address these PI projections, we added a CRY-GAL80 transgene to the Clk856-GAL4 ∩ R18H11-LexA combination. This strategy identified a CRY-negative (cryptochrome-negative) subset of DN1s that appear to send projections only to the PI (Figure 2C) (Chatterjee et al., 2018Chatterjee A. Lamaze A. De J. Mena W.

Activation of these PI-projecting DN1s promoted wakefulness and inhibited sleep (Figure 2C), consistent with previous reports that PI-projecting DN1s connect to DH44+ PI neurons to regulate locomotor activity (Cavanaugh et al., 2014Cavanaugh D.J.

Biol. 2014; 24: 2652-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We next examined projections of the R18H11 sleep-promoting DN1s. To this end and also to examine whether the R67F03 and R18H11 drivers label some sleep-promoting DN1s in common, we identified their overlapping neurons by combining R67F03-LexA and R18H11-GAL4. We confirmed that both R18H11-GAL4 and R67F03-GAL4 express in the same DNs as the corresponding LexA lines (data not shown). This strategy identified 4–5 DN1s with clear posterior and anterior fibers (Figure 2D), which strongly promote sleep (Figures 2D and S2D). To further confirm that these APDNs promote sleep under basal conditions, we temporally hyperpolarized these neurons by expressing the cyan-gated anion channel GtACR1 and exposing adult flies to green light after 3 days of ATR feeding (Mohammad et al., 2017Mohammad F. Stewart J.C. Ott S. Chlebikova K. Chua J.Y. Koh T.W. Ho J. Claridge-Chang A. Optogenetic inhibition of behavior with anion channelrhodopsins.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This caused a significant sleep reduction in both R18H11 > GtACR1 and R67F03 > GtACR1 flies during the green LED day compared to corresponding UAS or empty GAL4 controls (Figure 2E). We note that R18H11 > GtACR1 flies also sleep less compared to controls during the baseline day, suggesting that some GtACR1-expressing R18H11-GAL4 DN1s may be inhibited by the FlyBox entrainment light. The data taken together demonstrate an important role for the APDN circuit in sleep regulation. To examine whether the anterior fibers from the APDNs are receiving or sending signals, we labeled brains with the postsynaptic (dendritic) and presynaptic (axonal) fluorescent markers Denmark (Figure 3A, red) and syt1-GFP (Figure 3A, green), respectively (Nicolaï et al., 2010Nicolaï L.J. Ramaekers A. Raemaekers T. Drozdzecki A. Mauss A.S. Yan J. Landgraf M. Annaert W. Hassan B.A. Genetically encoded dendritic marker sheds light on neuronal connectivity in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 20553-20558Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). First, the posterior projections of DN1s are presynaptic as well as postsynaptic; the presynaptic fibers descend into the accessory medulla, where they reach the sLNv cell bodies (Figure 3A, middle panel). DN1 fibers have been previously shown to connect to the dorsal branches of lateral M and E cells, and these data suggest that the DN1s receive as well as send signals from/to the lateral M and E pacemakers (Guo et al., 2016Guo F. Yu J. Jung H.J. Abruzzi K.C. Luo W. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M. Circadian neuron feedback controls the Drosophila sleep--activity profile.Nature. 2016; 536: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Second and not unexpectedly, presynaptic markers densely label the DN1 projection to the PI region, consistent with the evidence that some activity-promoting DN1s output to PI neurons (see above). Third and most importantly, the DN1 anterior branches are solely and robustly labeled by the presynaptic marker, indicating that the neuropil in SLP region is a major new postsynaptic APDN target (Figures S3A and S3B). To trace and define the specific downstream synaptic partners located in the SLP, we employed the newly developed anterograde trans-synaptic tracing tool trans-Tango (Talay et al., 2017Talay M. Richman E.B. Snell N.J. Hartmann G.G. Fisher J.D. Sorkaç A. Santoyo J.F. Chou-Freed C. Nair N. Johnson M. et al.Transsynaptic mapping of second-order taste neurons in flies by trans-Tango.Neuron. 2017; 96: 783-795.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Expression of the tethered trans-Tango ligand in neurons can trigger mtdTomato expression in postsynaptic targets. We co-expressed the trans-Tango ligand and myrGFP with the classical Clk4.1M-GAL4; it strongly labels more DN1s and hence has more anterior projections compared to R18H11-labeled APDNs (Figure S3C; Videos S2 and S3) (Guo et al., 2016Guo F.

Clk4.1-GAL4 Labeled DNs Have a Characteristic Anterior Projection, Related to Figure 3Confocal stack of antibody staining of GFP (gray) and PDF (red) of the DNs labeled by CLK4.1-GAL4. There was clear postsynaptic mtdTomato labeling in several clusters of neurons within the circadian circuit, including the LNds and some DN3s (Figure 3B; data not shown). The LNd (E cell) output fits with previous data (Guo et al., 2016Guo F. Yu J. Jung H.J. Abruzzi K.C. Luo W. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M. Circadian neuron feedback controls the Drosophila sleep--activity profile.Nature. 2016; 536: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas the DN3 output indicates that these neurons are new postsynaptic targets of DN1s (data not shown). Because we could not detect a postsynaptic signal close to the two additional major contact sites of DN1s, the PI and SLP regions, we expressed two copies of the trans-Tango ligand in DN1s. This strategy resulted in positive trans-synaptic signal in both locations (Figure 3C). In the SLP, the myrGFP-labeled anterior projections of the APDNs reach the surface and innervate a neuropil called the AOTU. The postsynaptic mtdTomato signal is expressed in a subset of TuBu neurons not previously associated with the circadian circuit (Figure 3C). These neurons are reported to receive visual information from the AOTU and send it into the BU neuropil (Omoto et al., 2017Omoto J.J. Keleş M.F. Nguyen B.M. Bolanos C. Lovick J.K.

EB neurons are essential for a variety of functions, including sleep homeostasis and arousal (Lebestky et al., 2009Lebestky T. Chang J.S. Dankert H. Zelnik L. Kim Y.C. Han K.A. Wolf F.W. Perona P.

We found that lipophilic statin drugs and rationally designed bisphosphonates that target three distinct enzymes in the mevalonate pathway have potent adjuvant activities in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These inhibitors function independently of conventional ""danger sensing."" Instead, they inhibit the geranylgeranylation of small GTPases, including Rab5 in antigen-presenting cells, resulting in arrested endosomal maturation, prolonged antigen retention, enhanced antigen presentation, and T cell activation. Additionally, inhibiting the mevalonate pathway enhances antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity, inducing both Th1 and cytolytic T cell responses. As demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models, the mevalonate pathway inhibitors are robust for cancer vaccinations and synergize with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our research thus defines the mevalonate pathway as a druggable target for vaccine adjuvants and cancer immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2893038030,"Acute infection, if not kept in check, can lead to systemic inflammatory responses in the brain. Here, we show that within 2 hr of systemic inflammation, PDGFRβ mural cells of blood vessels rapidly secrete chemokine CCL2, which in turn increases total neuronal excitability by promoting excitatory synaptic transmission in glutamatergic neurons of multiple brain regions. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified Col1a1 and Rgs5 subgroups of PDGFRβ cells as the main source of CCL2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or Poly(I:C)-treated pericyte culture medium induced similar effects in a CCL2-dependent manner. Importantly, in Pdgfrb-Cre;Ccl2fl/fl mice, LPS-induced increase in excitatory synaptic transmission was significantly attenuated. These results demonstrate in vivo that PDGFRβ cells function as initial sensors of external insults by secreting CCL2, which relays the signal to the central nervous system. Through their gateway position in the brain, PDGFRβ cells are ideally positioned to respond rapidly to environmental changes and to coordinate responses."

Here we utilized miniScopes to record calcium activities from hundreds of excitatory neurons in the mPFC while mice freely explored restrained social targets in the absence or presence of the psychedelic drug phencyclidine (PCP). We identified distinct and dynamic ON and OFF neural ensembles that displayed opposing activities to code real-time behavioral information. We further illustrated that ON and OFF ensembles tuned to social exploration carried information of salience and novelty for social targets. Finally, we showed that dysfunctions in these ensembles were associated with abnormal social exploration elicited by PCP. Our findings underscore the importance of mPFC ON and OFF neural ensembles for proper exploratory behavior, including social exploration, and pave the way for future studies elucidating neural circuit dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2893003914,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play key roles in the use-dependent adaptation of glutamatergic synapses underpinning memory formation. In the forebrain, these plastic processes involve the varied contributions of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs that have different signaling properties. Although the molecular machinery of synaptic NMDAR trafficking has been under scrutiny, the postsynaptic spatial organization of these two receptor subtypes has remained elusive. Here, we used super-resolution imaging of NMDARs in rat hippocampal synapses to unveil the nanoscale topography of native GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDARs. Both subtypes were found to be organized in separate nanodomains that vary over the course of development. Furthermore, GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR nanoscale organizations relied on distinct regulatory mechanisms. Strikingly, the selective rearrangement of GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDARs, with no overall change in NMDAR current amplitude, allowed bi-directional tuning of synaptic LTP. Thus, GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR nanoscale organizations are differentially regulated and seem to involve distinct signaling complexes during synaptic adaptation."

However, most progenitors carrying such mutations colonize and persist in normal tissue without forming tumors. Here, we investigated tissue-level constraints on clonal progenitor behavior by inducing a single-allele p53 mutation (Trp53R245W; p53∗/wt), prevalent in normal human epidermis and squamous cell carcinoma, in transgenic mouse epidermis. p53∗/wt progenitors initially outcompeted wild-type cells due to enhanced proliferation, but subsequently reverted toward normal dynamics and homeostasis. Physiological doses of UV light accelerated short-term expansion of p53∗/wt clones, but their frequency decreased with protracted irradiation, possibly due to displacement by UV-induced mutant clones with higher competitive fitness. These results suggest multiple mechanisms restrain the proliferation of p53∗/wt progenitors, thereby maintaining epidermal integrity."

The major YAP regulators are the LATS1/2 kinases, which phosphorylate and inhibit YAP. LATS1/2 are activated by phosphorylation on a hydrophobic motif (HM) outside of the kinase domain by MST1/2 and other kinases. Phosphorylation of the HM motif then triggers autophosphorylation of the kinase in the activation loop to fully activate the kinase, a process facilitated by MOB1. The angiomotin family of proteins (AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2) bind LATS1/2 and promote its kinase activity and YAP phosphorylation through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that angiomotins increase Hippo signaling through multiple mechanisms. We found that, by binding LATS1/2, SAV1, and YAP, angiomotins function as a scaffold that connects LATS1/2 to both its activator SAV1–MST1 and its target YAP. Deletion of all three angiomotins reduced the association of LATS1 with SAV1–MST1 and decreased MST1/2-mediated LATS1/2-HM phosphorylation. Angiomotin deletion also reduced LATS1/2’s ability to associate with and phosphorylate YAP. In addition, we found that angiomotins have an unexpected function along with MOB1 to promote autophosphorylation of LATS1/2 on the activation loop motif independent of HM phosphorylation.

The formation of complex neuronal circuits is mediated by the recognition of correct synaptic partners followed by the assembly of the appropriate number and type of synapses. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules have been proposed to initiate this process and determine the specificity of synaptic connections (Bukalo and Dityatev, 2012Bukalo O. Dityatev A.

However, redundancy both within and between the different adhesion systems has complicated attempts to determine the precise role of specific molecules involved in mediating pre- and postsynaptic assembly. In mammals, the synaptic cell adhesion protein neurexin is alternatively spliced into thousands of isoforms that are differentially expressed throughout brain (Ullrich et al., 1995Ullrich B.

USA. 2015; 112: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The functions of various neurexin isoforms appear to be cell and synapse specific, as different phenotypes can be obtained in different brain regions from manipulation of the same neurexin subtype (Aoto et al., 2015Aoto J. Földy C. Ilcus S.M.C. Tabuchi K. Südhof T.C. Distinct circuit-dependent functions of presynaptic neurexin-3 at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Conditional triple knock outs that ablate expression of all α- and β-neurexins revealed dramatic differences in the functions of neurexin at different synapses, with some neurons exhibiting a dramatic decrease in synapse number while others displayed defects in synapse function or presynaptic calcium influx without affecting synapse number (Chen et al., 2017Chen L.Y. Jiang M. Zhang B. Gokce O. Südhof T.C. Conditional Deletion of All Neurexins Defines Diversity of Essential Synaptic Organizer Functions for Neurexins.Neuron. 2017; 94: 611-625.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Importantly, γ-neurexin was present in the α- and β-neurexin conditional knockouts, complicating the interpretation of these phenotypes and leaving the role of γ-neurexin completely uncharacterized. In C. elegans, a single neurexin gene (nrx-1) encodes long (α) and short (γ) isoforms that are expressed in the nervous system and localize to synapses (Haklai-Topper et al., 2011Haklai-Topper L. Soutschek J. Sabanay H. Scheel J. Hobert O. Peles E. The neurexin superfamily of Caenorhabditis elegans.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2011; 11: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The worm thus provides an excellent opportunity to dissect the contribution of each neurexin isoform in the context of a well-described nervous system. At inhibitory motor neuron synapses, presynaptic α-neurexin contributes to the neuroligin-dependent postsynaptic organization of GABA receptors (Maro et al., 2015Maro G.S. Gao S. Olechwier A.M. Hung W.L. Liu M. Özkan E. Zhen M. Shen K.

Hu Z. Liu Y. Anderson D. Kaplan J.M. A network of autism linked genes stabilizes two pools of synaptic GABA(A) receptors.eLife. 2015; 4: e09648Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but how C. elegans α- or γ-neurexin functions in presynaptic assembly is not known. Indeed, while the canonical role for neurexin is the induction of postsynaptic assembly through trans-synaptic interactions (for example by binding neuroligin), how neurexin cell-autonomously mediates presynaptic assembly and function is less clear. The many molecules implicated in synaptic induction and their relatively weak loss-of-function phenotypes suggests that synapse formation in vivo is likely to be mediated by parallel pathways. Even in the absence of the single Drosophila or C. elegans neurexin (Li et al., 2007Li J. Ashley J. Budnik V. Bhat M.A. Crucial role of Drosophila neurexin in proper active zone apposition to postsynaptic densities, synaptic growth, and synaptic transmission.Neuron. 2007; 55: 741-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Maro et al., 2015Maro G.S.

This suggests that there exist other molecules that function to induce presynaptic assembly. What other signaling molecules work in parallel with neurexin at a given synapse is unknown. Here we demonstrate a novel role for C. elegans γ-neurexin in presynaptic assembly, independent of neuroligin. This short form of neurexin is necessary and sufficient to promote normal presynaptic development by clustering active zone proteins, synaptic vesicles, and calcium channels at sites of release. Loss of γ- but not α-neurexin leads to a reduction in evoked synaptic transmission. Moreover, we identify a parallel pathway for presynaptic assembly mediated by the Frizzled receptor and show that Frizzled’s pro-synaptogenic function is independent of its ligand, Wnt. In fact, Wnt binding serves to abrogate Frizzled’s function by promoting its endocytosis, a process which also leads to the downregulation of neurexin within the asynaptic domain. These two unconventional synaptogenic pathways together mediate the large majority of synapse formation events in the C. elegans DA9 excitatory motor neuron. C. elegans contains a single neurexin gene, nrx-1. It has previously been implicated in tuning synaptic strength as part of a retrograde signal (Hu et al., 2012Hu Z. Hom S. Kudze T. Tong X.-J.

Hu Z. Liu Y. Anderson D. Kaplan J.M. A network of autism linked genes stabilizes two pools of synaptic GABA(A) receptors.eLife. 2015; 4: e09648Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), both in conjunction with its canonical binding partner neuroligin. To understand whether nrx-1 plays a role in presynaptic development, we analyzed synapses in the DA9 excitatory motor neuron found in the tail of the worm. DA9’s cell body and dendrite reside in the ventral cord, and its axon extends across to the dorsal side, where it elongates and forms synapses in a specific and stereotyped region (Figure 1A). Using a promoter specific for DA9 and its neighbor VA12 (whose axon remains on the ventral side), we can visualize the DA9 axon and synapses in the dorsal nerve cord with single-cell specificity. DA9 forms a row of en passant synapses along its axon. At each presynaptic bouton, active zones are marked by Clarinet-1 (CLA-1), a piccolo/bassoon-like protein that is involved in synaptic vesicle release (Xuan et al., 2017Xuan Z. Manning L. Nelson J. Richmond J.E. Colón-Ramos D.A. Shen K. Kurshan P.T. Clarinet (CLA-1), a novel active zone protein required for synaptic vesicle clustering and release.eLife. 2017; 6: 6Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Like other active zone proteins, it localizes to a discrete region at the ventral tip of the presynaptic varicosity where the axon is juxtaposed to postsynaptic cells (Figure 1B and Xuan et al., 2017Xuan Z. Manning L. Nelson J. Richmond J.E. Colón-Ramos D.A. Shen K. Kurshan P.T. Clarinet (CLA-1), a novel active zone protein required for synaptic vesicle clustering and release.eLife. 2017; 6: 6Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The synaptic vesicle-associated protein RAB-3 localizes to vesicle clusters and is more broadly distributed within the presynaptic bouton than CLA-1 (Figure 1B). Other than their size difference, puncta marked by these two proteins colocalize well at wild-type synapses (Figure 1B’). Both proteins are only localized to the synaptic domain and form a highly stereotyped pattern in DA9. We found that in nrx-1 mutants, the pattern of synaptic proteins was disrupted. The number of active zones (marked by CLA-1::GFP) was reduced (Figures 1C and 1E), and small, asynaptic vesicle accumulations (marked by RAB-3::tdTomato) that did not colocalize with CLA-1 appeared throughout the length of the axon (Figures 1C and 1F). Both phenotypes could be fully rescued by expression of full-length NRX-1 cDNA presynaptically under a DA9-specific promoter, indicating that the requirement for NRX-1 is cell-autonomous (Figures 1E, 1F, and Figure S1 related to Figure 1). To determine whether the reduced number of CLA-1 puncta in DA9 was indicative of a more general defect in synapse assembly at other synapses, we analyzed the intensity of two endogenously tagged active zone proteins, CLA-1 and SYD-2/Liprin-α, within the nerve ring (Figure S2 related to Figure 1). The C. elegans nerve ring comprises synapses of many head motor, sensory, and interneurons. We measured the total intensity of the nerve ring as a proxy for synapse number and found that in nrx-1(null) mutants there was a dramatic decrease in total nerve ring intensity measured with either marker, indicating a broad role for NRX-1 in synapse assembly. To determine whether the extra-synaptic RAB-3 puncta were a consequence of defective/reduced transport or, alternatively, defective synaptic capture, we performed live imaging of RAB-3::GFP in the dorsal asynaptic axonal region of DA9 (Figure S3 related to Figure 1). In addition to the brighter clusters apparent from the static images, we could also detect individual RAB-3 transport packets moving along the axon. We found that the total frequency of movements is actually higher in nrx-1(null) mutants (in both the anterograde and retrograde directions), and the speeds are unchanged (data not shown), indicating that the synaptic defects are not due to reduced axonal transport. Indeed, even the brighter clusters can be seen to move sporadically (arrows). The loss of synaptic puncta and increased axonal mobile puncta are similar to the phenotype of presynaptic assembly mutants such as syd-2/liprin-α (Wu et al., 2013Wu Y.E. Huo L. Maeder C.I. Feng W. Shen K. The balance between capture and dissociation of presynaptic proteins controls the spatial distribution of synapses.Neuron. 2013; 78: 994-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that a defect in the ability of these cargoes to be captured at synaptic sites may be the cause of their ectopic accumulations. C. elegans contains a single gene for neurexin’s canonical ligand, neuroligin (NLG-1). To determine whether neurexin’s effect on presynaptic assembly was mediated by binding to neuroligin, we analyzed synapses in nlg-1 mutants. nlg-1 mutants did not exhibit defects in presynaptic assembly (Figures 1D, 1E, and 1F), indicating that the function of NRX-1 in presynaptic assembly was independent of NLG-1 binding. Vertebrate neurexins are encoded by multiple genes and fall into three categories: full-length α-neurexin (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neurexins: synaptic cell surface proteins related to the alpha-latrotoxin receptor and laminin.Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), which contains 6 laminin-like LNS domains interleaved with 3 EGF repeats (Figure 2A), a shorter β-neurexin (Ushkaryov et al., 1994Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Conserved domain structure of β-neurexins. Unusual cleaved signal sequences in receptor-like neuronal cell-surface proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that only contains the sixth LNS domain (to which neuroligin binds), and a recently described even shorter γ-neurexin (Sterky et al., 2017Sterky F.H. Trotter J.H. Lee S.-J. Recktenwald C.V. Du X. Zhou B. Zhou P. Schwenk J. Fakler B. Südhof T.C. Carbonic anhydrase-related protein CA10 is an evolutionarily conserved pan-neurexin ligand.Proc. Natl.

USA. 2015; 112: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which does not contain any of the LNS/EGF domains. The single C. elegans nrx-1 gene encodes long isoforms homologous to α-neurexin, and short isoforms with homology to γ-neurexin (Figure 2A). To determine which isoforms of neurexin mediate presynaptic assembly, we made use of several large deletions of the nrx-1 genomic region (Figure 2A). The nu485 (“Δα”) allele specifically deletes only the α-neurexin isoforms (including all the LNS/EGF repeats). The wy778(“Δαγ”) allele is a complementary deletion that covers the common C terminus of the two isoform classes (including the transmembrane and intracellular domains) and deletes the entire γ-neurexin region. To be certain that we were completely abrogating neurexin function, we generated a third allele by CRISPR, wy1155(“null”), which is a deletion of the entire nrx-1 open reading frame. Both the wy1155 (null) and the wy778(Δαγ) alleles showed indistinguishable presynaptic assembly phenotypes in DA9 (Figure 2D). To our surprise, the α-neurexin-specific deletion allele nu485(Δα), in which only γ-neurexin remains, did not exhibit presynaptic assembly defects (Figures 2B and 2D). We verified that γ-neurexin expression was not dramatically upregulated in these mutants, using RT-PCR (Figure S4 related to Figure 2). To further establish that γ-neurexin was sufficient for presynaptic assembly, we isolated a γ-neurexin cDNA (the nrx-1 m transcript in wormbase.org) from a whole-worm cDNA library and expressed it under the DA9-specific promoter in the nrx-1(null) mutant background. We found that presynaptic assembly was fully rescued, similar to the effect of expressing α-neurexin (Figure 2D). In fact, this level of overexpression of γ-neurexin led to the formation of even more CLA-1 puncta than in wild-type (Figures 2C and 2D), confirming that the region of the neurexin protein encoded by γ-neurexin is sufficient to drive presynaptic assembly. To investigate the subcellular and sub-synaptic localization of NRX-1, we tagged both α- and γ-neurexin cDNAs with a GFP inserted just upstream of the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain (putting the GFP directly at the C terminus led to diffuse expression through the neuron, indicating that the PDZ-binding domain may be important for mediating NRX-1 localization) and compared their expression patterns to that of RAB-3. Both NRX-1 isoforms localized specifically to synapses in DA9 and accumulated at the ventral tip of the presynaptic varicosity, where active zone proteins reside (Figures 2E and 2G). These results confirm that NRX-1 is a presynaptically localized protein. To determine whether the localization of α-neurexin, which has a putative neuroligin binding domain, is dependent on neuroligin binding, we crossed our α-neurexin::GFP strain into nlg-1 mutants. We could not detect any differences in α-neurexin localization in nlg-1 mutants (Figure 2F), indicating that neuroligin is not required for either the synaptic or subsynaptic distribution pattern of NRX-1. In addition to its role in synapse assembly, neurexin has also been shown to play a role in calcium channel function and calcium-dependent synaptic vesicle release in vivo (Chen et al., 2017Chen L.Y.

Recently, neurexin was shown to bind the α2δ-3 subunit of calcium channels and to reduce CaV2.2 currents in vitro (Tong et al., 2017Tong X.-J. López-Soto E.J. Li L. Liu H. Nedelcu D. Lipscombe D.

In C. elegans the presynaptic CaV2-type calcium channel, encoded by the unc-2 gene, is required for normal synaptic transmission (Richmond et al., 2001Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2892515766,"Non-image-forming vision in mammals is mediated primarily by melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). In mouse M1-ipRGCs, by far the best-studied subtype, melanopsin activates PLCβ4 (phospholipase C-β4) to open TRPC6,7 channels, mechanistically similar to phototransduction in fly rhabdomeric (microvillous) photoreceptors. We report here that, surprisingly, mouse M4-ipRGCs rely on a different and hitherto undescribed melanopsin-driven, ciliary phototransduction mechanism involving cyclic nucleotide as the second messenger and HCN channels rather than CNG channels as the ion channel for phototransduction. Even more surprisingly, within an individual mouse M2-ipRGC, this HCN-channel-dependent, ciliary phototransduction pathway operates in parallel with the TRPC6,7-dependent rhabdomeric pathway. These findings reveal a complex heterogeneity in phototransduction among ipRGCs and, more importantly, break a general dogma about segregation of the two phototransduction motifs, likely with strong evolutionary implications."

Few studies have investigated how stigma contributes to our understanding of the well-being of acne sufferers, although it is clear that acne is stigmatized and stigmatization is associated with impaired well-being. The current study aimed to investigate the ability of perceived stigma to predict health-related quality of life, psychological distress, and somatic symptoms over and above established predictors. University students and staff suffering from acne completed self-report measures online. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that perceived stigma significantly contributed to the prediction of all three well-being measures, over and above the effects of gender, acne severity, acne location, and use of medication. Indeed, perceived stigma made the largest unique contribution to predicting well-being. Our findings suggest that interventions that attempt to counter stigma could also improve the overall well-being of people affected by acne."

Methods An observational cross-sectional pilot study was conducted at a single Japanese university hospital. One hundred and twenty-nine patients who were diagnosed with AF and who were taking DOACs were recruited from outpatients between January 4th and April 25th, 2017. We evaluated medication adherence to DOACs using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) and illness perceptions using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). The patients’ characteristics and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Results Ninety-nine (76.7%) patients (male, n = 74; mean age, 71.4±9.8 years) participated in this study. According to the MMAS-8, 21 (21.2%) of the patients were classified into the poor adherence group (MMAS-8 score of <6), and 78 (78.8%) were classified into the good adherence group (MMAS-8 score of 6–8). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (per year, odds ratio [OR] 0.912, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.853–0.965, p = 0.001), a history of warfarin use (OR 0.181, 95% CI 0.033–0.764, p = 0.019), duration of DOAC exposure (per 100 days, OR 1.245, 95% CI 1.084–1.460, p = 0.001), and the BIPQ emotional response score (per 1 point, OR 1.235, 95% CI 1.015–1.527, p = 0.035) were significantly associated with poor medication adherence in AF patients receiving DOACs. Conclusion Poor medication adherence to DOACs was strongly associated with a stronger emotional response (i.e. stronger feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression), as well as younger age, the absence of a history of warfarin treatment, and longer DOAC exposure. Further evaluation of the factors associated with medication adherence in AF patients and the development and execution of strategies for improving poor adherence are warranted in the real-world clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2893247092,"Virulent strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often associated with an acquired cytotoxic protein, exoenzyme U (ExoU) that rapidly destroys the cell membranes of host cells by its phospholipase activity. Strains possessing the exoU gene are predominant in eye infections and are more resistant to antibiotics. Thus, it is essential to understand treatment options for these strains. Here, we have investigated the resistance profiles and genes associated with resistance for fluoroquinolone and beta-lactams. A total of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa from anterior eye infections, microbial keratitis (MK), and the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were used. Based on whole genome sequencing, the prevalence of the exoU gene was 61.5% in MK isolates whereas none of the CF isolates possessed this gene. Overall, higher antibiotic resistance was observed in the isolates possessing exoU. Of the exoU strains, all except one were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 100% were resistant to beta-lactams. 75% had mutations in quinolone resistance determining regions (T81I gyrA and/or S87L parC) which correlated with fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, exoU strains had mutations at K76Q, A110T, and V126E in ampC, Q155I and V356I in ampR and E114A, G283E, and M288R in mexR genes that are associated with higher beta-lactamase and efflux pump activities. In contrast, such mutations were not observed in the strains lacking exoU. The expression of the ampC gene increased by up to nine-fold in all eight exoU strains and the ampR was upregulated in seven exoU strains compared to PAO1. The expression of mexR gene was 1.4 to 3.6 fold lower in 75% of exoU strains. This study highlights the association between virulence traits and antibiotic resistance in pathogenic P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2892623435,"Inverse dynamics is a technique in which measured kinematics and, possibly, external forces are used to calculate net joint torques in a rigid body linked segment model. However, kinematics and forces are usually not consistent due to incorrect modelling assumptions and measurement errors. This is commonly resolved by introducing ‘residual forces and torques’ which compensate for this problem, but do not exist in reality. In this study a constrained optimization algorithm is proposed that finds the kinematics that are mechanically consistent with measured external forces and mimic the measured kinematics as closely as possible. The algorithm was tested on datasets containing planar kinematics and ground reaction forces obtained during human walking at three velocities (0.8 m/s, 1.25 and 1.8 m/s). Before optimization, the residual force and torque were calculated for a typical example. Both showed substantial values, indicating the necessity of developing a mechanically consistent algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm converged to a solution in which the residual forces and torques were zero, without changing the ground reaction forces and with only minor changes to the measured kinematics. When using a rigid body approach, our algorithm ensures a consistent description of forces and kinematics, thereby improving the validity of calculated net joint torque and power values."

This study focused on the spore cortex of Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive, toxin-producing anaerobic bacterial pathogen that can colonize the human intestinal tract and is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

Our previous study shows that Lin28A is highly expressed in OC tissues and is involved in the regulation of OC cell biological behavior. In this study, we confirmed that high expression of Lin28A promoted the survival, invasion, metastasis, and inhibited the apoptosis of OC cells. Lin28A interacts with Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase2 (ROCK2) but not ROCK1 and upregulates the expression of ROCK2 in OC cells. The binding sites of each other were identified by truncated mutations and Immuno-precipitaion (IP) assay. After knock down of ROCK2 in cells with high expression of Lin28A, the survival, invasion, metastasis was significantly inhibited and early apoptosis was increased in OC cells and OC xenograft in nude mice. Our experimental data also showed that knock down of ROCK2 but not ROCK1 inhibited the invasion by decreasing the expression of N-cadherin, Slug, β-catenin and increasing ZO-1 expression. Simultaneously, knock down of ROCK2 induced cell apoptosis by increasing cleaved Caspase-9,cleaved Caspase-7, and cleaved Caspase-3. Taken together, Lin28A regulated the biological behaviors in OC cells through ROCK2 and the interaction of Lin28A/ROCK2 may be a new target for diagnosis and gene therapy of OC."
https://openalex.org/W2892636063,"Hair cortisol concentration (HCC), as a novel promising method to retrospectively measure hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, is being increasingly studied. We tested the relationships between HCC and a range of possible confounding variables in a Spanish sample of healthy adults and pregnant women.The number of healthy adults who participated in the study was 529, being 270 males and 259 females, with a combined mean age of 37.88 years (SD = 15.66). Additionally, a separate sample of 62 pregnant women was also recruited with a mean age of 32.95 (SD = 3.67), and in the first trimester of pregnancy. Each participant was interviewed before the study to obtain sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, and a hair sample was taken from the posterior vertex of the head, cut as close to the scalp as possible. Assuming the average growth rate of head hair is 1 cm per month, a 3-cm segment was analysed, in order to measure the cortisol concentrations from a three-month period. For the pregnant women, hair samples for each trimester of pregnancy were analysed.The mean hair cortisol concentration was 127.91 (111.52) pg/mg for the general sample. The variables of age, education, employment status, use of hair dyes, use of oral contraceptives, and physical exercise had a significant relation to HCC. When adjusted for further variables, only education and physical exercise remained statistically significant. When including the use of oral contraceptives and only with respect to females, only physical exercise remains statistically significant. For the subsample of pregnant woman, the mean hair cortisol concentration was 334.51 (409.77) pg/mg for the first trimester, 302.18 (270.24) pg/mg for the second trimester, and 331.31 (295.46) pg/mg for the third trimester of pregnancy. None of the assessed confounding variables (age, body mass index, previous miscarriages, employment status, hair dyes, dependent children and physical exercise), except education level, was related to HCC.In this sample of healthy Spaniards, results suggested an association between HCC and physical exercise and educational level. In pregnant women, the prevalence of HCC was higher than in non-pregnant woman, and was related to educational level. This study emphasises the need to determine the relationship between HCC and confounders such as sociodemographic and lifestyle variables in the general population and specific groups formed by individuals such as pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2893186854,"The dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (DYN/KOR) system appears to be a key mediator of the behavioral effects of chronic exposure to alcohol. Although KOR opioid receptor antagonists have been shown to decrease stress-related behaviors in animal models during acute ethanol withdrawal, the role of the DYN/KOR system in regulating long-term behavioral changes following protracted abstinence from ethanol is not well understood. The objective of the current study was to further explore the role of the DYN/KOR system in regulating stress-related behavioral changes associated with acute withdrawal and protracted abstinence from ethanol. More specifically, the present experiments sought to examine the ability of the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) to reverse depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test in rats exposed to chronic ethanol. In the first experiment, rats were fed an ethanol or control liquid diet for 28-30 days, and then 24 hours after removal of the diet, were exposed to inescapable swim stress. Immediately following this procedure, rats were injected with nor-BNI (20 mg/kg) or saline and then tested 24 hours later in the forced swim test. A second experiment used a similar procedure to examine the effects of nor-BNI on behavioral changes during protracted abstinence in rats tested in the forced swim test 3 weeks after exposure to the ethanol liquid diet procedure. Ethanol-dependent rats showed increased immobility, which is thought to indicate a depressive-like state, when examined during acute withdrawal and protracted abstinence compared to controls, an effect attenuated by nor-BNI. These results suggest that the DYN/KOR system plays role in mediating both short- and long-term behavioral changes associated with depression following chronic alcohol exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2893072529,"Background There is a lack of robust, rigorous mixed methods studies of patient safety culture generally and notably those which incorporate behavioural theories of change. The study aimed to quantify and explain key aspects of patient safety culture which were of most concern to healthcare professionals in Qatar. Methods A sequential explanatory mixed methods design of a cross-sectional survey followed by focus groups in Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. All doctors, nurses and pharmacists were invited to complete the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPS). Respondents expressing interest in focus group participation were sampled purposively, and discussions based on survey findings using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to explain behavioural determinants. Results One thousand, six hundred and four questionnaires were received (67.9% nurses, 13.3% doctors, 12.9% pharmacists). HSOPS composites with the lowest levels of positive responses were non-punitive response to errors (24.0% positive) and staffing (36.2%). Specific TDF determinants potentially associated with these composites were social/professional role and identity, emotions, and environmental context and resources. Thematic analysis identified issues of doctors relying on pharmacists to correct their errors and being reluctant to alter the prescribing of fellow doctors. There was a lack of recognition of nurses’ roles and frequent policy non-adherence. Stress, workload and lack of staff at key times were perceived to be major contributors to errors. Conclusions This study has quantified areas of concern relating to patient safety culture in Qatar and suggested important behavioural determinants. Rather than focusing on changing behaviour at the individual practitioner level, action may be required at the organisational strategic level to review policies, structures (including resource allocation and distribution) and processes which aim to promote patient safety culture."
https://openalex.org/W2894146012,"At present obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in India are the most challenging health problems. It is also well accepted that obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of metabolic syndrome and other degenerative diseases. Many studies have reported that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene have been associated with obesity and its related disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate the association of two intronic variants in ADIPOQ gene, -3971A>G (rs822396) and +276G>T (rs1501299) with obesity and metabolic syndrome.Biochemical and anthropometric measurements were obtained from a total of 550 unrelated subjects (obese = 250 and non-obese = 300) of North Indian Punjabi population. Genotyping for the intron variants were performed by polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. After genotyping, as a quality control measure 10% of the samples for each polymorphism were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing method. The distributions of genotypic and allelic frequencies among obese and non-obese groups were compared by chi-square test and the corresponding risk was calculated using binary logistic regression. The effects of multiple testing were controlled by applying Bonferroni corrections.All the anthropometric and biochemical parameters except triglycerides (TG) and very low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (VLDL-C) have shown significant association with both GG and TT genotypes of -3971A>G (rs822396) and +276G>T (rs1501299) polymorphisms respectively. The frequencies of GG (-3971A>G) and TT (+276G>T) genotypes were higher among obese cases (p = 0.008 and p = 0.035 respectively). However, no significant association was found between allelic frequencies of ADIPOQ rs822396 and obesity, whereas the association of ADIPOQ rs1501299 attenuated and became marginally significant after Bonferroni correction (p>0.025). Both the variant genotypes of ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms (-3971GG and +276TT) significantly increased the risk of development of obesity (OR: 1.52, p = 0.03; OR: 1.58, p = 0.04 respectively) and MetS (OR: 1.42, p = 0.03; OR: 1.57, p = 0.01 respectively) in the present population, after adjusting the various covariates. The G-T haplotype model (possessing -3971G and +276T alleles) was shown toprovide ~ 3 fold risk towards the obesity susceptibility (OR: 2.69, p = 0.009) and MetS risk (OR: 2.73, p = 0.009) and the association persisted after adjusting for different confounding variables.The present study has confirmed that ADIPOQ -3971A>G (rs822396) and +276G>T (rs1501299) polymorphism may be clinically helpful to estimate obesity and MetS risk in North Indian Punjabi population."
https://openalex.org/W2894122340,"Comparing the functional performance of biological systems often requires comparing multiple mechanical properties. Such analyses, however, are commonly presented using orthogonal plots that compare N ≤ 3 properties. Here, we develop a multidimensional visualization strategy using permutated radar charts (radial, multi-axis plots) to compare the relative performance distributions of mechanical systems on a single graphic across N ≥ 3 properties. Leveraging the fact that radar charts plot data in the form of closed polygonal profiles, we use shape descriptors for quantitative comparisons. We identify mechanical property-function correlations distinctive to rigid, flexible, and damage-tolerant biological materials in the form of structural ties, beams, shells, and foams. We also show that the microstructures of dentin, bone, tendon, skin, and cartilage dictate their tensile performance, exhibiting a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility. Lastly, we compare the feeding versus singing performance of Darwin’s finches to demonstrate the potential of radar charts for multidimensional comparisons beyond mechanics of materials."
https://openalex.org/W2892530831,"Acute leukemias are aggressive malignancies of developmentally arrested hematopoietic progenitors. We sought here to explore the possibility that changes in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells during development might alter the biology of leukemias arising from this tissue compartment. Using a mouse model of acute T cell leukemia, we found that leukemias generated from fetal liver (FL) and adult bone marrow (BM) differed dramatically in their leukemia stem cell activity with FL leukemias showing markedly reduced serial transplantability as compared to BM leukemias. We present evidence that this difference is due to NOTCH1-driven autocrine IGF1 signaling, which is active in FL cells but restrained in BM cells by EZH2-dependent H3K27 trimethylation. Further, we confirmed this mechanism is operative in human disease and show that enforced IGF1 signaling effectively limits leukemia stem cell activity. These findings demonstrate that resurrecting dormant fetal programs in adult cells may represent an alternate therapeutic approach in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2893136374,"Although the burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to increase worldwide, genetic factors predicting progression to cirrhosis and decompensation in NAFLD remain poorly understood. We sought to determine whether gene expression profiling was associated with clinical decompensation and death in patients with NAFLD, and to assess whether altered DNA methylation contributes to these changes in gene expression.We performed a retrospective analysis of 86 patients in the Duke NAFLD Clinical Database and Biorepository with biopsy-proven NAFLD whose liver tissue was previously evaluated for gene expression and DNA methylation using array based technologies. We assessed the prospective development of liver and cardiovascular disease related outcomes, including hepatic decompensation as identified by the development of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, or variceal bleeding as well as stroke and myocardial infarction via medical chart review.Of the 86 patients, 47 had F0-F1 fibrosis and 39 had F3-F4 fibrosis at index liver biopsy. Gene expression probe sets (n = 54,675) were analyzed; 42 genes showed significant differential expression (p<0.05) and a two-fold change in expression between patients with and without any outcome. Two expression probes of the branched chain amino-acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) gene were upregulated (p = 0.02; fold change 2.1 and 2.2 respectively) in patients with a clinical outcome. Methylation of three of the 34 BCAT1 CpG methylation probes were significantly inversely correlated with BCAT1 expression specific to the probes predictive of clinical deterioration.We found differential gene expression, correlated to changes in DNA methylation, at multiple BCAT1 loci in patients with cardiovascular outcomes and/or hepatic decompensation. BCAT1 catalyzes the transformation of alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate and has been linked to the presence and severity of NAFLD, possibly through derangements in the balance between glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate. Given the potential for BCAT1 to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes, and the potential therapeutic implications, these results should be validated in larger prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W2894250486,"When focused on a specific internal task like calculating a multiplication in mind we are able to ignore sensory distraction. This may be achieved by effective perceptual decoupling during internally directed cognition. The present study investigated whether decoupling from external events during internally directed cognition represents an active shielding mechanism that adapts to expected external distraction or a passive/automatic shielding mechanism that is independent of external distraction. Participants performed multiplications in mind (e.g. 26 x 7), a task that required to turn attention inward as soon as the problem was encoded. At the beginning of a block of trials, participants were informed whether or not distractors could appear during the calculation period, thereby potentially allowing them to prepare for the distractors. We tracked their eye behavior as markers of perceptual decoupling and workload. Turning attention inward to calculate the multiplication elicited evidence of perceptual decoupling for five of six eye parameters: blink rate, saccade and microsaccade rate increased, gaze was less constricted to the center, and pupils dilated. Although participants perceived blocks with distractors as more challenging, performance and eye behavior markers of both perceptual decoupling and workload were unaffected. This result supports the notion of perceptual decoupling as an automatic mechanism: focusing inward induces desensitization to external events independent of external distraction."
https://openalex.org/W2893394461,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ABC transporter that exports many amphipathic or hydrophobic compounds, including chemically and functionally dissimilar anticancer drugs, from cells. To understand the role of transmembrane helices (TMH) 1 and 7 in drug-binding and transport, we selected six residues from both TMH1 (V53, I59, I60, L65, M68 and F72) and TMH7 (V713, I719, I720, Q725, F728 and F732); and substituted them with alanine by gene synthesis to generate a variant termed “TMH1,7 mutant P-gp”. The expression and function of TMH1,7 mutant P-gp with twelve mutations was characterized using the BacMam baculovirus-HeLa cell expression system. The expression and conformation of TMH1,7 mutant P-gp was not altered by the introduction of the twelve mutations, as confirmed by using the human P-gp-specific antibodies UIC2, MRK16 and 4E3. We tested 25 fluorescently-labeled substrates and found that only three substrates, NBD-cyclosporine A, Rhod-2-AM and X-Rhod-1-AM were transported by the TMH1,7 mutant. The basal ATPase activity of TMH1,7 mutant P-gp was lower (40–50%) compared to wild-type (WT) P-gp, despite similar level of expression. Although most of the substrates modulate ATPase activity of P-gp, the activity of TMH1,7 mutant transporter was not significantly modulated by any of the tested substrates. Docking of selected substrates in homology models showed comparable docking scores for the TMH1,7 mutant and WT P-gp, although the binding conformations were different. Both the ATPase assay and in silico docking analyses suggest that the interactions with residues in the drug-binding pocket are altered as a consequence of the mutations. We demonstrate that it is possible to generate a variant of P-gp with a loss of broad substrate specificity and propose that TMH1 and TMH7 play a critical role in the drug efflux function of this multidrug transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2893367698,"High-frequency relapse remains a clinical hurdle for complete remission of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, with heterogeneous dysregulated signaling profiles—including of Raf-MEK-ERK and Akt-mTORC1-S6K signaling pathways—recently being implicated in disease outcomes. Here we report that GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common β-chain-associated protein (CBAP) is highly expressed in human T-ALL cell lines and many primary tumor tissues and is required to bolster leukemia cell proliferation in tissue culture and for in vivo leukemogenesis in a xenograft mouse model. Downregulation of CBAP markedly restrains expansion of leukemia cells and alleviates disease aggravation of leukemic mice. Transcriptomic profiling and molecular biological analyses suggest that CBAP acts upstream of Ras and Rac1, and functions as a modulator of both Raf-MEK–ERK and Akt-mTORC1 signaling pathways to control leukemia cell growth. Specifically, CBAP facilitated Akt-dependent TSC2 phosphorylation in cell-based assays and in vitro analysis, decreased lysosomal localization of TSC2, and elevated Rheb-GTP loading and subsequent activation of mTORC1 signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic contribution of CBAP in T-ALL leukemic cells, in addition to its original pro-apoptotic function in cytokine-dependent cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells, by demonstrating its functional role in the regulation of Akt-TSC2-mTORC1 signaling for leukemia cell proliferation. Thus, CBAP represents a novel therapeutic target for many types of cancers and metabolic diseases linked to PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2894067513,"Formins direct the elongation of unbranched actin filaments that are incorporated into a diverse set of cytoskeletal structures. Elongation of formin-bound filaments occurs along two parallel pathways. The formin homology 2 (FH2) pathway allows actin monomers to bind directly to barbed ends bound by dimeric FH2 domains. The formin homology 1 (FH1) pathway involves transfer of profilin-bound actin to the barbed end from polyproline tracts located in the disordered FH1 domains. Here, we used a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy-based fluorescence approach to determine the fraction of actin subunits incorporated via the FH1 and FH2 pathways during filament elongation mediated by two formins. We found that the fraction of filament elongation that occurs via each pathway directly depends on the efficiency of the other pathway, indicating that these two pathways compete with each other for subunit addition by formins. We conclude that this competition allows formins to compensate for changes in the efficiency of one pathway by adjusting the frequency of subunit addition via the other, thus increasing the overall robustness of formin-mediated actin polymerization.

CSB is proposed to participate in base-excision repair (BER), the primary pathway for repairing oxidative DNA damage, but exactly how CSB participates in this process is unknown. It is also unclear whether CSB contributes to other repair pathways during oxidative stress. Here, using a patient-derived CS1AN-sv cell line, we examined how CSB is targeted to chromatin in response to menadione-induced oxidative stress, both globally and locus-specifically. We found that menadione-induced, global CSB–chromatin association does not require CSB’s ATPase activity and is, therefore, mechanistically distinct from UV-induced CSB–chromatin association. Importantly, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) enhanced the kinetics of global menadione-induced CSB–chromatin association. We found that the major BER enzymes, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1), do not influence this association. Additionally, the level of γ-H2A histone family member X (γ-H2AX), a marker for dsDNA breaks, was not increased in menadione-treated cells. Therefore, our results support a model whereby PARP1 localizes to ssDNA breaks and recruits CSB to participate in DNA repair. Furthermore, this global CSB–chromatin association occurred independently of RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription elongation. However, unlike global CSB–chromatin association, both PARP1 knockdown and inhibition of transcription elongation interfered with menadione-induced CSB recruitment to specific genomic regions.

The major repair pathway for oxidative DNA damage is base-excision repair (BER) (24Dianov G.L. Hübscher U.

BER is initiated by a substrate-specific DNA glycosylase that removes the oxidized base. This is followed by cleavage of the sugar-phosphate backbone and excision of the remaining apurinic-apyrimidinic site by apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) or, in some cases, glycosylases with inherent endonuclease activity. The resulting nicked DNA is recognized by and activates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), which uses NAD+ to catalyze the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers to itself as well as other proteins. PARP1 is hypothesized to recruit proteins important for DNA repair, such as the scaffold protein XRCC1. PARP1 may also serve to stabilize nicked DNA, preventing degradation of single-strand breaks into double-strand breaks (24Dianov G.L. Hübscher U.

CSB has also been shown to interact physically and functionally with several key BER proteins such as OGG1 and APE1 (33Tuo J. Chen C. Zeng X. Christiansen M. Bohr V.A.

Additionally, CSB associates with PARP1, and PARP1 has been shown to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate CSB (35Thorslund T. von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. Indig F.E. Christiansen M. Stevnsner T. Bohr V.A.

Under replicative cell growth conditions, CSB interacts with chromatin very dynamically, and only ∼10% of CSB stably associates with chromatin (37Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. UV-induced association of the CSB remodeling protein with chromatin requires ATP-dependent relief of N-terminal autorepression.Mol.

In response to UV DNA damage, where CSB is employed for TC-NER, the situation is reversed, and ∼90% of CSB can become stably associated with chromatin. Recently, we demonstrated that oxidative stress also stabilizes the association of CSB with chromatin on a global level (20Lake R.J. Boetefuer E.L. Won K.J. Fan H.Y. The CSB chromatin remodeler and CTCF architectural protein cooperate in response to oxidative stress.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26578602): 2125-213510.1093/nar/gkv1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that oxidative stress induces the occupancy of CSB at specific genomic loci, including loci containing the binding motif for the chromatin architectural protein CCCTC–binding transcription factor (CTCF) (20Lake R.J. Boetefuer E.L. Won K.J. Fan H.Y. The CSB chromatin remodeler and CTCF architectural protein cooperate in response to oxidative stress.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26578602): 2125-213510.1093/nar/gkv1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Importantly, we found that CSB and CTCF reciprocally regulate each other’s site-specific chromatin association in response to oxidative stress and that these two proteins interact directly (20Lake R.J. Boetefuer E.L. Won K.J. Fan H.Y. The CSB chromatin remodeler and CTCF architectural protein cooperate in response to oxidative stress.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26578602): 2125-213510.1093/nar/gkv1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a role for CSB in regulating higher-order chromatin structure during oxidative stress. In the present study, we further characterized the mechanisms by which CSB stably associates with chromatin, both globally and locus-specifically, in response to oxidative stress. CSB interacts dynamically with chromatin. During replicative cell growth, ∼10% of CSB co-fractionates with chromatin (Fig. 1, A and B) (20Lake R.J. Boetefuer E.L. Won K.J. Fan H.Y. The CSB chromatin remodeler and CTCF architectural protein cooperate in response to oxidative stress.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26578602): 2125-213510.1093/nar/gkv1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, when cells are treated with menadione, which creates oxidative stress by producing reactive oxygen species (38Aherne S.A. O'Brien N.M. Mechanism of protection by the flavonoids, quercetin and rutin, against tert-butylhydroperoxide- and menadione-induced DNA single strand breaks in Caco-2 cells.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29 (11025194): 507-51410.1016/S0891-5849(00)00360-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a substantial increase in CSB–chromatin association is observed (Fig. 1, A and B) (20Lake R.J. Boetefuer E.L. Won K.J. Fan H.Y. The CSB chromatin remodeler and CTCF architectural protein cooperate in response to oxidative stress.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26578602): 2125-213510.1093/nar/gkv1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that enhanced CSB–chromatin association results from oxidative stress created by menadione. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that enhanced chromatin association could be associated with another biological consequence of menadione treatment, especially at a relatively high menadione dose (100 μm). To dissect the mechanisms by which menadione induces the global association of CSB with chromatin, we used the patient-derived, CSB-deficient CS1AN-sv cell line, stably reconstituted with WT CSB (CS1AN-CSBWT) (Fig. S1, A and B). CSB’s expression level in CS1AN-CSBWT cells is within 2-fold of that of the human fibroblast cell line MRC5 (Fig. S1A) (39Cho I. Tsai P.F. Lake R.J. Basheer A. Fan H.Y. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by Cockayne syndrome protein B and NAP1-like histone chaperones is required for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9 (23637612)e100340710.1371/journal.pgen.1003407Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We examined the time dependence of CSB–chromatin association in CS1AN-CSBWT cells treated with 100 μm menadione and found that ∼90% of CSB co-fractionates with chromatin within 30 min (Fig. 1, A and B). As demonstrated previously, the partitioning between soluble and chromatin fractions of another ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, BRG1, was not grossly altered by menadione treatment, and therefore, BRG1 was used as a protein loading control for normalization (Fig. 1A) (20Lake R.J. Boetefuer E.L. Won K.J. Fan H.Y. The CSB chromatin remodeler and CTCF architectural protein cooperate in response to oxidative stress.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26578602): 2125-213510.1093/nar/gkv1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Acetylated histones H3 as well as Ponceau S staining of total histone proteins were used as controls to examine chromatin fractionation efficiency (Fig. 1A). Additionally, as expected, the active form of RNA polymerase II was in the chromatin fraction, whereas GAPDH was in the soluble fraction. The CTCF protein, shown previously to increase its association with CSB in response to menadione treatment (20Lake R.J. Boetefuer E.L. Won K.J. Fan H.Y. The CSB chromatin remodeler and CTCF architectural protein cooperate in response to oxidative stress.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26578602): 2125-213510.1093/nar/gkv1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was chromatin-associated regardless of menadione treatment (Fig. 1A). We next examined how two other DNA repair proteins behaved in this fractionation assay (Fig. 1A). Menadione treatment induced the chromatin association of XRCC1, a scaffolding protein involved in DNA repair (Fig. 1, A and B). We found that PARP1 was present in both the soluble and chromatin fractions, and its partitioning between these two fractions was not significantly changed by menadione treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, we did not observe any apparent change in the levels of the classic marker for DNA double-strand breaks, γ-H2AX, after menadione treatment (Fig. 1A). To further demonstrate that oxidative stress increases CSB–chromatin association, we performed anti-CSB chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by Western blot analysis, using an antibody against histone H3. We found a greater than 5-fold increase of histone H3 co-immunoprecipitating with CSB in cells treated with menadione than in untreated cells, demonstrating that menadione treatment increases the association of CSB with chromatin (Fig. 1C). Stable CSB–chromatin association can also be induced by UV irradiation; this association requires ATP hydrolysis by CSB to relieve autorepression (37Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. UV-induced association of the CSB remodeling protein with chromatin requires ATP-dependent relief of N-terminal autorepression.Mol.

We next determined whether menadione-induced stable CSB–chromatin association is also ATP-dependent. To this end, we used the CSB-deficient CS1AN-sv cell line reconstituted with a CSB protein harboring a patient-derived mutation, CSBR670W, which is devoid of ATPase activity (Figs. 1D and S1, A and B) (37Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. UV-induced association of the CSB remodeling protein with chromatin requires ATP-dependent relief of N-terminal autorepression.Mol.

In sharp contrast to UV-induced CSB–chromatin association, menadione-induced stable association of CSBR670W with chromatin was kinetically similar to CSBWT. This result reveals that ATP hydrolysis by CSB is dispensable for global CSB–chromatin association in response to menadione treatment. To dissect further the mechanism by which CSB becomes stably associated with chromatin in response to oxidative stress, we analyzed a set of CSB deletion derivatives (Fig. 2). All mutant proteins were stably expressed in CS1AN-sv cells and nuclear (Fig. S1, A and B) (37Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. UV-induced association of the CSB remodeling protein with chromatin requires ATP-dependent relief of N-terminal autorepression.Mol.

CSBΔN, which is devoid of its N-terminal region but has intact ATPase and C-terminal domains, co-fractionates with chromatin, even in the absence of UV irradiation (37Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y. UV-induced association of the CSB remodeling protein with chromatin requires ATP-dependent relief of N-terminal autorepression.Mol.

However, unlike UV-induced CSB–chromatin association, menadione treatment resulted in a further increase in the association of CSBΔN with chromatin (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that CSB responds to oxidative stress through its ATPase and/or C-terminal domains. Deleting the last 484 amino acids of CSB (CSBΔC) abolishes the ability of CSB to associate with chromatin in response to UV irradiation (37Lake R.J. Geyko A. Hemashettar G. Zhao Y. Fan H.Y.

Policies differ in the extent and type of land use changes they induce and therefore in their impact on water resources. We quantify and compare the spatially varying water impacts of biofuel crops stemming from LUC induced by two different biofuels policies by coupling a biophysical model with an economic model to simulate the economically viable mix of crops, land uses, and crop management choices under alternative policy scenarios. We assess the outputs of an economic model with a high-resolution crop-water model for major agricultural crops and potential cellulosic feedstocks in the US to analyze the impacts of three alternative policy scenarios on water balances: a counterfactual ‘no-biofuels policy’ (BAU) scenario, a volumetric mandate (Mandate) scenario, and a clean fuel-intensity standard (CFS) scenario incentivizing fuels based on their carbon intensities. While both biofuel policies incentivize more biofuels than in the counterfactual, they differ in the mix of corn ethanol and advanced biofuels from miscanthus and switchgrass (more corn ethanol in Mandate and more cellulosic biofuels in CFS). The two policies differ in their impact on irrigated acreage, irrigation demand, groundwater use and runoff. Net irrigation requirements increase 0.7% in Mandate and decrease 3.8% in CFS, but in both scenarios increases are concentrated in regions of Kansas and Nebraska that rely upon the Ogallala aquifer for irrigation water. Our study illustrates the importance of accounting for the overall LUC and shifts in agricultural production and management practices in response to policies when assessing the water impacts of biofuels."
https://openalex.org/W2894380585,"All cellular processes, including those involved in normal cell metabolism to those responsible for cell proliferation or death, are finely controlled by cell signaling pathways, whose core proteins constitute the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) are two important PIKK proteins that act in response to DNA damage, phosphorylating a large number of proteins to exert control over genomic integrity. The genus Leishmania belongs to a group of early divergent eukaryotes in evolution and has a highly plastic genome, probably owing to the existence of signaling pathways designed to maintain genomic integrity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of specific human inhibitors of ATR and ATM in Leishmania major. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the existence of the putative PIKK genes ATR and ATM, in addition to mTOR and DNA-PKcs in Leishmania spp. Moreover, it was possible to suggest that the inhibitors VE-821 and KU-55933 have binding affinity for the catalytic sites of putative L. major ATR and ATM, respectively. Promastigotes of L. major exposed to these inhibitors show slight growth impairment and minor changes in cell cycle and morphology. It is noteworthy that treatment of promastigotes with inhibitors VE-821 and KU-55933 enhanced the oxidative damage caused by hydrogen peroxide. These inhibitors could significantly reduce the number of surviving L. major cells following H2O2 exposure whilst also decreasing their evaluated IC50 to H2O2 to less than half of that observed for non-treated cells. These results suggest that the use of specific inhibitors of ATR and ATM in Leishmania interferes in the signaling pathways of this parasite, which can impair its tolerance to DNA damage and affect its genome integrity. ATR and ATM could constitute novel targets for drug development and/or repositioning for treatment of leishmaniases."
https://openalex.org/W2894517532,"Suicide mortality among immigrant groups is an important health issue, particularly in countries with growing segments of immigrant populations such as Norway. Through linkage of Norwegian national registers we wanted to estimate suicide rates (per 100,000 population) in immigrant groups and to profile characteristics of suicide by immigration background with respect to sex, age, method and seasonality of suicide as well as time since immigrating to Norway. Among all 11,409 suicides during 1992-2012, 1,139 (10%) were individuals with an immigration background. Suicide rate was lower in first-generation immigrants (foreign-born persons to two foreign-born parents) than native Norwegians (9.53 vs 12.22, P < 0.01), with a significant difference confined to male rates only. Foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent had significantly higher suicide rates than natives in both sexes (22.42 vs 18.03 in males, 11.67 vs 6.54 in females, P < 0.01). The most frequently used suicide method in all the population groups was hanging; this method accounted for 44.0% of all suicides of first-generation immigrants, 45.2% of all suicides of foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent, and 35.4% of all suicides of natives. Suicide by firearms accounted for a much smaller proportion of cases of first-generation immigrants (6.7%) and foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent (6.8%) than cases of native Norwegians (20.7%). In terms of monthly distribution, suicides of first-generation immigrants displayed two peaks, in May and in November (P = 0.01). More than 25% of all first-generation immigrant suicides occurred in the first five years after immigration; but differences in time since immigration were observed by sex and country group of origin, in particular among those aged 35 years or less when moving to Norway. In conclusion, there are notable differences in characteristics of suicides by immigration background. Knowledge of immigrant mortality according to suicide method, seasonality of suicide, and time since immigration may be useful when planning suicide preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W2893077951,"Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is used as malaria chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women and children in Ghana. Plasmodium falciparum resistance to SP is linked to mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase gene (pfdhps), dihydrofolate reductase gene (pfdhfr) and amplification of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1) gene. The pfgch1 duplication is associated with pfdhfr L164, a crucial mutant for high level pyrimethamine resistance which is rare in Ghana. The presence of amplified pfgch1 in Ghanaian isolates could be an indicator of the evolution of the L164 mutant. This study therefore determined the pfgch1 copy number variations and SP resistance mutations in clinical isolates from Ghana. One hundred and ninety-two (192) blood samples collected from children aged ≤14 years with uncomplicated malaria in 2013-14 and 2015-16 were used. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the pfgch1 copy number and nested PCR-Sanger sequencing used to detect mutations in pfdhps and pfdhfr genes. Twelve parasites (6.3%) harbored double copies of the pfgch1 gene out of the 192 samples. Of the 12, 75% had the pfdhfr I51-R59-N108, 92% had the pfdhps G437 mutant, 8% had the pfdhps E540 and 67% had the SP resistance haplotype IRNG. No L164 was detected in samples with amplified pfgch1. The rare T108 mutant associated with cycloguanil resistance showed predominance (60%) over N108 in the 2015-16 isolates. The observation of parasites with increased copy number of pfgch1 gene is indicative of the future evolution of the rare quadruple pfdhfr mutant, I51-R59-N108-L164, in Ghanaian parasites. Mutant pfdhps isolates also had increased gch1 copy number suggestive that it may also facilitate sulphadoxine resistance. The selection of parasites with pfgch1 gene amplification will enhance the sustenance and persistence of parasites with SP resistance in the country. Policy makers need to begin the search for a replacement chemoprophylaxis drug for malaria vulnerable groups in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2894066941,"Fish are important for food supply, especially in developing countries. In Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, the mud crab fishery is an important livelihood that represents a valuable source of income and food to coastal communities. However, the increasing demand for mud crab in domestic and international markets and poor management has generated concern about the status of this fishery across Southeast Asia. In this region, at least four species of mud crab in the genus Scylla are recognised but their correct identification and occurrence remain to be fully explained. Relying on accurate taxonomic identification of mud crab species represents the cornerstone of the successful implementation of management plans as life history biology and relative exploitation rates may vary by species due to gear susceptibility. Toward this aim, tissue samples from mud crabs were collected from four fishing communities of the Mergui archipelago, in the Tanintharyi region of southern Myanmar. All crab samples were DNA barcoded for species identification through sequencing. This study is the first genetic characterization of the mud crab fishery in Myanmar and revealed that Scylla olivacea was the only species found in the sampled fisheries of the Tanintharyi region. The populations studied across the Mergui archipelago did not show evidence of genetic structure, but gene flow appeared to be limited among conspecifics from neighbouring countries."
https://openalex.org/W2893146123,"Neuroimaging provides a unique tool to investigate otherwise difficult-to-access mental processes like visual imagery. Prior studies support the idea that visual imagery is a top-down reinstatement of visual perception, and it is likely that this extends to object processing. Here we use functional MRI and multi-voxel pattern analysis to ask if mental imagery of cars engages the fusiform face area, similar to what is found during perception. We test only individuals who we assumed could imagine individual car models based on their above-average perceptual abilities with cars. Our results provide evidence that cars are represented differently from common objects in face-selective visual areas, at least in those with above-average car recognition ability. Moreover, pattern classifiers trained on data acquired during imagery can decode the neural response pattern acquired during perception, suggesting that the tested object categories are represented similarly during perception and visual imagery. The results suggest that, even at high-levels of visual processing, visual imagery mirrors perception to some extent, and that face-selective areas may in part support non-face object imagery."
https://openalex.org/W2892822623,"Two regions on the α subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), the Switch II/α2 helix (which changes conformation upon GDP-GTP exchange) and the α3 helix, have been shown to contain the binding sites for their effector proteins. However, how the binding of Gα subunits to their effector proteins is translated into the stimulation of effector activity is still poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of a reconstituted rhodopsin-coupled phototransduction system to address this question and identified a distinct surface and an essential residue on the α subunit of the G-protein transducin (αT) that is necessary to fully activate its effector enzyme, the cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). We started with a chimeric G-protein α subunit (αT*) comprising residues mainly from αT and a short stretch of residues from the Gi1 α subunit (αi1), which only weakly stimulates PDE activity. We then reinstated the αT residues by systematically replacing the corresponding αi1 residues within αT* with the aim of fully restoring PDE stimulatory activity. These experiments revealed that the αG/α4 loop and a phenylalanine residue at position 283 are essential for conferring the αT* subunit with full PDE stimulatory capability. We further demonstrated that this same region and amino acid within the α subunit of the Gs protein (αs) are necessary for full adenylyl cyclase activation. These findings highlight the importance of the αG/α4 loop and of an essential phenylalanine residue within this region on Gα subunits αT and αs as being pivotal for their selective and optimal stimulation of effector activity."
https://openalex.org/W2892932255,"Self-recovery schemes identify and restore tampering, using as a reference a compressed representation of a signal embedded into itself. In addition, audio self-recovery must comply with a transparency threshold, adequate for applications such as on-line music distribution or speech transmission. In this manuscript, an audio self-recovery scheme is proposed. Auditory masking properties of the signals are used to determine the frequencies that better mask the embedding distortion. Frequencies in the Fourier domain are mapped to the intDCT domain for embedding and extraction of reference bits for signal restoration. The contribution of this work is the use of auditory masking properties for the frequency selection and the mapping to the intDCT domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme satisfies a threshold of -2 ODG, suitable for audio applications. The efficacy of the scheme, in terms of its restoration capabilities, is also shown."
https://openalex.org/W2893237726,"Purpose To evaluate the potential role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (FDG-PET/CT) for predicting treatment response after radiotherapy (RT) in patients with spinal metastases. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was performed of 42 patients with spinal metastases who received RT from January 2010 to December 2014. All patients underwent FDG-PET/CT before and after treatment. Changes in metabolic responses, expressed as the maximum, mean, peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were analyzed to determine their association with clinical outcomes. Results The median age at the time of spinal metastasis diagnosis was 58 years. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival after RT were 15 months and 22.4 months, respectively. RT produced a significant decrease in SUVmean (2.27 to 1.41), SUVmax (6.87 to 2.99), SUVpeak (5.75 to 2.33) and TLG (52.84 to 24.17) when compared with the baseline values (p<0.001). The mean pain score decreased from 3.86 before RT to 0.79 after RT (p<0.001). There were significant linear relationships between maximum SUV and pain scores at baseline (r = 0.321, p = 0.038) and after treatment (r = 0.369, p = 0.016) as well as TLG at baseline (r = 0.428, p = 0.005) and after treatment (r = 0.403, p = 0.009). Local progression after treatment was identified in 12 patients (28.6%). Univariate analyses showed that >70% reduction in maximum SUV after treatment was independently associated with good PFS (p = 0.036). Conclusions RT is an effective treatment for patients with spinal metastases, and there were significant changes in PET parameters compared with baseline. The metabolic response measured by SUV and TLG changes in FDG-PET/CT correlated with the clinical outcomes, especially with shorter PFS in patients who had higher residual maximum SUV after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2892910101,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a cancer-causing virus in humans, primarily affecting AIDS patients. KSHV causes a range of cancers including Kaposi’s sarcoma, pleural effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease. Current methods available for treating these cancers are relatively ineffective, and new targets for therapy are needed. The KSHV viral homolog of interleukin-6 gene (vIL-6) may play a significant role in tumor development and may serve as a new anti-cancer target, but its role in tumor formation is only partially understood. Here, a novel animal model was used to study how vIL-6 affects tumor development. Highly immune-deficient Rag2-/-γc-/- mice were transplanted with an immortalized human B cell line (BJAB) harboring either wild-type (WT) KSHV or a mutant strain lacking vIL-6 ΔvIL-6). Solid tumors developed and total tumor mass and the number of tumors were characterized. The vIL-6 gene had no significant impact on tumor mass, but significantly more tumors were detected when vIL-6 was present. Significant differences in expression of B cell markers in cells from extracted tumors were detected based upon the presence of vIL-6. B cell markers in tumor cells were also compared to the same cell type in culture, prior to xenotransplantation; B cell markers were mostly downregulated during tumor formation and these changes did not differ based upon the presence of vIL-6. The only marker that significantly increased in expression during tumor development was CD30. Tumor blood vessels were quantified to determine if more angiogenesis occurred with vIL-6-expressing virus, but there was no significant difference. These data indicate that vIL-6 plays a role in KSHV tumor formation in B cells in vivo. Further investigation into how vIL-6 manipulates CD30 expression may shed insight into KSHV oncogenesis, and may identify how vIL-6 can be targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2893217452,Objective To demonstrate a method to calculate phase amplitude coupling (PAC) quickly and robustly for realtime applications. Methods We designed and implemented a multirate PAC algorithm with efficient filter bank processing and efficient computation of PAC for many frequency-pair combinations. We tested the developed algorithm for computing PAC on simulated data and on intraoperative neural recording data obtained during deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode implantation surgery. Results A combination of parallelized frequency-domain filtering and modulation index for PAC estimation provided robust results that could be calculated in real time on modest computing hardware. Conclusion The standard methods for calculating PAC can be optimized for quick and robust performance. Significance These results demonstrated that PAC can be extracted in real time and is suitable for neurofeedback applications.
https://openalex.org/W2894498577,"Changes in extracellular matrix proteins may contribute significantly to the adaptation of vein grafts to the arterial circulation. We examined the production and distribution of versican and hyaluronan in intact human vein rings cultured ex vivo, veins perfused ex vivo, and cultured venous adventitial and smooth muscle cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed higher levels of versican in the intima/media compared to the adventitia, and no differences in hyaluronan. In the vasa vasorum, versican and hyaluronan associated with CD34+ progenitor cells. Culturing the vein rings for 14 days revealed increased versican immunostaining of 30–40% in all layers, with no changes in hyaluronan. Changes in versican accumulation appear to result from increased synthesis in the intima/media and decreased degradation in the adventitia as versican transcripts were increased in the intima/media, but unchanged in the adventitia, and versikine (the ADAMTS-mediated cleavage product of versican) was increased in the intima/media, but decreased in the adventitia. In perfused human veins, versican was specifically increased in the intima/media in the presence of venous pressure, but not with arterial pressure. Unexpectedly, cultured adventitial cells express and accumulate more versican and hyaluronan than smooth muscle cells. These data demonstrate a differential regulation of versican and hyaluronan in human venous adventitia vs. intima/media and suggest distinct functions for these extracellular matrix macromolecules in these venous wall compartments during the adaptive response of vein grafts to the arterial circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2892587700,"Plant breeding is achieved through the controlled self- or cross-pollination of individuals and typically involves isolation of floral parts from selected parental plants. Paper, cellulose or synthetic materials are used to avoid self pollination or cross contamination. Low seed set limits the rate of breeding progress and increases costs. We hypothesized that a novel ‘non-woven’ fabric optimal for both pollination and seed set in multiple plant species could be developed. After determining the baseline pollen characteristics and usage requirements we established iterative three phase development and biological testing. This determined (1) that white fabric gave superior seed return and informed the (2) development of three non-woven materials using different fibre and layering techniques. We tested their performance in selfing and hybridisation experiments recording differences in performance by material type within species. Finally we (3) developed further advanced fabrics with increased air permeability and tested biological performance. An interaction between material type and species was observed and environmental decoupling investigated, showing that the non-woven fabrics had superior water vapour transmission and temperature regulation compared to controls. Overall, non-woven fabrics outperformed existing materials for both pollination and seed set and we found that different materials can optimize species-specific, rather than species-generic performance."

https://openalex.org/W2892662805,"Musculoskeletal complaints (MSC) are common in the general population, causing a major disease burden to the individual and society. The association between MSC and mortality is still unclear. To our knowledge, no study has hitherto evaluated the association between MSC onset within the last month (incident MSC) on the one hand, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality on the other.This prospective population-based cohort study was done using data from the second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT2) linked with data from a comprehensive national registry of cause of death. A total of 25,931 participants at risk for incident MSC were included. Hazard ratios (HR) of mortality were estimated for participants with incident MSC using Cox regression based on a mean of 14.1 years of follow-up.Participants who reported incident MSC did not have an excess mortality compared to those with no MSC in the analyses of all-cause mortality (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89-1.10) and cause specific mortality. This was true also after adjustment for several potential confounding factors. No clear association between the number of MSC body sites and mortality was found.Incident MSC were not associated with an increased mortality, neither for all-cause mortality, nor cause-specific mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2893810021,"Drosophila retinal degeneration C (RDGC) is the founding member of the PPEF family of protein phosphatases. RDGC mediates dephosphorylation of the visual pigment rhodopsin and the TRP ion channel. From the rdgC locus, three protein isoforms, termed RDGC-S, -M, and -L, with different N-termini are generated. Due to fatty acylation, RDGC-M and -L are attached to the plasma membrane while RDGC-S is soluble. To assign physiological roles to these RDGC isoforms, we constructed flies that express various combinations of RDGC protein isoforms. Expression of the RDGC-L isoform alone did not fully prevent rhodopsin hyperphosphorylation and resulted in impaired photoreceptor physiology and in decelerated TRP dephosphorylation at Ser936. However, expression of RDGC-L alone as well as RDGC-S/M was sufficient to prevent degeneration of photoreceptor cells which is a hallmark of the rdgC null mutant. Membrane-attached RDGC-M displayed higher activity of TRP dephosphorylation than the soluble isoform RDGC-S. Taken together, in vivo activities of RDGC splice variants are controlled by their N-termini."
https://openalex.org/W2893412205,"For each given pair of (rooted or unrooted) topological trees with the same number of leaves a strict upper bound is shown for the tree partition distance (also called symmetric difference metric and Robinson-Foulds distance)-in case of unrooted trees-and for the cluster distance (also called Robinson-Foulds distance)-in case of rooted trees-of corresponding phylogenetic trees. In particular, it is shown that there exist assignments of labels (e.g., species) to the leaves of both topological tree where each label is assigned to exactly one leaf in each tree such that: i) in the unrooted case, the tree partition distance between the corresponding phylogenetic trees equals the number of internal edges in both trees minus the number of nodes with degree 2 in both trees, ii) in the rooted case, the cluster distance between any two corresponding phylogenetic trees equals the number of internal edges in both trees minus the number of nodes with degree 2 in both trees, and iii) the values in (i) and (ii) are also the maximum values with respect to all possible assignments. The shown strict worst case bounds are needed as normalization factor to compute a normalized version of the respective tree partition metrics."
