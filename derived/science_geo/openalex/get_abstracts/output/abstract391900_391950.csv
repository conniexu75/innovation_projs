https://openalex.org/W2037878492,"Cigarette smokers have an increased risk of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. Some effects of smoking on specific respiratory tract bacteria have been described, but the consequences for global airway microbial community composition have not been determined. Here, we used culture-independent high-density sequencing to analyze the microbiota from the right and left nasopharynx and oropharynx of 29 smoking and 33 nonsmoking healthy asymptomatic adults to assess microbial composition and effects of cigarette smoking. Bacterial communities were profiled using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S sequence tags (803,391 total reads), aligned to 16S rRNA databases, and communities compared using the UniFrac distance metric. A Random Forest machine-learning algorithm was used to predict smoking status and identify taxa that best distinguished between smokers and nonsmokers. Community composition was primarily determined by airway site, with individuals exhibiting minimal side-of-body or temporal variation. Within airway habitats, microbiota from smokers were significantly more diverse than nonsmokers and clustered separately. The distributions of several genera were systematically altered by smoking in both the oro- and nasopharynx, and there was an enrichment of anaerobic lineages associated with periodontal disease in the oropharynx. These results indicate that distinct regions of the human upper respiratory tract contain characteristic microbial communities that exhibit disordered patterns in cigarette smokers, both in individual components and global structure, which may contribute to the prevalence of respiratory tract complications in this population."
https://openalex.org/W1964040105,"What are the dominant stocks which drive the correlations present among stocks traded in a stock market? Can a correlation analysis provide an answer to this question? In the past, correlation based networks have been proposed as a tool to uncover the underlying backbone of the market. Correlation based networks represent the stocks and their relationships, which are then investigated using different network theory methodologies. Here we introduce a new concept to tackle the above question--the partial correlation network. Partial correlation is a measure of how the correlation between two variables, e.g., stock returns, is affected by a third variable. By using it we define a proxy of stock influence, which is then used to construct partial correlation networks. The empirical part of this study is performed on a specific financial system, namely the set of 300 highly capitalized stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange, in the time period 2001-2003. By constructing the partial correlation network, unlike the case of standard correlation based networks, we find that stocks belonging to the financial sector and, in particular, to the investment services sub-sector, are the most influential stocks affecting the correlation profile of the system. Using a moving window analysis, we find that the strong influence of the financial stocks is conserved across time for the investigated trading period. Our findings shed a new light on the underlying mechanisms and driving forces controlling the correlation profile observed in a financial market."
https://openalex.org/W2088307620,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs), fundamental to learning and memory and implicated in certain neurological disorders, are heterotetrameric complexes composed of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits. The function of synaptic NMDARs in postnatal principal forebrain neurons is typically attributed to diheteromeric NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors, despite compelling evidence for triheteromeric NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors. In synapses, the properties of triheteromeric NMDARs could thus far not be distinguished from those of mixtures of diheteromeric NMDARs. To find a signature of NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors, we have employed two gene-targeted mouse lines, expressing either NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B receptors without NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors, and compared their synaptic properties with those of wild type. In acute hippocampal slices of mutants older than 4 weeks we found a distinct voltage dependence of NMDA R-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (NMDA EPSC) decay time for the two diheteromeric NMDARs. In wild-type mice, NMDA EPSCs unveiled the NR1/NR2A characteristic for this voltage-dependent deactivation exclusively, indicating that the contribution of NR1/NR2B receptors to evoked NMDA EPSCs is negligible in adult CA3-to-CA1 synapses. The presence of NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors was obvious from properties that could not be explained by a mixture of diheteromeric NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors or by the presence of NR1/NR2A receptors alone. The decay time for NMDA EPSCs in wild type was slower than that for NR1/NR2A receptors, and the sensitivity of NMDA EPSCs to NR2B-directed NMDAR antagonists was 50%. Thus, NR2B is prominent in adult hippocampal synapses as an integral part of NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2001002869,"Metamorphosis in insects is regulated by juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids. The mechanism of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), but not of JH action, is well understood. A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) family member, methoprene tolerant (Met), plays an important role in JH action. Microarray analysis and RNA interference (RNAi) were used to identify 69 genes that require Met for their hydroprene-regulated expression in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Quantitative real time PCR analysis confirmed microarray data for 13 of the 16 hydroprene-response genes tested. The members of the bHLH-PAS family often function as heterodimers to regulate gene expression and Met is a member of this family. To determine whether other members of the bHLH-PAS family are required for the expression of JH-response genes, we employed RNAi to knockdown the expression of all 11 members of the bHLH-PAS family and studied the expression of JH-response genes in RNAi insects. These studies showed that besides Met, another member of this family, steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) is required for the expression of 15 JH-response genes tested. Moreover, studies in JH responsive Aag-2 cells revealed that Aedes aegypti homologues of both Met and SRC are required for the expression of the JH-response gene, kr-h1, and SRC is required for expression of ecdysone-response genes. These data suggest the steroid receptor co-activator plays key roles in both JH and 20E action suggesting that this may be an important molecule that mediates cross-talk between JH and 20E to prevent metamorphosis.

The higher levels of JH during larval stages modulate ecdysteroid action to prevent metamorphosis, whereas lower levels or absence of JH at the end of larval or pupal stages allow ecdysteroids to promote metamorphosis (6Riddiford L.M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 271-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the onset of metamorphosis, remodeling of larval tissues, such as the midgut, is initiated by ecdysteroid action in the absence of JH. However, exogenous application of JH or its analogs cause suppression of ecdysteroid-induced gene expression and blocks remodeling of larval tissues (7Wu Y. Parthasarathy R. Bai H. Palli S.R. Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 530-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Parthasarathy R. Palli S.R. Mech. Dev. 2007; 124: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).

The mechanism of 20E but not of JH action is well understood. Methoprene tolerant (Met) was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster, mutant flies that are resistant to methoprene, a JH mimic (9Wilson T.G. Ashok M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14040-14044Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Met is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) transcription factor family. Met is localized exclusively to the nuclei and ligand binding assays showed that it can bind to JH III with high affinity (10Pursley S. Ashok M. Wilson T.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Miura K. Oda M. Makita S. Chinzei Y. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Ashok M. Turner C. Wilson T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of the met gene in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, which responds well to exogenous JH application, showed that Met is required for JH action in preventing larval-pupal metamorphosis, as well as precocious differentiation of adult structures (13Konopova B. Jindra M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10488-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Parthasarathy R. Tan A. Palli S.R. Mech. Dev. 2008; 125: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this insect, Met also plays an important role in JH regulation of vitellogenin synthesis in adult female beetles (15Parthasarathy R. Sun Z. Bai H. Palli S.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 40: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Members of the bHLH transcription factor superfamily regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, determination, and tissue differentiation during the development of animals and plants (16Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 17Weintraub H.

All members of this superfamily contain a bHLH domain of 60 amino acids consisting of two regions: a DNA-binding basic region of 15 amino acids in length, and a helix-loop-helix region, which allows the formation of homodimer or heterodimer complexes (19Murre C.

Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The bHLH transcription factors bind to a consensus hexameric DNA sequence called E-box (CANNTG), which is present in promoter regions of their target genes (22Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The members of the bHLH transcription factor superfamily are classified into various families (PAS, period (per), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and single-minded (Sim); HES, Hairy-Enhancer of split; USF/Myc/Upstream Transcription Factor; AS-C (Atonal, Mesp, Hand, p48, Shout, and Achaete-scute), and others) based on the presence of additional functional domains (23Moore A.W. Barbel S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10436-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We recently identified 11 members of the bHLH-PAS family in T. castaneum (24Bitra K. Tan A. Dowling A. Palli S.R. Gene. 2009; 448: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNAi analysis showed that knockdown in the expression of seven of 11 members of this family affected growth and development of T. castaneum. The inability to reach critical weight to undergo metamorphosis, failure to complete larval-pupal or pupal-adult ecdysis, and abnormal wing development are among the most common phenotypes observed in RNAi insects. Among bHLH transcription factors studied, the steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) and Met showed the most severe phenotypes (14Parthasarathy R. Tan A. Palli S.R. Mech. Dev. 2008; 125: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Bitra K. Tan A. Dowling A. Palli S.R. Gene. 2009; 448: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, a combination of microarray, qRT-PCR, and RNAi methods were employed to study the function of bHLH-PAS family transcription factors in JH action. The data presented here showed that two members of the bHLH-PAS family, Met and SRC, are required to regulate the expression of JH-response genes. Two-hybrid and pulldown assays showed that SRC heterodimerizes with Met suggesting that this nuclear receptor co-activator could play an important role in JH action. T. castaneum strain GA-1 beetles were reared on organic wheat flour containing 10% yeast at 30 °C, following the methods described previously (25Parthasarathy R. Tan A. Sun Z. Chen Z. Rankin M. Palli S.R. Mech. Dev. 2009; 126: 563-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The newly molted final instar larvae were identified by white heads and staged from that time onwards. Genomic DNA was extracted from T. castaneum adults and purified using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Fragments of genes coding for bHLH-PAS family members were PCR amplified using the primers reported previously (24Bitra K. Tan A. Dowling A. Palli S.R. Gene. 2009; 448: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and these DNA fragments were used to prepare dsRNA, as described previously (24Bitra K. Tan A. Dowling A. Palli S.R. Gene. 2009; 448: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Newly molted final instar larvae were anesthetized with ether vapor for 5 min and lined on a glass slide covered with double-sided tape. dsRNAs were injected into the ventral side of the first or second abdominal segment of the animals, using an injection needle made by the needle puller (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, Utah). About 0.8 to 1 μg (0.1 μl) dsRNA was injected into each animal. The dsRNA of Escherichia coli maltase gene (malE) was injected as a control. Injected larvae were removed from the slide after recovery and raised in whole wheat flour at 30 °C. Hydroprene (ethyl (2E,4E,7S)-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,4-dodecadienoate, a gift from Wellmark International, Dallas, TX), a JH analog, was dissolved in cyclohexane to 2 μg/μl. JH III (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or cyclohexane to 10 mm. Ponasterone A was purchased from Alexis Corporation (San Diego, CA) and dissolved in DMSO to make 10 mm solution. The final instar larvae, which were injected with dsRNA on the first day, were topically applied with 0.5 μl of 2 μg/μl of hydroprene solution, or 10 mm JH III solution, on the dorsum on the third day. The same volume of cyclohexane or DMSO was applied to the control larvae. The treated larvae were collected at 6 h after treatment and stored in a −80 °C freezer. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E, Sigma) was dissolved in distilled water to create a 100 mm solution, and 0.1 μl was injected into each insect. The same volume of distilled water was injected into the control insects. Total RNA was isolated from the whole body of the treated larvae using spin columns (RNeasy, Roche Applied Science). Probe preparation, hybridization to T. castaneum microarrays, washing, data acquisition, and analysis using the GeneSpring program were performed as described by Parthasarathy et al. (25Parthasarathy R. Tan A. Sun Z. Chen Z. Rankin M. Palli S.R. Mech. Dev. 2009; 126: 563-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, the total RNA was isolated from the whole body of the treated larvae using spin columns (RNeasy, Roche Applied Science). The integrity of RNA was verified by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Total RNA (>200 ng) from each of the three replicates was used to synthesize cDNA using the Agilent low RNA input fluorescent linear amplification kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The labeled cDNA were purified using RNase mini purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fluorescently labeled cDNAs (15 pmol) were hybridized to T. castaneum microarrays. The microarrays were prepared by printing 60-mer oligonucleotides designed based on 15,008 genes selected from the 16,000 genes predicted by T. castaneum genome annotations, and 736 control probe sets were put onto glass slides at Agilent Technologies. Data analysis was performed using GeneSpring program. Total RNA was isolated from four larvae for each sample using the TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR were performed as described previously (24Bitra K. Tan A. Dowling A. Palli S.R. Gene. 2009; 448: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using the primers reported in Bitra et al. (24Bitra K. Tan A. Dowling A. Palli S.R. Gene. 2009; 448: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and shown in Table 1. The mRNA levels were normalized using the internal control, the mRNA levels of RP49, a ribosomal protein.TABLE 1Primers used in qRT-PCR and RNAi experimentsGeneForward primerReverse primerMetGGGAAAGCAAAGGATCATCAAAGGCCTTCTTGCTCACTCAJheACTTTACGTGGGGTGTGAGCTTGATGAGGATCGGGATTTCKr-h1BTGTGACGTTTGCTCGAAGACGCACGAGTAGGGCTTTTCACrp49TGACCGTTATGGCAMCTCATAGCATGTGCTTCGTTTTGGGLEAN_05078TCCATAATGTGGCTTGAGGCTGGAATCAGTACGAACAGTACGTGGGCAGLEAN_03733TGCATTTGCTGCCAGTATTGTGGGTCCTGGGATTCCTTCGCACTTGTAGLEAN_05953TCAACGACGGTGTTTCACCTGAGTTTCATAGACATCGAAGCCGGCCATGLEAN_02187TCCATAATGTGGCTTGAGGCTGGAATCAGTACGAACAGTACGTGGGCAGLEAN_08456AAGCGCGCGAATTGAAGAGTTTCCTCTGCAACCAACACCCTTCAGGTAGLEAN_00688ACCTTCTTTGAAAGTTGCGGCGTCACTTCTGTCCGTTCAGCATCTCGTGLEAN_05951AGAAGACCACCGAGCAAGTCAACAAACTTGCCATTGAGCAGCACCTTCGLEAN_06764CAAAGGGCGCTTAAAGCACGACAAACTCATCAAGCTGGACGAAGTGGTGLEAN_02552CGCGAGCATAAAGATGGGTGGTTTTAGTGGTTTGGGCACCGCCTATAAGLEAN_08469TTTATTCAAGCGTCGGCCAGTTGCCACCATCAGCACACCCAACATCTAGLEAN_06026CGAGGATGTTCTGTGCTGGGTATTTTGCCGTATTCCTTTACGAACGCCGLEAN_05093AGAGATGACCGTGGAAACACCCAATAGGTTCCACCCACATGCCAAGTAGLEAN_02832TGAAGACCATCCCACCATCAGCATTTGGGCTTCCGTCAAGAGAGTCAAGLEAN_07620TTCAGAAGCACACTGATACGGCGATCCATTCTCCTGCCTCGTCACATTGLEAN_13280TGGTATTGCTCGAGTACCACAGGTTGTCAACGGCAGAACAGTCAGGATGLEAN_14022GGTTTCACCGCACTCCGAATTTGTAGGCGTTCGGAGAAATCGTCTTGAAakr-h1TTCTCGCAACAACAGCAACATCCGTCATCAGATCCATTGACGCTGGGTAaSRCCCAACAACGTTGGCAGTACGAACAATGTTTGCATTCCGTCTCCGTTGCAaHR3GTGTGCGGCGACAAGTCGTCTCGACCGAATTTGACCGCGTCAaE75ACTCAGTCGCAAACACCGGTCATGTAAACTCTTTTGGCGGCCGAAaBrZ1AGCATAGCTTGGCACCGAGCGCCAAGGCGTAGCAGGCGTGGAAGAAaS7RPACCGCCGTCTACGATGCCAATGGTGGTCTGCTGGTTCTTAaSRCdsRNAFTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGTCAAATGCAGCAGATCACCCAAAaSRCdsRNARTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGTTGGTTGTTCGAGGGAGAAGGT Open table in a new tab Mammalian two-hybrid vectors (Promega), pBIND containing GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and pACT containing the VP16 activation domain were used to prepare GAL4 and VP16 fusion proteins of receptors and transcription factors. To prepare VP16:SRC(bHLH-PAS) or GST:SRC(bHLH-PAS) constructs, the DNA fragment coding for amino acids 29–370 of TcSRC were PCR amplified and cloned into pACT (Promega Corp.) and pGEX5.1 vectors (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. GST:SRC(LXXLL) was prepared by cloning the DNA fragment coding for amino acids 534–720 into the pGEX5.1 vector. GAL4:EcRDEF and GAL4:Met were prepared by cloning DNA fragments coding for amino acids 189–484 containing DEF domains of the TcEcRB isoform and complete open reading frame of TcMet, respectively, into pBIND vector. To prepare VP16:Hypoxia or VP16:Clock constructs, the DNA fragment coding for amino acids 2–875 of TcHypoxia and 2–576 of TcClock were PCR amplified and cloned into pACT (Promega Corp.). 3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection experiments, 50,000 cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate. On the following day, the cells were transiently transfected with 166 ng each of receptor/transcription factor and 332 ng each of pFRLUC reporter construct, using a “Polyfect” transfection reagent (Qiagen). The plasmid Sport, containing the lacZ reporter gene, was co-transfected into cells and used for normalization. Aag-2 cells were cultured in Drosophila Schneider medium containing 10% FBS. These cells were transfected with Cellfectin (Invitrogen). Preliminary experiments showed that soaking these cells in dsRNA-containing medium for 72 h causes more than 90% knockdown in expression of the target gene. All RNAi experiments were performed by soaking cells in a dsRNA-containing medium for 72 h. For RNAi experiments, 40,000 Aag-2 cells were seeded into each well of 6-well plates and cultured at 28 °C overnight. The next day, the old medium was replaced with 1 ml of Drosophila Schneider medium-containing 6 μg of dsRNA, and the cells were cultured for 6 h. At the end of this period, 1 ml of Drosophila Schneider medium containing 20% FBS was added to each well, and the cells were cultured for 3 days. The transfected cells were exposed to DMSO (1 μl/ml) or 1 μm JH III in DMSO (1 μl/ml) for 6 h. Pulldown assays were performed following the procedure described in the technical manual for the magneGSTTM Pull-Down system. Western blots were used to detect the pulldown proteins using the anti-V5 antibody and Enhanced Chemiluminescene (ECL) method (Pierce). GST fusion proteins were prepared in bacteria by transforming BL21 cells with pGEX5.1TcSRC(bHLH-PAS) or pGEX5.1TcSRC(LXXLL) constructs. Full-length TcMet and TcGATA proteins containing V5 and His tags on either end were expressed using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) and purified using the nickel affinity column. Newly molted final instar T. castaneum larvae were injected with Met or malE (a gene coding for Maltase in bacteria used as a control) dsRNA. On the third day after injection, the two groups of dsRNA-injected larvae were applied with hydroprene (a JH analog that works better than methoprene in T. castaneum) or cyclohexane (solvent control). Six hours after hydroprene application, total RNA was isolated from the whole body samples. The RNA was labeled and hybridized to T. castaneum custom microarrays. The signal for 11,757 of 15,008 probe sets was detected with at least one of the 12 RNA samples tested (three replicates for each of Met-Hyp, malE-Hyp, Met-CHX, and malE-CHX treatments). The spot intensity data for these probe sets were statistically analyzed using GeneSpring software (Agilent Technologies). The fold-difference in the expression (designated as “FD,” calculated by dividing the mean value of signal intensities of the hydroprene-treated samples with the signal intensities of the cyclohexane-treated samples) and the significance of difference (p value from t test) for 11,757 probe sets are shown as volcano plots (see Fig. 1, A and B). In the larvae injected with malE dsRNA, hydroprene induced the expression of 100 genes by 2-fold or more, with a p value of less than 0.01 (Fig. 1C, Table 2). Knockdown in the expression of met decreased hydroprene induction of 86 of 100 genes to less than 2-fold. Moreover, 37 of these 86 genes showed more than 50% reduction in their hydroprene-induced expression in Met RNAi larvae, compared with their expression in the control larvae (Fig. 1C, Table 2). The expression of these 37 genes derived from microarray data is shown in Fig. 1E. Hydroprene application also suppressed the expression of 45 genes by 2-fold or more, with a p value of less than 0.01. Knockdown in the expression of the met gene decreased the hydroprene suppression of 39 of 45 genes to less than 2-fold. Furthermore, 32 of these 45 genes showed more than 50% reduction in hydroprene-suppressed activity in Met RNAi larvae (Fig. 1D, Table 2). The expression of these 32 genes derived from microarray data is shown in Fig. 1F. In the functional annotation analyses, the 37 hydroprene-induced and 32 hydroprene-suppressed genes that require Met for their hydroprene regulation were preferentially associated with certain gene ontology terms identified using the Blast2Go program, revealing that the majority of these 69 genes participate in cellular or metabolic processes with binding or catalytic activity (Table 3).TABLE 2Number of genes that showed more than 2-fold change in gene expressionp < 0.0001p < 0.001p < 0.01p > 0.01Hydroprene induced genesHyp/CHX ≥ 2.0 (malE RNAi)736100231Hyp/CHX ≥ 2.0 (Met RNAi)2659aIncludes genes that are induced or suppressed in Met RNAi insects only.437aIncludes genes that are induced or suppressed in Met RNAi insects only.Hydroprene suppressed genesCHX/Hyp ≥ 2.0 (malE RNAi)0145380CHX/Hyp ≥ 2.0 (Met RNAi)1644aIncludes genes that are induced or suppressed in Met RNAi insects only.554aIncludes genes that are induced or suppressed in Met RNAi insects only.a Includes genes that are induced or suppressed in Met RNAi insects only.

Open table in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from dsRNA-injected larvae treated with hydroprene or cyclohexane under identical conditions to those used for collecting RNA for the microarray analysis. Specific primers were designed based on the coding sequences of 16 randomly selected Met-regulated hydroprene response genes identified by the microarray experiments. The primers and RNA samples were used to quantify the mRNA levels of selected genes by qRT-PCR. Three control genes met (to measure knockdown efficiency), jhe (a known JH-response gene), and kr-h1 (Glean_12990, a known JH-response gene) were also included in the analysis. Met mRNA levels were reduced by more than 90% in the larvae injected with Met dsRNA, when compared with the levels in the larvae injected with malE dsRNA; this suggests that expression of the met gene was knocked down efficiently in Met dsRNA-injected larvae (Fig. 2A). In the malE dsRNA-injected larvae, the mRNA levels of both JHE and Kr-h1 increased by 2.5- and 6.5-fold, respectively, in the larvae treated with hydroprene, when compared with the levels in the larvae treated with cyclohexane (Fig. 2A). However, hydroprene did not induce such an increase in the mRNA levels of both these genes in Met dsRNA-injected larvae (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the presence of Met is required for hydroprene induction of these two known JH-response genes. The mRNA levels of 9 of 11 genes tested were induced by hydroprene in the malE dsRNA-injected larvae, but not in the Met dsRNA-injected larvae (Fig. 2A). The other two genes (GLEAN_05078 and GLEAN_02187) tested showed different expression patterns in the qRT-PCR analysis, when compared with their expression patterns observed in the microarray analysis. Therefore, these two genes were not included in the further studies described below. Similarly, four of five genes chosen as Met-regulated, hydroprene-suppressed genes identified in the microarray analysis were confirmed by qRT-PCR data. These data showed that the mRNA levels of these four genes were suppressed by hydroprene in the larvae injected with malE dsRNA, but not in the larvae injected with Met dsRNA (Fig. 2A). The mRNA levels of GLEAN_05093 tested by qRT-PCR increased in both control malE dsRNA-injected and Met dsRNA-injected larvae treated with hydroprene. Therefore, the microarray data for this gene were not confirmed by qRT-PCR, and this gene was not included in the further studies described below. In summary, 13 (9 induced and 4 suppressed) of 16 (11 induced and 5 suppressed) hydroprene-response genes tested by qRT-PCR confirmed the data from the microarray experiments. As hydroprene is a JH analog, we wondered whether natural JHs, such as JH III, have similar effects on the expression of these 13 confirmed genes. Thus, JH III was applied to the dsRNA-injected larvae, and the mRNA levels were quantified using the total RNA isolated from the JH III or cyclohexane-treated insects. The changes in the expression of genes observed in the JH III-treated larvae are similar to those observed in the hydroprene-treated larvae (Fig. 2A). The application of JH III increased the mRNA levels of nine hydroprene-induced genes and decreased the mRNA levels of four hydroprene-suppressed genes in the malE dsRNA-injected larvae, but not in the Met dsRNA-injected larvae (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, JH III induced expression of the jhe gene by 5.1-fold, which is much higher than the 2.6-fold induction of this gene observed after treatment with hydroprene. These data showed that the nine genes identified in the microarray experiments and confirmed by qRT-PCR as those induced by hydroprene are also induced by JH III; therefore, they could be up-regulated by JH in vivo. Similarly, the four genes identified in the microarray analysis and confirmed by qRT-PCR as those suppressed by hydroprene are also suppressed by JH III, and thus, they could be down-regulated by JH in vivo. The members of the bHLH-PAS family often function as heterodimers to regulate gene expression and Met is a member of this family. To determine whether any other members of the bHLH-PAS family are required for the expression of JH-response genes, we injected dsRNAs of all 11 members of this family individually into newly m"
https://openalex.org/W2080119374,"The ability of interferons (IFNs) to inhibit viral replication and cellular proliferation is well established, but the specific contribution of each IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) to these biological responses remains to be completely understood. In this report we demonstrate that ISG54, also known as IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), is a mediator of apoptosis. Expression of ISG54, independent of IFN stimulation, elicits apoptotic cell death. Cell death and apoptosis were quantified by propidium iodide uptake and annexin-V staining, respectively. The activation of caspase-3, a key mediator of the execution phase of apoptosis, was clearly apparent in cells expressing ISG54. The anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma-xl (Bcl-xl) protein inhibited the apoptotic effects of ISG54 as did the anti-apoptotic adenoviral E1B-19K protein. In addition, ISG54 was not able to promote cell death in the absence of pro-apoptotic Bcl family members, Bax and Bak. Analyses of binding partners of ISG54 revealed association with two homologous proteins, ISG56/IFIT1 and ISG60/IFIT3. In addition, ISG60 binding negatively regulates the apoptotic effects of ISG54. The results reveal a previously unidentified role of ISG54 in the induction of apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway and shed new light on the mechanism by which IFN elicits anti-viral and anti-cancer effects."
https://openalex.org/W2168982589,"The Hippo pathway regulates organ size by controlling both cell proliferation and apoptosis. TAZ functions as a transcriptional co-activator downstream of the Hippo pathway and has been implicated in human cancer development. A key step in the Hippo-TAZ pathway is phosphorylation of TAZ by LATS kinase, which leads to TAZ inhibition by both cytoplasmic retention and degradation. However, the mechanism of TAZ dephosphorylation and the responsible phosphatase are unknown. Here, we identified PP1 as a bona fide TAZ phosphatase. PP1A dephosphorylates TAZ at Ser-89 and Ser-311, promotes TAZ nuclear translocation, and stabilizes TAZ by disrupting the binding to the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, ASPP2 facilitates the interaction between TAZ and PP1 to promote TAZ dephosphorylation. As a result, PP1 and ASPP2 increase TAZ-dependent gene expression. This study demonstrates that PP1A and ASPP2 play a critical role in promoting TAZ function by antagonizing the LATS kinase through TAZ dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2021528515,"Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary often express aromatase and synthesize estrogen, which in turn may influence their progression. Recently a specific point mutation (C134W) in the FOXL2 protein was identified in >94% of adult-type GCT and it is likely to contribute to their development. A number of genes are known to be regulated by FOXL2, including aromatase/CYP19A1, but it is unclear which are direct targets and whether the C134W mutation alters their regulation. Recently, it has been reported that FOXL2 forms a complex with steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) which is a known regulator of aromatase in granulosa cells.In this work, the human GCT-derived cell lines KGN and COV434 were heterozygous and wildtype for the FOXL2:C134W mutation, respectively. KGN had abundant FOXL2 mRNA expression but it was not expressed in COV434. Expression of exogenous FOXL2:C134W in COV434 cells induced higher expression of a luciferase reporter for the ovarian specific aromatase promoter, promoter II (PII) (-516bp) than expression of wildtype FOXL2, but did not alter induction of a similar reporter for the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) promoter (-1300bp). Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that FOXL2 bound SF-1 and that it also bound its homologue, liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1), however, the C134W mutation did not alter these interactions or induce a selective binding of the proteins. A highly conserved putative binding site for FOXL2 was identified in PII. FOXL2 was demonstrated to bind the site by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and site-directed mutagenesis of this element blocked its differential induction by wildtype FOXL2 and FOXL2:C134W.These findings suggest that aromatase is a direct target of FOXL2:C134W in adult-type GCT via a single distinctive and highly conserved binding site in PII and therefore provide insight into the pathogenic mechanism of this mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2061149151,"Malfunctioning of system xc–, responsible for exchanging intracellular glutamate for extracellular cystine, can cause oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, both important phenomena in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We used mice lacking xCT (xCT_/_ mice), the specific subunit of system xc˜, to investigate the involvement of this antiporter in PD. Although cystine that is imported via system xc˜ is reduced to cysteine, the rate-limiting substrate in the synthesis of glutathione, deletion of xCT did not result in decreased glutathione levels in striatum. Accordingly, no signs of increased oxidative stress could be observed in striatum or substantia nigra of xCT_/_ mice. In sharp contrast to expectations, xCT_/_ mice were less susceptible to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta compared to their age-matched wild-type littermates. This reduced sensitivity to a PD-inducing toxin might be related to the decrease of 70% in striatal extracellular glutamate levels that was observed in mice lacking xCT. The current data point toward system xc˜ as a possible target for the development of new pharmacotherapies for the treatment of PD and emphasize the need to continue the search for specific ligands for system xc˜.—Massie, A., Schallier, A., Kim, S.

https://openalex.org/W2120316083,"Lenalidomide plays an important role in our chemotherapeutic armamentarium against multiple myeloma, in part by exerting direct anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. Unfortunately, long-term exposure leads to the development of drug resistance through unknown mechanisms, and we therefore sought to identify pathways that could be responsible for this phenotype. Chronic drug exposure produced myeloma cell lines that were tolerant of the direct effects of lenalidomide, with a degree of resistance of up to 2,500-fold. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis identified dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a consistent change across four independent cell isolates, and a pair of primary plasma cell samples. Acute drug treatment also increased β-catenin transcription by 3-fold or more, and both acute and chronic exposure resulted in enhanced accumulation of β-catenin protein by up to 20-fold or more. This produced Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, as judged by increased activity of a lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor promoter reporter, and enhanced accumulation of the downstream targets cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Components of the β-catenin destruction complex were also impacted by lenalidomide, which suppressed casein kinase 1α expression while augmenting glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β phosphorylation. Stimulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling with recombinant Wnt-3a, or by overexpression of β-catenin, reduced the anti-proliferative activity of lenalidomide. Conversely, suppression of β-catenin with small hairpin RNAs restored plasma cell sensitivity to lenalidomide. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that lenalidomide mediates activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in plasma cells as a mechanism of inducible chemoresistance through effects at the transcriptional and post-translational levels."
https://openalex.org/W1979156811,"Defensins are a group of cationic peptides that exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, we cloned and characterized a β-defensin from pituitary cDNA library of a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Interestingly, the β-defensin was shown to be dominantly expressed in pituitary and testis by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, and its transcript level is significantly upregulated in reproduction organs from intersexual gonad to testis during the natural and artificial sex reversal. Promoter sequence and the responsible activity region analyses revealed the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site and testis-specific SRY responsible site, and demonstrated that the pituitary-specific POU1F1a transcription binding site that locates between −180 and −208 bp is the major responsible region of grouper β-defensin promoter activity. Immunofluorescence localization observed its pituicyte expression in pituitary and spermatogonic cell expression in testis. Moreover, both in vitro antibacterial activity assay of the recombinant β-defensin and in vivo embryo microinjection of the β-defensin mRNA were shown to be effective in killing Gram-negative bacteria. And, its antiviral role was also demonstrated in EPC cells transfected with the β-defensin construct. Additionally, the antibacterial activity was sensitive to concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The above intriguing findings strongly suggest that the fish β-defensin might play significant roles in both innate immunity defense and reproduction endocrine regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2070886429,"Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of maternal and neonatal mortality worldwide. Young maternal age at delivery has been proposed as risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome, yet there is insufficient data from Sub-Saharan Africa. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of maternal adolescence on pregnancy outcomes in the Central African country Gabon.Data on maternal age, parity, birth weight, gestational age, maternal Plasmodium falciparum infection, use of bednets, and intake of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy were collected in a cross-sectional survey in 775 women giving birth in three mother-child health centers in Gabon. Adolescent women (≤16 years of age) had a significantly increased risk to deliver a baby with low birth weight in univariable analysis (22.8%, 13/57, vs. 9.3%, 67/718, OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.5-5.6) and young maternal age showed a statistically significant association with the risk for low birth weight in multivariable regression analysis after correction for established risk factors (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1-6.5). In further analysis adolescent women were shown to attend significantly less antenatal care visits than adult mothers (3.3±1.9 versus 4.4±1.9 mean visits, p<0.01, n = 356) and this difference accounted at least for part of the excess risk for low birth weight in adolescents.Our data demonstrate the importance of adolescent age as risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome. Antenatal care programs specifically tailored for the needs of adolescents may be necessary to improve the frequency of antenatal care visits and pregnancy outcomes in this risk group in Central Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2131592319,"Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is still complicated by the occurrence of fever and inflammatory complications attributed to neutropenia and subsequent infectious complications. The role of mucosal barrier injury (MBI) of the intestinal tract therein has received little attention.We performed a retrospective analysis in 163 SCT recipients of which data had been collected prospectively on intestinal damage (citrulline), inflammation (C-reactive protein), and neutrophil count. Six different conditioning regimens were studied; 5 myeloablative (MA) and 1 non-myeloablative (NMA). Linear mixed model multivariate and AUC analyses were used to define the role of intestinal damage in post-SCT inflammation. We also studied the relationship between the degree of intestinal damage and the occurrence of early post-SCT complications.In the 5 MA regimen there was a striking pattern of inflammatory response that coincided with the occurrence of severe intestinal damage. This contrasted with a modest inflammatory response seen in the NMA regimen in which intestinal damage was limited. With linear mixed model analysis the degree of intestinal damage was shown the most important determinant of the inflammatory response, and both neutropenia and bacteremia had only a minor impact. AUC analysis revealed a strong correlation between citrulline and CRP (Pearson correlation r = 0.96). Intestinal damage was associated with the occurrence of bacteremia and acute lung injury, and influenced the kinetics of acute graft-versus-host disease.The degree of intestinal damage after myeloablative conditioning appeared to be the most important determined the inflammatory response following SCT, and was associated with inflammatory complications. Studies should explore ways to ameliorate cytotoxic therapy-induced intestinal damage in order to reduce complications associated with myeloablative conditioning therapy."

We have previously identified the contribution of elevated BACE1 activity to voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 density and neuronal function. Here, we analyzed physiological changes in sodium channel metabolism in BACE1-null mice. Mechanistically, we first confirmed that endogenous BACE1 requires its substrate, the β-subunit Navβ2, to regulate levels of the pore-forming α-subunit Nav1.1 in cultured primary neurons. Next, we analyzed sodium channel α-subunit levels in brains of BACE1-null mice at 1 and 3 months of age. At both ages, we found that Nav1.1 protein levels were significantly decreased in BACE1-null versus wild-type mouse brains, remaining unchanged in BACE1-heterozygous mouse brains. Interestingly, levels of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 α-subunits also decreased in 1-month-old BACE1-null mice. In the hippocampus of BACE1-null mice, we found a robust 57% decrease of Nav1.1 levels. Next, we performed surface biotinylation studies in acutely dissociated hippocampal slices from BACE1-null mice. Hippocampal surface Nav1.1 levels were significantly decreased, but Nav1.2 surface levels were increased in BACE1-null mice perhaps as a compensatory mechanism for reduced surface Nav1.1. We also found that Navβ2 processing and Nav1.1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in brains of BACE1-null mice. This suggests a mechanism consistent with BACE1 activity regulating mRNA levels of the α-subunit Nav1.1 via cleavage of cell-surface Navβ2. Together, our data show that endogenous BACE1 activity regulates total and surface levels of voltage-gated sodium channels in mouse brains. Both decreased Nav1.1 and elevated surface Nav1.2 may result in a seizure phenotype.

In the late stages of the disease, neuropsychiatric symptoms include depression, aggressiveness, agitation, and generalized anxiety (1Zayas E. Grossberg G. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1996; 57: 46-54PubMed Google Scholar). Pathological hallmarks of AD patient brains consist of extracellular amyloid deposits (senile plaques), neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (2de Leon M.J.

The main component of amyloid deposits is a short amyloid β (Aβ) peptide most commonly of 40–42 amino acids, which derives from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). To generate Aβ, APP is first cleaved by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and subsequently by γ-secretase. Because of their central role in Aβ generation, it is not surprising that the two secretases are among the prime drug targets for AD treatment (4Vassar R. J. Mol.

To understand the physiological function of BACE1, it is essential to characterize BACE1-mediated cleavage of its neuronal substrates.Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1s) consist of one pore-forming α-subunit, associated with one or two β-accessory subunits (20Isom L.L.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The β-subunits are type I single-transmembrane proteins that regulate the localization, trafficking, and inactivation of the α-subunits by direct interaction (20Isom L.L.

Indeed, the auxiliary β2-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels undergoes sequential processing by BACE1 and γ-secretase similar to APP (18Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Carey B.W. Pettingell W.H.

We found that BACE1-mediated cleavage of Navβ2 alters neuronal activity (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A. Binshtok A.M. Wertz M.H. Pettingell W.H. He P. Lee V.M. Woolf C.J. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevated levels of the pore-forming α-subunit Nav1.1 are observed in AD brains with elevated BACE1 expression and also in mice overexpressing human BACE1 (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A. Binshtok A.M. Wertz M.H. Pettingell W.H. He P. Lee V.M. Woolf C.J. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The β2-intracellular domain (β2-ICD), derived from BACE1 and γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of β2, regulates Nav1.1 expression. However, Nav1.1 trafficking to the cell membrane is impaired resulting in reduced Nav1.1 surface levels, which leads to reduced sodium current densities (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A. Binshtok A.M. Wertz M.H. Pettingell W.H. He P. Lee V.M. Woolf C.J. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Here, we asked whether endogenous BACE1 activity regulates Nav1 metabolism in neuronal cells under physiological conditions. First, we found that Navβ2 is essential for BACE1 activity-dependent regulation of Nav1.1 mRNA and protein levels in cultured embryonic neurons. Next, we also found that endogenous BACE1 activity regulates total and surface levels of Nav1.1 especially in adult hippocampus. Interestingly, Nav1.2 appears to compensate for decreased surface levels of Nav1.1.DISCUSSIONHere, we show that expression levels of three major brain Nav1 channels are strongly affected by BACE1 deletion during early postnatal brain development. Levels of the Nav1.1 α-subunit showed the most dramatic decrease. These changes are predicted to have significant effects on the development of excitability. Ablation of BACE1 results in ∼40–50% decrease of Nav1.1 protein and mRNA levels in whole brains of 1-month-old mice and up to 56% in the hippocampus of 3-month-old mice (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 and supplemental Figs. 2–4). We also found that the decrease in Nav1.1 in BACE1-null mice was less pronounced at 3 months versus 1 month of age, suggesting the possibility that the lack of BACE1 activity affects Nav1 α-subunit levels more prominently at early ages. Nav1.2 α-subunit levels were also decreased in whole brain samples from 1- and 3-month-old mice but not in the hippocampus. In addition, we found that Nav1.6 α-subunit levels were also decreased in brains of 1-month-old but not in 3-month-old mice. These data demonstrate that BACE1 regulates adult brain Nav1 α-subunit levels in physiological conditions, possibly in an age-dependent and/or region-specific manner.Previously, we reported that BACE1/γ-secretase activities promote the release of the β2-ICD, which localizes to the nucleus and increases mRNA and protein levels of the pore-forming Nav1.1 α-subunit in neuroblastoma cells (18Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Carey B.W. Pettingell W.H. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23251-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A.

Elevated BACE1 activity also increases Navβ2 cleavages and Nav1.1 levels in brains of BACE1-transgenic mice and AD patients (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A. Binshtok A.M. Wertz M.H. Pettingell W.H. He P. Lee V.M. Woolf C.J. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although BACE1 cleaves all four β-subunits in vitro, only Navβ2 and Navβ4 were reported as physiological substrates in mouse brains (19Wong H.K. Sakurai T. Oyama F. Kaneko K. Wada K. Miyazaki H. Kurosawa M. De Strooper B. Saftig P. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23009-23017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings, we found a significant decrease of Navβ2 C-terminal fragment levels in the hippocampus of BACE1-null mice (Fig. 6B). Therefore, endogenous BACE1 activity is essential for Navβ2 cleavage in the hippocampus in vivo. Fig. 1 also suggests a crucial role of Navβ2 in BACE1-dependent regulation of Nav1.1 levels at least in the embryonic neuronal cells. Although BACE1 inhibitors largely decreased Scn1a (Nav1.1) mRNA and protein levels in cultured cortical/hippocampal neurons, the same inhibitors did not change Nav1.1 levels in Navβ2-null neurons (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1, A, B, and D). Together, these data support the notion that Navβ2 and its processing are essential for regulating Nav1.1 levels under physiological conditions. Interestingly, we were not able to detect significant changes of Scn2a (Nav1.2) or Scn8a (Nav1.6) mRNA levels, although Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 protein levels are significantly decreased in the brains from 1-month-old BACE1-null mice. This suggests an alternative molecular pathway mediating the Nav1.2 or Nav1.6 decrease in BACE1-null mice (Fig. 6C and supplemental Fig. 4). Altered processing of other neuronal BACE1 substrates may contribute to these Nav1 α-subunit changes. Further studies will be required to fully characterize the underlying molecular mechanism of Nav1 α-subunit changes.As shown in Fig. 5, ablation of BACE1 results in ∼40% decrease of surface Nav1.1 levels in hippocampal neurons, which is comparable with the decreased levels of total Nav1.1 in the same region. Therefore, surface expression of Nav1.1 is regulated by the decrease of total Nav1.1 levels in BACE1-null mice in physiological conditions. On the contrary, we found that Nav1.2 surface levels are significantly increased (Fig. 5, A and D). This suggests a compensatory mechanism between Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 surface levels. However, disconnected total versus cell surface distributions of Nav1.2 in BACE1-null mice are reminiscent of Nav1.1 distribution in BACE1-overexpressing systems. In neuroblastoma cells and adult hippocampal neurons from BACE1-transgenic mice, overexpressed BACE1 paradoxically reduced cell surface expression of Nav1 α-subunits, although total Nav1.1 α-subunits levels increased (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A. Binshtok A.M. Wertz M.H. Pettingell W.H. He P. Lee V.M. Woolf C.J. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The increased Nav1.1 was retained inside the cells and accumulated in HSP70-positive punctate structures, suggesting that Nav1.1 trafficking to cell surface was inhibited by BACE1 overexpression (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A. Binshtok A.M. Wertz M.H. Pettingell W.H. He P. Lee V.M. Woolf C.J. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that expression of Nav1 α-subunits on the cell surface is under tight regulation, and changes in intracellular α-subunit levels may not always reflect surface expression of each channel. Decreased BACE-mediated cleavage of surface Navβ2 may differentially affect Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 surface trafficking. Further studies will be required to clarify how BACE1-mediated cleavage of Navβ2 can differentially regulate the trafficking of each α-subunit.Neuronal Nav1 channels are known to be up-regulated or redistributed upon nerve injury or demyelination (38Westenbroek R.E.

In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, levels and distribution of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 are altered in demyelinated axons within acute multiple sclerosis plaques (39Craner M.J.

BACE1-null mice also show mild but significant hypomyelination in the CNS and peripheral nervous system, and these might contribute to the elevated Nav1.2 surface levels shown in BACE1-null mice (15Willem M.

FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study showed that Navβ2 also mediates demyelination-induced Nav1 α-subunit regulation in the same multiple sclerosis model (43O'Malley H.A. Shreiner A.B. Chen G.H. Huffnagle G.B. Isom L.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 40: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Together with our data, this study suggests the interesting possibility that in BACE1-null mice Navβ2 not only is an essential Nav1 β-subunit in regulating changes in Nav1 α-subunit levels via generation of its ICD but also indirectly via reduced myelination, which is a well characterized phenotype of BACE-null mice. Further studies are required to clarify whether Navβ2 also plays a role in regulating Nav1 α-subunit levels under mild hypomyelination in addition to demyelinating conditions.Deletion of the Nav1.1 gene does not significantly affect sodium current density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons because of high expression of Nav1.2 and other α-subunits (35Westenbroek R.E. Merrick D.K. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 36Yu F.H. Mantegazza M. Westenbroek R.E. Robbins C.A. Kalume F. Burton K.A. Spain W.J.

Physiol. 2010; 588: 1849-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, Nav1.1 plays a major role in regulating sodium currents in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. Indeed, 50% decrease of Nav1.1 dramatically reduced sodium current in GABAergic interneurons (36Yu F.H. Mantegazza M. Westenbroek R.E. Robbins C.A. Kalume F. Burton K.A. Spain W.J. McKnight G.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Similarly, 40–50% decrease of total and surface Nav1.1 levels in BACE1-null mice may decrease sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. This would result in electrical imbalances and the vulnerability to epileptic seizures as previously shown in Nav1.1-null mice (36Yu F.H. Mantegazza M. Westenbroek R.E. Robbins C.A. Kalume F. Burton K.A. Spain W.J. McKnight G.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Increase of Nav1.2 surface expression may also contribute to the electrical imbalances by selectively increasing sodium currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.While we were revising this manuscript, two independent groups reported that BACE1-null mice showed increased seizure susceptibility and spontaneous behavioral seizure phenotypes (45Hu X. Zhou X. He W. Yang J. Xiong W. Wong P. Wilson C.G. Yan R. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8819-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 46Hitt B.D. Jaramillo T.C. Chetkovich D.M. Vassar R. Mol. Neurodegener. 2010; 5: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These results clearly support our prediction, based on altered Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 surface expression in BACE1-null mice (Fig. 5). Hu et al. (45Hu X. Zhou X. He W. Yang J. Xiong W. Wong P. Wilson C.G. Yan R. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8819-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showed that surface levels of Nav1.2 are increased in cultured hippocampal neurons from BACE1-null mice, which is also consistent with our results on increased Nav1.2 surface levels in adult hippocampus from BACE1-null mice (Fig. 5). In addition to Nav1.2 changes, we also found reduced surface levels of Nav1.1, which allow us to propose a novel Nav1.1-based mechanism for the increased seizure susceptibility of BACE1-null mice (Fig. 6D). Indeed, mutations of the Nav1.1 α-subunit are frequently associated with inherited familial epileptic seizures in humans (44Catterall W.A. Kalume F. Oakley J.C. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1849-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).Early electrical deficits may also explain the enhanced lethality of BACE1/2-null mice at very early ages and their body weight loss (28Dominguez D. Tournoy J. Hartmann D. Huth T. Cryns K. Deforce S. Serneels L. Camacho I.E. Marjaux E. Craessaerts K. Roebroek A.J. Schwake M. D'Hooge R. Bach P. Kalinke U. Moechars D. Alzheimer C. Reiss K.

Neurodegener. 2010; 5: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nav1.1-null and -heterozygous mice show severe and fatal seizure phenotypes (36Yu F.H. Mantegazza M. Westenbroek R.E. Robbins C.A. Kalume F. Burton K.A. Spain W.J. McKnight G.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 44Catterall W.A. Kalume F. Oakley J.C. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1849-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A selective loss of Nav1.1-mediated sodium currents in inhibitory neurons is proposed as a molecular mechanism underlying these severe phenotypes. Interestingly, all the major Nav1 α-subunit levels are decreased in BACE1-null mice (Fig. 2) and may not be selective to one neuronal population. Therefore, neuronal excitability in BACE1-null mice may be generally reduced all over the brain rather than in specific circuits, which may not lead to a severe and fatal electrical imbalance in neural circuits. This may explain why BACE1-null mice do not show a fatal seizure phenotype as predicted by the drastic Nav1 α-subunit decreases at the early age (Fig. 2).Nav1 α-subunits are large hydrophobic membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains (24Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). It is technically challenging to analyze total Nav1 α-subunits because they are highly insoluble in mild detergent extraction conditions. To overcome this technical problem, we used several extraction conditions and compared the results (Fig. 2). We found that 1.5–2% of SDS extraction conditions showed the most consistent results, tightly comparable with a method based on direct boiling of membrane fractions in the presence of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The direct boiling method has been commonly used for sodium channel analysis by other groups (27Lopez-Santiago L.F. Pertin M. Morisod X. Chen C. Hong S. Wiley J. Decosterd I. Isom L.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7984-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Yu F.H. Mantegazza M. Westenbroek R.E. Robbins C.A. Kalume F. Burton K.A. Spain W.J. McKnight G.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). In these conditions, we found that Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 levels are consistently decreased especially in young adult BACE1-null mice as compared with BACE-HE and wild-type controls (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with the results from Hu et al. and Hitt et al. (45Hu X. Zhou X. He W. Yang J. Xiong W. Wong P. Wilson C.G. Yan R. J.

Wong P. Wilson C.G. Yan R. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8819-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The discrepancy regarding Nav1.2 may derive from differential extraction conditions (2% SDS versus 1% Triton X-100) or different ages of the mice. Indeed, we found that the decrease in Nav1.2 is much less pronounced (∼20%) in 3-month-old mice as compared with 1-month-old mice (∼40–50%) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Consistent with the data from Hitt et al. (46Hitt B.D. Jaramillo T.C. Chetkovich D.M. Vassar R. Mol. Neurodegener. 2010; 5: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we found that Nav1.2 levels were not significantly changed in the hippocampal region of 3-month-old mice, although Nav1.1 shows a dramatic decrease in the same samples (Fig. 4). However, Hitt et al. (46Hitt B.D. Jaramillo T.C. Chetkovich D.M. Vassar R. Mol. Neurodegener. 2010; 5: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) did not analyze levels of Nav1.2 at the cell surface. Because the vast majority of sodium channels is retained inside the cells, total Nav1.2 levels may not reflect changes at the cell surface. We found that Nav1.1 levels decrease at the cell surface, although Nav1.2 levels increase in agreement with Hu et al. (45Hu X. Zhou X. He W. Yang J. Xiong W. Wong P. Wilson C.G. Yan R. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8819-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data argue that the lack of BACE1 activity dynamically modulates changes in Nav1 α-subunit levels depending on age/brain region and that changes in cell surface Nav1 α-subunit levels are likely to cause epileptic seizures in BACE1-null mice. Further studies will be required to fully address BACE1 effects on Nav1 α-subunit levels in vivo.BACE1 is one of the prime drug targets for therapeutic treatment of AD patents. Genetic ablation of BACE1 showed decreased Aβ levels and ameliorated cognitive function in animal models (47Ohno M. Sametsky E.A. Younkin L.H. Oakley H. Younkin S.G. Citron M. Vassar R. Disterhoft J.F. Neuron. 2004; 41: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Our findings that the ablation of BACE1 leads to decreased sodium channel levels suggest that complete block of BACE1 is likely to cause side effects through altered sodium current densities. However, our studies on Nav1 levels in BACE1-heterozygous mice show that 50% decrease of BACE1 activity does not significantly decrease Nav1.1 levels (Fig. 1), although partial reduction of BACE1 results in dramatic reduction in Aβ plaques, neuritic burden, and synaptic deficits in older mice (48McConlogue L. Buttini M. Anderson J.P. Brigham E.F. Chen K.S. Freedman S.B. Games D. Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Zeller M. Liu W. Motter R. Sinha S. J. Biol.

Therefore, it will be important to find a therapeutic window for inhibiting BACE1 activity to block Aβ burden, without significantly affecting Nav1 metabolism.

In the late stages of the disease, neuropsychiatric symptoms include depression, aggressiveness, agitation, and generalized anxiety (1Zayas E. Grossberg G. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1996; 57: 46-54PubMed Google Scholar). Pathological hallmarks of AD patient brains consist of extracellular amyloid deposits (senile plaques), neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (2de Leon M.J. Convit A. DeSanti S. Golomb J. Tarshish C. Rusinek H. Bobinski M. Ince C. Miller D.C. Wisniewski H.M. Neuroimaging Clin. N. Am. 1995; 5: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10791) Google Scholar). The main component of amyloid deposits is a short amyloid β (Aβ) peptide most commonly of 40–42 amino acids, which derives from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). To generate Aβ, APP is first cleaved by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and subsequently by γ-secretase. Because of their central role in Aβ generation, it is not surprising that the two secretases are among the prime drug targets for AD treatment (4Vassar R. J. Mol.

To understand the physiological function of BACE1, it is essential to characterize BACE1-mediated cleavage of its neuronal substrates.Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1s) consist of one pore-forming α-subunit, associated with one or two β-accessory subunits (20Isom L.L. Neuroscientist. 2001; 7: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Currently, 10 α- and 4 β-subunits have been reported (21Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The β-subunits are type I single-transmembrane proteins that regulate the localization, trafficking, and inactivation of the α-subunits by direct interaction (20Isom L.L.

Indeed, the auxiliary β2-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels undergoes sequential processing by BACE1 and γ-secretase similar to APP (18Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Carey B.W. Pettingell W.H.

Moreover, elevated levels of the pore-forming α-subunit Nav1.1 are observed in AD brains with elevated BACE1 expression and also in mice overexpressing human BACE1 (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H.

The β2-intracellular domain (β2-ICD), derived from BACE1 and γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of β2, regulates Nav1.1 expression. However, Nav1.1 trafficking to the cell membrane is impaired resulting in reduced Nav1.1 surface levels, which leads to reduced sodium current densities (32Kim D.Y. Carey B.W. Wang H. Ingano L.A.

First, we found that Navβ2 is essential for BACE1 activity-dependent regulation of Nav1.1 mRNA and protein levels in cultured embryonic neurons. Next, we also found that endogenous BACE1 activity regulates total and surface levels of Nav1.1 especially in adult hippocampus. Interestingly, Nav1.2 appears to compensate for decreased surface levels of Nav1.1."
https://openalex.org/W1979308978,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) possess the capacity to proliferate indefinitely in an undifferentiated state and to differentiate into various cell types in an organism. However, the critical question of how self-renewal and differentiation are precisely regulated in ESCs is not entirely understood at present. Here, we report the essential role of Tbx3, a pluripotency-related transcription factor of the T-box gene family, for both the maintenance of self-renewal of mouse ESCs and for their differentiation into extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn). We show that Tbx3 is highly expressed in ExEn cells in addition to undifferentiated ESCs. Knockdown of Tbx3 expression using tetracycline-regulated Tbx3 siRNA resulted in the attenuation of ESC self-renewal ability and aberrant differentiation processes, including reduced ExEn differentiation but enhanced ectoderm and trophectoderm differentiation. Conversely, inducible forced expression of Tbx3 triggered ExEn lineage commitment. Mechanistically, Tbx3 directly activated the expression of Gata6, an essential regulator of ExEn. Interestingly, Tbx3 modulated H3K27me3 modification and the association of the PRC2 complex with the promoter region of Gata6. Taken together, the results of this study revealed a previously unappreciated role of a pluripotency factor in ExEn differentiation. Additionally, our data reveal that Tbx3 may function through direct binding and epigenetic modification of histones on the Gata6 promoter to maintain the ExEn differentiation potential of ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W1972762552,"The Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ect2 is genetically and biochemically linked to the PKCι oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ect2 is overexpressed and mislocalized to the cytoplasm of NSCLC cells where it binds the oncogenic PKCι-Par6 complex, leading to activation of the Rac1 small GTPase. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized phosphorylation site on Ect2, threonine 328, that serves to regulate the oncogenic activity of Ect2 in NSCLC cells. PKCι directly phosphorylates Ect2 at Thr-328 in vitro, and RNAi-mediated knockdown of either PKCι or Par6 leads to a decrease in phospho-Thr-328 Ect2, indicating that PKCι regulates Thr-328 Ect2 phosphorylation in NSCLC cells. Both wild-type Ect2 and a phosphomimetic T328D Ect2 mutant bind the PKCι-Par6 complex, activate Rac1, and restore transformed growth and invasion when expressed in NSCLC cells made deficient in endogenous Ect2 by RNAi-mediated knockdown. In contrast, a phosphorylation-deficient T328A Ect2 mutant fails to bind the PKCι-Par6 complex, activate Rac1, or restore transformation. Our data support a model in which PKCι-mediated phosphorylation regulates Ect2 binding to the oncogenic PKCι-Par6 complex thereby activating Rac1 activity and driving transformed growth and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1980041666,"Stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) induces formation of a phosphorylation-dependent signaling network via multiprotein complexes, whose compositions and dynamics are incompletely understood. Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics, we investigated the kinetics of signal propagation after TCR-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. We confidently assigned 77 proteins (of 758 identified) as a direct or indirect consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation that proceeds in successive ""signaling waves"" revealing the temporal pace at which tyrosine kinases activate cellular functions. The first wave includes thymocyte-expressed molecule involved in selection (THEMIS), a protein recently implicated in thymocyte development but whose signaling role is unclear. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of THEMIS depends on the presence of the scaffold proteins Linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and SH2 domain-containing lymphocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76). THEMIS associates with LAT, presumably via the adapter growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and with phospholipase Cγ1 (PLC-γ1). RNAi-mediated THEMIS knock-down inhibited TCR-induced IL-2 gene expression due to reduced ERK and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)/activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling, whereas JNK, p38, or nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation were unaffected. Our study reveals the dynamics of TCR-dependent signaling networks and suggests a specific role for THEMIS in early TCR signalosome function."
https://openalex.org/W2154835728,"A major challenge in the field of systems biology consists of predicting gene regulatory networks based on different training data. Within the DREAM4 initiative, we took part in the multifactorial sub-challenge that aimed to predict gene regulatory networks of size 100 from training data consisting of steady-state levels obtained after applying multifactorial perturbations to the original in silico network. Due to the static character of the challenge data, we tackled the problem via a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field, which relates network topology with the covariance inverse generated by the gene measurements. As for the computations, we used the Graphical Lasso algorithm which provided a large range of candidate network topologies. The main task was to select the optimal network topology and for that, different model selection criteria were explored. The selected networks were compared with the golden standards and the results ranked using the scoring metrics applied in the challenge, giving a better insight in our submission and the way to improve it. Our approach provides an easy statistical and computational framework to infer gene regulatory networks that is suitable for large networks, even if the number of the observations (perturbations) is greater than the number of variables (genes)."

For example, the stoichiometry and symmetry of the homomeric β-barrel pores generate many permutations and combinations of the modified (or engineered) and unmodified (wild type) monomers. This is the major reason for the technical difficulties of separating the engineered single subunit-modified protein pores with well defined biophysical and biochemical features from other products of the oligomerization reaction (13Movileanu L.

Recently, the outer membrane protein G (OmpG), a monomeric β-barrel pore, whose single-channel conductance and inner diameter are comparable with the corresponding values of the αHL pore (∼1 nS and ∼15 Å, respectively) (15Subbarao G.V. van den Berg B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was engineered to produce a quiet unitary conductance (16Chen M. Khalid S. Sansom M.S. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6272-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the engineered OmpG protein might function as a nanopore-based biosensor for stochastic detection via noncovalent adaptors. However, the x-ray crystal structures of both αHL (4Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar) and OmpG (15Subbarao G.V. van den Berg B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) proteins reveal a somewhat small diameter of the constriction region of the pore (∼15 Å), allowing the translocation of small molecules up to ∼700 Da in molecular mass. Furthermore, the αHL, OmpF, and OmpG protein nanopores cannot permit the passage of bulky biomolecules, such as folded proteins (17Mohammad M.M. Prakash S. Matouschek A. Movileanu L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 4081-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Mohammad M.M. Movileanu L. Eur. Biophys. J. 2008; 37: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or even double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (19Kasianowicz J.J. Brandin E. Branton D. Deamer D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13770-13773Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). To overcome these fundamental limitations, a larger monomeric β-barrel protein pore is required for single-molecule stochastic sensing of biomolecules, such as dsDNA, functional proteins, and their ensembles. We decided to explore the ferric hydroxamate uptake component A (FhuA), a monomeric β-barrel protein from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. The high resolution x-ray crystal structure of FhuA is available, revealing a large membrane-spanning β-barrel domain, composed of 22 β strands (residues 161–714) (Fig. 1), which is filled by a globular N-terminal domain (residues 1–160) called the cork (20Locher K.P.

Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The barrel has an elliptically shaped cross-sectional area, and the sequential β strands run anti-parallel to one another, conferring an exceptional robustness (22Bonhivers M. Desmadril M. Moeck G.S. Boulanger P. Colomer-Pallas A. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Ramakrishnan M. Pocanschi C.L. Kleinschmidt J.H. Marsh D.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Adjacent β strands are connected by short turns on the periplasmic side and long loops on the extracellular side (Fig. 1). The x-ray crystal structure of the FhuA protein indicates that, unlike porins, the extracellular loops do not fold back into the interior of the pore but rather project away from the membrane surface (20Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 21Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). It has also revealed its monomeric character and elucidated the relatively clear architecture of the channel at the atomic level (Fig. 1) (20Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 21Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Therefore, this information paves the way for the use of this outer membrane protein in redesign studies and in the possible development of stochastic biosensing elements. The FhuA protein exhibits a highly diverse functionality. Its primary role is to provide a binding site on the outer membrane surface for siderophores, such as ferrichrome (20Locher K.P. Rees B.

Biochimie. 2002; 84: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dynamics of the wild-type FhuA (WT-FhuA) protein at an atomistic level has been revealed by molecular dynamics simulations (35Faraldo-Gómez J.D. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1406-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The FhuA channel exhibits a remarkable robustness, versatility, tractability, and thermal stability, as was well documented by prior spectroscopic and calorimetric studies (22Bonhivers M. Desmadril M. Moeck G.S. Boulanger P. Colomer-Pallas A. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Ramakrishnan M. Pocanschi C.L. Kleinschmidt J.H.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we designed a series of single domain or multiple loop deletions to investigate which parts of the FhuA protein contribute to the occlusion of the lumen. First, we constructed a deletion mutant removing the cork domain, which encompassed the first 160 amino acids (FhuAΔ1–160) (Table 2). Second, we deleted 52% of strand β8 along with nine amino acids of loop L4 (FhuAΔ335–355). Third, we also deleted 52% of strand β8 along with most of loop L4 (FhuAΔ322–355), leaving the first seven amino acids. This construct will not have loop L4 deleted per se, but it might put a structural constraint on loop L4 to compensate for the loss of the majority of the β strand in the barrel (supplemental Fig. S2). Loop L4 is targeted for modifications, because it has been shown to reduce the extracellular entrance to the lumen of FhuA protein by ∼50% (20Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and perhaps it would prevent more modulation or even the release of the cork upon the application of a transmembrane potential.TABLE 2The physical properties of the extracellular loops of the FhuA proteinLoopOverall chargeaThe total charge of the loop was calculated at pH 7.4.Charge ratiobThe total number of positive charges of the loop versus its negative charges and was calculated at pH 7.4.ResiduesLoop lengthcThe length of the loop under the stretched out conformation was based upon the total number of residues.CommentsdComments concern the cork-free FhuA protein.ÅL1−10/−1Thr170–Ser1727.0Very short loopL2+1+1/0Ala203–Ser20817.5Short loopL30+4/−4Tyr243–Asn273105Large flexible, random coil loop that folds back into the pore lumenL4+1+3/−2Cys318–His33973.5Large loop that contains three helices, and a β strand.

Open table in a new tab Previously engineered FhuA proteins were stable and functional in reconstituted systems, as judged by their channel-forming ability in planar lipid membranes (36Killmann H. Benz R. Braun V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Braun V. Killmann H. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Killmann H. Benz R. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6913-6920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Braun M. Killmann H. Maier E. Benz R. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4948-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the past, these deletion mutants were studied by macroscopic electrical recordings, in which detailed, time-resolved single-channel information about each deletion mutant is lacking. For example, the channel sub-states can be difficult to decipher (36Killmann H. Benz R. Braun V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Braun M. Killmann H. Maier E. Benz R. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4948-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, these macroscopic current studies hindered important conclusions about which parts of FhuA occlude the lumen. Therefore, we used single-channel electrical recordings to investigate single-deletion FhuA mutants along with the WT-FhuA protein to derive detailed information about their spontaneous, stochastic gating. In addition to single-deletion FhuA mutants, we examined double and multiple deletion mutants to obtain a comprehensive picture of the cumulative effect of both the cork domain and several large extracellular loops on the biophysical features of the FhuA protein. Based upon examination of the crystal structure of the FhuA protein (20Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 21Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), our major hypothesis was that L4 is not the only loop occluding the pore, but other extracellular loops may modulate the unitary conductance of the cork-free FhuA protein. We found that the removal of the cork domain and loop L4 produces an increase in the single-channel conductance up to ∼3.0 nS over WT-FhuA. In accord with our expectations, the deletion of additional extracellular loops (L3, L4, L5, and L11) resulted in a substantially enhanced single-channel conductance of ∼4.8 nS. To our knowledge, this is the highest single-channel conductance ever measured with an engineered FhuA protein (29Bonhivers M. Ghazi A. Boulanger P. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Killmann H. Benz R. Braun V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Braun V. Killmann H.

Maier E. Benz R. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4948-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cork-free, multiple loop-deletion FhuA (FhuAΔC/Δ4L) proteins were either extracted from outer membranes or refolded from inclusion bodies (Fig. 1). Remarkably, high resolution single-channel electrical recordings accomplished with planar lipid bilayers showed that, although their unitary conductance is closely similar, membrane-extracted and refolded FhuAΔC/Δ4L proteins exhibit slightly different single-channel signatures. This finding pinpoints the power of single-channel electrical measurements in detecting subtle functional distinctions of membrane protein channels. pPR-IAB1 plasmids that contained wt fhua and fhuaΔ1–160, with an internal 6×His+ cloned into the coding region for the surfaced-exposed loop L5, were gifted by Professor Ulrich Schwaneberg (Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany). To construct fhuaΔ322–355, inverse PCR was performed on the wt fhua-containing plasmid with the following two phosphorylated primers: p-322, 5′-GTG ATC GAA GCT GTA GCC GAC-3′, and p-355, 5′-AAT GCT TAC AGC AAA CAG TGT-3′. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified using the MinElute® gel purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and then self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase. To construct fhuaΔ335–355, the same strategy was applied except that p-322 was exchanged with p-335, 5′-GCG CAG GTT CTG ACG CAC AGT-3′. To construct fhuaΔ1–160/Δ322–355 and fhuaΔ1–160/Δ335–355, we applied the above overall strategy except that we performed inverse PCR on the fhuaΔ1–160-containing plasmid. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The fhua gene, which lacked the regions coding for the cork domain and loops 3–5 and 11, named fhuaΔC/Δ4L, was constructed by de novo synthesis (GENEART, Regensburg, Germany) in the pMK-RQ plasmid flanked by EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. In this construct, the deleted loops were replaced with the polypeptide NSEG(S). A serine residue was added, if it did not exist in the original loop (40Endriss F. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4818-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pMK-RQ plasmid was digested with EcoRI and XhoI enzymes, and the released fhuaΔC/Δ4L gene was gel-purified, as mentioned above, and cloned into the pPR-IBA1 expression plasmid. This latter plasmid was also digested with EcoRI and XhoI enzymes. A C-terminal 6×His+ tag, which was preceded by a thrombin protease cleavage site, was added to fhuaΔC/Δ4L by inverse PCR utilizing the following two primers: 5′-ACT ACC GCG TGG CAG CAG AAA ACG AAA GGT TGC GGT GGC AAC-3′ and 5-CAT CAT CAC CAT CAC CAC TAA AGC GCT GGG AGC CCC CCC AGT-3′. The thrombin cleavage site and 6×His+ tag coding sequences are boldface and underlined, respectively. The final plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing. pPR-IBA1 containing the fhua gene and its derived constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) omp9 (F− hsdSB (rB− mB−) gal ompT dcm (DE3) ΔlamB ompF::Tn5 ΔompA ΔompC ompN::Ω (kindly provided by Dr. Helge Weingart, Jacobs University Bremen). The transformed cells were then grown in 2× TY media at 37 °C, until an A600 ∼0.7–0.8. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, at a final concentration of 1 mm, and allowed to continue until the cell growth plateaued, as measured by A600 ∼1.4. The wild-type FhuA (WT-FhuA) protein was purified as described previously (41Nallani M. Benito S. Onaca O. Graff A. Lindemann M. Winterhalter M. Meier W. Schwaneberg U. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 123: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The outer membranes were pre-extracted in 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% octyl-polyoxoethylene (oPOE), pH 8.0. The membrane-extracted proteins were obtained by incubating the outer membranes for 1 h at 37 °C, while shaking at 200 rpm, in 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 3% oPOE, pH 8.0. The insoluble materials were sedimented by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C; the supernatant, enriched in extracted outer membrane proteins, was used for subsequent purification steps. Prior to starting purification, the detergent concentration of the solubilized WT-FhuA was reduced from 3 to 1% to lessen the effects of detergent screening during chromatographic separation. Lower concentrations of oPOE were also tested; however, the concentrations were determined to be below the critical micelle concentration and thus did not allow for complete solubilization of the WT-FhuA protein.

Nonsynonymous (NS) variants of NPC1L1 in humans have been suggested to associate with cholesterol absorption variations. However, information concerning the characteristics and mechanism of these variants in cholesterol uptake is limited. In this study, we analyzed the cholesterol uptake ability of the 19 reported NS variants of NPC1L1 identified from cholesterol low absorbers. Among these variants, L110F, R306C, A395V, G402S, T413M, R693C, R1214H, and R1268H could partially mediate cellular cholesterol uptake and were categorized as partially dysfunctional variants. The other 11 variants including T61M, N132S, D398G, R417W, G434R, T499M, S620C, I647N, G672R, S881L, and R1108W could barely facilitate cholesterol uptake, and were classified into the severely dysfunctional group. The partially dysfunctional variants showed mild defects in one or multiple aspects of cholesterol-regulated recycling, subcellular localization, glycosylation, and protein stability. The severely dysfunctional ones displayed remarkable defects in all these aspects and were rapidly degraded through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. In vivo analyses using adenovirus-mediated expression in mouse liver confirmed that the S881L variant failed to localize to liver canalicular membrane, and the mice showed defects in biliary cholesterol re-absorption, while the G402S variant appeared to be similar to wild-type NPC1L1 in mouse liver. This study suggests that the dysfunction of the 19 variants on cholesterol absorption is due to the impairment of recycling, subcellular localization, glycosylation, or stability of NPC1L1.

https://openalex.org/W1987475803,"Hypoxia modulates gene expression and affects multiple aspects of endothelial cell biology. Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) is an extracellular matrix protein essential for elastic fiber assembly and vasculogenesis that participates in vascular remodeling and controls endothelial cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation. In this context, we aimed to analyze FBLN5 regulation by hypoxia in endothelial cells. Hypoxia (1% O(2)) increased FBLN5 mRNA levels in endothelial cells in a time-dependent manner. Maximal induction (∼2.5-fold) was achieved after 24 h of hypoxia. This effect paralleled an increase in both intracellular and extracellular FBLN5 protein levels. The increase in FBLN5 mRNA levels observed in hypoxic cells was blocked by inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (LY294002 and rapamycin) and mimicked by dimethyl oxal glycine, which prevents proline hydroxylase-mediated degradation of HIF-1α. Silencing of HIF-1α completely prevented hypoxia-induced FBLN5 up-regulation. Accordingly, both hypoxia and HIF-1α overexpression increased FBLN5 transcriptional activity. Serial promoter deletion and mutagenesis studies revealed the involvement of a putative hypoxia response element (HRE) located at -78 bp. In fact, EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrated increased HIF-1 binding to this site in hypoxic cells. Interestingly, the rate of endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis in cultures exposed to hypoxia increased in FBLN5 knockdown cells, suggesting that hypoxia-induced FBLN5 expression contributes to preserve cell survival. These results provide evidence that HIF-1 signaling underlies the increase of FBLN5 expression elicited by hypoxia in endothelial cells and suggest that FBLN5 induction could be involved in the adaptive survival response of endothelial cells to hypoxia."

The thermophilic gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, a model organism for structural genomics and systems biology, discloses ∼46 ABC proteins, which are largely uncharacterized. Here, we functionally analyzed the first two and only ABC half-transporters of the hyperthermophilic bacterium, TmrA and TmrB. The ABC system mediates uptake of the drug Hoechst 33342 in inside-out oriented vesicles that is inhibited by verapamil. TmrA and TmrB form a stable heterodimeric complex hydrolyzing ATP with a K(m) of 0.9 mm and k(cat) of 9 s(-1) at 68 °C. Two nucleotides can be trapped in the heterodimeric ABC complex either by vanadate or by mutation inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. Nucleotide trapping requires permissive temperatures, at which a conformational ATP switch is possible. We further demonstrate that the canonic glutamate 523 of TmrA is essential for rapid conversion of the ATP/ATP-bound complex into its ADP/ATP state, whereas the corresponding aspartate in TmrB (Asp-500) has only a regulatory role. Notably, exchange of this single noncanonic residue into a catalytic glutamate cannot rescue the function of the E523Q/D500E complex, implicating a built-in asymmetry of the complex. However, slow ATP hydrolysis in the newly generated canonic site (D500E) strictly depends on the formation of a posthydrolysis state in the consensus site, indicating an allosteric coupling of both active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2158490827,"Throughout spermatogenesis, the Sertoli cell blood-testis barrier (BTB) is strictly regulated by cytokines, which mediate its timely restructuring, thereby allowing spermatocytes to enter the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium for development into spermatozoa. The aim herein was to investigate whether germ cells play a role in BTB restructuring via the action of interleukin-lo (IL-1α) since germ cells are known to control Sertoli cell production of this cytokine, and if yes, how these effects are mediated. When Sertoli cells were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats and plated at high density, IL-1α (100 pg/ml) was shown to “open” the Sertoli cell barrier when its integrity was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. Further investigation of Sertoli cells treated with IL-1α revealed striking changes in the cellular distribution of actin filaments when compared to untreated cells. These effects at the Sertoli cell barrier were mediated, in part, by epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8; an actin bundling and barbed-end capping protein) and actin-related protein 3 (Arp3; a component of the actin nucleation machinery). As important, an increase in the kinetics of occludin internalization but a decrease in its rate of degradation was noted following IL-1α treatment. These results indicate that IL-1α is a critical regulator of BTB dynamics.—Lie, P. P. Y., Cheng, C. Y., Mruk, D. D. Interleukin-lα is a regulator of the blood-testis barrier.

Progress in understanding its pathogenicity and epidemiology has been hampered by the lack of a long-term in vitro culture method. Obligate parasitism of this pathogen has been suggested on the basis of various features but remains controversial. We analysed the 7.0 Mb draft genome sequence of the closely related species Pneumocystis carinii infecting rats, which is a well established experimental model of the disease. We predicted 8'085 (redundant) peptides and 14.9% of them were mapped onto the KEGG biochemical pathways. The proteome of the closely related yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was used as a control for the annotation procedure (4'974 genes, 14.1% mapped). About two thirds of the mapped peptides of each organism (65.7% and 73.2%, respectively) corresponded to crucial enzymes for the basal metabolism and standard cellular processes. However, the proportion of P. carinii genes relative to those of S. pombe was significantly smaller for the ""amino acid metabolism"" category of pathways than for all other categories taken together (40 versus 114 against 278 versus 427, P<0.002). Importantly, we identified in P. carinii only 2 enzymes specifically dedicated to the synthesis of the 20 standard amino acids. By contrast all the 54 enzymes dedicated to this synthesis reported in the KEGG atlas for S. pombe were detected upon reannotation of S. pombe proteome (2 versus 54 against 278 versus 427, P<0.0001). This finding strongly suggests that species of the genus Pneumocystis are scavenging amino acids from their host's lung environment. Consequently, they would have no form able to live independently from another organism, and these parasites would be obligate in addition to being opportunistic. These findings have implications for the management of patients susceptible to P. jirovecii infection given that the only source of infection would be other humans."
https://openalex.org/W2049452651,"Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of genetically inherited disorders that result from the defective activity of lysosomal enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan catabolism, causing their intralysosomal accumulation. Sanfilippo disease describes a subset of mucopolysaccharidoses resulting from defects in heparan sulfate catabolism. Sanfilippo disorders cause severe neuropathology in affected children. The reason for such extensive central nervous system dysfunction is unresolved, but it may be associated with the secondary accumulation of metabolites such as gangliosides. In this article, we describe the accumulation of dermatan sulfate as a novel secondary metabolite in Sanfilippo. Based on chondroitinase ABC digestion, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate levels in fibroblasts from Sanfilippo patients were elevated 2-5-fold above wild-type dermal fibroblasts. Lysosomal turnover of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate in these cell lines was significantly impaired but could be normalized by reducing heparan sulfate storage using enzyme replacement therapy. Examination of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate catabolic enzymes showed that heparan sulfate and heparin can inhibit iduronate 2-sulfatase. Analysis of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate fraction by chondroitinase ACII digestion showed dermatan sulfate storage, consistent with inhibition of iduronate 2-sulfatase. The discovery of a novel storage metabolite in Sanfilippo patients may have important implications for diagnosis and understanding disease pathology."

Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of BH and the relevance of BH to AD. First, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of BH.

In the canonical pathway, the extracellular Wnt ligands regulate the expression of specific target genes by modulating the amount of β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt, degradation of β-catenin is mediated by a destruction complex containing adenomatous polyposis coli, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, casein kinase I, and Axin. 2The abbreviations used are: Axinaxis inhibition proteinDvlDishevelledDIXDishevelled and AxinCcd1coiled-coil-DIX1HSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. Binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) receptors results in the activation of Dishevelled (Dvl), which suppresses β-catenin degradation. Thus, β-catenin is accumulated in the cytosol and subsequently translocated into the nucleus to regulate Wnt target genes.Dvl and Axin contain a conserved region of about 100 residues, referred to as the DIX domain (4Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic Dvl has a tendency to form puncta via its DIX domain (Dvl-DIX), which may mediate Wnt signaling by reversible polymerization to provide an interaction platform for other Wnt components, including Axin (5Schwarz-Romond T.

The DIX domain of Axin (Axin-DIX) is also required for the formation of Axin polymers and puncta (10Sakanaka C. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

In addition to Dvl and Axin, the coiled-coil protein DIX domain-containing 1 (Ccd1) also contains a DIX domain that can form heteromeric complexes with Dvl and Axin and, thus, positively regulate the canonical Wnt signaling (14Shiomi K.

Fiedler M. Shibata N. Butler P.J. Kikuchi A. Higuchi Y. Bienz M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, the DIX domain of Axin cannot form hetero-complexes with either Dvl-DIX or Ccd1-DIX and is dispensable for the canonical Wnt signaling. In contrast, both DIX domains of Ccd1 and Dvl are indispensable for their hetero-interaction and the regulation of Wnt signaling. Therefore, the homomeric interaction revealed in the crystal packing of Axin-DIX might not fully define the nature for the interactions between the DIX domains. To reveal the molecular basis, we determined the crystal structures of wild type Ccd1-DIX and mutant Dvl1-DIX(Y17D) and carried out extensive biochemical studies on how the DIX domain-containing proteins can dynamically modulate each other. Despite their monomeric nature, these two DIX domains are engaged in similar homo-oligomeric contacts, forming helical filaments in crystals. Structural analyses and systematic mutagenesis studies revealed that the critical residues for the DIX-DIX interaction are from three sites, two intra-filament sites (Site I and Site II) and one inter-filament site (Site III). The integrity of all three sites is required for Dvl homo-assembly, puncta formation, and Wnt signal transduction, whereas the non-conservative Site II in Axin-DIX may account for its disability to form hetero-complex with Dvl-DIX and Ccd1-DIX. In addition, we found that Ccd1 regulates Wnt signaling via association with Dvl through the head of Dvl-DIX and the tail of Ccd1-DIX. Importantly, Ccd1 depolymerizes the homo-assembly of Dvl in vitro and induces its diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in vivo. Our data together with prior work disclose the activation mechanism of Ccd1 by directly interacting with Dvl, depolymerizing the high molecular weight Dvl homopolymer, and further stabilizing Dvl in its biologically active low molecular weight state.DISCUSSIONAlthough Ccd1 was shown to positively regulate the Wnt pathway (14Shiomi K. Uchida H. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Luo W. Zou H. Jin L. Lin S. Li Q. Ye Z. Rui H. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

We found that Ccd1 regulates Wnt signaling through the direct interaction with Dvl. Our study has further elucidated the structural basis for complex formations among the DIX domain proteins and demonstrated that the capability of Ccd1 to convert latent polymeric Dvl to biologically active oligomer underlies its positive role on Wnt signaling.The structures of Ccd1-DIX and Dvl1-DIX(Y17D) belong to the ubiquitin-like fold, the same β-grasp topology as the previously determined Axin-DIX structure. Regardless of the distinct monomeric/oligomeric nature of the proteins used for structural studies, all three DIX domains form helical filaments in crystals, involving similar head-to-tail packing. It is noteworthy that a number of proteins form the head-to-tail complexes via association of their homotypic domains and, thus, exert widespread roles in the precise transduction of cellular signaling pathways (37Park H.H.

In addition to the previously identified hydrophobic interface (Site I), the crystal packing of Ccd1 and Dvl indicates additional contacts (Site II) between the N terminus of strand β1 or β5 of one molecule and the twisted β3-β4 loop of the adjacent molecule within the filament. Interestingly, the eight molecules of Dvl1-DIX(Y17D) within each asymmetric unit pack into two intertwined helical filaments, which enables us to identify a symmetric interfilament interface (Site III) for the assembly of higher order aggregate. Recently, some residues at Sites II and III were predicted to have potential roles in mediating DIX-DIX interaction by comparative modeling (40Ehebauer M.T. Arias A.M. BMC Struct. Biol. 2009; 9: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our structure-guided mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the integrity of the interface, including the primary Site I, the auxiliary Site II, and the interfilament Site III, is indispensable for Dvl homo-oligomerization, puncta formation, and Wnt signaling. In addition, Dvl and Ccd1 directly interact with each other through the head of Dvl-DIX and the tail of Ccd1-DIX, involving residues from Sites I and II. However, Axin-DIX may not possess an active Site II and is, therefore, incapable to form hetero-complex with Dvl-DIX and Ccd1-DIX (9Schwarz-Romond T. Metcalfe C. Bienz M. J.

The hydrophobic pocket at Site II of Axin-DIX is partially deformed; a small Ala-756 on the head substitutes the bulky Leu/Ile in Ccd1/Dvl, and concomitantly the aromatic ring of Phe-801 on the tail of Axin shifts outwards more than 6 Å (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the charged residues forming salt bridges in Ccd1/Dvl are replaced by Ser-798 and Val-754 in Axin, which may lead to the disruption of the hydrophilic interactions at Site II. Therefore, Site II may be unique to Dvl-DIX and Ccd1-DIX.Overexpressed Dvl has a tendency to form high molecular weight protein assemblies, visualized as puncta in cytosol, and the polymerization of Dvl is believed to be crucial for the initiation of Wnt signaling (5Schwarz-Romond T.

Importantly, the membrane-associated Dvl after Wnt stimulation appears to form smaller punctates than those in cytosol, suggesting that the large Dvl polymer undergoes a transient disassociation and subsequent translocation to the plasma membrane as low molecular weight oligomers (6Yang-Snyder J.

Moreover, casein kinase Iϵ, a positive regulator of Wnt signaling, is able to bind to the PDZ and DEP domains of Dvl, phosphorylates it within a basic region, and induces a relatively even distribution within the cytoplasm in response to Wnt signal (46Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 47Kishida M. Hino Si. Michiue T. Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Fukui A. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J.

Together, these results have indicated that the biologically active Dvl assemblies are in fact low molecular weight oligomers but not large punctate polymers as suggested by overexpression systems.In the present study we observed that the positive Wnt regulator Ccd1, upon binding to Dvl, attenuates the homo-assembly of Dvl in vitro and leads to diffused cytoplasmic distribution of Dvl in vivo. Of a particular note, we have resolved a paradox between the observations that Dvl needs to homopolymerize for Wnt activation and that Ccd1 acts to depolymerize Dvl in Wnt activation. It is clear that a prior requirement for Dvl to exert its positive role in Wnt signaling is to be able to form a homo-assembly of at least a dimer, in fact, as aforementioned a trimer. In the resting state, Dvl proteins accumulate in cytosol and form large punctate polymers that may preclude the access of other Wnt components, including Axin, due to the tight self-association. The Dvl assemblies are dynamic, and Wnt stimulation triggers a membrane translocation of the low molecular weight Dvl oligomers by direct interaction with Frizzled receptors. Recently, the activation of Wnt signaling was found to coincide with the increase of Ccd1 protein level due to a decrease in its ubiquitin-mediated degradation (49Wang L. Li H. Chen Q. Zhu T. Zhu H. Zheng L. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, in response to Wnt stimulation, Ccd1 is somehow accumulated in cytosol, then recruited to the Dvl polymer and concomitantly depolymerize it, yielding the biologically active trimer. Under this conjecture, Dvl, by virtue of this reversible homo-assembly, is able to both keep the Wnt activity in check and to stimulate Wnt signaling, depending on the availability of Wnt signal. IntroductionWnt signaling is one of the major developmental pathways regulating various cellular processes (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4180) Google Scholar, 2Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar, 3Klaus A. Birchmeier W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). In the canonical pathway, the extracellular Wnt ligands regulate the expression of specific target genes by modulating the amount of β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt, degradation of β-catenin is mediated by a destruction complex containing adenomatous polyposis coli, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, casein kinase I, and Axin. 2The abbreviations used are: Axinaxis inhibition proteinDvlDishevelledDIXDishevelled and AxinCcd1coiled-coil-DIX1HSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. Binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) receptors results in the activation of Dishevelled (Dvl), which suppresses β-catenin degradation. Thus, β-catenin is accumulated in the cytosol and subsequently translocated into the nucleus to regulate Wnt target genes.Dvl and Axin contain a conserved region of about 100 residues, referred to as the DIX domain (4Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic Dvl has a tendency to form puncta via its DIX domain (Dvl-DIX), which may mediate Wnt signaling by reversible polymerization to provide an interaction platform for other Wnt components, including Axin (5Schwarz-Romond T.

The DIX domain of Axin (Axin-DIX) is also required for the formation of Axin polymers and puncta (10Sakanaka C. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

Proper intracellular transduction of Wnt signal relies on the direct interaction between Dvl and Axin (11Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L.

It is generally believed that the DIX domains play important roles in the formation of Dvl-Axin complex, although isolated Dvl-DIX and Axin-DIX do not bind to each other directly either in vivo or in vitro (9Schwarz-Romond T.

In addition to Dvl and Axin, the coiled-coil protein DIX domain-containing 1 (Ccd1) also contains a DIX domain that can form heteromeric complexes with Dvl and Axin and, thus, positively regulate the canonical Wnt signaling (14Shiomi K. Uchida H. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ccd1 is highly conserved in species ranging from zebrafish to human and is shown to play important roles in neurogenesis, axonal morphogenesis, and neuronal migration (15Shiomi K. Kanemoto M.

Neuron. 2010; 67: 33-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).The x-ray structure of Axin-DIX was determined and revealed a helical filament in crystal and led to a head-to-tail self-association model of the DIX domain (5Schwarz-Romond T. Fiedler M. Shibata N. Butler P.J. Kikuchi A. Higuchi Y. Bienz M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, the DIX domain of Axin cannot form hetero-complexes with either Dvl-DIX or Ccd1-DIX and is dispensable for the canonical Wnt signaling. In contrast, both DIX domains of Ccd1 and Dvl are indispensable for their hetero-interaction and the regulation of Wnt signaling. Therefore, the homomeric interaction revealed in the crystal packing of Axin-DIX might not fully define the nature for the interactions between the DIX domains. To reveal the molecular basis, we determined the crystal structures of wild type Ccd1-DIX and mutant Dvl1-DIX(Y17D) and carried out extensive biochemical studies on how the DIX domain-containing proteins can dynamically modulate each other. Despite their monomeric nature, these two DIX domains are engaged in similar homo-oligomeric contacts, forming helical filaments in crystals. Structural analyses and systematic mutagenesis studies revealed that the critical residues for the DIX-DIX interaction are from three sites, two intra-filament sites (Site I and Site II) and one inter-filament site (Site III). The integrity of all three sites is required for Dvl homo-assembly, puncta formation, and Wnt signal transduction, whereas the non-conservative Site II in Axin-DIX may account for its disability to form hetero-complex with Dvl-DIX and Ccd1-DIX. In addition, we found that Ccd1 regulates Wnt signaling via association with Dvl through the head of Dvl-DIX and the tail of Ccd1-DIX. Importantly, Ccd1 depolymerizes the homo-assembly of Dvl in vitro and induces its diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in vivo. Our data together with prior work disclose the activation mechanism of Ccd1 by directly interacting with Dvl, depolymerizing the high molecular weight Dvl homopolymer, and further stabilizing Dvl in its biologically active low molecular weight state. Wnt signaling is one of the major developmental pathways regulating various cellular processes (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Bacterial σ factors control specific transcriptional programs through activation of core RNA polymerase. All σ factors are negatively regulated by anti-σ factors. In Bacillus subtilis, σ F (σF) initiates and controls the sporulation program. The anti-σ factor for σF is SpoIIAB, a Ser/Thr kinase under the inhibitory control of the anti-σ antagonist SpoIIAA. ATP-liganded SpoII AB binds and inhibits σF. SpoIIAA activates σF through sequestration of SpoIIAB (ATP), which displaces σF from its complex with SpoIIAB. SpoIIAA phosphorylation (at Ser58) by bound SpoIIAB leads to its dissociation from the ADP form of SpoIIAB. Phosphorylated SpoIIAA can then be dephosphorylated by phosphatase SpoIIE (summarized in Ref. 21Masuda S. Murakami K.S. Wang S. Anders Olson C. Donigian J. Leon F. Darst S.A. Campbell E.A. J. Mol.

However, the amino acid assignments of this structure have not been reported and, until recently, no other structural information had been released for STAS domains of SulP/SLC26 anion transporters.We have overexpressed and purified the 560-aa putative SO42− transporter Rv1739c from M. tuberculosis, comprising an N-terminal trans-membrane domain (aa 1–414) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic STAS domain (aa 442–560) (15Zolotarev A.S.

Previously, we reported the secondary structural features present in the C-terminal STAS domain using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (30Sharma A.K. Ye L. Zolotarev A.S. Alper S.L. Rigby A.C. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional NMR structure of the Rv1739c STAS domain (aa 437–560). Using intrinsic fluorescence quench data and 1H-15N chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, we demonstrate that the monomeric STAS domain binds guanine nucleotides at physiological concentrations. The purified STAS domain is also associated with detectable GTPase activity. CSP analysis reveals that STAS binding of GDP elicits a more extensive conformational perturbation than does GTP. In silico docking calculations support these CSP data, suggesting that GDP binds preferentially, whereas GTP binding involves a subset of the GDP-interacting residues. The overexpressed Rv1739c STAS domain is not a phosphoprotein as isolated from E. coli or Mycobacterium smegmatis, and is not phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant Ser-Thr kinases or anti-σ factors of M. tuberculosis.

Supplemental Fig. S2 shows sequential 13Cα, and 13Cβ assignments for the first α-helix (supplemental Fig. S2A) and third β-strand in Rv1739c STAS (supplemental Fig. S2B). The 1H-15N two-dimensional HSQC spectrum of the STAS domain (30Sharma A.K. Ye L. Zolotarev A.S. Alper S.L. Rigby A.C. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) exhibited well dispersed resonances for nearly all backbone and side chain proton-nitrogen pairs (supplemental Fig. S2C), with previously reported 1H-, 15N-, and 13C-chemical shifts (BMRB accession number 16052) (30Sharma A.K.

Sequential and medium range NOEs are summarized in Fig. 1. Of 311 long range NOEs assigned, 68 are from 1Hα and 1HΝ backbone-side chain interactions, 200 are from side chain-side chain interactions, and 43 represent backbone-backbone interactions.

These structures were selected using standard structural criteria including: low target function, minimal upper distance NOE violations >0.5 Å, and absence of dihedral angle violations >5°. The low root mean square deviation values represented by the superimposed ensemble and the identification in allowed regions of the Ramachandran map of 98.1% of amino acid residues support the precision and stereochemical quality of the calculated structures (Table 1).FIGURE 2Solution structure of Rv1739c STAS.

The structure includes five well defined helices (α1, 30–42; α2, 65–77; α3, 91–99; α4, 102–105; and α5, 114–121), and four β-strands (β1, 16–19; β2, 50–53; β3, 82–86; and β4, 110–111) in a parallel orientation to form a β-sheet structure. Packing of helices α1 and α2 is stabilized by NOEs between adjacent regions within the fold. Supplemental Fig. S3A shows the calculated electrostatic potential surface of Rv1739c STAS. The net surface charge of −3 reflects 20 negatively charged and 17 positively charged surface residues that are distributed non-uniformly across the Rv1739c STAS surface.The structural order/rigidity of Rv1739c was evaluated using heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE data obtained for 108 of 119 non-proline amino acids, and plotted as a function of amino acid sequence (supplemental “Methods” and Fig. S3B). The mean {1H}-15N NOE value for all residues was 0.79 ± 0.02, and was higher in more structured regions (0.84 ± 0.02) than in loop regions (0.71 ± 0.02). NOE values suggest the β2 (0.92 ± 0.02) and α4 (0.78 ± 0.05) regions as having higher and lower structural order/rigidity. The lower NOE value for the N-terminal 15 aa residues (0.55 ± 0.02) supports N-terminal fraying and conformational flexibility often associated with the presence of multiple prolines.Structural Comparison of Rv1739c STAS with Other STAS DomainsFig. 3, A–D, superimpose the backbone atoms of Rv1739c STAS with the crystal structure of non-phosphorylated B. sphaericus SpoIIAA, the NMR structure of B. subtilis SpoIIAA, the NMR structure of T. maritima TM1442, and the crystal structure of Rattus norvegicus Slc26a5/prestin.

The region shown in light magenta comprises the N-terminal 15 aa of the prestin STAS (light magenta) extending beyond the Rv1739c STAS N-terminal residues. Backbone N, Cα, and C′ atoms were superposed onto secondary structured regions. (Overlays were obtained by superposition of backbone atoms as follows: in A, Rv1739c STAS domain residues 16–20, 30–42, 49–54, 65–77, 81–85, 91–98, and 114–120 were superposed on B. sphaericus SPOIIAA residues 12–16, 23–35, 44–49, 57–69, 76–80, 84–91, and 104–110. In B, STAS domain residues 16–20, 30–42, 49–54, 65–77, 81–85, and 91–97 were superposed on B. subtilis SPOIIAA residues 12–16, 25–37, 44–49, 60–72, 76–80, and 87–93. In C, STAS domain residues 16–20, 30–42, 50–54, 65–77, and 82–86 were superposed on TM1442 residues 14–18, 30–42, 46–50, 59–71, and 78–82. In D, Rv1739c STAS domain residues 16–20, 49–54, 65–77, 81–85, 91–98, and 110–111 were superposed on rat prestin STAS residues 536–540, 640–645, 655–667, 673–677, 681–688, and 702–703.) E, amino acid sequence alignment (ClustalW with manual adjustments) of Rv1739c STAS with STAS domains and structurally characterized anti-σ factor antagonists (italicized) from other organisms, including SpoIIAA from B. subtilis (B. sub.); SpoIIAA from B. sphericus (B. sph.), and TM1442 (T. maritima). Above the aligned sequences are the tertiary structural elements and aa numbers of Rv1739c STAS. Numbers in parentheses are the aa residues encompassing each STAS domain or each (full-length) anti-σ factor antagonist. The conserved DSSG motif of B. subtilis SpoIIAA (red) and its phosphorylated residue Ser58 correspond to DLTA and Thr64 of Rv1739c STAS (red). The STAS domains from E. coli YchM and Sultr1.2 from A. thaliana are of lengths comparable with that of Rv1739c. The STAS domain of 764 aa human SLC26A3/DRA encompasses aa 505–728, and that of rat slc26a5/prestin encompasses aa 505–721. Both are shown with excision of the IVS region of ∼75 aa between helix α1 and strand β2 (blue arrowheads, Rv1739c STAS-based nomenclature (28Quin M. Newman J. Firbank S. Lewis R.J. Marles-Wright J.

The flexible structure of the N-terminal 14 aa residues of Rv1739c STAS contrasts with the structured N-terminal regions of SpoIIAA from B. sphaericus and B. subtilis. These include single β strands of 8 or 3 residues, respectively, packed in antiparallel orientation to the subsequent β strands arrayed in parallel, which together form a central β sheet. Helices α1 and α2 of Rv1739c STAS and B. subtilis SpoIIAA are similar in length, but shorter than the corresponding helices in B. sphaericus SpoIIAA. Helix α4 of Rv1739c STAS is oriented away from the protein core as in B. sphaericus, but closely packed to the main fold in B. subtilis and TM1442. Rv1739c STAS helix α3 extends parallel to the central β-sheet, in contrast to a perpendicular orientation of α3 in B. subtilis SpoIIAA. β1 and β2 strands of Rv1739c STAS and TM1442 are of similar length, but shorter than those of SpoIIAA. The β3-strands in Rv1739c (aa 80–86) and B. sphaericus SpoIIAA are similar in length. However, this region is shorter in length in TM1442 and unstructured in B. subtilis SpoIIAA.The topological fold of Rv1739c STAS closely resembles that of the rat prestin construct truncated at its C terminus and devoid of its “intervening sequence” (IVS) region aa 564–636. A notable exception to this similarity is the N-terminal 15-aa extension present in prestin STAS, which includes a “β1 strand” at its extreme N terminus and a “β0 strand” in the immediately juxtaposed loop (31Pasqualetto E. Aiello R. Gesiot L. Bonetto G. Bellanda M. Battistutta R. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Structural comparison among SulP/SLC26 polypeptides reveals that the presence of a common C-terminal β4 strand (aa 110–111 of Rv1739c STAS) is often absent from anti-σ factor antagonist structures. In addition, whereas helices α1 and α2 of anti-σ factor antagonists are arrayed in parallel orientation, the corresponding α1 and α2 helices of SulP/SLC26 STAS domains are oriented along divergent axes.The conserved 56DSSG motif of SpoIIAA constitutes a canonical phosphorylation site at Ser58 (Fig. 3E, in red). Sequence alignment suggests that Thr64 of Rv1739c, 62DLTA (also in red), provides a homologous phosphorylation site of Rv1739c. Superimposed tertiary structures further support the alignment of Ser58 of SPOIIAA (PDB code 1AUZ) with the partially surface exposed Thr64 of Rv1739c STAS (PDB code 2KLN). These phosphorylation motifs in both SpoIIAA and Rv1739c are bracketed by hydrophobic residues. In addition to Thr64, many conserved residues of Rv1739c STAS reside within a localized patch comprising the β2-α2 region (Fig. 3E).Guanine Nucleotide Binding by Rv1739c STASThe reported nucleotide binding properties of the anti-σ factor antagonist SpoIIAA (22Najafi S.M.

Gärtner W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3818-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) prompted us to evaluate the nucleotide binding potential of Rv1739c STAS. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, Rv1739c STAS was photolabeled by a γ-biotinylated derivative of 8-N3-GTP, and this photolabeling was prevented in the presence of excess unlabeled GTP. The presence of a unique Trp residue, Trp50 (aa 486 of Rv1739c holoprotein), in Rv1739c STAS and Tyr residues at STAS positions 7, 19, and 21 (Fig. 3E and supplemental Fig. S4A) allowed assessment of nucleotide binding using intrinsic fluorescence quench methods.FIGURE 4Rv1739c STAS binds guanine nucleotides.

Fig. 4B illustrates the gradual quench of intrinsic STAS fluorescence with progressively increasing concentrations of GDP. Supplemental Fig. S4 shows comparable quench by increasing concentrations of GTP, of non-hydrolyzable guanine nucleotides, and ATP. The observed quench isotherms are compatible with a single nucleotide binding site with dissociation constants (K½, in μm) of 146 ± 38 for GDP, 347 ± 227 for GTP (Fig. 4, C and D), 152 ± 53 for GDPβS (supplemental Fig. S4, E and F), and 326 ± 131 for GTPγS (supplemental Fig. S4, C and D and Table 2). K½ values (in μm) were higher in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2, 587 ± 337 for GDP and 727 ± 251 for GTP (Table 2). K½ for ATP in the absence of MgCl2 was 756 ± 232 μm (supplemental Fig. S4, G and H). Thus, the nucleotide affinity rank-order profile for Rv1739c STAS appeared to be GDP > GTP > ATP. Maximum STAS fluorescence quench was observed at ≤400 μm nucleotide except in the case of ATP, which required 2 mm nucleotide. The percent quench varied from 19 (for GTP) and 49% for GDP (Table 2). These data suggest a nucleotide interaction surface in Rv1739C STAS that directly or indirectly perturbs Trp50 and/or the three Tyr residues through conformational effects on adjacent or interposed residues.TABLE 2Binding affinities of nucleotide-Rv1739c STAS interactionNucleotideK½ ± S.E.r2μmGTP347 ± 2270.96GTPγS326 ± 1310.98GTP + 1 mm MgCl2727 ± 2510.99GDP146 ± 380.98GDPβS152 ± 530.98GDP + 1 mm MgCl2587 ± 3370.97ATP756 ± 2320.94 Open table in a new tab GTPase Activity Associated with Rv1739c STASIntrinsic signaling or enzymatic activities of bacterial SulP-associated STAS domains remain undefined.

https://openalex.org/W1994130992,"Plant responses to environmental stresses are polygenic and complex traits. In this study quantitative genetics using natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana was used to investigate the genetic architecture of plant responses to salt stress. Eighty seven A. thaliana accessions were screened and showed a large variation for root development and seed germination under 125 and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. Twenty two quantitative trait loci for these traits have been detected by phenotyping two recombinants inbred line populations, Sha x Col and Sha x Ler. Four QTLs controlling germination under salt were detected in the Sha x Col population. Interestingly, only one allelic combination at these four QTLs inhibits germination under salt stress, implying strong epistatic interactions between them. In this interacting context, we confirmed the effect of one QTL by phenotyping selected heterozygous inbred families. We also showed that this QTL is involved in the control of germination under other stress conditions such as KCl, mannitol, cold, glucose and ABA. Our data highlights the presence of a genetic network which consists of four interacting QTLs and controls germination under limiting environmental conditions."

Also, we identify in ERK8 two LXXLL motifs, typical of agonist-bound nuclear receptor corepressors, as necessary features for this MAP kinase to interact with ERRα and to regulate its cellular localization and transcriptional activity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that ERK8 is able to counteract, in immortalized human mammary cells, ERRα activation induced by the EGF receptor pathway, often deregulated in breast cancer. Altogether, these results reveal a novel function for ERK8 as a bona fide ERRα corepressor, involved in control of its cellular localization by nuclear exclusion, and suggest a key role for this MAP kinase in the regulation of the biological activities of this nuclear receptor."

They are widely expressed, often co-expressed, and regulate developmental processes, cell adhesion, motility, survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Both tumor suppressor and oncogene activities are ascribed to EFNs and Ephs in various contexts. A major conundrum regarding the EFN/Eph system concerns their large number and functional redundancy given the promiscuous cross-activation of ligands and receptors and the overlapping intracellular signaling pathways. To address this issue, we treated human epidermal keratinocytes with five EFNAs individually and defined the transcriptional responses in the cells. We found that a large set of genes is coregulated by all EFNAs. However, although the responses to EFNA3, EFNA4, and EFNA5 are identical, the responses to EFNA1 and EFNA2 are characteristic and distinctive. All EFNAs induce epidermal differentiation markers and suppress cell adhesion genes, especially integrins. Ontological analysis showed that all EFNAs induce cornification and keratin genes while suppressing wound healing-associated, signaling, receptor, and extracellular matrix-associated genes. Transcriptional targets of AP1 are selectively suppressed by EFNAs. EFNA1 and EFNA2, but not the EFNA3, EFNA4, EFNA5 cluster, regulate the members of the ubiquitin-associated proteolysis genes. EFNA1 specifically induces collagen production. Our results demonstrate that the EFN-Eph interactions in the epidermis, although promiscuous, are not redundant but specific. This suggests that different members of the EFN/Eph system have specific, clearly demarcated functions.

https://openalex.org/W2018837729,"Background Induction of osteolytic bone lesions in multiple myeloma is caused by an uncoupling of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation. Current management of myeloma bone disease is limited to the use of antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested the effects of daily administered parathyroid hormone (PTH) on bone disease and myeloma growth, and we investigated molecular mechanisms by analyzing gene expression profiles of unique myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells engrafted in SCID-rab and SCID-hu mouse models. PTH resulted in increased bone mineral density of myelomatous bones and reduced tumor burden, which reflected the dependence of primary myeloma cells on the bone marrow microenvironment. Treatment with PTH also increased bone mineral density of uninvolved murine bones in myelomatous hosts and bone mineral density of implanted human bones in nonmyelomatous hosts. In myelomatous bone, PTH markedly increased the number of osteoblasts and bone-formation parameters, and the number of osteoclasts was unaffected or moderately reduced. Pretreatment with PTH before injecting myeloma cells increased bone mineral density of the implanted bone and delayed tumor progression. Human global gene expression profiling of myelomatous bones from SCID-hu mice treated with PTH or saline revealed activation of multiple distinct pathways involved in bone formation and coupling; involvement of Wnt signaling was prominent. Treatment with PTH also downregulated markers typically expressed by osteoclasts and myeloma cells, and altered expression of genes that control oxidative stress and inflammation. PTH receptors were not expressed by myeloma cells, and PTH had no effect on myeloma cell growth in vitro. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that PTH-induced bone formation in myelomatous bones is mediated by activation of multiple signaling pathways involved in osteoblastogenesis and attenuated bone resorption and myeloma growth; mechanisms involve increased osteoblast production of anti-myeloma factors and minimized myeloma induction of inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2033485155,"ATP7B is a P-type ATPase involved in copper transport and homeostasis. In experiments with microsomes isolated from COS-1 cells or HepG2 hepatocytes sustaining ATP7B heterologous expression, we found that ATP7B utilization of ATP includes autophosphorylation of an aspartyl residue serving as ATPase catalytic intermediate as well as phosphorylation of serine residues by protein kinase D (PKD). The latter was abolished by specific PKD inhibition with CID755673. The presence of PKD protein in the microsomal fraction was demonstrated by Western blotting. PKD is a serine/threonine kinase that associates with the trans-Golgi network, regulating fission of transport carriers destined to the cell surface. Parallel studies on cultured cells showed that nascent WT ATP7B transits to the Golgi complex where it undergoes serine phosphorylation by PKD. Misfolded ATP7B protein (especially if subjected to deletions) underwent proteasome-mediated degradation, which provides effective quality control. Inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation with MG132 yielded additional, but nonfunctional protein. On the other hand, serine phosphorylation protected WT ATP7B from degradation. Protection was enhanced by PKD activation with phorbol esters and limited by PKD inhibition with CID75673. As a final step, phosphorylated ATP7B was transferred from the Golgi complex to cytosolic trafficking vesicles. Phosphorylation and trafficking were completely prevented by mutations of critical copper binding sites, demonstrating copper dependence of both PKD-assisted phosphorylation and trafficking. ATP7B trafficking was markedly reduced by the Ser-478/481/1121/1453 to Ala mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2042400152,"Membrane trafficking is dictated by dynamic molecular interactions involving discrete determinants in the cargo proteins and the intracellular transport machineries. We have previously reported that cell surface expression of GPR15, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that serves as a co-receptor for HIV, is correlated with the mode III binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the receptor C terminus. Here we provide a mechanistic basis for the role of 14-3-3 in promoting the cell surface expression of GPR15. The Ala mutation of penultimate phospho-Ser (S359A) that abolishes 14-3-3 binding resulted in substantially reduced O-glycosylation and the cell surface expression of GPR15. The surface membrane protein CD8 fused with the C-terminal tail of GPR15S359A mutant was re-localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the context of S359A mutation, the additional mutations in the upstream stretch of basic residues (RXR motif) restored O-glycosylation and the cell surface expression. The RXR motif was responsible for the interaction with coatomer protein I (COPI), which was inversely correlated with the 14-3-3 binding and cell surface expression. These results suggest that 14-3-3 binding promotes cell surface expression of GPR15 by releasing the receptor from ER retrieval/retention pathway that is mediated by the interaction of RXR motif and COPI. Moreover, 14-3-3 binding substantially increased the stability of GPR15 protein. Thus 14-3-3 proteins play multiple roles in biogenesis and trafficking of an HIV co-receptor GPR15 to control its cell surface density in response to the phosphorylation signal.

The magnitude of GPCR-mediated signaling is dictated by the cell surface density of the receptors. Naturally, genetic mutations that result in deficient cell surface trafficking of GPCRs are correlated with pathophysiology of various human diseases (1Dunham J.H. Hall R.A. Trends Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 541-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For instance, the majority of mutations in vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) that result in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus cause ER retention of the receptors (2Bernier V. Lagacé M. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the genetic deletion in HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 (CCR5-Δ32) reduces its cell surface expression and this confers the resistance to viral infection (3Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F.

Thus elucidation of molecular mechanisms that regulate cell surface transport of GPCRs will provide important basis for therapeutic intervention as well as for understanding of GPCR biology. However, compared with the extensive studies on the ligand-induced endocytic pathways (4Drake M.T. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Marullo S. Med Sci. 2004; 20: 78-83Google Scholar, 6Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V.

Our previous screening of a random peptide library identified a group of C-terminal sequences that directed the efficient cell surface expression of a reporter membrane protein by specific binding to 14-3-3 proteins (8Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of proteins that usually bind to the phosphopeptide motifs in the target proteins and play central regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological pathways (9van Heusden G.P.

The underlying mechanism by which 14-3-3 binding mediates forward trafficking of membrane proteins seems to be diverse and involve multiple different protein interactions (8Shikano S. Coblitz B.

We have reported that C-terminal (mode III) 14-3-3 binding to GPR15, a putative chemokine receptor and known as a co-receptor for HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (17Farzan M. Choe H.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, mechanistic basis for the role of 14-3-3 has not been understood. Here we demonstrate that the phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding promotes cell surface expression of GPR15 by suppressing the dibasic (RXR) motif-mediated ER localization activity and also by increasing the stability of GPR15. Thus we for the first time demonstrate a critical role of 14-3-3 proteins in controlling the cell surface density of a GPCR. The human GPR15 gene was cloned in pCMV vectors with N-terminal HA or Myc epitope as described previously (19Chung J.J. Okamoto Y. Coblitz B. Li M. Qiu Y. Shikano S. Febs. J. 2009; 276: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For untagged GPR15 constructs, the GPR15 gene was cloned in pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Human CD8 was either tagged with Myc (inserted after the N-terminal signal sequence) or with HA (inserted after the cytoplasmic tail) and cloned in pCDNA3.1(+). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension PCR. Mouse anti-HA, rabbit anti-HA, rabbit anti-myc, rabbit anti-14-3-3β (reacts to all seven 14-3-3 isoforms), and rabbit anti-β-tubulin were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-Myc with or without Alexa Fluor (AF) 488 label was from Millipore (Billerica, MA), mouse anti-human GPR15 was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), rabbit anti-GPR15 was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), mouse anti-calnexin, mouse anti-GM130, and mouse anti-p230 were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), rabbit anti-phospho Akt substrate (RXX(S/T)) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), rabbit Abs against α-COP, β-COP, and γ-COP were from Affinity BioReagent (Golden, CO). HEK293 cells were maintained in 50% DMEM/50% Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHO ldlD cells were generously provided by Dr. M. Krieger and cultured in Ham's F-12 with 5% FBS. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Transient transfection of plasmids was performed using Mirus TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected HEK293 cells were collected by gentle flushing and washed with Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 1% BSA (staining buffer). All the Ab staining and washing thereafter were performed in the staining buffer at 4 °C. For surface staining of GPR15, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with GPR15 mAb pre-labeled with R-phycoerythrin (PE) using Zenon labeling kit (Invitrogen). For Myc-tagged CD8, myc-AF488 mAb was used for stain. After wash, the stained cells were fixed with 1% PFA and analyzed by Cell Lab Quanta SC (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The geometric mean of the cell surface fluorescence from the live cells was obtained by FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). HeLa cells transfected with Myc-GPR15 or Myc-CD8 fusion constructs in the chamber slides were fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Pharmingen) for 15 min at 4 °C and permeabilized with −20 °C chilled 90% methanol for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were first stained with Abs for the intracellular markers overnight at 4 °C, followed by Cy3-labeled secondary Abs (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with AF488-Myc mAb for 1 h at 4 °C, and then with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) for 10 min before mounting. For cell surface staining of GPR15 or CD8 in the live cells, the transfected cells were incubated with AF488-Myc mAb at 4 °C for 30 min followed by wash and Hoechst stain. Images were collected with a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser scanning microscope using LSM Image Browser (Zeiss) software. For IP of GPR15 from total cell lysate, the transfected cells were washed with PBS once and lysed with lysis buffer (0.5% Igepal, 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Pierce) for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 11,000 × g, the supernatant was mixed with appropriate Abs and protein A- or protein G-conjugated agarose beads (Invitrogen). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and then the precipitated proteins were eluted by incubating the beads with 2× SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature. For IP of cell surface GPR15, the cells transfected with Myc-GPR15 constructs were first collected and live stained with Myc mAb for 30 min on ice. After washing, the cells were lysed and the centrifuge supernatants were incubated with protein G-beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted as described for the total cell IP. The protein samples resolved by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with skim milk. Membranes were incubated with primary Abs overnight at 4 °C and then with corresponding secondary Abs conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA). Blot signals were obtained using ECL substrates (Pierce) and collected by exposing to film or with a Chemi-Doc XRS system (Bio-Rad). Band intensity was determined using Quantity One® Software (Bio-Rad). Peptides encoding the C-terminal sequence of GPR15 (aa 347–360) with or without phosphorylation at Ser359 were synthesized by Genscript (Pisctaway, NJ) and Neo Bioscience (Cambridge, MA). The peptides were covalently coupled to SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) and incubated with HEK293 cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. The pulled-down proteins were eluted with sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted for 14-3-3 or COPI proteins. HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-GPR15 constructs in 60 mm dishes. After 48 h, the cells were starved in Met/Cys-free pulse medium for 30 min. Fresh [35S]Met/Cys (Trans 35S, MP Biomedical, Solon, OH) was added to the culture at 100 μCi/ml and the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and then washed twice with HBSS at RT. The cells were incubated in the complete medium supplemented with 2 mm of Met and Cys for 1, 3, and 5 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates made at each time point were immunoprecipitated with HA mAb at 4 °C. The eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the dried gels were analyzed for the radioactivity by phosphor imager (Typhoon, GE Helathcare, Pisctaway, NJ). The GPR15 signals were quantified by ImageQuant software (GE Helathcare). All the reagents including enzymes and buffers for this assay were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Wt GPR15 proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA mAb and the beads were incubated in G7 buffer containing neuraminidase, endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycosidase), β1,4-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase for 4 days at 37 °C. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted for GPR15. Previously we showed that mutation of penultimate Ser359 to Ala (Fig. 1A) abolished 14-3-3 binding and substantially reduced cell surface expression of GPR15 (8Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The in vitro pull-down assay using synthetic peptides encoding GPR15 C terminus clearly shows that 14-3-3 binding is dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser359 (Fig. 1B). To test the functional correlation between 14-3-3 binding and receptor surface expression, we designed GPR15 that lacks Ser359 but is fused with an R18 peptide sequence (Fig. 1C, GPR15Δ358-R18). The R18 is an unphosphorylated peptide that was isolated as a high affinity 14-3-3 binding sequence by a phage library screen (20Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and has no sequence homology to GPR15 C terminus. Its binding to 14-3-3 requires the core WLDLE sequence (20Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The co-IP and FCM assays showed that C-terminally fused-R18 sequence mediated the 14-3-3 binding to the receptor (Fig. 1D) and conferred the comparable surface expression to that of Wt GPR15 (Fig. 1E). In contrast, fusion of R18 sequence carrying Ala mutations in the core region (Fig. 1C, GPR15Δ358-R18AAAA) resulted in no 14-3-3 binding and low expression similar to that of GPR15S359A (Fig. 1, D and E). These results suggest that C-terminal 14-3-3 binding is sufficient for conferring the efficient surface expression of GPR15. Phosphorylation signal plays a key role in a wide variety of protein trafficking pathways. In the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR1, phosphorylation of Ser residues adjacent to the Arg stretch (RRRS896S897) by PKA and PKC is thought to allow the receptor for efficient trafficking to synapses (21Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Ehlers M.D. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because our S359A mutation abolishes both phosphorylation of Ser359 and 14-3-3 binding, it is still possible that in the Wt GPR15, phosphorylation of Ser359 itself is sufficient to mediate surface transport of GPR15 regardless of subsequent 14-3-3 binding. To address this possibility, we created GPR15 with three Ala residues extended (Fig. 1C). This AAA extension should perturb the C-terminal mode III 14-3-3 binding motif by shifting the phosphorylatable Ser from −2 to −5 position (22Coblitz B. Shikano S. Wu M. Gabelli S.B. Cockrell L.M. Spieker M. Hanyu Y. Fu H. Amzel L.M. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36263-36272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but will still preserve the Ser/Thr kinase recognition motif. By this we attempted to dissect the effect of phosphorylation alone from that of subsequent 14-3-3 binding. The eluates from IP of GPR15 were blotted with Abs against HA (Fig. 1F, top), phosphorylated RXX(S/T) motif (middle), and the associating 14-3-3 (bottom). As expected, GPR15-AAA showed similar level of phosphorylation signals to that of Wt, but completely lacked 14-3-3 binding. The absence of phospho-RXXS signal in GPR15Δ351 mutant lacking the C-terminal 9 residues confirmed the specificity of this phosphorylation signal (data not shown). Under this condition we observed low surface expression of GPR15-AAA similar to that of GPR15S359A (Fig. 1G). Collectively, our data demonstrate that Ser359-dependent 14-3-3 binding is both necessary and sufficient for mediating the efficient surface expression of GPR15. GPCRs are well known to undergo various post-translational modifications along the secretory pathway. In SDS-PAGE under the reducing condition, N-terminally HA-tagged GPR15 protein migrated with a molecular mass of ∼40–45 kDa, 80–90 kDa, and larger (>150 kDa) that seem to represent monomers, dimers, and oligomers and/or aggregates, respectively (Fig. 2A). The relative intensity of a slower migrating band (**) to the faster migrating band (*) was low in S359A mutant when compared with Wt GPR15 (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern had been observed for the GPR15Δ358-R18AAAA and GPR15Δ358-R18Wt (Fig. 1D). These data suggested that the difference of protein sizes represents post-translational modifications associated with the cell surface transport. The N-terminal extracellular region of an HIV co-receptor CCR5 is O-glycosylated on Ser and Thr residues and this modification is required for efficient binding of a chemokine ligand (23Bannert N. Craig S. Farzan M. Sogah D. Santo N.V. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1661-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because GPR15 has no N-glycosylation motifs, we tested the possibility of O-glycosylation. Treatment of Wt GPR15 protein with the enzyme mixture containing O-glycosidase reduced the size of slower migrating band (Fig. 2B), suggesting the presence of O-linked glycans. We also used a mutant CHO cell line ldlD to confirm this possibility. The ldlD cells lack the UDP-galactose (Gal)/UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 4-epimerase and therefore are deficient in GalNAc O-glycosylation and galactosylation in the absence of exogeneously added GalNAc and Gal, respectively (24Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When expressed in ldlD cells in the absence of GalNAc and Gal, the Wt GPR15 protein exhibited only ∼40 kDa band identical to that of GPR15S359A (Fig. 2C, lane 1). The addition of both sugars in the culture restored the ∼45-kDa band for Wt GPR15 but not for GPR15S359A (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 4). Moreover, the GPR15 mutants in which Ser and Thr residues at the amino acids 6, 7, 16, 17, and 20 in the N-terminal extracellular region were changed to Ala showed almost complete loss of ∼45-kDa band (Fig. 2D, upper panel). This TS-AA mutant maintained 14-3-3 binding (Fig. 2D, lower panel), suggesting that these N-terminal mutations at least did not significantly affect receptor folding in the ER. Collectively, these results suggest that GPR15 undergoes O-glycosylation on its N-terminal Ser and/or Thr residues in the Golgi, and this process is facilitated by 14-3-3 binding. A comparative analysis of immunoprecipitated GPR15 proteins from the whole cell lysate and the cell surface pool shows that the O-glycosylated mature form is enriched on the cell surface (Fig. 2E, upper panel). The presence of 14-3-3 proteins in this cell surface IP eluate (Fig. 2E, lower panel) indicates that 14-3-3 proteins is in complex with GPR15 proteins that were delivered to cell surface. To further investigate the role of 14-3-3 in the early secretory pathway, we performed immunofluorescence staining in Hela cells transfected with GPR15. The surface staining of unpermeabilized cells (Fig. 2F) shows much higher signal of Wt GPR15 on the plasma membrane than S359A mutant, consistent with the FCM results (Fig. 1). When stained for the intracellular localization in permeabilized cells (Fig. 2G), Wt GPR15 was mostly observed in the intracellular compartments that co-localized with markers for cis-Golgi (GM130) and trans-Golgi (p230) as well as in the plasma membrane. In contrast, S359A mutant showed less co-localization with Golgi markers and appeared to be more co-localized with the ER marker (calnexin) than Wt GPR15 did. Collectively, our data support the notion that 14-3-3 binding promotes the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of GPR15 and this leads to the enhanced surface expression of this receptor. How does 14-3-3 binding promote ER-to-Golgi transport of GPR15? Because a stretch of Arg residues (RXR motif) is known to mediate Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport of various membrane proteins (8Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7014-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we tested if the C-terminal Arg-containing sequence of GPR15 possesses the ER localization activity. Truncation of the last two residues (Ser359 and Leu360) substantially reduced the surface expression (Fig. 3, A and C, GPR15Δ358), consistent with the loss of Ser359-dependent 14-3-3 binding (Fig. 3B, lower panel). However, further removal of upstream amino acids (GPR15Δ354 and GPR15Δ351) restored the efficient surface expression (Fig. 3, A and C) and O-glycosylation (Fig. 3, B and C) despite the absence of 14-3-3 binding. These results suggested that C-terminal tail of GPR15 contains the ER localization activity that functions in the absence of 14-3-3 binding. To further test this possibility, we fused GPR15 C-terminal sequence to CD8, a heavily O-glycosylated surface membrane protein (31Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fusion of GPR15S359A tail sequence (CD8-RRRKRSVAL) abolished the cell surface expression, as determined by FCM (Fig. 3D) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3E, unpermeabilized cells). The loss of surface expression in CD8-RRRKRSVAL was consistent with its substantial co-localization with the ER marker (Fig. 3E, permeabilized cells) and the total absence of O-glycosylated mature form (Fig. 3F, upper panel). In contrast, CD8 fused with Wt GPR15 tail (CD8-RRRKRSVSL) showed robust surface expression (Fig. 3D), less localization in the ER (Fig. 3E), and detectable O-glycosylation (Fig. 3F, upper panel). Importantly, this CD8 fusion showed strong interaction with 14-3-3 (Fig. 3F, lower panel). Together, these results demonstrate that GPR15 C terminus has the ER localization activity which functions in the absence of Ser359-dependent 14-3-3 binding. To further define the responsible residues for 14-3-3 binding, we created more Ala mutants and examined for their surface expression and 14-3-3 binding. Other than the Ser359, the mutation of Arg356 caused most drastic reduction of surface expression (Fig. 4, A and B) and complete loss of 14-3-3 association (Fig. 4C). This was consistent with our earlier finding that the minimal component of C-terminal mode III 14-3-3 binding motif is RXX(S/T)X-COOH (22Coblitz B. Shikano S. Wu M. Gabelli S.B. Cockrell L.M. Spieker M. Hanyu Y. Fu H. Amzel L.M. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36263-36272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutation of Arg354, which constitutes an Akt consensus motif RXRXXS/T together with Arg356, showed detectable but less effect on 14-3-3 binding. Thus, Arg356 and Ser359 seem to be the most critical components of 14-3-3 binding activity within the C-terminal 9 amino acids of GPR15. However, the higher surface expression of S356A compared with that of S359A in spite that both mutants completely lack 14-3-3 binding suggests that Arg356 may be also a component of the ER localization signal. It is interesting to note that all of the Ala mutations in amino acids 352–355, particularly R352A and R354A, showed higher surface expression and more efficient O-glycosylation than those of Wt without detectable increase of 14-3-3 binding. This is similar to the phenotype observed for the truncation mutant Δ351 in Fig. 3. These results indicate that in the Wt GPR15-transfected HEK293 cells, not all the GPR15 receptors are released from the ER localization pathway, probably due to the incomplete 14-3-3 binding in the basal condition. This is consistent with our previous observation that PI3K pathway activation can enhance 14-3-3 binding and surface expression of Wt GPR15 in HEK293 cells (19Chung J.J. Okamoto Y. Coblitz B. Li M. Qiu Y. Shikano S. Febs. J. 2009; 276: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another point to note is that the V358A mutant showed substantially higher 14-3-3 binding and surface expression than Wt did (Fig. 4). This indicates that Ala in 358 position is favored for kinase recognition and/or 14-3-3 binding. Indeed, a recent bioinformatic study shows that Ala is the most represented residue in the −1 position relative to phospho-Ser/Thr (corresponds to Ser359 of GPR15) in all the known 14-3-3 binding sites of mammalian proteins (32Johnson C. Crowther S. Stafford M.J. Campbell D.G. Toth R. Mackintosh C. Biochem. J. 2010; 427: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We then created additional mutations in the context of S359A to define the residues involved in the ER localization activity. Among those double Ala mutants, R354A/S359A and R352A/S359A showed most effective restoration of surface expression (Fig. 5A). Other mutations at Arg356, Lys355, or Arg353 in the context of S359A were less effective but still showed detectable restoration. These results indicate that Arg354 and Arg352 are most important but Arg356, Lys355, and Arg353 are also involved in the ER localization activity that is functional in the absence of 14-3-3 binding. Because an RXR motif has been reported to mediate retrograde transport by the interaction with COPI complex (14Zuzarte M. Heusser K. Renigunta V. Schlichthörl G. Rinné S. Wischmeyer E. Daut J.

https://openalex.org/W2021428453,"In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the Src-coupled α1 Na/K-ATPase works as a receptor for cardiotonic steroids, such as ouabain, to regulate cellular protein kinase cascades. Here, we explore further the structural determinants of the interaction between the α1 Na/K-ATPase and Src and demonstrate that the Src-coupled α1 Na/K-ATPase allows the cell to decode the transmembrane transport activity of the Na/K-ATPase to turn on/off protein kinases. The α1 Na/K-ATPase undergoes E1/E2 conformational transition during an ion pumping cycle. The amount of E1 and E2 Na/K-ATPase is regulated by extracellular K(+) and intracellular Na(+). Using purified enzyme preparations we find that the E1 Na/K-ATPase can bind both the Src SH2 and kinase domains simultaneously and keep Src in an inactive state. Conversely, the E1 to E2 transition releases the kinase domain and activates the associated Src. Moreover, we demonstrate that changes in E1/E2 Na/K-ATPase by either Na(+) or K(+) are capable of regulating Src and Src effectors in live cells. Together, the data suggest that the Src-coupled α1 Na/K-ATPase may act as a Na(+)/K(+) receptor, allowing salt to regulate cellular function through Src and Src effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1968027480,"The innate immune system elicits the first wave of immune responses against pathogen infection. Its operational modes are complex and have yet to be defined. Here, we report the identification of an innate immune regulator termed TAPE (TBK1-associated protein in endolysosomes), previously known as CC2D1A/Freud-1/Aki-1, which modulates the TLR3 and TLR4 pathways. We found that TAPE activated the TBK1, NF-κB, and ERK pathways leading to IFN-β and inflammatory cytokine induction. TAPE was shown to colocalize with endosomal marker Rab5 and lysosomal marker LAMP1 in mammalian cells, suggesting that TAPE resided in endolysosomes. Knockdown of TAPE selectively impaired the TLR3 and endocytic TLR4 pathways to IFN-β induction. Furthermore, TAPE interacted and synergized with Trif to activate IFN-β. TAPE knockdown failed to block Trif-mediated IFN-β induction, whereas Trif knockdown impaired the TLR3 and TAPE cooperation on IFN-β induction, suggesting that TAPE acts upstream of Trif. Together, our data demonstrate a central role for TAPE in linking TLR3 and TLR4 to innate immune defenses at an early step."
https://openalex.org/W1968755198,"Bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3) peptides are potent cancer therapeutic reagents that target regulators of apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. However, their cytotoxic effects are affected by different expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins. We recently found that the amphipathic tail-anchoring peptide (ATAP) from Bfl-1, a bifunctional Bcl-2 family member, produced strong pro-apoptotic activity by permeabilizing the mitochondrial outer membrane. Here, we test whether the activity of ATAP requires other cellular factors and whether ATAP has an advantage over the BH3 peptides in targeting cancer cells. Confocal microscopic imaging illustrates specific targeting of ATAP to mitochondria, whereas BH3 peptides show diffuse patterns of cytosolic distribution. Although the pro-apoptotic activities of BH3 peptides are largely inhibited by either overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL or nullification of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak in cells, the pro-apoptotic function of ATAP is not affected by these cellular factors. Reconstitution of synthetic ATAP into liposomal membranes results in release of fluorescent molecules of the size of cytochrome c from the liposomes, suggesting that the membrane permeabilizing activity of ATAP does not require additional protein factors. Because ATAP can target to the mitochondrial membrane and its pro-apoptotic activity does not depend on the content of Bcl-2 family proteins, it represents a promising candidate for anti-cancer drugs that can potentially overcome the intrinsic apoptosis-resistant nature of cancer cells.

In addition, the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3 peptides and their mimetics was dependent on other cellular factors as the activity was abrogated in the absence of Bax and Bak (19Letai A. Bassik M.C.

The down-regulation of pro-apoptotic and/or the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is commonly observed in cancer cells and often causes resistance to BH3 peptide-induced cell death, and thus the application of BH3 peptides and their mimetics in cancer therapy may be limited by these intrinsic cellular factors. Previously, we reported that ATAP, a novel amphipathic tail-anchoring peptide of Bfl-1 (amino acids 147–175), targeted specifically to mitochondria and triggered potent apoptotic cell death in the absence of Bax and Bak (35Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Synthetic ATAP increased the permeability of lipid bilayer membranes and induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Thus, ATAP represents a unique pro-apoptotic peptide with a potential as a therapeutic agent for treatment of cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of ATAP action at mitochondria and in cells requires further elucidation. In particular, it is important to determine whether ATAP can form the cytochrome c-releasing pore in the MOM in the absence of other cellular proteins and whether the pro-apoptotic activity of ATAP is sensitive to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. It is also of interest to determine the relative efficacy of ATAP compared with BH3 peptides. In this study, we analyzed the pore forming activity ATAP in a MOM-mimicking liposomal membrane and its pro-apoptotic activity in cancer cells, and we compared the activities of ATAP and BH3 peptides in these systems. We found that ATAP, unlike BH3 peptides, formed large pores in the liposomal membrane in the absence of any other proteins and induced apoptosis in cells in a Bax/Bak-independent and Bcl-2-insensitive manner. These results suggest that ATAP is potentially a better therapeutic lead for cancer treatment than BH3 peptides and mimetics, as it can bypass the resistance mechanism resulting from dysregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins in cancer cells. Plasmids pFLAG-Bcl-xL and pcDNA-Bcl-2 were described previously (36Yang W.S. Ko J.K. Park S.O. Choi H.Y. Kim Y.N. Kim C.W. J. Cell.

To construct pFLAG-Bcl-2, cDNA was amplified using pcDNA-Bcl-2 as template and primers 5′-AAAGAATTCATGGCGCACGCTGGGAGAAC and 5′-AAAGGTACCTCACTTGTGGGACAGATAGGCAC. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and KpnI and then ligated with pFLAG-ATAP (35Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J.

Each paired oligonucleotide contains complementary sequences at the 3′-end (underlined), which were annealed, filled in by PCR, digested with XhoI and BamHI, and then subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1. The digested PCR products were also used to generate pFLAG-Bak BH3, pFLAG-Bid BH3, and pFLAG-Bad BH3 constructs by ligating them with pFLAG-ATAP vector (35Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N.

Cells were transfected with 1 μg (unless specified otherwise) of the indicated expression plasmids using Gene Jammar reagent (Stratagene) and further cultured in the absence or presence of 50 μm pan-caspase inhibitor, QVD-OPH (Enzyme Systems Products). For morphological assessment of apoptotic cell death, cells were plated onto LabTek II chamber slides (Nalgen Nunc International) at densities of 5 × 104 cells per well. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to fixation with 4% formaldehyde. Subsequently, cells were stained with a Vectasheild mounting solution (Vector Laboratories) containing 1 μg/ml DAPI and visualized under an Axiovert 100 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Nuclei with rippled contours and chromatin condensation were considered to represent the apoptotic cell death. Cell viability was measured by DAPI exclusion. After transfection with GFP fusion plasmids, a total of 1 μg/ml DAPI (Molecular Probes) was added to the cell culture. Cells were observed and photographed with a fluorescence microscope at three different fields containing ∼200 GFP-positive cells. GFP and DAPI double-positive cells were counted as dead cells. Quantitative analysis of cell viability was also determined by β-galactosidase reporter assay according to the procedures described previously (35Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W.

Briefly, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of tested plasmid plus 0.1 μg of pCMV-β plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (Sigma). 24 h following transfection, cells were harvested, and β-galactosidase activity was measured using β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). In every experiment, each construct was tested in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least three times. To observe intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins, fixed HeLa cells were used for confocal microscopy. HeLa cells were transfected as described above on LabTek II chamber slides and cultured in the presence of 50 μm QVD-OPH. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde. Cells finally were washed, mounted, and analyzed with a confocal Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 63× objective lens. Image acquisition was performed at room temperature. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, ∼2 × 105 cells cultured in a 35-mm well were transfected with the indicated plasmids in the presence of 50 μm QVD-OPH. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), on ice. Postnuclear lysates were normalized for protein content, precleared with Sepharose 6B (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for at least 2 h at 4 °C on a orbital shaker. Immunoprecipitates were washed with the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. For immunoblotting analysis, 20 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane, which was blocked with 5% skimmed milk, probed with primary antibodies, and visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare). Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody and anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-FLAG 9E10.2 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-mouse HRP antibody was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Total genomic DNA was isolated from cultured BMK-W2 or BMK-D3 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100 ng of purified genomic DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers 5′-GTTTCATCCAGGATCGAGCAGG and 5′-CCTCTGCAGCTCCATATTGCTG for Bax and 5′-CCTATTTAAGAGTGGCATCAGCTG and 5′-CCAACCGCCTCTCTGTGCGATC for Bak. Each primer pair was designed from a single exon sequence to amplify short PCR products of 149 bp for Bax and 181 bp for Bak. PCR products were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. The 29-mer ATAP peptide corresponding to the C terminus of Bfl-1 were synthesized as described previously (35Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The BH3 peptides of Bid (QEDIIRNIAR-HLAQVGDSMDR) and Bad (NLWAAQRYGRELRRMSDEFVDSFKK) were synthesized by Abgent (San Diego) with 99% purity as measured by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 10 mm stock. All phospholipids and lipid analogs were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Fluorescent dye Cascade Blue (CB), CB-labeled dextran of 10 kDa, and rabbit anti-CB polyclonal antibody were obtained from Molecular Probes. Liposomes were made with the Xenopus MOM characteristic lipids in the membrane and fluorescent dye CB-labeled dextran (10 kDa) in the lumen by an extrusion method as described previously (16Tan C. Dlugosz P.J. Peng J. Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Plafker S.M. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14764-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Ni2+-chelating liposomes were prepared similarly except that the Ni2+-chelating lipid analog, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-([N(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid]-succinyl) (nickel salt), was included in the membrane as described previously (15Peng J.

The regular or Ni2+-chelating liposomes (12.5 μm) loaded with CB dextran were mixed with 6 μg/ml anti-CB antibodies in 250 μl of buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 51 mm Na2HPO4, and 3.8 mm citric acid, pH 7.4). The initial emission intensity (F0) was determined after equilibrating the sample at 25 °C for 5 min. ATAP, BH3 peptide, His6-tagged Bcl-2ΔTM, tBid, and/or Bax protein were then added. The first fluorescence intensity measurement was started exactly 20 s after the addition of the peptide, chemical, and/or protein(s) and was followed by multiple measurements in a predetermined time interval for 5 h, resulting in multiple intermediate intensities (F). At the end of the time course, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added, and the final measurement was taken, resulting in the final intensity (Ft). The extent of CB dextran release is proportional to the extent of fluorescence quenching that is equal to ΔFProtein/ΔFTriton, where ΔFProtein = F0 − F and ΔFTriton = F0 − Ft. All fluorescence intensities were measured using the SLM-8100 spectrometer as described previously (16Tan C. Dlugosz P.J. Peng J. Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Plafker S.M. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14764-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Synthetic ATAP (17 μm) was incubated with 1.3 mm regular liposome made with the Xenopus MOM characteristic lipids in 120 μl of buffer A at 22 °C for 1 h. 4 μm BMH (Pierce) was then added to 1 of the 2 aliquots, and the cross-linking reaction was carried out at 22 °C for 30 min and then quenched by 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min. The resulting samples were subjected to a step sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (37Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48935-48941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Top half, bottom half, and pellet fractions were collected, which contain liposome-bound, soluble, and aggregated peptides, respectively. All fractions were precipitated using Cl3CCOOH and analyzed by 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and silver staining. To compare the cellular function of ATAP and BH3 peptides derived from pro-apoptotic proteins Bid, Bad, and Bak, we fused these peptides with GFP and expressed the fusion proteins in HeLa cells for live cell imaging with a confocal microscope (Fig. 1A). Dying cells were observed by staining their nuclei with a cell-impermeable DNA dye, DAPI, to detect late stage apoptotic cells. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, strong pro-apoptotic activity was observed in cells expressing GFP-ATAP or GFP-Bak BH3, as a similar degree of cell death was observed with GFP-ATAP and GFP-Bak BH3 at 24 h after transfection (Fig. 1C). Transient expression of GFP-Bid BH3 and GFP-Bad BH3 also caused apoptosis in HeLa cells, although to a less extent than GFP-ATAP and GFP-Bak BH3 (Fig. 1, B and C). To test if apoptosis induced by these peptides involves activation of caspase, a pan-caspase inhibitor, QVD-OPH, was added to cells during transfection. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, the pro-apoptotic activity of ATAP as well as BH3 peptides was strongly inhibited by treatment with 50 μm QVD-OPH at an early stage of the experiment. At 24 h after transfection, more than 78% of cells expressing GFP-ATAP were alive in the presence of QVD-OPH. A stronger inhibitory effect of QVD-OPH was observed against GFP-BH3 peptides because more than 90% of cells transfected with GFP-BH3 peptides survived by treatment with QVD-OPH. At 48 h after transfection, ∼40% of cells expressing GFP-ATAP underwent apoptosis, whereas more than 80% of cells expressing GFP-Bak BH3 were still alive (Fig. 1D). These results show that ATAP can induce apoptosis by both the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway at an early stage and the caspase-independent pathways at a late stage, whereas BH3 peptides induce apoptosis mainly by activation of the caspase-dependent pathway. When fixed cells were observed by DAPI staining to compare nuclei among transfected cells, most of the cells transiently expressing GFP-ATAP or GFP-Bak BH3 displayed condensed and fragmented chromatin structure, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1E). As fusion with GFP may affect the pro-apoptotic activity of these peptides, we generated FLAG-tagged peptides to test the effect of different tags. The cytotoxic activity of the FLAG peptides was quantified using a β-galactosidase reporter assay 24 h after co-transfection of plasmids encoding β-galactosidase and FLAG peptides in HeLa cells. The decrease in β-galactosidase activity quantitatively reflects the loss of cell viability (35Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J.

Compared with cells co-transfected with the mock plasmid, an ∼60% decrease in β-galactosidase activity was observed in cells transfected with the FLAG-ATAP plasmid, which could be prevented by the addition of QVD-OPH (Fig. 1F).

In contrast to previously cloned NFI-X1, overexpression of NFI-X3 potently activates NFI reporters, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reporter, in astrocytes and glioma cells. The GAL4 fusion protein containing the TA domain of NFI-X3 strongly activates the GAL4 reporter, whereas the TA domain of NFI-X1 is ineffective.

Overexpression of NFI-X3 dramatically up-regulates GFAP and SPARCL1 expression in glioma cells, whereas the knockdown of NFI-X3 diminishes the expression of both GFAP and SPARCL1 in astrocytes.

The Nfia and Nfib knock-out mice are characterized by neuroanatomical defects, including agenesis of the corpus callosum, loss of specific midline glial populations, and a 5–10-fold decrease in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is an astrocyte marker (11Steele-Perkins G.

In addition, Nfib-deficient mice present aberrant hippocampus and pons formation and die due to the defects in lung development (11Steele-Perkins G. Plachez C. Butz K.G. Yang G. Bachurski C.J.

The immature nestin-positive glia populate the hippocampus of Nfib-deficient mice but fail to mature into GFAP-positive astrocytes (22Barry G. Piper M. Lindwall C. Moldrich R. Mason S. Little E.

In contrast, disruption of the Nfic gene results in early postnatal defects in tooth formation, including the loss of molar roots and aberrant incisor development (23Steele-Perkins G. Butz K.G.

The Nfix knock-out mice have recently been generated by two independent groups (24Driller K. Pagenstecher A. Uhl M. Omran H. Berlis A. Gründer A. Sippel A.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3855-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Campbell C.E. Piper M. Plachez C. Yeh Y.T. Baizer J.S. Osinski J.M. Litwack E.D. Richards L.J. Gronostajski R.M. BMC Dev.

The Nfix gene knock-out causes postnatal lethality in most of the animals and leads to hydrocephalus and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum (24Driller K. Pagenstecher A. Uhl M. Omran H. Berlis A. Gründer A. Sippel A.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3855-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These mice also develop a deformation of the spine with kyphosis, due to a delay in ossification of vertebral bodies and a progressive degeneration of intervertebral disks. However, Nfix knock-out mice survive on a soft chow diet but are characterized by increased brain weight, expansion of the brain along the dorsal ventrical axis, and aberrant formation of the hippocampus (25Campbell C.E. Piper M. Plachez C. Yeh Y.T. Baizer J.S. Osinski J.M. Litwack E.D. Richards L.J. Gronostajski R.M. BMC Dev. Biol. 2008; 8: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In summary, the knock-out phenotypes suggest that NFI-A, -B, and -X are important for normal brain development; however, the identity of the affected cell type(s) is not clear. Recently, both NFI-A and -B were shown to regulate gliogenesis in the chick embryo, with NFI-A also controlling the maintenance of neural precursors (27Deneen B. Ho R. Lukaszewicz A. Hochstim C.J. Gronostajski R.M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 2006; 52: 953-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). More recently, NFI-C and -X were shown to regulate the expression of late astrocyte markers during the differentiation of neural precursors into astrocytes in vitro (28Wilczynska K.M. Singh S.K.

Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Alternative splicing is a common mechanism of generating transcription factors with diverse functions in the brain (29Vihma H.

Accordingly, transcripts of all four NFI genes are alternatively spliced, yielding many different proteins from a single gene (33Kruse U. Sippel A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with several different splice variants of NFI-X identified in human cells (35Gründer A. Qian F. Ebel T.T. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Kruse U. Sippel A.E. Gene. 2003; 304: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we cloned and characterized a novel human NFI-X splice variant X3 (NFI-X3), which regulates gene expression in primary human astrocytes. This splice variant contains a unique transcriptional activation (TA) domain that is remarkably conserved in mammals, including mice, rats, dogs, macaques, and humans. Mechanistically, the TA domain of NFI-X3 activates GFAP expression, in part, by inducing alterations in the nucleosome architecture that lead to the increased recruitment of RNA polymerase II.DISCUSSIONIt is apparent that NFIs are critical for the proper development of the brain; nevertheless, the vital target genes regulated by NFIs and the molecular mechanisms of their regulation remain elusive. To date, multiple NFI-responsive genes have been identified in the brain, including the genes encoding GFAP, ACT, SPARCL1, and S100B in astrocytes (28Wilczynska K.M. Singh S.K. Adams B. Bryan L.

Brain Res. 1998; 57: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because regulatory sequences of these genes can bind all NFIs, their transcriptional regulation in a given cell type, in part, depends on the availability of a particular NFI isoform, the presence of the specific splice variant, and probably the acquired post-transcriptional modifications of the NFIs. In fact, NFIs are expressed in complicated patterns during embryogenesis (20Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 51Plachez C. Lindwall C. Sunn N. Piper M. Moldrich R.X. Campbell C.E. Osinski J.M. Gronostajski R.M. Richards L.J. J. Comp.

Anderson D.J. Neuron. 2006; 52: 953-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), whereas NFI-X and NFI-C are expressed later in the differentiation of astrocytes and control the expression of late astrocyte markers (28Wilczynska K.M. Singh S.K. Adams B. Bryan L. Rao R.R. Valerie K. Wright S. Griswold-Prenner I. Kordula T. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NFIs are also phosphorylated, and this modification affects their function (7Bisgrove D.A. Monckton E.A. Packer M. Godbout R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30668-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).To date, the functional importance of the multiple NFI splice variants as well as the mechanisms controlling their generation remain largely unknown. Significantly, the NFI splice variants are evolutionarily conserved in mammals, and their splicing mostly affects the C termini encoding their TA domains, thus suggesting that these variants probably fulfill very specific biological functions (35Gründer A. Qian F. Ebel T.T. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Kruse U. Sippel A.E. Gene. 2003; 304: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In particular, the inclusion of the exon 9 found in the NFI-A, NFI-B, and NFI-C generates a subset of relatively active transcription factors (NFI-A1, NFI-B1, and CTF-1). In contrast to these isoforms, the importance of alternative splicing of the NFI-X transcript was controversial, because Xenopus and mouse splice variants containing exon 9 were reported not to be particularly active (19Roulet E. Armentero M.T. Krey G. Corthésy B. Dreyer C. Mermod N. Wahli W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5552-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 52Nebl G. Cato A.C. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). However, the TA domain of Xenopus NFI-X3 is drastically different from the TA of the X3 variants found in mammals (Fig. 1). Moreover, the repressive properties of the previously cloned mouse NFI-X3 can be attributed to the partial TA domain that lacks 14 C-terminal amino acids (52Nebl G. Cato A.C. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the full-length TA domain of the NFI-X3 splice variant is remarkably conserved in mammals, with 100% identity in primates and dog, and contains 17 conserved proline residues (Fig. 1). These proline residues are probably responsible for the relatively strong activation of both the GFAP and NFI reporters by NFI-X3 in astrocytes and glioma cells (Fig. 3, A and B), activation of GFAP and SPARCL1 expression in differentiating astrocytes (Fig. 5), and activation of GFAP and SPARCL1 expression in cells overexpressing NFI-X3 (Fig. 7). In contrast, NFI-X3Δ, which lacks its proline-rich TA domain, did not activate GFAP and SPARCL1 expression when overexpressed (Fig. 7). The importance of the NFI-X3 TA domain is further supported by the findings that the Gal4-X3TA domain fusion protein efficiently activated Gal4 reporter (Fig. 4), whereas siRNA specific to exon 9 (present in NFI-X3) abolished the activation of GFAP and SPARCL1 expression (Fig. 6). In contrast, NFI-X1 did not activate the GFAP reporter in astrocytes and glioma cells (Fig. 3A), mildly activated the NFI reporter in astrocytes (with approximately 10 times lower efficiency than NFI-X3) (Fig. 3B), and relatively moderately activated SPARCL1 and GFAP expression when stably overexpressed in glioma cells (Fig. 7). Moreover, a fusion protein containing the NFI-X1 TA domain and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain did not activate the Gal4 reporter (Fig. 4). These data suggest that NFI-X3 serves as a strong transcriptional activator, whereas NFI-X1 is either a repressor or a relatively very weak activator. Surprisingly, both NFI-X1 and NFI-X3 repress some genes independently of their TA domains, as observed for the p21 reporter (Fig. 3C) and p21 mRNA in cells overexpressing NFI-X1 and NFI-X3 (data not shown); nevertheless, the mechanism of repression remains to be established. In contrast to the TA domain of NFI-X3, a deletion of 8 amino acids (exon 1A) did not affect NFI-X3 binding to the gfap enhancer (Fig. 8) or the repression of the p21 reporter (Fig. 3C).The question remains as to whether NFI-X3 plays an important biological role. Our data argue that NFI-X3 is mainly responsible for the NFI-X-mediated regulation of GFAP and SPARCL1 expression in primary human astrocytes because the down-regulation of NFI-X3 expression has an identical effect as the down-regulation of expression of the total NFI-X pool (Fig. 6). Although NFI-X3 mRNA accounts for only ∼10% of the NFI-X mRNAs (Fig. 6A), the 10 times stronger activation potential (Fig. 3B) may explain its critical role in gene regulation. Moreover, the expression of NFI-X3 is strongly up-regulated during the differentiation of neural progenitors toward astrocytes and precedes the activation of GFAP and SPARCL1 expression (Fig. 5). Importantly, the ratio of NFI-X3 mRNA/total NFI-X mRNA increases ∼2-fold during the differentiation (Fig. 5). Conversely, this ratio is decreased in various glioma cells, already expressing low levels of all NFI-X transcripts (Fig. 2C), which may be viewed as cells that exited astrocyte differentiation. However, NFI-X3 expression is not restricted to glia because we were also able to detect NFI-X3 mRNA in other non-glial cells (data not shown), thus indicating that NFI-X3 probably regulates transcription in various cell types.Although NFIs were discovered over 2 decades ago (53Nagata K. Guggenheimer R.A. Enomoto T. Lichy J.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of NFI-mediated gene activation still remains elusive. Interestingly, NFIs not only bind to their specific binding elements within the regulatory regions of target genes but also interact with other transcription factors (54Ravichandran V. Sabath B.F. Jensen P.N. Houff S.A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10506-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and histone H3 (55Müller K. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1645-1650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Importantly, NFI-C (CTF-1) binding to histone H3, in part, depends on its TA domain (55Müller K. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1645-1650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NFI-C can also be immunoprecipitated with remodeling complexes containing Brg1 (56Zhao L.H. Ba X.Q. Wang X.G. Zhu X.J. Wang L. Zeng X.L. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2005; 37: 440-446Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that chromatin remodeling may be the mechanism regulating NFI-dependent transcription. Recently, the induction of the c-fos gene by MAPK signaling has been shown to depend on the acetylation relay switch that induces a local change in the nucleosome architecture allowing for NFI binding (57O'Donnell A. Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 780-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, how NFI recruitment increases c-fos expression is not clear. Our data allow us to postulate a novel model of gene activation that depends on the TA domain of NFI-X3. Our data suggest that binding of NFI-X3 (and to a lesser extent NFI-X1) to the gfap enhancer induces changes in the structure/occupancy of the nucleosomes positioned at the promoter of the gfap gene (Fig. 9B). This localized alteration is probably an eviction of the +1 nucleosome from the gfap promoter, which subsequently allows for the increased binding of the general transcription factors and the recruitment of PolII. In summary, our data suggest that NFI-X3 is a critical splice variant of the nfix gene, which regulates expression of late markers, such as GFAP, in astrocytes via a mechanism that depends, in part, on the induction of local alteration in chromatin architecture. IntroductionAstrocytes are critical for the normal functions of the brain but also play a destructive role in many diseases of the central nervous system. Nevertheless, mechanisms controlling their differentiation and astrocyte-specific gene expression are only partially understood. Astrocyte differentiation is promoted by the activation of several signaling pathways, including the JAK-STAT pathway (1Miller F.D. Gauthier A.S.

During the vertebrate embryonic development, neurons are generated first, followed by glia. This neurogenic-to-gliogenic switch is induced by the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in neural precursors by neuron-derived cardiotrophin-1 (2Barnabé-Heider F. Wasylnka J.A.

Specifically, STAT3 induces production of BMP-2, which subsequently activates SMAD1 (3Fukuda S. Abematsu M. Mori H. Yanagisawa M. Kagawa T. Nakashima K. Yoshimura A. Taga T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4931-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In turn, SMAD1 forms a complex with STAT3 and induces astrogliogenesis (14Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N.

These proteins, encoded by four genes highly conserved from chickens to humans (Nfia, Nfib, Nfic, and Nfix), regulate the transcription of various cellular and viral genes as well as viral DNA replication (16Gronostajski R.M.

In vertebrates, products of these genes (NFI-A, -B, -C, and -X) share conserved N-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domains, followed by a subtype-specific domain and a variable C-terminal transactivation domain (19Roulet E.

The Nfia and Nfib knock-out mice are characterized by neuroanatomical defects, including agenesis of the corpus callosum, loss of specific midline glial populations, and a 5–10-fold decrease in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is an astrocyte marker (11Steele-Perkins G.

These mice also develop a deformation of the spine with kyphosis, due to a delay in ossification of vertebral bodies and a progressive degeneration of intervertebral disks. However, Nfix knock-out mice survive on a soft chow diet but are characterized by increased brain weight, expansion of the brain along the dorsal ventrical axis, and aberrant formation of the hippocampus (25Campbell C.E.

In summary, the knock-out phenotypes suggest that NFI-A, -B, and -X are important for normal brain development; however, the identity of the affected cell type(s) is not clear. Recently, both NFI-A and -B were shown to regulate gliogenesis in the chick embryo, with NFI-A also controlling the maintenance of neural precursors (27Deneen B. Ho R. Lukaszewicz A. Hochstim C.J.

Here, we cloned and characterized a novel human NFI-X splice variant X3 (NFI-X3), which regulates gene expression in primary human astrocytes. This splice variant contains a unique transcriptional activation (TA) domain that is remarkably conserved in mammals, including mice, rats, dogs, macaques, and humans. Mechanistically, the TA domain of NFI-X3 activates GFAP expression, in part, by inducing alterations in the nucleosome architecture that lead to the increased recruitment of RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W2005103955,"TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent anti-inflammation property. However, the mechanisms underlying TGF-β1 suppression of inflammation remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 inhibited TNF-α- or IL-1-induced RANTES expression in human kidney tubular epithelial cells (HKC-8). To delineate the mechanism by which TGF-β1 inhibits RANTES expression, we examined the potential signal pathway activated by TGF-β1 in suppressing NF-κB signaling. TGF-β1 affected neither TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, nor p65 NF-κB phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation. However, TGF-β1 could inhibit p65 and p50 binding to the κB site in human RANTES promoter as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and protein-DNA binding assay. We found that TGF-β1 induced glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation on Ser-9 in HKC-8 cells, leading to its inactivation. Knockdown of GSK-3β mimicked TGF-β1 and inhibited RANTES induction, whereas overexpression of GSK-3β abolished the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 and completely restored RANTES expression. Furthermore, TGF-β1 induced the dephosphorylation and activation of β-catenin, a major downstream target of GSK-3β. Ectopic expression of constitutively active β-catenin mimicked the TGF-β1 effect and completely suppressed RANTES expression induced by TNF-α. Interestingly, TGF-β1 induced a physical interaction between β-catenin and p65 NF-κB, which prevented p65 binding to the κB site, sequestered its trans-activating activity, and repressed p65-mediated gene transcription. We conclude that TGF-β1 inhibition of proinflammatory RANTES expression is mediated by β-catenin-triggered blockade of NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2088924735,"Asf1 is a conserved histone H3/H4 chaperone. We find that Asf1 in budding yeast promotes an essential cellular response to replication stress caused by the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea. That is, Asf1 stimulates derepression of DNA damage response (DDR) genes during the S phase. Derepression of DDR genes strongly correlates with Asf1 binding to their promoters. Having identified the C terminus and histone-binding domains of Asf1 as molecular determinants of its constitutive and inducible association with chromatin, we tested whether Asf1 binding to DDR genes is mechanistically important for their derepression. Our results provide little support for this hypothesis. Rather, the contribution of Asf1 to DDR gene derepression depends on its ability to stimulate H3K56 acetylation by lysine acetyltransferase Rtt109. The precise regulation of H3K56 acetylation in the promoters of DDR genes is unexpected: DDR gene promoters are occupied by H3K56-acetylated nucleosomes under repressing conditions, and the steady state level of H3K56 promoter acetylation does not change upon derepression. We propose that replication-coupled deposition of Lys(56)-acetylated H3 poises the DDR genes in newly synthesized daughter duplexes for derepression during the S phase. In this model, the presence of a histone mark that destabilizes nucleosomes is compatible with suppression of transcription because in the uninduced state, DDR gene promoters are constitutively occupied by a potent repressor-corepressor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2017265940,"Currently, pharmacogenetic studies are at an impasse as the low prevalence (<2%) of most variants hinder their pharmacogenetic analysis with population sizes often inadequate for sufficiently powered studies. Grouping rare mutations by functional phenotype rather than mutation site can potentially increase sample size. Using human population-based studies (n = 1,761) to search for dysfunctional human prostacyclin receptor (hIP) variants, we recently discovered 18 non-synonymous mutations, all with frequencies less than 2% in our study cohort. Eight of the 18 had defects in binding, activation, and/or protein stability/folding. Mutations (M113T, L104R, and R279C) in three highly conserved positions demonstrated severe misfolding manifested by impaired binding and activation of cell surface receptors. To assess for association with coronary artery disease, we performed a case-control study comparing coronary angiographic results from patients with reduced cAMP production arising from the non-synonymous mutations (n = 23) with patients with non-synonymous mutations that had no reduction in cAMP (n = 17). Major coronary artery obstruction was significantly increased in the dysfunctional mutation group in comparison with the silent mutations. We then compared the 23 dysfunctional receptor patients with 69 age- and risk factor-matched controls (1:3). This verified the significantly increased coronary disease in the non-synonymous dysfunctional variant cohort. This study demonstrates the potential utility of in vitro functional characterization in predicting clinical phenotypes and represents the most comprehensive characterization of human prostacyclin receptor genetic variants to date."

Mutation of STR1 alone resulted in a shrunken seed phenotype, although growth and development of vegetative and reproductive organs were not affected. The shrunken seed phenotype was associated with the delayed/arrested embryo development, in most cases, at the heart stage. The embryo defect of str1 mutant is not fully penetrant.

Partially shrunken seeds that contained viable embryos could still germinate. However, cotyledons of the seedlings from such seeds were abnormal. An STR1-GUS fusion reporter revealed that the STR1 gene was universally expressed, with high levels of expression in specific tissues/organs including embryos. The incomplete penetrance of str1 embryo/seed phenotype is a result of functional STR2. Single str2 mutant had no phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2023491408,"DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a DNA repair enzyme and plays an important role in determining the molecular fate of the rAAV genome. However, the effect this cellular enzyme on rAAV DNA replication remains elusive.In the present study, we characterized the roles of DNA-PK on recombinant adeno-associated virus DNA replication. Inhibition of DNA-PK by a DNA-PK inhibitor or siRNA targeting DNA-PKcs significantly decreased replication of AAV in MO59K and 293 cells. Southern blot analysis showed that replicated rAAV DNA formed head-to-head or tail-to-tail junctions. The head-to-tail junction was low or undetectable suggesting AAV-ITR self-priming is the major mechanism for rAAV DNA replication. In an in vitro replication assay, anti-Ku80 antibody strongly inhibited rAAV replication, while anti-Ku70 antibody moderately decreased rAAV replication. Similarly, when Ku heterodimer (Ku70/80) was depleted, less replicated rAAV DNA were detected. Finally, we showed that AAV-ITRs directly interacted with Ku proteins.Collectively, our results showed that that DNA-PK enhances rAAV replication through the interaction of Ku proteins and AAV-ITRs."

https://openalex.org/W1996332621,"The bacteriophage P1-encoded Ref protein enhances RecA-dependent recombination in vivo by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that Ref is a new type of enzyme; that is, a RecA-dependent nuclease. Ref binds to ss- and dsDNA but does not cleave any DNA substrate until RecA protein and ATP are added to form RecA nucleoprotein filaments. Ref cleaves only where RecA protein is bound. RecA functions as a co-nuclease in the Ref/RecA system. Ref nuclease activity can be limited to the targeted strands of short RecA-containing D-loops. The result is a uniquely programmable endonuclease activity, producing targeted double-strand breaks at any chosen DNA sequence in an oligonucleotide-directed fashion. We present evidence indicating that cleavage occurs in the RecA filament groove. The structure of the Ref protein has been determined to 1.4 Å resolution. The core structure, consisting of residues 77-186, consists of a central 2-stranded β-hairpin that is sandwiched between several α-helical and extended loop elements. The N-terminal 76 amino acid residues are disordered; this flexible region is required for optimal activity. The overall structure of Ref, including several putative active site histidine residues, defines a new subclass of HNH-family nucleases. We propose that enhancement of recombination by Ref reflects the introduction of directed, recombinogenic double-strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2006344528,"Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-induced reduction in ligand binding affinity (negative cooperativity) requires TSH receptor (TSHR) homodimerization, the latter involving primarily the transmembrane domain (TMD) but with the extracellular domain (ECD) also contributing to this association. To test the role of the TMD in negative cooperativity, we studied the TSHR ECD tethered to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that multimerizes despite the absence of the TMD. Using the infinite ligand dilution approach, we confirmed that TSH increased the rate of dissociation (k(off)) of prebound (125)I-TSH from CHO cells expressing the TSH holoreceptor. Such negative cooperativity did not occur with TSHR ECD-GPI-expressing cells. However, even in the absence of added TSH, (125)I-TSH dissociated much more rapidly from the TSHR ECD-GPI than from the TSH holoreceptor. This phenomenon, suggesting a lower TSH affinity for the former, was surprising because both the TSHR ECD and TSH holoreceptor contain the entire TSH-binding site, and the TSH binding affinities for both receptor forms should, theoretically, be identical. In ligand competition studies, we observed that the TSH binding affinity for the TSHR ECD-GPI was significantly lower than that for the TSH holoreceptor. Further evidence for a difference in ligand binding kinetics for the TSH holoreceptor and TSHR ECD-GPI was obtained upon comparison of the TSH K(d) values for these two receptor forms at 4 °C versus room temperature. Our data provide the first evidence that the wild-type TSHR TMD influences ligand binding affinity for the ECD, possibly by altering the conformation of the closely associated hinge region that contributes to the TSH-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2094232409,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that make reliable decisions should have design features to cope with random fluctuations in the levels or activities of biological molecules. The phage GRN makes a lysis-lysogeny decision informed by the number of phages infecting the cell. To analyse the design of decision making GRNs, we generated random in silico GRNs comprised of two or three transcriptional regulators and selected those able to perform a -like decision in the presence of noise. Various two-protein networks analogous to the CI-Cro GRN worked in noise-less conditions but failed when noise was introduced. Adding a CII-like protein significantly improved robustness to noise. CII relieves the CI-like protein of its ‘decider’ function, allowing CI to be optimized as a decision ‘maintainer’. CII's lysogenic decider function was improved by its instability and rapid removal once the decision was taken, preventing its interference with maintenance. A more reliable decision also resulted from simulated co-transcription of the genes for CII and the Cro-like protein, which correlates fluctuations in these opposing decider functions and makes their ratio less noisy. Thus, the decision network contains design features for reducing and resisting noise."
https://openalex.org/W2108571934,"Copper is essential for aerobic life, but many aspects of its cellular uptake and distribution remain to be fully elucidated. A genome-wide screen for copper homeostasis genes in Drosophila melanogaster identified the SNARE gene Syntaxin 5 (Syx5) as playing an important role in copper regulation; flies heterozygous for a null mutation in Syx5 display increased tolerance to high dietary copper. The phenotype is shown here to be due to a decrease in copper accumulation, a mechanism also observed in both Drosophila and human cell lines. Studies in adult Drosophila tissue suggest that very low levels of Syx5 result in neuronal defects and lethality, and increased levels also generate neuronal defects. In contrast, mild suppression generates a phenotype typical of copper-deficiency in viable, fertile flies and is exacerbated by co-suppression of the copper uptake gene Ctr1A. Reduced copper uptake appears to be due to reduced levels at the plasma membrane of the copper uptake transporter, Ctr1. Thus Syx5 plays an essential role in copper homeostasis and is a candidate gene for copper-related disease in humans."

The informed consent was provided and documented in in-patients by trained and instructed physicians the day before CA. In contrast, out-patients received standard information by different not trained physicians, who did not know about this investigation. All patients had to sign a form stating that enough information had been given and all questions had been answered sufficiently. One hour before CA an assessment of the patients' knowledge about CA was performed using a standard point-by-point questionnaire by another independent physician. The supplied information was composed of 12 potential complications, 3 general, 4 periprocedural and 4 procedural aspects. 95% of the patients felt that they had been well and sufficiently informed. Less than half of the potential complications could be remembered by the patients and more patients could remember less serious than life-threatening complications (27.9±8.8% vs. 47.1±11.0%; p<0.001). Even obvious complications like local bleeding could not be remembered by 35% of in-patients and 36% of out-patients (p = 0.87).

https://openalex.org/W2039648309,"Protease inhibitors play a decisive role in maintaining homeostasis and eliciting antimicrobial activities. Invertebrates like the horseshoe crab have developed unique modalities with serine protease inhibitors to detect and respond to microbial and host proteases. Two isoforms of an immunomodulatory two-domain Kazal-like serine protease inhibitor, CrSPI-1 and CrSPI-2, have been recently identified in the hepatopancreas of the horseshoe crab, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda. Full length and domain 2 of CrSPI-1 display powerful inhibitory activities against subtilisin. However, the structure and function of CrSPI-1 domain-1 (D1) remain unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of CrSPI-1-D1 refined up to 2.0 Å resolution. Despite the close structural homology of CrSPI-1-D1 to rhodniin-D1 (a known thrombin inhibitor), the CrSPI-1-D1 does not inhibit thrombin. This prompted us to modify the selectivity of CrSPI-1-D1 specifically towards thrombin. We illustrate the use of structural information of CrSPI-1-D1 to modify this domain into a potent thrombin inhibitor with IC(50) of 26.3 nM. In addition, these studies demonstrate that, besides the rigid conformation of the reactive site loop of the inhibitor, the sequence is the most important determinant of the specificity of the inhibitor. This study will lead to the significant application to modify a multi-domain inhibitor protein to target several proteases."
