https://openalex.org/W2141135018,"The role of the world's forests as a “sink” for atmospheric carbon dioxide is the subject of active debate. Long-term monitoring of plots in mature humid tropical forests concentrated in South America revealed that biomass gain by tree growth exceeded losses from tree death in 38 of 50 Neotropical sites. These forest plots have accumulated 0.71 ton, plus or minus 0.34 ton, of carbon per hectare per year in recent decades. The data suggest that Neotropical forests may be a significant carbon sink, reducing the rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2133933578,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide increased at a rate of 2.8 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year-1) during 1988 to 1992 (1 Pg = 10(15) grams). Given estimates of fossil carbon dioxide emissions, and net oceanic uptake, this implies a global terrestrial uptake of 1.0 to 2. 2 Pg C year-1. The spatial distribution of the terrestrial carbon dioxide uptake is estimated by means of the observed spatial patterns of the greatly increased atmospheric carbon dioxide data set available from 1988 onward, together with two atmospheric transport models, two estimates of the sea-air flux, and an estimate of the spatial distribution of fossil carbon dioxide emissions. North America is the best constrained continent, with a mean uptake of 1.7 +/- 0.5 Pg C year-1, mostly south of 51 degrees north. Eurasia-North Africa is relatively weakly constrained, with a mean uptake of 0.1 +/- 0.6 Pg C year-1. The rest of the world's land surface is poorly constrained, with a mean source of 0.2 +/- 0.9 Pg C year-1."

https://openalex.org/W2041151913,"The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) in surface waters and related atmospheric exchanges were measured in nine European estuaries. Averaged fluxes over the entire estuaries are usually in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mole of CO 2 per square meter per day. For wide estuaries, net daily fluxes to the atmosphere amount to several hundred tons of carbon (up to 790 tons of carbon per day in the Scheldt estuary). European estuaries emit between 30 and 60 million tons of carbon per year to the atmosphere, representing 5 to 10% of present anthropogenic CO 2 emissions for Western Europe."

https://openalex.org/W2054224846,"Carefully selected ice core data from Greenland can be used to reconstruct an annual proxy North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) index. This index for the past 350 years indicates that the NAO is an intermittent climate oscillation with temporally active (coherent) and passive (incoherent) phases. No indication for a single, persistent, multiannual NAO frequency is found. In active phases, most of the energy is located in the frequency band with periods less than about 15 years. In addition, variability on time scales of 80 to 90 years has been observed since the mid-19th century."

If the variability of snowfall observed in Antarctic ice cores is allowed for, the mass imbalance of the interior this century is only −0.06 ± 0.08 of the mean mass accumulation rate."

https://openalex.org/W1639840249,"Mathematically, three-dimensional space can be represented differently by the cartesian, polar, and other coordinate systems. However, in physical sciences, the choice of representation system is restricted by the need to simplify a machine's computation while enhancing its efficiency1. Does the brain, for the same reasons, ‘select’ the most cost-efficient way to represent the three-dimensional location of objects? As we frequentlyinteract with objects on the common ground surface, it might be beneficial for the visual system to code an object's location using a ground-surface-based reference frame2. More precisely, the brain could use a quasi-two-dimensional coordinate system (x s, y s) with respect to the ground surface (s), rather than a strictly three-dimensional coordinate system (x, y, z), thus reducing coding redundancy and simplifying computations2,3,4,5. Here we provide support for this view by studying human psychophysical performance in perceiving absolute distance and in visually directed action tasks6,7,8,9,10,11. For example, when an object was seen on a continuous, homogeneous texture ground surface, the observer judged the distance to the object accurately. However, when similar surface information was unavailable, for example, when the object was seen across a gap in the ground, or across distinct texture regions, distance judgement was impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2038460600,"The cause of Northern Hemisphere glaciation about 3 million years ago remains uncertain. Closing the Panamanian Isthmus increased thermohaline circulation and enhanced moisture supply to high latitudes, but the accompanying heat would have inhibited ice growth. One possible solution is that enhanced moisture transported to Eurasia also enhanced freshwater delivery to the Arctic via Siberian rivers. Freshwater input to the Arctic would facilitate sea ice formation, increase the albedo, and isolate the high heat capacity of the ocean from the atmosphere. It would also act as a negative feedback on the efficiency of the “conveyor belt” heat pump."
https://openalex.org/W2089540661,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent T cell clone CTLL-2 underwent apoptosis by deprivation of IL-2 from culture medium. The decrease in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL protein level was observed during apoptosis after IL-2 withdrawal. We found that Bcl-XL protein was cleaved to produce two 18 kDa fragments during CTLL-2 cell apoptosis. When the activation of caspases was suppressed by overexpressing human Bcl-2 protein or by the addition of caspase inhibitors, cleavage of Bcl-XL protein was suppressed in vivo. Bcl-XL protein cleavage by incubation with apoptosed CTLL-2 cell lysate was suppressed by the caspase-3/CPP32-specific tetrapeptide inhibitor in vitro. Therefore, caspase-3/CPP32-like proteases were activated and involved in the cleavage of Bcl-XL protein during CTLL-2 cell apoptosis. We found that Bcl-XL protein was cleaved by caspase-3/CPP32 at two sites in the loop domain (i.e., HLAD61/S and SSLD76/A). The transfection of the carboxy-terminal 18 kDa Bcl-XL fragment increased the sensitivity to apoptosis. These results indicate that caspase-3/CPP32-like proteases cleaved anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL protein and resulted in accelerated apoptotic cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2033526246,"Single two-dimensional (2D) atomically thick magnetic particles of cobalt and iron with variable size and shape were fabricated by combining a mask technique with standard molecular beam epitaxy. Reduction of the lateral size of in-plane magnetized 2D cobalt films down to about 100 nanometers did not essentially modify their magnetic properties; although the separation of boundaries decreased greatly, neither domain penetrated the particle, nor was any sizable shape anisotropy observed. The mutual interaction of 2D cobalt particles was negligible, and the magnetic state of a single particle could be switched without modifying the state of the neighbors. Perpendicularly magnetized iron particles did not exhibit such responses. These results suggest that only a few atoms forming a 2D in-plane magnetized dot may provide a stable elementary bit for nanorecording."

https://openalex.org/W2026539870,"Gene therapy is usually reserved for severe and medically refractory disorders because of the toxicity, potential long-term risks and invasiveness of most gene transfer protocols. Here we show that an orally administered adeno-associated viral vector leads to persistent expression of a ß-galactosidase transgene in both gut epithelial and lamina propria cells, and that this approach results in long-term phenotypic recovery in an animal model of lactose intolerance. A gene 'pill' associated with highly efficient and stable gene expression might be a practical and cost-effective strategy for even relatively mild disorders, such as lactase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2011683291,"As a consequence of a reciprocal translocation t(17;22)(q22;q13) and of supernumerary ring chromosomes derived from the t(17;22), a fusion between the platelet-derived growth factor b-chain (PDGF, c-sis proto-oncogene) and the collagen type 1A1 (COL1A1) genes has been recently described in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DP), an infiltrating skin tumor (). Although PDGFB has been implicated in transforming processes via autocrine and paracrine pathways, by the activation of the cognate receptor, no direct evidence of its involvement in neoplastic transformation of human tumours has been so far provided. In this report, we have tested the DNA from four DPs in the classical DNA transfection assay onto NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line. All the DNAs induced the formation of transformed foci in the transfected cultures whose derived cell lines were shown to contain a fused sequence comprising the human COL1A1 and PDGF genes. The relative breakpoint regions have been sequenced revealing that this gene fusion deleted exon 1 of PDGF and released the growth factor from its normal regulation. All the biochemical and biological assays were consistent with the model of an autocrine mechanism for NIH3T3 transformation by the human rearranged PDGFB gene involving the activation of the endogeneous PDGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2312710045,"The 'high risk' human papillomaviruses are associated with the development of anogenital carcinomas and their E6 and E7 genes possess immortalizing and transforming functions in several in vitro culture systems. Recently the E6 gene has also been shown to enhance the apoptosis of human mammary epithelial cells. To determine the apoptotic activity of these oncogenes in the natural host cell, we infected genital keratinocytes with retroviruses expressing either HPV-16 E6, E7, or both the E6 and E7 (E6/7) genes. Apoptosis was quantitated under normal growth conditions or when induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha/cycloheximide or sulfur mustard. In contrast to previous findings with mammary epithelial cells, the E6 gene did not significantly augment either spontaneous or induced apoptosis. E6 also did not suppress apoptosis in normal keratinocytes (despite dramatically reducing their p53 levels), suggesting that p53-independent events mediated this effect. In contrast, E7 increased both spontaneous and induced apoptosis as well as the cellular levels of p53 and p21 protein. Interestingly, co-expression of E6 abrogated E7-facilitated apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor alpha nearly completely, but had only a minor protective effect on sulfur mustard induced apoptosis in these cells, demonstrating at least in part the p53-dependence and -independence of these two apoptotic pathways. Finally, our results indicate that the apoptosis of normal and E7-expressing keratinocytes is differentially affected by E6 expression and that E7, when unaccompanied by E6, sensitizes keratinocytes to apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2322349519,"Members of both the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase and BCL2 gene families, acting in concert with other gene products, are involved in the regulation of cell viability. However, the relationship between these families, and the signal transduction networks that control viability-regulating genes, are only beginning to be elucidated. MCL1 is a viability-promoting member of the BCL2 family that exhibits a rapid increase in expression in response to specific differentiation- and apoptosis-inducing stimuli. The signal transduction pathway involved in eliciting this increase has now been investigated. In the ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, a rapid and sustained increase in phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) members of the MAP kinase family was found to precede the increase in MCL1 expression produced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or the microtubule-disrupting agents colchicine and vinblastine. ERK activation was necessary for the increase in MCL1, as inhibition of the increase in ERK phosphorylation (with the inhibitor PD 98059) prevented the increase in MCL1 expression and caused rapid cell death by apoptosis. In addition, other agents that markedly increased ERK phosphorylation (lipopolysaccharide, okadaic acid) also increased MCL1 expression. In contrast, agents that did not have this marked effect did not increase MCL1. Upstream components in this ERK-mediated pathway were also identified, where the pathway was found to be stimulated by microtubule disruption acting through protein kinase C (PKC). These results indicate that expression of the MCL1 viability-enhancing gene is regulated through a cytoskeletal disruption-induced ERK-mediated signal transduction pathway. They therefore suggest a mechanism through which the cytoskeleton and MAP kinases can exert effects on cell viability."

https://openalex.org/W2318258851,"Interleukin-1α (IL-1α) is a multifunctional cytokine that promotes inflammation, tissue remodeling and epithelial hyperplasia. Keratinocytes produce and sequester large amounts of biologically active IL-1α which can be released after injury or infection. We show that high level expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins enhanced release of IL-1α from cultures of normal cervical keratinocytes (relative effectiveness E7>E6/E7≫E6> control). The amount of IL-1α released was directly related to the ability of E7 or E6/E7 to stimulate apoptosis. E7 proteins that bound the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) strongly (HPV-16 and -18) induced more IL-1α release than those that bound poorly (HPV-6 and an HPV-16 E7 24gly mutant). Furthermore, overexpression of the E2F-1 transcription factor, a downstream target of Rb, induced extensive apoptosis and IL-1α release. Apoptosis and IL-1α release in response to growth factor removal occurred in part through a p53-independent pathway as coexpression of E6 and downregulation of p53 did not prevent either response. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that IL-1α was expressed by keratinocytes in normal cervical epithelia, low and high grade dysplasias, and cervical carcinomas. However, HPV-16 E6/E7 RNA expression and apoptosis increased in parallel in proliferating keratinocytes in severe dysplasias and carcinomas suggesting that IL-1α release is associated with progression to high grade disease. Thus, high level expression of the HPV-16 E7 protein sensitizes keratinocytes to apoptosis which results in release of IL-1α."

https://openalex.org/W2315339369,"The expression of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-1, is induced both in keratinocytes and in fibroblasts during development and tissue regeneration. Here we report that in keratinocytes the syndecan-1 gene was stimulated by EGF but not by FGF-2. In fibroblasts it was stimulated by FGF-2 but not by EGF. Likewise, the recently discovered FGF-inducible response element (FiRE) on the gene of syndecan-1 was stimulated by FGF-2 in fibroblasts and by EGF in keratinocytes, but not vice versa. The FiRE has two binding sites for an activator protein-1 (AP-1), one for an FGF-inducible nuclear factor (FIN-1) and one for an upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1). The growth factor-stimulated binding of these transcription factors, as well as their requirement for FiRE activation, varied between the two cell types. First, although AP-1s were required for activation of FiRE in both cell types, the binding of AP-1 to FiRE was increased by growth factor-stimulation only in fibroblasts and not in keratinocytes. Secondly, FiRE did not bind FIN-1 nor needed the FIN-1 binding site for EGF-stimulated activation in keratinocytes, in contrast to the FGF-stimulated activation of FiRE in fibroblasts. Thirdly, EGF, which did not activate FiRE in fibroblasts, failed to activate FIN-1 in these cells. Finally, an USF-1 binding site that was necessary for activation of FiRE in keratinocytes was not needed in fibroblasts. These data suggest mechanisms by which members of the EGF- and FGF-families can differentially stimulate transcription through AP-1 regulated elements in a cell type-specific manner."

https://openalex.org/W2330943477,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBL) constitute an heterogeneous clinico-pathological entity. To characterize molecular events related to histological subtypes, clinical presentation or outcome, we compared the mRNAs expressed in a limited series of DLBL by Differential display-reverse transcription (DDRT) and cloned a differential cDNA, that we called LB1. LB1 open reading frame encodes a 683 amino-acid polypeptide that does not show significant homology upon comparison to protein databases, nor any structural domain relating LB1 to an already known protein family. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected COS cells showed a cytoplasmic filamentous staining, indicating that LB1 protein is tightly associated with cytoskeletal fibers. Two LB1 transcripts, a major 3.6–3.9 Kb and a minor 2.2 Kb transcripts, were detected among human haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic lines and tissues. LB1 transcripts were abundant in testis, thymus and in tumour derived cell lines, while barely detectable in liver, prostate and kidney. Concerning DLBL, LB1 expression was high in two cases of DLBL, and low or undetectable in four others, confirming the differential expression previously observed in the DDRT experiment. Furthermore, LB1 gene mapped to chromosome 13q14, a region that has been involved as a chromosomal breakpoint in DLBL. The cellular function of LB1 and its relationship with B cell maturation and/or oncogenesis remain to be established."
https://openalex.org/W2335248399,"The Wilms' tumour suppressor gene WT1 encodes a zinc finger protein that is mutated in a subset of Wilms' tumours. Mutation screening and animal studies revealed essential roles during development and later function of the kidneys and the entire genitourinary system. Sequence similarity suggested a possible role for WT1 as a transcription factor. Indeed, sequence specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation or repression potential could be demonstrated in transient transfection assays with various reporter constructs. To identify endogenous WT1 target genes we established HEK293 cell lines expressing the different WT1 isoforms in a tetracycline dependent manner. Differential display PCR (ddPCR) was performed on RNA from stable WT1 transfected HEK293 cell lines and two other WT1 transfected lines (G401 and Saos-2). In an extended survey of several thousand ddPCR bands only few differences in intensity were seen and none of these could unambiguously be verified as being WT1 regulated by subsequent Northern blot analysis. In addition, almost none of the WT1 target genes identified to date in transient co-transfection assays could be confirmed by either ddPCR or Northern hybridization in the three stable transfected cell lines. Among the nine genes expressed, the only exceptions were CSF1 and to a lesser extent IGF1R being induced in Saos-2/G401 and HEK293 cells, respectively. At least two of the cell lines tested had previously shown clear biological effects though – either WT1 dependent apoptosis (Saos-2) or greatly reduced tumorigenicity (G401). This suggests that WT1 may regulate only a very small set of genes that escape the detection methods used or it may not act as a transcription factor that influences steady state levels of mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2317768344,"The transforming activity of SV40 large T-antigen (Tag) depends on its binding to cellular proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle (p53, pRb, p300..) and on the J-domain region in the amino-terminus. We established transgenic lines expressing wild-type or Tag mutant proteins lacking one of the three transforming domains, to determine the respective contributions of these domains to hepatic tumour formation. Tag mutants with no pRb-binding domain or N-terminal fragment did not cause neoplastic liver abnormalities. The dl1137 Tag mutant protein, which inhibits pRb function without affecting p53, induced hepatic tumours. These tumours grew significantly faster than those induced by wild-type Tag. Our results demonstrate different requirements for each of the inactivating functions of SV40 Tag in hepatocyte transformation and show that the loss of p53 function has only a moderate effect on hepatic tumour formation."
