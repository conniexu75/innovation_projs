https://openalex.org/W2975256032,"We show that Cohen’s Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), both extended and contrasted measures of performance in multi-class classification, are correlated in most situations, albeit can differ in others. Indeed, although in the symmetric case both match, we consider different unbalanced situations in which Kappa exhibits an undesired behaviour, i.e. a worse classifier gets higher Kappa score, differing qualitatively from that of MCC. The debate about the incoherence in the behaviour of Kappa revolves around the convenience, or not, of using a relative metric, which makes the interpretation of its values difficult. We extend these concerns by showing that its pitfalls can go even further. Through experimentation, we present a novel approach to this topic. We carry on a comprehensive study that identifies an scenario in which the contradictory behaviour among MCC and Kappa emerges. Specifically, we find out that when there is a decrease to zero of the entropy of the elements out of the diagonal of the confusion matrix associated to a classifier, the discrepancy between Kappa and MCC rise, pointing to an anomalous performance of the former. We believe that this finding disables Kappa to be used in general as a performance measure to compare classifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2976581810,"The second largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in history is currently raging in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Stubbornly persistent EVD transmission has been associated with social resistance, ranging from passive non-compliance to overt acts of aggression toward EVD reponse teams.We explored community resistance using focus group discussions and assessed the prevalence of resistant views using standardized questionnaires.Despite being generally cooperative and appreciative of the EVD response (led by the government of DRC with support from the international community), focus group participants provided eyewitness accounts of aggressive resistance to control efforts, consistent with recent media reports. Mistrust of EVD response teams was fueled by perceived inadequacies of the response effort (""herd medicine""), suspicion of mercenary motives, and violation of cultural burial mores (""makeshift plastic morgue""). Survey questionnaires found that the majority of respondents had compliant attitudes with respect to EVD control. Nonetheless, 78/630 (12%) respondents believed that EVD was fabricated and did not exist in the area, 482/630 (72%) were dissatisfied with or mistrustful of the EVD response, and 60/630 (9%) sympathized with perpetrators of overt hostility. Furthermore, 102/630 (15%) expressed non-compliant intentions in the case of EVD illness or death in a family member, including hiding from the health authorities, touching the body, or refusing to welcome an official burial team. Denial of the biomedical discourse and dissatisfaction/mistrust of the EVD response were statistically significantly associated with indicators of social resistance.We concluded that social resistance to EVD control efforts was prevalent among focus group and survey participants. Mistrust, with deep political and historical roots in this area besieged by chronic violence and neglected by the outside world, may fuel social resistance. Resistant attitudes may be refractory to short-lived community engagement efforts targeting the epidemic but not the broader humanitarian crisis in Eastern DRC."

However, in addition to these positive aspects, digital technology also provides an effective medium for spreading hateful content in the form of cyberbullying, bigotry, hateful ideologies, and harassment of individuals and groups. This research aims to investigate the growing body of online hate research (OHR) by mapping general research indices, prevalent themes of research, research hotspots, and influential stakeholders such as organizations and contributing regions. For this, we use scientometric techniques and collect research papers from the Web of Science core database published through March 2019. We apply a predefined search strategy to retrieve peer-reviewed OHR and analyze the data using CiteSpace software by identifying influential papers, themes of research, and collaborating institutions. Our results show that higher-income countries contribute most to OHR, with Western countries accounting for most of the publications, funded by North American and European funding agencies. We also observed increased research activity post-2005, starting from more than 50 publications to more than 550 in 2018. This applies to a number of publications as well as citations. The hotbeds of OHR focus on cyberbullying, social media platforms, co-morbid mental disorders, and profiling of aggressors and victims. Moreover, we identified four main clusters of OHR: (1) Cyberbullying, (2) Sexual solicitation and intimate partner violence, (3) Deep learning and automation, and (4) Extremist and online hate groups, which highlight the cross-disciplinary and multifaceted nature of OHR as a field of research. The research has implications for researchers and policymakers engaged in OHR and its associated problems for individuals and society."
https://openalex.org/W2975067599,"With the rapid development of the internet, social media has become an essential tool for getting information, and attracted a large number of people join the social media platforms because of its low cost, accessibility and amazing content. It greatly enriches our life. However, its rapid development and widespread also have provided an excellent convenience for the range of fake news, people are constantly exposed to fake news and suffer from it all the time. Fake news usually uses hyperbole to catch people’s eyes with dishonest intention. More importantly, it often misleads the reader and causes people to have wrong perceptions of society. It has the potential for negative impacts on society and individuals. Therefore, it is significative research on detecting fake news. In the paper, we built a model named SMHA-CNN (Self Multi-Head Attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks) that can judge the authenticity of news with high accuracy based only on content by using convolutional neural networks and self multi-head attention mechanism. In order to prove its validity, we conducted experiments on a public dataset and achieved a precision rate of 95.5% with a recall rate of 95.6% under the 5-fold cross-validation. Our experimental result indicates that the model is more effective at detecting fake news."

In this pre-post intervention study, we evaluated how a molecular identification test directly performed on positive blood cultures of critically ill improves patient's therapeutic management.All adult patients staying at the intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of positive blood culture detection were study-eligible. In the 8-month pre-intervention period (P0), standard positive blood culture management was performed. In the 10-month intervention period (P1), a BioFire® FilmArray® blood culture identification (FA-BCID) test (bioMérieux) was additionally performed 24/7 at detection. The evaluated clinical outcome was time to optimal antimicrobial treatment of the bloodstream infection. FA-BCID microbiological test performances were also analysed.163 positive blood culture episodes were allocated to P0 and 166 to P1. After the withdrawal of episodes in accordance with defined exclusion criteria, outcome analysis was performed on 110 bloodstream infections both in P0 and P1. Time to optimal antimicrobial treatment in P0 was 14h41 compared to 4h39 in P1. FA-BCID test results led to a treatment adjustment in 35/110 (31.8%) P1 episodes including 26 where the adjustment was the optimal antimicrobial treatment. FA-BCID testing identified 96.2% of the on-panel microorganisms thereby covering 85.2% of our ICU-strain epidemiology. Time to identification with FA-BCID testing was calculated at 1h35. Resistance detection was in complete concordance with routine results. Considering 150 FA-BCID tests were initially performed in P1, 4,3 tests were required to have 1 test leading to an improved therapeutic outcome.FA-BCID testing drastically reduced time to optimal antimicrobial treatment in critically ill with bloodstream infections."
https://openalex.org/W2975073736,"Although it is now recognized that women suffer from myofascial pain to a greater extent than men, and that the muscular fasciae can respond to hormonal stimuli, thanks to the expression of sex hormone receptors, how the fasciae can modify their structure under hormonal stimulation is not clear. In this work, an immunocytochemical analysis of collagen-I, collagen-III and fibrillin were carried out on fibroblasts isolated from human fascia lata after in vitro treatment with various levels of sex hormones β-estradiol and/or relaxin-1, according to the phases of a woman’s period (follicular, periovulatory, luteal, post-menopausal phases and pregnancy). This study demonstrates for the first time that fascial cells can modulate the production of some components of the extracellular matrix according to hormone levels, when treated with β-estradiol: collagen-I falls from 6% of positivity in the follicular phase to 1.9 in the periovulatory phase. However, after the addition of relaxin-1 to the cell culture, the production of extracellular matrix decreased and remained at the same level (1.7% of collagen-I, at both follicular and periovulatory levels of hormones). These results confirm the antifibrotic function of relaxin-1, thanks to its ability to reduce matrix synthesis. They are also a first step in our understanding of how some hormonal dysfunctions in women can cause a dysregulation of extracellular matrix production in fasciae."
https://openalex.org/W2976529246,"Transcutaneous spinal cord or transspinal stimulation over the thoracolumbar enlargement, the spinal location of motoneurons innervating leg muscles, modulates neural circuits engaged in the control of movement. The extent to which daily sessions (e.g. repeated) of transspinal stimulation affects soleus H-reflex excitability in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) remains largely unknown. In this study, we established the effects of repeated cathodal transspinal stimulation on soleus H-reflex excitability and spinal inhibition in individuals with and without chronic SCI. Ten SCI and 10 healthy control subjects received monophasic transspinal stimuli of 1-ms duration at 0.2 Hz at subthreshold and suprathreshold intensities of the right soleus transspinal evoked potential (TEP). SCI subjects received an average of 16 stimulation sessions, while healthy control subjects received an average of 10 stimulation sessions. Before and one or two days post intervention, we used the soleus H reflex to assess changes in motoneuron recruitment, homosynaptic depression following single tibial nerve stimuli delivered at 0.1, 0.125, 0.2, 0.33 and 1.0 Hz, and postactivation depression following paired tibial nerve stimuli at the interstimulus intervals of 60, 100, 300, and 500 ms. Soleus H-reflex excitability was decreased in both legs in motor incomplete and complete SCI but not in healthy control subjects. Soleus H-reflex homosynaptic and postactivation depression was present in motor incomplete and complete SCI but was of lesser strength to that observed in healthy control subjects. Repeated transspinal stimulation increased homosynaptic depression in all SCI subjects and remained unaltered in healthy controls. Postactivation depression remained unaltered in all subject groups. Lastly, transspinal stimulation decreased the severity of spasms and ankle clonus. The results indicate decreased reflex hyperexcitability and recovery of spinal inhibitory control in the injured human spinal cord with repeated transspinal stimulation. Transspinal stimulation is a noninvasive neuromodulation method for restoring spinally-mediated afferent reflex actions after SCI in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2975206222,"The objective of this study was to identify, understand and generate a Taguchi orthogonal array model for the formation of 10–50 μm microparticles with applications in topical/ocular controlled drug delivery. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles were fabricated by the single emulsion oil-in-water method and the particle size was characterized using laser diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Sequential Taguchi L12 and L18 orthogonal array (OA) designs were employed to study the influence of ten and eight parameters, respectively, on microparticle size (response). The first optimization step using the L12 design showed that all parameters significantly influenced the particle size of the prepared PLGA microparticles with exception of the concentration of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in the hardening bath. The smallest mean particle size obtained from the L12 design was 54.39 μm. A subsequent L18 design showed that the molecular weight of PLGA does not significantly affect the particle size. An experimental run comprising of defined parameters including molecular weight of PLGA (89 kDa), concentration of PLGA (20% w/v), concentration of PVA in the emulsion (0.8% w/v), solvent type (ethyl acetate), organic/aqeuous phase ratio (1:1 v/v), vortexing speed (9), vortexing duration (60 seconds), concentration of PVA in hardening bath (0.8% w/v), stirring speed of hardening bath (1200 rpm) and solvent evaporation duration (24 hours) resulted in the lowest mean particle size of 23.51 μm which was predicted and confirmed by the L18 array. A comparable size was demonstrated during the fabrication of BSA-incorporated microparticles. Taguchi OA design proved to be a valuable tool in determining the combination of process parameters that can provide the optimal condition for microparticle formulation. Taguchi OA design can be used to correctly predict the size of microparticles fabricated by the single emulsion process and can therefore, ultimately, save time and costs during the manufacturing process of drug delivery formulations by minimising experimental runs."
https://openalex.org/W2975999621,"Fragmentation of mitochondrial network has been implicated in many neurodegenerative, renal, and metabolic diseases. However, a quantitative measure of the microscopic parameters resulting in the impaired balance between fission and fusion of mitochondria and consequently the fragmented networks in a wide range of pathological conditions does not exist. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial networks in cells with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), optic neuropathy (OPA), diabetes/cancer, acute kidney injury, Ca2+ overload, and Down Syndrome (DS) pathologies that indicates significant network fragmentation in all these conditions. Furthermore, we found key differences in the way the microscopic rates of fission and fusion are affected in different conditions. The observed fragmentation in cells with AD, HD, DS, kidney injury, Ca2+ overload, and diabetes/cancer pathologies results from the imbalance between the fission and fusion through lateral interactions, whereas that in OPA, PD, and ALS results from impaired balance between fission and fusion arising from longitudinal interactions of mitochondria. Such microscopic difference leads to major disparities in the fine structure and topology of the network that could have significant implications for the way fragmentation affects various cell functions in different diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2976527321,"Background Road Traffic Accidents have become an enormous global public health problem killing approximately 1.25 million people and injuring 20 to 50 million others yearly. It is the 10th leading cause of death universally and the number one cause of mortality of the young population between the ages of 5 and 29. Only few studies have been conducted on the severity of road traffic injuries in Ethiopia hence the need for the study. Objective To assess injury severity level and associated factors among road traffic accident victims. Methods A cross-sectional study of patients involved in road traffic accident and attended Tirunesh Beijing hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Victims were consecutively recruited until sample size (164) attained during the study period. Data collectors administered a structured questionnaire. The collected data was then entered and cleaned using Epi info and exported to IBM SPSS for statistical analysis. Independent factors associated with injury severity were assessed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results A total of 164 road traffic injury victims were included to the study. Prevalence of severe injury accounted for 36.6% of cases. “can read and write” educational status OR 35.194(95% CI; 3.325–372.539), sustaining multiple injury OR 18.400(95% CI; 5.402–62.671), sustaining multiple injury type OR 6.955(95% CI; 1.716–28.185) and being transported by ambulance from the scene of accident OR 13.800(95% CI; 1.481–128.635) were the explanatory variables found to have a statistically significant association with severe injury. Conclusion This study showed road traffic accident is predominantly affecting the economically active, male young population. Not a single victim received pre-hospital care, majority were extracted by bystanders and most used commercial vehicle to be transported to a health institution reflecting the need for improvements in pre-hospital emergency services and socio-economic related infrastructures."
https://openalex.org/W2976587599,"The West Nile Virus (WNV) NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for the development of therapeutics against this arboviral pathogen. In the present investigation, the screening of a small library of fifty-eight synthetic compounds against the NS2-NB3 protease of WNV is described. The following groups of compounds were evaluated: 3-(2-aryl-2-oxoethyl)isobenzofuran-1(3H)-ones; eugenol derivatives bearing 1,2,3-triazolic functionalities; and indan-1,3-diones with 1,2,3-triazolic functionalities. The most promising of these was a eugenol derivative, namely 4-(3-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)-propyl)-1-(2-bromobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole (35), which inhibited the protease with IC50 of 6.86 μmol L-1. Enzyme kinetic assays showed that this derivative of eugenol presents competitive inhibition behaviour. Molecular docking calculations predicted a recognition pattern involving the residues His51 and Ser135, which are members of the catalytic triad of the WNV NS2B-NS3 protease."

Compared to the control group, the antibiotics and EL extract significantly increased the average daily gain and decreased the feed: gain ratio as well as the diarrhea rate (P < 0.05). The EL extract significantly decreased the crypt depth and increased the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05), while the fermented EL group did the opposite (P < 0.05). The crypt depth in the antibiotics group was of similar value to the EL extract group, and was lower than the fermented EL and EL powder groups (P < 0.05). Compared to the control and antibiotics groups, the jejunul claudin-3 mRNA expression and the concentrations of total VFA, Chao 1, and ACE were significantly augmented in the EL extract group of piglets (P < 0.05). The EL extract groups also showed elevated Shannon (P < 0.05) and Simpson (P = 0.07) values relative to the control and antibiotics groups. At the phylum level, the EL extract group exhibited a reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and an enhanced abundance of Firmicutes. At the genus level, the abundance of Prevotella was augmented in the EL extract group. Moreover, compared with the antibiotic group, the acetate concentration was enhanced in the EL extract and fermented EL groups. Overall, dietary supplementation with the EL extract, but not the fermented EL or EL powder, improved growth performance, jejunul morphology and function, as well as changed colonic microbial composition and diversity, which might be an alternative to confer protection against weanling stress in weanling piglets."
https://openalex.org/W2974952596,"Variceal hemorrhage may cause high rebleeding and mortality rates. Preventing the first episode of variceal bleeding is mandatory in patients with high-risk esophageal varices (EV). This study aimed to identify factors that predict the recurrence of EV after endoscopic treatment (ET), and to develop a reasonable therapeutic strategy for EV in cirrhosis. From January 2012 to December 2014, 45 patients with cirrhosis and high-risk EV underwent ET, including sclerotherapy and/or ligation. Statistical analyses identified factors associated with the recurrence of EV after ET, and the Kaplan-Meier method determined the cumulative variceal recurrence rates. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative posttreatment recurrence rates for EV were 13.3%, 29.5%, and 32.2%, respectively. No significant differences were evident between the patients with and without variceal recurrences at 1-year posttreatment. The multivariate regression analyses identified a history of partial splenic embolization (PSE) and the pretreatment Child-Pugh classification as independent predictors of variceal recurrences at 2 years (p < 0.05) and 3 years (p < 0.05) posttreatment. While EV did not recur after ET and splenic artery embolization in cases with Child-Pugh class A, the overall posttreatment variceal recurrence rates were 0% and 66.7% when PSE was performed before and after ET, respectively, in those with Child-Pugh class B or C. Splenic artery embolization significantly reduced the hepatic venous pressure gradient and markedly lowered the Child-Pugh score in 15 patients. Adjunctive PSE and pretreatment Child-Pugh class A could be independently associated with reduced cumulative recurrence rates of EV post-ET. From the perspectives of portal hemodynamics and hepatic function, splenic artery embolization before or after ET could prevent posttreatment variceal recurrence in patients with Child-Pugh class A, and PSE before ET could achieve the long-term eradication of EV following ET in those with Child-Pugh class B or C."
https://openalex.org/W2975179657,"The severity of negative energy balance (NEB) in high-producing dairy cows has a high incidence among health diseases. The cow's energy status during early lactation critically affects metabolic and reproductive parameters. The first objective of this study was to investigate by RNA-seq analysis and RT-qPCR the gene expression profile in white adipose tissue and by gene ontology and upstream regulation tools the relationships with energy metabolism and reproduction in two groups of primiparous dairy cows with extreme NEB statuses (NEB < -9 Mcal/day vs. NEB > -9 Mcal/day) around parturition. The second objective was to determine the potential involvement of a new adipokine identified as a candidate for the regulation of ovarian function in our RNA-seq analysis by using bovine primary granulosa culture, thymidine incorporation to determine cell proliferation and ELISA assays to measure progesterone secretion. The RNA-seq analysis revealed that 514 genes were over-expressed and 695 were under-expressed in the adipose tissue of cows with severe NEB (SNEB) and cows with moderate NEB (MNEB) during the -4 and 16 wkpp period. In addition, 491 genes were over-expressed and 705 genes were under-expressed in the adipose tissue of SNEB cows compared to MNEB cows. Among these differently expressed genes (DEGs), 298 were related to metabolic functions and 264 to reproductive traits. A set of 19 DEGs were validated by RT-qPCR, including CCL21 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 21). Moreover, CCL21, a gene known to be secreted by adipose tissue, was chosen for further analysis in plasma and ovaries. The use of next-generation sequencing technologies allowed us to characterise the transcriptome of white adipose tissue from primiparous cows with different levels of NEB during lactation. This study highlighted the alteration of the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, including CCL21, which is released in the bloodstream and associated with the in vitro regulation of ovarian functions."
https://openalex.org/W2977371516,"It was shown previously that inhibition of the ubiquitous α1 isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase by ouabain sharply affects gene expression profile via elevation of intracellular [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio. Unlike other cells, neurons are abundant in the α3 isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase, whose affinity in rodents to ouabain is 104-fold higher compared to the α1 isoform. With these sharp differences in mind, we compared transcriptomic changes in rat cerebellum granule cells triggered by inhibition of α1- and α3-Na+,K+-ATPase isoforms. Inhibition of α1- and α3-Na+,K+-ATPase isoforms by 1 mM ouabain resulted in dissipation of transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients and differential expression of 994 transcripts, whereas selective inhibition of α3-Na+,K+-ATPase isoform by 100 nM ouabain affected expression of 144 transcripts without any impact on the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio. The list of genes whose expression was affected by 1 mM ouabain by more than 2-fold was abundant in intermediates of intracellular signaling and transcription regulators, including augmented content of Npas4, Fos, Junb, Atf3, and Klf4 mRNAs, whose upregulated expression was demonstrated in neurons subjected to electrical and glutamatergic stimulation. The role [Na+]i/[K+]i-mediated signaling in transcriptomic changes involved in memory formation and storage should be examined further."
https://openalex.org/W2976048102,"Chronic/abnormal activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked to the exacerbation of the inflammatory process and has been recently linked to Crohn’s disease (CD) pathophysiology. We investigated the intestinal mucosa and the mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) collected from CD patients with active disease (CD group) and from non-IBD patients (CTR group) to study ER stress activation and to address tissue-specific modulation in CD. The intestinal mucosa of CD patients showed an upregulation in the expression of ER stress related genes, including ATF3, DNAJC3, STC2, DDIT3, CALR, HSPA5 and HSP90B1. Results showed that EIF2AK3 gene was upregulated, along with increased protein expression of p-eIF2α and p-eIF2α/eIF2α ratio. Additionally, ERN1 gene expression was upregulated, along with an increased spliced/activated form sXBP1 protein. Despite the upregulation of ATF6 gene expression in the intestinal mucosa of CD patients, no differences were found in ATF6 protein expression. Lastly, the analysis of MAT revealed unchanged levels of ER stress markers along with no differences in the activation of UPR. However, chaperone gene expression was modulated in the MAT of CD patients. To conclude, our results address tissue-specific differences in UPR activation in CD and point the ER stress as an important pro-inflammatory mechanism in CD, specifically in the intestinal mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W2976376283,"Despite the consideration of chromosomal mutations as the major cause of rifampicin (RIF) resistance in M. tuberculosis, the role of other mechanisms such as efflux pumps cannot be ruled out. We evaluated the role of four efflux pumps viz., MmpL2 (Rv0507), MmpL5 (Rv0676c), Rv0194 and Rv1250 in providing RIF resistance in M. tuberculosis. The real time expression of the efflux pumps was analyzed in 16 RIF resistant and 11 RIF susceptible clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis after exposure to RIF. Expression of efflux pumps in these isolates was also correlated with mutations in the rpoB gene and MICs of RIF in the presence and absence of efflux pump inhibitors. Under RIF stress, Rv0194 was induced in 8/16 (50%) RIF resistant and 2/11 (18%) RIF susceptible isolates; mmpL5 in 7/16 (44%) RIF resistant and 1/11 (9%) RIF susceptible isolates; Rv1250 in 4/16 (25%) RIF resistant and 2/11 (18%) RIF susceptible isolates; and mmpL2 was upregulated in 2/16 (12.5%) RIF resistant and 1/11 (9%) RIF susceptible isolates. This preliminary study did not find any association between Rv0194, MmpL2, MmpL5 and Rv1250 and RIF resistance. However, the overexpression of Rv0194 and mmpL5 in greater number of RIF resistant isolates as compared to RIF susceptible isolates and expression of Rv0194 in wild type (WT) resistant isolates suggests a need for further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2975115144,"Globally, gains in sweet corn [Zea mays L.var. rugosa (or saccharata)] are a fraction of the yield advances made in field corn (Zea mays L.) in the last half-century. Grain yield improvement of field corn is associated with increased tolerance to higher plant densities (i.e., crowding stress). Processing sweet corn hybrids that tolerate crowding stress have been identified; however, such hybrids appear to be under-planted in the processing sweet corn. Using crowding stress tolerant (CST) hybrids, the objectives of this study were to: (1) identify optimum plant densities for a range of growing conditions; (2) quantify gaps in production between current and optimum plant densities; and (3) enumerate changes in yield and ear traits when shifting from current to optimum plant densities. Using a CST shrunken-2 (sh2) processing sweet corn hybrid, on-farm plant density trials were conducted in thirty fields across the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin, from 2013 to 2017 in order to capture a wide variety of growing conditions. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify the optimum plant density corresponding to maximum ear mass (Mt ha-1), case production (cases ha-1), and profitability to the processor ($ ha-1). Kernel moisture, indicative of plant development, was unaffected by plant density. Ear traits, such as ear number and ear mass per plant, average ear length, and filled ear length declined linearly with increasing plant density. Nonetheless, there was a large economic benefit to the grower and processor by shifting to higher plant densities in most environments. This research shows that increasing plant densities of CST hybrids from current (58,475 plants ha-1) to optimum (73,075 plants ha-1) could improve processing sweet corn green ear yield and processor profitability on average of 1.13 Mt ha-1 and $525 ha-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2975827299,"Percutaneous pedicle screw (PPS) can provide internal fixation of the thoracolumbar spine through a minimally invasive surgical procedure. PPS fixation has been widely used to treat various spinal diseases. Rigid fixation of PPS is essential for managing osteoporotic spine in order to prevent the risks of screw loosening and implant failure. We recently developed a novel augmentation method using hydroxyapatite (HA) granules for PPS fixation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the strength and stiffness of PPS fixation augmented with HA granules using an osteoporotic bone model.Screws were inserted into uniform synthetic bone (sawbones) with and without augmentation. The uniaxial pullout strength and insertion torque of the screws were evaluated. In addition, each screw underwent cyclic toggling under incrementally increasing physiological loads until 2 mm of screwhead displacement occurred. The maximal pullout strength (N), maximal insertion torque (N·cm), number of toggle cycles and maximal load (N) required to achieve 2-mm screwhead displacement were compared between the screws with and without augmentation.The maximal pullout strength was significantly stronger for screws with augmentation than for those without augmentation (302 ± 19 N vs. 254 ± 17 N, p < 0.05). In addition, the maximal insertion torque was significantly increased in screws with augmentation compared to those without augmentation (48 ± 4 N·cm vs. 26 ± 5 N·cm, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of toggle cycles and the maximal load required to reach 2 mm of displacement were significantly greater in screws with augmentation than in those without augmentation (106 ± 9 vs. 52 ± 10 cycles; 152 ± 4 N vs. 124 ± 5 N, p < 0.05).Augmentation using HA granules significantly enhanced the rigidity of PPS fixation in the osteoporotic bone model. The present study suggested that novel augmentation with HA granules may be a useful technique for PPS fixation in patients with osteoporotic spine."
https://openalex.org/W2977087547,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of additive and non-additive genes on the efficiency of nitrogen (N) use and N responsiveness in inbred popcorn lines. The parents, hybrids and reciprocal crosses were evaluated in a 10x10 triple lattice design at two sites and two levels of N availability. To establish different N levels in the two experiments, fertilization was carried out at sowing, according to soil analysis reports. However, for the experiments with ideal nitrogen availability, N was sidedressed according to the crop requirement, whereas for the N-poor experiments sidedressing consisted of 30% of that applied in the N-rich environment. Two indices were evaluated, the Harmonic Mean of the Relative Performance (HMRP) and Agronomic Efficiency under Low Nitrogen Availability (AELN), both based on grain yield at both N levels. Both additive and non-additive gene effects were important for selection for N-use efficiency. Moreover, there was allelic complementarity between the lines and a reciprocal effect for N-use efficiency, indicating the importance of the choice of the parents used as male or female. The best hybrids were obtained from inbred popcorn lines with contrasting N-use efficiency and N responsiveness."

This article presents the results of a natural experiment where the Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative Phase I programming ended in early 2015 and Phase II activities continued in a subset of cities. Using data collected in 2015 and 2017, we compare contraceptive ideation and modern family planning use in two cities: Ilorin where program activities concluded in 2015 and Kaduna where program activities continued. The results demonstrate that exposure to program activities decreased in Ilorin but for those individuals reporting continuing exposure, the effect size of exposure on modern family planning use remained the same and was not significantly different from Kaduna. Modern family planning use continued to increase in both cites but at a lower rate than during Phase I.

In this study, we used cell-attached or whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to characterize the effects of trazodone at somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AARs) and α1-adrenoceptors of serotonergic neurons in rodent dorsal raphe slices. To reveal the effects of trazodone at α1-adrenoceptors, the baseline firing of 5-HT neurons was facilitated by applying the selective α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine at various concentrations. In the absence of phenylephrine, trazodone (1–10 μM) concentration-dependently silenced neurons through activation of 5-HT1AARs. The effect was fully antagonized by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist Way-100635. With 5-HT1A receptors blocked by Way-100635, trazodone (1–10 μM) concentration-dependently inhibited neuron firing facilitated by 1 μM phenylephrine. Parallel rightward shift of dose-response curves for trazodone recorded in higher phenylephrine concentrations (10–100 μM) indicated competitive antagonism at α1-adrenoceptors. Both effects of trazodone were also observed in slices from Tph2-/- mice that lack synthesis of brain serotonin, showing that the activation of 5-HT1AARs was not mediated by endogenous serotonin. In whole-cell recordings, trazodone activated 5-HT1AAR-coupled G protein-activated inwardly-rectifying (GIRK) channel conductance with weak partial agonist efficacy (~35%) compared to that of the full agonist 5-CT. Collectively our data show that trazodone, at concentrations relevant to its clinical effects, exerts weak partial agonism at 5-HT1AARs and disfacilitation of firing through α1-adrenoceptor antagonism. These two actions converge in inhibiting dorsal raphe serotonergic neuron activity, albeit with varying contribution depending on the intensity of α1-adrenoceptor stimulation."

Ventilation is the important regulatory factor in composting process, and high degree of maturity is the principal requirement for safe application of composting product. In the study, four treatments were designed as every 5 days turning (A1), every 7 days turning (A2), every 10 days turning(A3), and every 15 days turning (A4) for evaluating the maturity of Camellia oleifera shell co-composted with goat dung and optimizing turning frequency. During composting, TN, [Formula: see text], GI, Solvita maturity index was increased along with composting process, while [Formula: see text], C/N shown an opposite trend. For all treatments, the longest thermophilic period (over 50°C), highest total nutrient and lowest C/N ratio were observed in A2. A turning frequency of every 7 days for co-compost of Camellia oleifera shell and goat dung could enhance the composting product quality. According to the analysis of spearman correlation, TN, C/N ratio, and GI could be used to comprehensively evaluate the compost maturity."
https://openalex.org/W2975489958,"Industrial robots are a strategic future technology and an important part of the development of artificial intelligence, and they are a necessary means for the intelligent transformation of manufacturing industry. Based on global industrial robot trade data from 1998 to 2017, this paper applies the dynamic complex network analysis method to reveal the spatial and temporal variation characteristics and trade status evolution of the global industrial robot trade network. The results show that the global industrial robot network density has steadily increased, and the industrial robot trade has been characterized by 'diversification'. The number of major industrial robot exporters in the world is increasing, and the import market is increasingly diversified. The export market structure is relatively tight, the centrality of the global industrial robot trade network shows a downward trend, and the dissimilarity of the 'core-edge' clusters decreases year by year. The trade status of 'catch-up' countries represented by China has rapidly increased. However, Japan, Germany, and Italy are still in the central position of the industrial robot trade. Moreover, trade of the 'catch-up' countries' is dominated by imports, and exports of industrial robot products are insufficient. Finally, policy suggestions are provided according to the results."
https://openalex.org/W2976677447,"Recent work has shown that weak protein-protein interactions are susceptible to the cellular milieu. One case in point is the binding of heat shock proteins (Hsps) to substrate proteins in cells under stress. Upregulation of the Hsp70 chaperone machinery at elevated temperature was discovered in the 1960s, and more recent studies have shown that ATPase activity in one Hsp70 domain is essential for control of substrate binding by the other Hsp70 domain. Although there are several denaturant-based assays of Hsp70 activity, reports of ATP-dependent binding of Hsp70 to a globular protein substrate under heat shock are scarce. Here we show that binding of heat-inducible Hsp70 to phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is remarkably different in vitro compared to in-cell. We use fluorescent-labeled mHsp70 and ePGK, and begin by showing that mHsp70 passes the standard β-galactosidase assay, and that it does not self-aggregate until 50°C in presence of ATP. Yet during denaturant refolding or during in vitro heat shock, mHsp70 shows only ATP-independent non-specific sticking to ePGK, as evidenced by nearly identical results with an ATPase activity-deficient K71M mutant of Hsp70 as a control. Addition of Hsp40 (co-factor) or Ficoll (crowder) does not reduce non-specific sticking, but cell lysate does. Therefore, Hsp70 does not act as an ATP-dependent chaperone on its substrate PGK in vitro. In contrast, we observe only specific ATP-dependent binding of mHsp70 to ePGK in mammalian cells, when compared to the inactive Hsp70 K71M mutant. We hypothesize that enhanced in-cell activity is not due to an unknown co-factor, but simply to a favorable shift in binding equilibrium caused by the combination of crowding and osmolyte/macromolecular interactions present in the cell. One candidate mechanism for such a favorable shift in binding equilibrium is the proven ability of Hsp70 to bind near-native states of substrate proteins in vitro. We show evidence for early onset of binding in-cell. Our results suggest that Hsp70 binds PGK preemptively, prior to its full unfolding transition, thus stabilizing it against further unfolding. We propose a “preemptive holdase” mechanism for Hsp70-substrate binding. Given our result for PGK, more proteins than one might think based on in vitro assays may be chaperoned by Hsp70 in vivo. The cellular environment thus plays an important role in maintaining proper Hsp70 function."
https://openalex.org/W2975153708,"Alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) has been widely applied to understand the psychophysiological role of this band in cognition. In particular, a considerable number of publications have described spectral alterations in several pathologies using this time-frequency approach. However, ERD is not capable of specifically showing nonphase (induced) activity related to the presentation of stimuli. Recent studies have described an evoked and induced activity in the early phases (first 200 ms) of stimulus processing. However, scarce studies have analyzed induced and evoked modulations in longer latencies (>200 ms) and their potential roles in cognitive processing. The main goal of the present study was to analyze diverse evoked and induced modulations in response to visual stimuli. Thus, 58-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 21 healthy subjects during the performance of a visual attention task, and analyses were performed for both target and standard stimuli. The initial result showed that phase-locked and nonphase locked activities coexist in the early processing of target and standard stimuli as has been reported by previous studies. However, more modulations were evident in longer latencies in both evoked and induced activities. Correlation analyses suggest that similar maps were present for evoked and induced activities at different timepoints. In the discussion section, diverse proposals will be stated to define the potential roles of these modulations in the information processing for this cognitive task. As a general conclusion, induced activity enables the observation of cognitive mechanisms that are not visible by ERD or ERP modulations."
https://openalex.org/W2977141246,"Cross-border seasonal livestock movements in West Africa bring into close contact several cattle breeds. In the coastal countries hosting migrating herders from the Sahel, it often affects the genetic variability and geographical distribution of traditional cattle breeds, through their indiscriminate but also intended crossbreeding with larger-framed Sahelian cattle breeds. The need to secure and effectively manage this genetic variability, in order to respond to changing production and market conditions, is widely recognized by the scientific community, livestock herders and policy-makers. This however requires a comprehensive knowledge of the breeds' characteristics. The indigenous criteria used by pastoralists to characterize and distinguish cattle breeds remain unclear and further validation is required. This study was therefore designed to document and validate herders' knowledge on cattle breeds. From June 2015 to June 2016, 803 cattle herders participated in a phenotypic breed description in seven pastoral communities across the country. Each cattle herder was asked to name and describe morphologically the different cattle breeds in his herd. Subsequently, fifteen body measurements taken on a total of 1401 adult cattle (964 cows and 439 bulls) were submitted to multivariate analyses. Participants distinguished ten different cattle breeds kept in traditional herds according to six primary morphological traits and clearly separated zebuine from taurine breeds. These results were consistent with those of the multivariate analyses of the measured traits. However, herders' classification approach proved to be more accurate in distinguishing breeds within the zebuine subspecies. Hence, while metric measurements and molecular genetic analyses are promising approaches to fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of local farm animal genetic resources, they should integrate livestock herders' traditional knowledge for more precision."
https://openalex.org/W2977193547,"All broiler flocks reared and slaughtered in Norway from May-October 2016 (n = 2110) were screened for the presence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) -resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we investigated possible risk factors for occurrence of such bacteria in broiler flocks. The odds of a flock being positive for ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae increased if the previous flock in the same house was positive, and if the flock was reared during September-October. However, we cannot exclude seasonal fluctuations in occurrence of ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae during the months November to April. The overall occurrence of ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae was 10.4%, and primarily linked to the presence of blaCMY (82.6%) in positive isolates. We describe the first findings of Escherichia coli with blaCTX-M-1, Klebsiella pneumoniae with both blaCTX-M-15 and blaSHV-12, and K. pneumoniae with blaCMY isolated from Norwegian broiler production. This study gives us a unique overview and estimate of the true occurrence of ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Norwegian broilers over a six-month period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study performed on the occurrence of ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in a broiler population."
https://openalex.org/W2975063071,"It is well known that simple visual tasks, such as object detection or categorization, can be performed within a short period of time, suggesting the sufficiency of feed-forward visual processing. However, more complex visual tasks, such as fine-grained localization may require high-resolution information available at the early processing levels in the visual hierarchy. To access this information using a top-down approach, feedback processing would need to traverse several stages in the visual hierarchy and each step in this traversal takes processing time. In the present study, we compared the processing time required to complete object categorization and localization by varying presentation duration and complexity of natural scene stimuli. We hypothesized that performance would be asymptotic at shorter presentation durations when feed-forward processing suffices for visual tasks, whereas performance would gradually improve as images are presented longer if the tasks rely on feedback processing. In Experiment 1, where simple images were presented, both object categorization and localization performance sharply improved until 100 ms of presentation then it leveled off. These results are a replication of previously reported rapid categorization effects but they do not support the role of feedback processing in localization tasks, indicating that feed-forward processing enables coarse localization in relatively simple visual scenes. In Experiment 2, the same tasks were performed but more attention-demanding and ecologically valid images were used as stimuli. Unlike in Experiment 1, both object categorization performance and localization precision gradually improved as stimulus presentation duration became longer. This finding suggests that complex visual tasks that require visual scrutiny call for top-down feedback processing."
https://openalex.org/W2976248986,"Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) is considered to be the beginning of lymphogenous and hematogenous metastases. It is strongly related to dissemination, and therefore could be a valuable predictive sign of lymph node metastases and distant spread. Recently, the presence of LVSI in endometrial cancer (EC) has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor. The preoperative diagnosis of LVSI by pathological examination is difficult and LVSI is detected after surgery. The aim of the current study was to explore candidate genes as potential diagnostic biomarkers and determine whether they are predictors of LVSI in patients with EC. A total of 88 surgical specimens obtained from EC patients who had undergone surgical resection at Fukushima Medical University Hospital between 2010 and 2015 were analyzed using DNA microarray. LVSI was significantly associated with poor prognostic factors in EC such as higher tumor grade, lymph node metastasis, deep myometrium invasion, advanced stage and recurrence. Fifty-five candidate genes were significantly differentially expressed between 26 LVSI-positive and 62 LVSI-negative samples. All 88 samples were divided into two groups according to hierarchical clustering of 55 genes. Regarding diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and negative predictive value were both high (92% and 95%, respectively); further, specificity and positive predictive value were both moderate (63% and 71%, respectively). Our data suggests that the 55-gene signature could contribute to predicting LVSI in EC, and provide clinically important information for better management. The molecular signatures of 55 genes may be also useful for understanding the underlying mechanism of LVSI."
https://openalex.org/W2976909457,"Understanding the overall utility of biological testing for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is essential for the development and integration of biomarkers into routine care. One measure related to the overall utility of biological testing is the knowledge that a person has about the condition he/she suffers from. However, a major gap towards understanding the role of knowledge in overall utility is the absence of studies that have assessed knowledge of autism along with its predictors within a representative sample of families within the context of routine care. The objective of this study was to measure knowledge of ASD among families within the routine care pathway for biological testing in ASD by examining the association between knowledge with potential correlates of knowledge namely sociodemographic factors, parental stress and distress, and time since diagnosis among parents whose child with ASD is undergoing clinical genetic testing. Parents of a child diagnosed with ASD (n = 85, Mage = 39.0, SD = 7.7) participating in an ongoing prospective genomics study completed the ASD Quiz prior to undergoing genetic testing for clinical and research purposes. Parents also completed self-reported measures of stress and distress. Parent stress and distress was each independently correlated with knowledge of ASD, rs ≥ 0.26, ps < 0.05. Stepwise regression analysis revealed a significant model accounting for 7.8% of the variance in knowledge, F (1, 82) = 8.02, p = 0.006. The only factor significantly associated with knowledge was parental distress, β = 0.30, p = 0.006. Parental stress, time since diagnosis, and sociodemographic factors were not significant predictors in this model. We concluded that families require tailored support prior to undergoing genetic testing to address either knowledge gaps or high distress. Ongoing appraisal of the testing process among families of diverse backgrounds is essential in offering optimal care for families undergoing genetic testing."

Weekly CTs (4-6 sets for each patient) were acquired during RT. The tumors, normal esophageal mucosa tissue (NEC) of 5 cm and the spinal cord in the relevant area were delineated. CT texture features were extracted with a home-made tool. The changes of these features were analyzed by t-test. The correlations of the changes of features with RT responses and with patient survival were investigated by Pearson analysis.The average changes were increased by 0.00072 ±0.00197 for coarseness, by 0.14 ±0.40 for entropy, and by 2.34 ±3.56 for strength. In addition, the average changes were reduced by 8.88 ±15.71cc for volume and by 0.07 ±0.11 for busyness. The changes of the coarseness, strength, STD and entropy in ESC were different for the good and poor response groups. The survival rate of the patients was significantly correlated with the change of coarseness and strength (P = 0.0027 and P = 0.0001).During RT, changes of CT texture features of ESC, e.g., coarseness, strength, STD, entropy and volume are correlated with radiation response and survival rate. With more clinical data and robust research, CT features, e.g., coarseness and strength, can be selected as outstanding imaging biomarkers for prediction of RT prognosis of ESC."
https://openalex.org/W2975089139,"Direct lightning strikes to the human head can lead to various effects, ranging from burnings to death. The biological and physical mechanisms of a direct lightning strike in the human head are not well understood. The aim of this paper is to design an experimental setup to measure the spatial and temporal current distribution during a direct lightning strike to physical head phantoms to establish normative values for personal lightning protection equipment design and testing. We created head phantoms made of agarose, replicating the geometric and dielectric properties of scalp, skull, and intracranial volume. The bases of the three compartments were galvanically contacted via copper electrodes to measure the current per compartment. We used pulse generators to apply aperiodic voltage and current signals that modelled lightning components. Our experiments indicated that the scalp compartment was exposed to the current with a fraction of 80-90%. The brain and skull compartments were exposed between 6-13% and 3-6% of the total measured current respectively. In case of a flashover, most of the current (98-99%) flowed through the discharge channel. Unlike previous theoretical estimates and measurements in technical setups, we observed considerably longer times for the flashover to build up. In our experiments, the time to build up a fully formed flashover varied from approximately 30-700 μs. The observed current patterns in cases without and with flashover provided information on regions of possible damage in the human head. Consequently, we identified the phenomenon of a flashover as a potential mechanism for humans to survive a lightning strike. Our measured current distributions and amplitudes formed the base for normative values, which can be used in later experimental investigations regarding the possibilities of individual lightning protection equipment for humans."
https://openalex.org/W2975291588,"Alpha-motoneurons (MNs) innervating ankle extensor muscles show reduced peripheral inputs from Ia proprioceptive afferents and cholinergic afferents after chronic spinalization (SCT). That phenomenon is not observed on ankle flexor MNs, indicating a smaller vulnerability of the latter MNs circuit to SCT. Locomotor training of spinal rats which partially restored those inputs to extensor MNs tended to hyper innervate flexor MNs, disclosing a need for selective approaches. In rats with intact spinal cord 7-days of low-threshold proprioceptive stimulation of the tibial nerve enriched glutamatergic Ia and cholinergic innervation of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) MNs, suggesting usefulness of selective stimulation for restoration of inputs to extensor MNs after SCT. Accordingly, to examine its effectiveness after SCT, tibial nerves and soleus muscles were implanted bilaterally, and for MN identification fluorescence tracers to LG and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were injected two weeks prior to spinalization. Stimulation of tibial nerve, controlled by H-reflex recorded in the soleus muscle, started on the third post-SCT day and continued for 7 days. Nine days post-SCT the number and volume of glutamatergic Ia and of cholinergic C-boutons on LG MNs was decreased, but stimulation affected neither of them. Postsynaptically, a threefold decrease of NMDAR NR1 subunit and thirtyfold decrease of M2 muscarinic receptor transcripts caused by SCT were not counteracted by stimulation, whereas a threefold decrease of AMPAR GluR2 subunit tended to deepen after stimulation. We conclude that LG MNs, supported with proprioceptive stimuli after SCT, do not transcribe the perceived cues into compensatory response at the transcriptional level in the early post-SCT period."

The aim of this study was to examine whether or not the adherence of patients varies according to their receiving prescription or over-the-counter ONS. Data were obtained from an online cross-sectional survey conducted with patients in Japan. A total of 107 patients who matched the inclusion criteria for the prescription ONS group and 148 who matched the criteria for the over-the-counter ONS group were further analyzed. In the prescription and over-the-counter ONS groups, the main medical reason for ONS consumption were ""malnutrition"" (48 patients [44.9%] vs. 63 patients [42.6%] p = 0.798], ""frailty"" (29 patients [27.1%] vs. 36 patients [24.3%] p = 0.663) and ""aging"" (25 patients [23.4%] vs. 30 patients [20.3%] p = 0.644). The proportion of ""No particular disease"" for prescription ONS consumption was significantly lower than that for over-the-counter ONS (6 patients [5.6%] vs. 24 patients [16.2%] p = 0.001). The body mass index of the prescription ONS group was significantly higher than that of the over-the-counter ONS group (21.1±4.38 kg/m2 vs. 19.9±3.75 kg/m2, p = 0.0161). In the prescription ONS group, all patients were given medical advice by doctors or registered dietitians. In contrast, in the over-the-counter ONS group, only 46 patients (31.1%) were given advice by doctors or registered dietitians (p<0.001). In the prescription ONS group, ONS was taken significantly more times and for a longer duration than in the over-the-counter ONS group (p<0.0001). However, among patients given advice by doctors or registered dietitians, there were no significant differences between the groups.

Aim of this study was to prove the feasibility of accessing a partially inserted cochlear-implant-electrode for complete insertion to its maximum length through the external ear canal using a transcanal approach.Two CI electrodes were customized with 18 stimulating channels. The electrode design enables the use of 12 active channels available for electrical stimulation inside the cochlea both after partial and full insertion. 10 CI electrodes were implanted in 10 fresh human cadaveric temporal bones. After initial partial insertion by posterior tympanotomy, the electrode was inserted to its maximum length via a transcanal approach. Radiographs and CT scans were performed to confirm the electrode position. The electrodes were investigated via x-ray after removal.X-ray and CT-scans confirmed the electrode prototypes covering an angular insertion depth between 236° to 307° after initial insertion. Accessing the electrode in the middle ear space was feasible and insertion to its full length was successful. Post-insertion CT confirmed insertion of the 28mm and 31.5mm electrode arrays covering an angular insertion depth between 360° and 540° respectively. No tip foldovers were detected.This study confirms the feasibility of extending the electrode insertion to its maximum insertion length using a transcanal approach in temporal bone specimens. This constitutes a second stage procedure on demand in EAS-surgery. This may be beneficial for EAS-patients providing electrical stimulation beyond the basal turn of the cochlea once the functional residual hearing is lost, without replacing the entire CI."
https://openalex.org/W2976045082,"Research has found that preschoolers’ imitation demonstrates in-group bias and is guided by behavior efficacy. However, little is known about whether children’s sensitivity to behavior efficacy affects their in-group imitation. This study aimed to investigate preschoolers’ imitation tendency when group preference and behavior efficacy are in conflict. Participants were 4-year-old (N = 72) and 6-year-old (N = 72) preschoolers in China. They observed two demonstrators (one in-group and one out-group) pressing two different buttons, respectively, to turn on a music box, and were then asked to try it themselves. In the experimental condition, the out-group demonstrator always succeeded, whereas the in-group demonstrator failed half the time. The results showed that more 6-year-old children imitated the less-effective behaviors of the in-group demonstrator, whereas 4-year-old children showed no such inclination. Two control conditions confirmed that children chose to imitate in-group rather than out-group members (Control 1: both in-group and out-group demonstrators succeeded all four times), and could imitate according to efficacy (Control 2: two in-group demonstrators succeeded two and four times, respectively). These results indicated that 6-year-olds faithfully followed the in-group modeled behavior, regardless of behavior efficacy. Results are discussed through the social function of in-group imitative learning."

Understanding how these demographic patterns relate to older persons' cognitive health may inform efforts to reduce the disease burden due to cognitive decline. Data came from the China Health and Nutrition Survey in 1997, 2000 and 2004. Participants aged 55 to 93 who participated in a cognitive function screening test (score range: 0-31) in two or more waves and provided information on family members' migration (n = 1,267) were included in the analysis. A mixed linear model was used to investigate the association between being left behind by any members who had not resided in the household for at least 6 months at baseline and cognitive function. Approximately 10% of the participants had been left behind by family members who migrated out of their communities. A significant interaction was observed in relation to cognitive function between being left behind and the number of years from the first test. Specifically, there was a less steep decline in cognitive function of PLB compared to people not left behind. This longitudinal study showed that PLB tended to have a higher cognitive function compared to those not left behind due to their relatively stable transition in cognitive function during the study period."
https://openalex.org/W2975925336,"Since 2011, Kenya has been evaluating ShangRing device for use in its voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) program according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Compared to conventional surgical circumcision, the ShangRing procedure is shorter, does not require suturing and gives better cosmetic outcomes. After a pilot evaluation of ShangRing in 2011, Kenya conducted an active surveillance for adverse events associated with its use from 2016-2018 to further assess its safety, uptake and to identify any operational bottlenecks to its widespread use based on data from a larger pool of procedures in routine health care settings.From December 2017 to August 2018, HIV-negative VMMC clients aged 13 years or older seeking VMMC at six sites across five counties in Kenya were offered ShangRing under injectable local anesthetic as an alternative to conventional surgical circumcision. Providers described both procedures to clients before letting them make a choice. Outcome measures recorded for clients who chose ShangRing included the proportions who were clinically eligible, had successful device placement, experienced adverse events (AEs), or failed to return for device removal. Clients failing to return for follow up were sought through phone calls, text messages or home visits to ensure removal and complete information on adverse events.Out of 3,692 eligible clients 1,079 (29.2%) chose ShangRing; of these, 11 (1.0%) were excluded due to ongoing clinical conditions, 17 (1.6%) underwent conventional surgery due to lack of appropriate device size at the time of the procedure, 97.3% (1051/1079) had ShangRing placement. Uptake of ShangRing varied from 11% to 97% across different sites. There was one severe AE, a failed ShangRing placement (0.1%) managed by conventional wound suturing, plus two moderate AEs (0.2%), post removal wound dehiscence and bleeding, that resolved without sequelae. The overall AE rate was 0.3%. All clients returned for device removal from fifth to eleventh day after placement.ShangRing circumcision is effective and safe in the Kenyan context but its uptake varies widely in different settings. It should be rolled out under programmatic implementation for eligible males to take advantage of its unique benefits and the freedom of choice beyond conventional surgical MMC. Public education on its availability and unique advantages is necessary to optimize its uptake and to actualize the benefit of its inclusion in VMMC programs."

This study assessed the feasibility of an active learning training program and its effects on smoking cessation counselling skills of medical residents in Armenia, an Eastern European country with high smoking prevalence.The study used a pre-post assessment of smoking cessation counselling activities and a course evaluation survey to assess the feasibility of the intervention in a different environment.We adapted an active learning training model developed in Switzerland. Residents were trained in Yerevan, Armenia, using video-taped counselling sessions, role plays, standardized patients (actors), group discussions and immediate feedback. The training evaluation was done using a semi-structured anonymous questionnaire. The study assessed the physicians' self-reported smoking cessation counselling activities before and 6 months after the training. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to assess pre-post differences in physicians' counselling skills measured on ordinal scale.Of the 37 residents trained, 75% were female, 89% aged 20-29 years and 83% were never-smokers. Twenty-eight trainees (76%) returned the course evaluation survey and 32 (86%) answered a questionnaire on skills self-assessment at 6 months follow-up. The majority agreed the course was successful in achieving its learning objectives (64%-96%) and increased their confidence in assisting their patients to quit (74%). After 6 months, the physicians were more likely than at baseline to adhere to evidence-based counselling strategies, including assessing the smoking status and dependence and matching the advice to the patient motivation. The training did not, however, improve the prescription of tobacco dependence medications.Six months after the training, several self-reported smoking cessation counselling activities had significantly improved compared to baseline. This training model is acceptable for medical residents in Yerevan, Armenia and offers a promising approach in addressing the lack of physician counselling skills in similar settings and populations."

Here, we used optical tweezers to study the unfolding/refolding of rpoS inhibitory stem in the absence and presence of Mg2+. We found adding Mg2+ decreased the free energy of the RNA junction without re-arranging its secondary structure, through confirming that this RNA formed a canonical RNA three-way junction. We suspected increased free energy might change the relative orientation of different stems of rpoS and confirmed this by small angle X-ray scattering. Such changed conformation may improve Hfq-bridged annealing between sRNA and rpoS RNA inhibitory stem. We established a convenient route to analyze the changes of RNA conformation and folding dynamics by combining optical tweezers with X-ray scattering methods. This route can be easily applied in the studies of other RNA structure and ligand-RNA."

The physiological performance was evaluated by analyzing the water content, germination, first germination count, germination speed index, electrical conductivity, seedling emergence, and seedling length and dry mass. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were carried out with quantitative analyses (Ca, P, K, and S concentration in the seed coat and the whole seed) and qualitative analyses (macronutrient mapping). The EDXRF and μ-XRF techniques are efficient and promising to differentiate the physiological performance of C. ochroleuca seeds, based on the concentration and distribution of Ca, P, K, and S in different structures. Ca is predominant in the seed coat, and K, S, and P are found throughout the embryonic axis. Seeds of yellow and green coats have higher nutrients concentration and distribution in the embryonic axis, revealing high germinative capacity and physiological performance. Seeds of red coat have higher nutrients concentration in the seed coat and lower assimilation, showing less vigour, which interferes directly in the quality of commercial lots."
https://openalex.org/W2977133305,"The understanding of mammalian spermatogenesis niche factors active during sexual development may be leveraged to impact reproduction in farm animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of r-met-hu/G-CSF (filgrastim) on prepubertal sexual development of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) and ram lambs (Ovis aries). Individuals of both species were administered r-met-hu/G-CSF daily for 4 days. During and after administration protocols, testicular function and development were assessed through hematological responses, hormonal profiles (gonadotropins, testosterone and cortisol) testicular morphometry and germ cell kinetics. As expected, r-met-hu/G-CSF acutely mobilized white-lineage blood cells in both species. LH was increased by r-met-hu/G-CSF in guinea pigs (P<0.01) but T remained unchanged. In ram lambs gonadotropins and T increased in dose-response fashion (P<0.01) while cortisol values were stable and similar in treated and control animals (P>0.05). In guinea pigs there were no differences in testicular weights and volumes 2-mo after r-met-hu/G-CSF application (P>0.05). However, ram lambs showed a dose-response effect regarding testis weight (P<0.05). 66.66% of ram lambs had initial testes not yet in meiosis or starting the first spermatogenic wave. After 60-days only 25% of control animals were pubertal while all treated animals (1140-μg) had reached puberty. We propose an integrated hypothesis that G-CSF can stimulate spermatogenesis through two possible ways. 1) r-met-hu/G-CSF may go through the brain blood barrier and once there it can stimulate GnRH-neurons to release GnRH with the subsequent release of gonadotrophins. 2) a local testicular effect through stimulation of steroidogenesis that enhances spermiogenesis via testosterone production and a direct stimulation over spermatogonial stem cells self-renewal. In conclusion, this study shows that r-met-hu/G-CSF differentially affects prepubertal sexual development in hystricomorpha and ovine species, a relevant fact to consider when designing methods to hasten sexual developmental in mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2975318616,"The capture precision of the free surface of an open-channel with a water-air interface directly affects the calculation precision of flow field characteristics and general characteristics of the flow. Significant research effort has been devoted to Level Set since its creation, although the relevant research is mainly limited to bubble or droplet movement. In this paper, Level Set method is applied to a two-dimensional numerical simulation of open-channel turbulence, while a new numerical model is proposed and multispot synchronized experimental data are applied to the validation of numerical model. In addition, the model is used to study the flow field characteristics and general characteristics of open-channel flow, which have a water-level lowering curve. The study shows that (1) a semilogarithm zone of vertical distribution of longitudinal velocity is still present amid the transition of flow from nonuniform to uniform, and the depth-averaged velocity and wall shear stress increase along the flowing path. (2) both the energy loss coefficient and roughness coefficient of the flow at nonuniform flow region are greater than the respective values at uniform flow region, and the magnitude of the deviation is relevant to the magnitude of the flow deviation from uniform flow stage."
https://openalex.org/W2977214743,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) allow lecturers to overcome spatiotemporal boundaries and reach large numbers of participants. However, the completion rates of MOOCs are relatively low, a critical obstacle to their ultimate success. Existing literature suggests that strengthening student interaction has the potential to increase student commitment. The goal of this study is to develop a novel, market-based knowledge-sharing method that fosters student engagement and interaction in MOOCs, addressing the problem of low completion rates and demonstrating how MOOC engagement can lead to greater student success. The proposed method, “Knowledge Stock Exchange” (KSX), is derived from the concept of crowd-based intelligence mechanisms for incentive-compatible information aggregation. Using a popular MOOC as the focus of our empirical study, we show that the KSX method increases student interaction as well as MOOC completion rates. Moreover, we find that KSX participation has a significant positive effect on participants’ exam grades."
https://openalex.org/W2935290860,"A recent work by Hern\'andez et al. introduced a networked voting rule supported by a trust-based social network, where indications of possible representatives were based on individuals opinions. Individual contributions went beyond a simple vote-counting and were based on proxy voting. These mechanisms generated a high level of representativeness of the selected committee, weakening the possibility of relations of patronage. By incorporating the integrity of individuals and its perception, here we address the question of the trustability of the resulting committee. Our results show that this voting rule provides high representativeness for small committees with a high level of integrity. Furthermore, the voting system displays robustness to a strategic and untruthful application of the voting algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2975228435,"This article proposes methodology for evaluating the accuracy of the pore pressure generation model devised by Byrne, as implemented in a commercial software program using a Mohr-Coulomb-type failure criterion and a Finn constitutive model. The different empirical formulas of liquefaction developed by Seed and Idriss are reviewed, as well as various constitutive models specified in the literature, emphasizing the selection of the Finn model for the liquefaction study. In the analysis a comparison is carried out using the factors of safety against liquefaction (FSLs) devised by Seed and Idriss and the adapted formula by Boulanger and Idriss. The analysis assumes a hypothesis to verify whether a soil element is liquefied. The results are then compared with those of a numerical model that simulates a soil column, the base of which is subjected to the same seismic inputs of varying magnitudes, Mw, and peak ground accelerations, Pga, to which the empirical model was subjected. Adjusted equations are provided on the based on that comparison to allow for the calibration of the Byrne equation using the (N1)60 value obtained via a standard penetration test (SPT), for the study of liquefaction problems in situations in which there are earthquakes of varying magnitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2975789556,"SET (also called I2PP2A and TIF-1) is a multi-functional protein that regulates a variety of cell signaling including nucleosome assembly, histone binding, and tumorigenesis. Elevated SET protein levels are observed in various human tumors, and are correlated with poor prognosis and drug-resistance. We recently reported that SET protein levels in cancer cells were positively correlated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Using immunohistochemistry, SET protein was observed not only in cancer cells, but also in some interstitial cells. However, the tissue distribution of SET has not been investigated. Here we performed co-immunofluorescent staining to characterize SET protein distribution in gastrointestinal tissues. We found that even though the positive rate is much lower than epithelial cells, SET protein is also expressed in non-epithelial cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, neural cells, myofibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. Our results indicate an extensive role of SET in a variety of cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2976269602,"Soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization represents one of the largest fluxes in the global carbon cycle. Numerous studies have shown that soil organic carbon decomposition was largely changed owing to the addition of litter, however very few studies have focused on the role of plant organs in the priming effects (PEs). Here, we studied the effects of different Pinus massoniana organs (fresh leaf, leaf litter, twigs, absorptive fine roots, and transport fine roots) on C4 soil respiration by applying the 13C isotopic natural abundance method. Results showed that the effects of plant organs on PEs were significantly different at the end of 210 days incubation, which can be ascribed to contrasting organs traits especially non-structural carbohydrates and water-soluble compounds. Transport fine roots and fresh leaf induced positive PE, whereas absorptive fine roots induced negative PE. Leaf litter did not change the native SOC decomposition. Plant organ addition can change the microbial community and result in the reduction of bacteria-to-fungi ratio. Our results suggest that with regard to determining the PE of the entire ecosystem, using fresh leaf to represent leaf litter and aboveground to represent underground is implausible."
