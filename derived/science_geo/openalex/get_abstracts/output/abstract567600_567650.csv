https://openalex.org/W2511372061,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an invariably fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Despite a 100% fatality rate, areas of high prevalence, and increasingly expanding geographic endemic areas, little is known about the population-level effects of CWD in deer. To investigate these effects, we tested the null hypothesis that high prevalence CWD did not negatively impact white-tailed deer population sustainability. The specific objectives of the study were to monitor CWD-positive and CWD-negative white-tailed deer in a high-prevalence CWD area longitudinally via radio-telemetry and global positioning system (GPS) collars. For the two populations, we determined the following: a) demographic and disease indices, b) annual survival, and c) finite rate of population growth (λ). The CWD prevalence was higher in females (42%) than males (28.8%) and hunter harvest and clinical CWD were the most frequent causes of mortality, with CWD-positive deer over-represented in harvest and total mortalities. Survival was significantly lower for CWD-positive deer and separately by sex; CWD-positive deer were 4.5 times more likely to die annually than CWD-negative deer while bucks were 1.7 times more likely to die than does. Population λ was 0.896 (0.859-0.980), which indicated a 10.4% annual decline. We show that a chronic disease that becomes endemic in wildlife populations has the potential to be population-limiting and the strong population-level effects of CWD suggest affected populations are not sustainable at high disease prevalence under current harvest levels."

The aim of this study was to elucidate the status of pro-inflammatory cytokines and biochemical markers and possible correlation of these factors towards outcome of the disease.The study was carried out on 29 T1D subjects and 20 healthy subjects. Plasma levels of oxidative stress markers, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were estimated employing biochemical assays. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as by IL-1β & IL-17 in the serum were determined by ELISA, while the expression of TNF-α, IL-23 & IFN-γ was ascertained by qRT-PCR.The onset of T1D disease was accompanied with elevation in levels of Plasma malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content and nitric oxide while plasma vitamin C, reduced glutathione and erythrocyte sulfhydryl groups were found to be significantly decreased in T1D patients as compared to healthy control subjects. Activity of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-s-transferase showed a significant suppression in the erythrocytes of T1D patients as compared to healthy subjects. Nevertheless, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-17A were significantly augmented (***p≤.001) on one hand, while expression of T cell based cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-23 was also up-regulated (*p≤.05) as compared to healthy human subjects.The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and specific biochemical markers in the serum of the patient can be exploited as potential markers for type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. The study suggests that level of inflammatory markers is up-regulated in T1D patients in an age dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2513123599,"Background Previous studies have documented that heightened impulsivity likely contributes to the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorders. However, there is still a lack of studies that comprehensively detected the brain changes associated with abnormal impulsivity in alcohol addicts. This study was designed to investigate the alterations in brain structure and functional connectivity associated with abnormal impulsivity in alcohol dependent patients. Methods Brain structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data as well as impulsive behavior data were collected from 20 alcohol dependent patients and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls respectively. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume, and tract-based spatial statistics was used to detect abnormal white matter regions between alcohol dependent patients and healthy controls. The alterations in resting-state functional connectivity in alcohol dependent patients were examined using selected brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. Results Compared with healthy controls, alcohol dependent patients had significantly reduced gray matter volume in the mesocorticolimbic system including the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the putamen, decreased fractional anisotropy in the regions connecting the damaged grey matter areas driven by higher radial diffusivity value in the same areas and decreased resting-state functional connectivity within the reward network. Moreover, the gray matter volume of the left medial prefrontal cortex exhibited negative correlations with various impulse indices. Conclusions These findings suggest that chronic alcohol dependence could cause a complex neural changes linked to abnormal impulsivity."
https://openalex.org/W2512423612,"We investigated the gastrointestinal colonization rate and antibiotic resistance patterns of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)- producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients admitted at Ethiopia's largest tertiary hospital. Fecal samples/swabs from 267 patients were cultured on chrome agar. ESBL. Bacterial species identification, verification of ESBL production and antibiotic susceptibility testing were done using Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, France). Phenotype characterization of ESBL-E.coli and ESBL- K.pneumoniae was done using Neo-Sensitabs™. ESBL positivity rate was much higher in K. pneumoniae (76%) than E. coli (45%). The overall gastrointestinal colonization rate of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) in hospitalized patients was 52% (95%CI; 46%-58%) of which, ESBL-E. coli and K.pneumoniae accounted for 68% and 32% respectively. Fecal ESBL-E carriage rate in neonates, children and adults was 74%, 59% and 46% respectively. Gastrointestinal colonization rate of ESBL-E.coli in neonates, children and adults was 11%, 42% and 42% respectively. Of all E. coli strains isolated from adults, children and neonates, 44%, 49% and 22% were ESBL positive (p = 0.28). The prevalence of ESBL-K.pneumoniae carriage in neonates, children and adults was 68%, 22% and 7% respectively. All K. pneumoniae isolated from neonates (100%) and 88% of K. pneumoniae isolated from children were ESBL positive, but only 50% of K.pneumoniae isolated from adults were ESBL positive (p = 0.001). Thirteen patients (5%) were carriers of both ESBL-E.coli and ESBL-KP. The overall carrier rate of ESBL producing isolates resistant to carbapenem was 2% (5/267), all detected in children; three with E.coli HL cephalosporinase (AmpC), resistant to ertapenem and two with K. pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC) resistant to meropenem, ertapenem and impenem. We report a high gastrointestinal colonization rate with ESBL-E and the emergence of carbapenems-resistant K. pneumoniae in Ethiopia. Urgent implementation of infection control measures, and surveillance are urgently needed to limit the spread within healthcare facilities and further to the community."
https://openalex.org/W2517815064,"Inshore coral reefs are experiencing the combined pressures of excess nutrient availability associated with coastal activities and warming seawater temperatures. Both pressures are known to have detrimental effects on the early life history stages of hard corals, but studies of their combined effects on early demographic stages are lacking. We conducted a series of experiments to test the combined effects of nutrient enrichment (three levels) and elevated seawater temperature (up to five levels) on early life history stages of the inshore coral Acropora tenuis, a common species in the Indo-Pacific and Red Sea. Gamete fertilization, larval survivorship and larval settlement were all significantly reduced as temperature increased, but only fertilization was further affected by simultaneous nutrient enrichment. Combined high temperatures and nutrient enrichment affected fertilization in an additive manner, whereas embryo abnormalities increased synergistically. Higher than normal temperatures (32°C) increased coral juvenile growth rates 1.6-fold, but mortality also increased by 50%. The co-occurrence of nutrient enrichment with high temperatures reduced juvenile mortality to 36%, ameliorating temperature stress (antagonistic interaction). Overall, the types of effect (additive vs synergistic or antagonistic) and their magnitude varied among life stages. Gamete and embryo stages were more affected by temperature stress and, in some cases, also by nutrient enrichment than juveniles. The data suggest that coastal runoff events might exacerbate the impacts of warming temperatures on fertilization if these events co-occur during corals spawning. The cumulative impacts of simultaneous exposure to nutrient enrichment and elevated temperatures over all early life history stages increases the likelihood for failure of larval supply and recruitment for this coral species. Our results suggest that improving the water quality of river discharges into coastal areas might help to enhance the thermal tolerances of early life history stages in this common coral species."
https://openalex.org/W2517534917,"Several studies have found that fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms after stroke and the most difficult to cope with. The present study aimed to investigate the presence and severity of self-reported fatigue six years after stroke onset and associated factors. The cohort “Life After Stroke Phase I” (n = 349 persons) was invited at six years to report fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale 7-item version), perceived impact of stroke and global recovery after stroke (Stroke Impact Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), life satisfaction (Life Satisfaction Checklist) and participation in everyday social activities (Frenchay Activities Index). At six years 37% of the 102 participants in this cross-sectional study reported fatigue. The results showed that in nearly all SIS domains the odds for post-stroke fatigue were higher in persons with a higher perceived impact. Furthermore, the odds for post-stroke fatigue were higher in those who had experienced a moderate/severe stroke and had signs of depression and anxiety. Fatigue is still present in one-third of persons as long as six years after stroke onset and is perceived to hinder many aspects of functioning in everyday life. There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate interventions to reduce fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2508333710,"Anthropogenic debris in the world's oceans and coastal environments is a pervasive global issue that has both direct and indirect impacts on avifauna. The number of bird species affected, the feeding ecologies associated with an increased risk of debris ingestion, and selectivity of ingested debris have yet to be investigated in most of Australia's coastal and marine birds. With this study we aim to address the paucity of data regarding marine debris ingestion in Australian coastal and marine bird species. We investigated which Australian bird groups ingest marine debris, and whether debris-ingesting groups exhibit selectivity associated with their taxonomy, habitat or foraging methods. Here we present the largest multispecies study of anthropogenic debris ingestion in Australasian avifauna to date. We necropsied and investigated the gastrointestinal contents of 378 birds across 61 species, collected dead across eastern Australia. These species represented nine taxonomic orders, five habitat groups and six feeding strategies. Among investigated species, thirty percent had ingested debris, though ingestion did not occur uniformly within the orders of birds surveyed. Debris ingestion was found to occur in orders Procellariiformes, Suliformes, Charadriiformes and Pelecaniformes, across all surveyed habitats, and among birds that foraged by surface feeding, pursuit diving and search-by-sight. Procellariiformes, birds in pelagic habitats, and surface feeding marine birds ingested debris with the greatest frequency. Among birds which were found to ingest marine debris, we investigated debris selectivity and found that marine birds were selective with respect to both type and colour of debris. Selectivity for type and colour of debris significantly correlated with taxonomic order, habitat and foraging strategy. This study highlights the significant impact of feeding ecology on debris ingestion among Australia's avifauna."
https://openalex.org/W2508095539,"Higher global temperatures and increased levels of disturbance are contributing to greater tree mortality in many forest ecosystems. These same drivers can also limit forest regeneration, leading to vegetation type conversion. For the Sierra Nevada of California, little is known about how type conversion may affect streamflow, a critical source of water supply for urban, agriculture and environmental purposes. In this paper, we examined the effects of tree-to-shrub type conversion, in combination with climate change, on streamflow in two lower montane forest watersheds in the Sierra Nevada. A spatially distributed ecohydrologic model was used to simulate changes in streamflow, evaporation, and transpiration following type conversion, with an explicit focus on the role of vegetation size and aspect. Model results indicated that streamflow may show negligible change or small decreases following type conversion when the difference between tree and shrub leaf areas is small, partly due to the higher stomatal conductivity and the deep rooting depth of shrubs. In contrast, streamflow may increase when post-conversion shrubs have a small leaf area relative to trees. Model estimates also suggested that vegetation change could have a greater impact on streamflow magnitude than the direct hydrologic impacts of increased temperatures. Temperature increases, however, may have a greater impact on streamflow timing. Tree-to-shrub type conversion increased streamflow only marginally during dry years (annual precipitation < 800 mm), with most streamflow change observed during wetter years. These modeling results underscore the importance of accounting for changes in vegetation communities to accurately characterize future hydrologic regimes for the Sierra Nevada."
https://openalex.org/W2513295452,"Introduction Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is among the top 10 infectious disease priorities in the world, and the leading cause of morbidity in Iran. The present study was conducted to assess the risk of CL, and to determine some epidemiological features of the disease in endemic areas of Qom Province in Central Iran during 2009 to 2013. Methods Data regarding human cases of the disease were obtained from the Qom Province Health Center, prepared and stored in a spatial database created in ArcGIS10.3. A total of 9 out of 212 Leishmania spp. positive slides taken in 2013 from patients residing in Qom city were examined using molecular methods and the species of Leishmania was identified by PCR-RFLP. Those 9 patients had no history of travel outside the city. Spatial analysis and clustering methods were applied to find major hot spots and susceptible areas for the establishment of novel foci of the disease. Transmission patterns were examined for spatial autocorrelation using the Moran's I statistical application, and for the clustering of high or low values using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics. Results During the period of study, a total of 1767 CL cases were passively reported in the area, out of which were 65% males and 35% females. The highest and lowest numbers of cases were reported in 2010 and 2013, respectively. Importantly, 979 cases were reported from urban areas, while the remainder came from rural areas. Leishmania major was detected as the causative agent of CL in the city of Qom. Remarkably, most patients recorded in Qom city were associated with a history of travel to the endemic areas of CL within the province, or to other endemic areas of the disease in Iran. Spatial distribution of CL cases revealed northeastern and southwestern quarters of the city were the major hot spots of the disease (P<0.05). Hot spot and CL transmission risk analysis across the province indicated that more than 40 villages were located in high and very high risk areas of CL transmission. Conclusions Due to the existence of hot spots (P<0.05) of CL in successive years in some quarters of Qom city, along with detection of L. major from the patients without a history of travel, there may be potential of local transmission of the disease within the city. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study concerning the hot spots of CL in Qom city for curtailing the incidence of the disease in the city. The methodology and the results of this study is essential in serving as a yardstick for subsequent similar studies that will be carried out in other endemic areas of CL in Iran and providing an adequate tool for the establishment of a national database of cutaneous leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W2512399739,"Soils are a sink for sulfidised-silver nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs), yet there are limited ecotoxicity data for their effects on microbial communities. Conventional toxicity tests typically target a single test species or function, which does not reflect the broader community response. Using a combination of quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and species sensitivity distribution (SSD) methods, we have developed a new approach to calculate silver-based NP toxicity thresholds (HCx, hazardous concentrations) that are protective of specific members (operational taxonomic units, OTUs) of the soil microbial community. At the HC20 (80% of species protected), soil OTUs were significantly less sensitive to Ag2S-NPs compared to AgNPs and Ag+ (5.9, 1.4 and 1.4 mg Ag kg-1, respectively). However at more conservative HC values, there were no significant differences. These trends in OTU responses matched with those seen in a specific microbial function (rate of nitrification) and amoA-bacteria gene abundance. This study provides a novel molecular-based framework for quantifying the effect of a toxicant on whole soil microbial communities while still determining sensitive genera/species. Methods and results described here provide a benchmark for microbial community ecotoxicological studies and we recommend that future revisions of Soil Quality Guidelines for AgNPs and other such toxicants consider this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2518356634,"Extensively spectral-responsive photocatalytic hydrogen production was achieved over g-C3N4 photo-sensitized by Au nanoparticles. The photo-sensitization, which was achieved by a facile photo-assisted reduction route, resulted in an extended spectral range of absorption from 460 to 640 nm. The photo-sensitized g-C3N4 (Au/g-C3N4) photocatalysts exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with a TOF value of 223 μmol g-1 h-1, which is a 130-fold improvement over g-C3N4. The hydrogen production result confirms that Au nanoparticles are effective photo-sensitizers for the visible light-responsive substrate g-C3N4. UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS), photoluminescence spectra (PL), electron spin resonance (ESR), and electrochemical measurements were used to investigate the transfer process of photogenerated electrons. The optimal Au/g-C3N4 photocatalyst displays the lowest charge transfer resistance of 18.45 Ω cm-2 and a high electron transfer efficiency, as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The photo-sensitized g-C3N4 shows a broad range of response to visible light (400–640 nm), with significantly high incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) values of 14.52%, 2.9%, and 0.74% under monochromatic light irradiation of 400, 550, and 640 nm, respectively. ESR characterization suggests that Au nanoparticles are able to absorb visible light of wavelengths higher than 460 nm and to generate hot electrons due to the SPR effect."
https://openalex.org/W2513448634,"There has been little research into brachycephalism and associated disorders in cats. A questionnaire aimed at cat owners was used to determine the relationship between feline facial conformation and owner-reported cat management requirements and respiratory abnormalities. Owner-submitted photographs of cats were used to develop novel measures of skull conformation. One thousand valid questionnaires were received. Within these there were 373 valid photographs that allowed measurement of muzzle ratio (M%) and 494 that allowed nose position ratio (NP%). The data included 239 cats for which both measurements were available. Owners reported lifestyle factors (e.g. feeding type, grooming routine, activity level), physical characteristics (e.g. hair length) and other health characteristics of their cat (e.g. tear staining, body condition score). A composite respiratory score (RS) was calculated for each cat using their owner's assessment of respiratory noise whilst their cat was asleep and then breathing difficulty following activity. Multivariate analyses were carried out using linear models to explore the relationship between RS and facial conformation, and lifestyle risk factors. The results showed that reductions in NP% and M% were significantly associated with RS (P < 0.001 and P = 0.026, respectively) and that the relationship was significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.56, P < 0.001 for both). Respiratory score was also significantly associated with increased presence of tear staining (P < 0.001) and a sedentary lifestyle (P = 0.01). This study improves current knowledge concerning cats with breeding-related alterations in skull confirmation and indicates that brachycephalism may have negative respiratory implications for cat health and welfare, as has been previously shown in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2518426247,"Mid-substance rupture of the canine cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CR) and associated stifle osteoarthritis (OA) is an important veterinary health problem. CR causes stifle joint instability and contralateral CR often develops. The dog is an important model for human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, where rupture of graft repair or the contralateral ACL is also common. This suggests that both genetic and environmental factors may increase ligament rupture risk. We investigated use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to reduce systemic and stifle joint inflammatory responses in dogs with CR. Twelve dogs with unilateral CR and contralateral stable partial CR were enrolled prospectively. BM-MSCs were collected during surgical treatment of the unstable CR stifle and culture-expanded. BM-MSCs were subsequently injected at a dose of 2x106 BM-MSCs/kg intravenously and 5x106 BM-MSCs by intra-articular injection of the partial CR stifle. Blood (entry, 4 and 8 weeks) and stifle synovial fluid (entry and 8 weeks) were obtained after BM-MSC injection. No adverse events after BM-MSC treatment were detected. Circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes were lower after BM-MSC injection. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was decreased at 4 weeks and serum CXCL8 was increased at 8 weeks. Synovial CRP in the complete CR stifle was decreased at 8 weeks. Synovial IFNγ was also lower in both stifles after BM-MSC injection. Synovial/serum CRP ratio at diagnosis in the partial CR stifle was significantly correlated with development of a second CR. Systemic and intra-articular injection of autologous BM-MSCs in dogs with partial CR suppresses systemic and stifle joint inflammation, including CRP concentrations. Intra-articular injection of autologous BM-MSCs had profound effects on the correlation and conditional dependencies of cytokines using causal networks. Such treatment effects could ameliorate risk of a second CR by modifying the stifle joint inflammatory response associated with cranial cruciate ligament matrix degeneration or damage."
https://openalex.org/W2509142740,"Purpose To investigate the reliability and validity of the SQUASH physical activity (PA) questionnaire in a multi-ethnic population living in the Netherlands. Methods We included participants from the HELIUS study, a population-based cohort study. In this study we included Dutch (n = 114), Turkish (n = 88), Moroccan (n = 74), South-Asian Surinamese (n = 98) and African Surinamese (n = 91) adults, aged 18–70 years. The SQUASH was self-administered twice to assess test-re-test reliability (mean interval 6–7 weeks) and participants wore an accelerometer and heart rate monitor (Actiheart) to enable assessment of construct validity. Results We observed low test-re-test reliability; Intra class correlation coefficients ranged from low (0.05 for moderate/high intensity PA in African Surinamese women) to acceptable (0.78 for light intensity PA in Moroccan women). The discrepancy between self-reported and measured PA differed on the basis of the intensity of activity: self-reported light intensity PA was lower than measured but self-reported moderate/high intensity PA was higher than measured, with wide limits of agreement. The discrepancy between questionnaire and Actiheart measures of moderate intensity PA did not differ between ethnic minority and Dutch participants with correction for relevant confounders. Additionally, the SQUASH overestimated the number of participants meeting the Dutch PA norm; Cohen’s kappas for the agreement were poor, the highest being 0.30 in Dutch women. Conclusion We found considerable variation in the test-re-test reliability and validity of self-reported PA with no consistency based on ethnic origin. Our findings imply that the SQUASH does not provide a valid basis for comparison of PA between ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2513377838,"Background The continuous exposure to inorganic mercury vapour in artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) areas leads to chronic health problems. It is therefore essential to have a quick, but reliable risk assessing tool to diagnose chronic inorganic mercury intoxication. This study re-evaluates the state-of-the-art toolkit to diagnose chronic inorganic mercury intoxication by analysing data from multiple pooled cross-sectional studies. The primary research question aims to reduce the currently used set of indicators without affecting essentially the capability to diagnose chronic inorganic mercury intoxication. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed on established biomonitoring exposure limits for mercury in blood, hair, urine and urine adjusted by creatinine, where the biomonitoring exposure limits are compared to thresholds most associated with chronic inorganic mercury intoxication in artisanal small-scale gold mining. Methods Health data from miners and community members in Indonesia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe were obtained as part of the Global Mercury Project and pooled into one dataset together with their biomarkers mercury in urine, blood and hair. The individual prognostic impact of the indicators on the diagnosis of mercury intoxication is quantified using logistic regression models. The selection is performed by a stepwise forward/backward selection. Different models are compared based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Cohen`s kappa is used to evaluate the level of agreement between the diagnosis of mercury intoxication based on the currently used set of indicators and the result based on our reduced set of indicators. The sensitivity analysis of biomarker exposure limits of mercury is based on a sequence of chi square tests. Results The variable selection in logistic regression reduced the number of medical indicators from thirteen to ten in addition to the biomarkers. The estimated level of agreement using ten of thirteen medical indicators and all four biomarkers to diagnose chronic inorganic mercury intoxication yields a Cohen`s Kappa of 0.87. While in an additional stepwise selection the biomarker blood was not selected, the level of agreement based on ten medical indicators and only the three biomarkers urine, urine/creatinine and hair reduced Cohen`s Kappa to 0.46. The optimal cut-point for the biomarkers blood, hair, urine and urine/creatinine were estimated at 11. 6 μg/l, 3.84 μg/g, 24.4 μg/l and 4.26 μg/g, respectively. Conclusion The results show that a reduction down to only ten indicators still allows a reliable diagnosis of chronic inorganic mercury intoxication. This reduction of indicators will simplify health assessments in artisanal small-scale gold mining areas."
https://openalex.org/W2510129303,"Osteoarthritis (OA) in humans is associated with low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]. In vitamin D replete rats, radiolabeled 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24R,25(OH)2D3] accumulates in articular cartilage following injection of [3H]-25(OH)D3. Previously, we showed that 24R,25(OH)2D3 blocks chondrocyte apoptosis via phospholipase D and p53, suggesting a role for 24R,25(OH)2D3 in maintaining cartilage health. We examined the ability of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to prevent degenerative changes in articular cartilage in an OA-like environment and the potential mechanisms involved. In vitro, rat articular chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β with and without 24R,25(OH)2D3 or 1α,25(OH)2D3. 24R,25(OH)2D3 but not 1α,25(OH)2D3 blocked the effects of IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner, and its effect was partially mediated through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. In vivo, unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transections were performed in immunocompetent rats followed by intra-articular injections of 24R,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle (t = 0, 7, 14, 21 days). Tissues were harvested on day 28. Joints treated with vehicle had changes typical of OA whereas joints treated with 24R,25(OH)2D3 had less articular cartilage damage and levels of inflammatory mediators. These results indicate that 24R,25(OH)2D3 protects against OA, and suggest that it may be a therapeutic approach for preventing trauma-induced osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2510890404,"This study analyzed clinical and microbiological characteristics of heteroresistant (hVISA) and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) from bloodstream infections (BSI) in a Brazilian teaching hospital, between 2011 and 2013. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antimicrobials were determined by broth microdilution method and SCCmec was detected by PCR. Isolates with a vancomycin MIC ≥ 2mg/L were cultured on BHI agar with 3, 4 or 6 mg/L (BHIa3, BHIa4 or BHIa6) of vancomycin and BHIa4 with casein (BHIa4ca). Macromethod Etest® and Etest® Glicopeptides Resistance Detection were also used. VISA and hVISA isolates were confirmed by the population analysis profile then typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. Medical data from the patients were obtained from their medical records. Among 110 consecutive isolates, 31 (28%) were MRSA and carried the SCCmec type II (15 isolates) or IV (16 isolates). Vancomycin MIC50 and MIC90 were 1 and 2 mg/L, respectively. MRSA isolates had increased non-susceptibility to daptomycin (p = 0.0003). Six (5%) isolates were VISA, four of which were MRSA, three SCCmec type II/USA100/ST5 and one type IV/USA800/ST3192. One MRSA SCCmec II isolate grew on agar BHIa3, BHIa4 and BHIa4ca, and it was confirmed as hVISA. Among the six VISA isolates, five (83%) grew on BHIa3 and three (50%) on BHI4ca. Four of the six VISA isolates and the one hVISA isolate were from patients who had undergone dialysis. Thus, a possible dissemination of the SCCmec II/USA100/ST5 lineage may have occurred in the hospital comprising the VISA, hVISA and daptomycin non-susceptible S. aureus Brazilian isolates from health care associated bloodstream infections."
https://openalex.org/W2511344992,"MitoNEET (mNT) (CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 1 or CISD1) is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that donates 2Fe-2S clusters to apo-acceptor proteins. In the present study, using a global mNT knock-out (mNTKO) mouse model, we investigated the in vivo functional role of mNT in the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis. Experimental alcoholic steatohepatitis was achieved by pair feeding wild-type (WT) and mNTKO mice with Lieber-DeCarli ethanol-containing diets for 4 weeks. Strikingly, chronically ethanol-fed mNTKO mice were completely resistant to ethanol-induced steatohepatitis as revealed by dramatically reduced hepatic triglycerides, decreased hepatic cholesterol level, diminished liver inflammatory response, and normalized serum ALT levels. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ethanol administration to mNTKO mice induced two pivotal endocrine hormones, namely, adipose-derived adiponectin and gut-derived fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15). The elevation in circulating levels of adiponectin and Fgf15 led to normalized hepatic and serum levels of bile acids, limited hepatic accumulation of toxic bile, attenuated inflammation, and amelioration of liver injury in the ethanol-fed mNTKO mice. Other potential mechanisms such as reduced oxidative stress, activated Sirt1 signaling, and diminished NF-κB activity also contribute to hepatic improvement in the ethanol-fed mNTKO mice. In conclusion, the present study identified adiponectin and Fgf15 as pivotal adipose-gut-liver metabolic coordinators in mediating the protective action of mNT deficiency against development of alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice. Our findings may help to establish mNT as a novel therapeutic target and pharmacological inhibition of mNT may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of human alcoholic steatohepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2513003487,"Mutations in the ferritin light chain (FTL) gene cause the neurodegenerative disease neuroferritinopathy or hereditary ferritinopathy (HF). HF is characterized by a severe movement disorder and by the presence of nuclear and cytoplasmic iron-containing ferritin inclusion bodies (IBs) in glia and neurons throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and in tissues of multiple organ systems. Herein, using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from a mouse model of HF, we show significant intracellular accumulation of ferritin and an increase in susceptibility to oxidative damage when cells are exposed to iron. Treatment of the cells with the iron chelator deferiprone (DFP) led to a significant improvement in cell viability and a decrease in iron content. In vivo, iron overload and DFP treatment of the mouse model had remarkable effects on systemic iron homeostasis and ferritin deposition, without significantly affecting CNS pathology. Our study highlights the role of iron in modulating ferritin aggregation in vivo in the disease HF. It also puts emphasis on the potential usefulness of a therapy based on chelators that can target the CNS to remove and redistribute iron and to resolubilize or prevent ferritin aggregation while maintaining normal systemic iron stores."

In this study we have (1) elicited patient preferences for benefits, side effects and process characteristics of treatments and (2) measured patients’ preferred and perceived involvement in decision-making about treatment. Methods Preferences were elicited using a best-worst scaling case 2 experiment. Attributes were selected based on 18 patient-interviews: treatment modality, tremor, slowness of movement, posture and balance problems, drowsiness, dizziness, and dyskinesia. Subsequently, a questionnaire was distributed in which patients were asked to indicate the most and least desirable attribute in nine possible treatment scenarios. Conditional logistic analysis and latent class analysis were used to estimate preference weights and identify subgroups. Patients also indicated their preferred and perceived degree of involvement in treatment decision-making (ranging from active to collaborative to passive). Results Two preference patterns were found in the patient sample (N = 192). One class of patients focused largely on optimising the process of care, while the other class focused more on controlling motor-symptoms. Patients who had experienced advanced treatments, had a shorter disease duration, or were still employed were more likely to belong to the latter class. For both classes, the benefits of treatment were more influential than the described side effects. Furthermore, many patients (45%) preferred to take the lead in treatment decisions, however 10.8% perceived a more passive or collaborative role instead. Discussion Patients weighted the benefits and side effects of treatment differently, indicating there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to choosing treatments. Moreover, many patients preferred an active role in decision-making about treatment. Both results stress the need for physicians to know what is important to patients and to share treatment decisions to ensure that patients receive the treatment that aligns with their preferences."

While inflammation is responsible for widespread organ damage, anti-inflammatory mediators lead to immunoparalysis increasing susceptibility to secondary infections (nosocomial pneumonia). We aimed to investigate the impact of bacterial load on survival and cytokine release in a two-hit murine (C57BL/6J) model of CLP followed by P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Plasmatic TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, sTNFr I and II were quantified until 13 days. At D5, splenocytes were processed for immunological assays or mice were intratracheally instilled with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.106, 2.107 and 108 CFU) to evaluate survival and cytokines production. TNFα, sTNFrs, IL-6 and IL-10 increased 2h post CLP. TNFα and sTNFrs declined respectively one and two days later. In CLP mice, IL-6 and IL-10 remained high for the whole experiment, as compared to Sham. At D5, for CLP mice, whereas total T cells population (CD3+) decreased, Treg fraction (CD4+/CD25+) increased. In parallel, T cells proliferation and LPS-stimulated splenocytes ability to release TNFα decreased. At D13, survival was 100% after 5.106 CFU, 50% for CLP mice after 2.107 CFU and 0% for CLP and Sham after 108 CFU. After instillation, IL-10 and IL-6 increased and appeared to be dose and time dependent. Pseudomonas was detected in all CLP and Sham’s lungs; in spleen and liver only in CLP at 2.107 CFU, and in CLP and Sham at 108 CFU. We demonstrated that post-CLP immunosuppression followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung instillation increases mortality reactivates cytokines secretion and is associated with systemic dissemination in septic mice depending on bacterial load."
https://openalex.org/W2511325721,"The synthesis, processing, and joining of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication is complex, requiring the sequential action of a large number of proteins. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA sliding clamp, interacts with and coordinates the activity of several DNA replication proteins, including the enzymes flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) and DNA ligase I that complete the processing and joining of Okazaki fragments, respectively. Although it is evident that maintaining the appropriate relative stoichiometry of FEN-1 and DNA ligase I, which compete for binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen, is critical to prevent genomic instability, little is known about how the steady state levels of DNA replication proteins are regulated, in particular the proteolytic mechanisms involved in their turnover. Because DNA ligase I has been reported to be ubiquitylated, we used a proteomic approach to map ubiquitylation sites and screen for DNA ligase I-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases. We identified three ubiquitylated lysine residues and showed that DNA ligase I interacts with and is targeted for ubiquitylation by DCAF7, a specificity factor for the Cul4-DDB1 complex. Notably, knockdown of DCAF7 reduced the degradation of DNA ligase I in response to inhibition of proliferation and replacement of ubiquitylated lysine residues reduced the in vitro ubiquitylation of DNA ligase I by Cul4-DDB1 and DCAF7. In contrast, a different E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates FEN-1 turnover. Thus, although the expression of many of the genes encoding DNA replication proteins is coordinately regulated, our studies reveal that different mechanisms are involved in the turnover of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2509698629,"GABAB receptors are heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptors, which control neuronal excitability by mediating prolonged inhibition. The magnitude of GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition essentially depends on the amount of receptors in the plasma membrane. However, the factors regulating cell surface expression of GABAB receptors are poorly characterized. Cell surface GABAB receptors are constitutively internalized and either recycled to the plasma membrane or degraded in lysosomes. The signal that sorts GABAB receptors to lysosomes is currently unknown. Here we show that Mind bomb-2 (MIB2)-mediated Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of the GABAB1 subunit at multiple sites is the lysosomal sorting signal for GABAB receptors. We found that inhibition of lysosomal activity in cultured rat cortical neurons increased the fraction of Lys-63-linked ubiquitinated GABAB receptors and enhanced the expression of total as well as cell surface GABAB receptors. Mutational inactivation of four putative ubiquitination sites in the GABAB1 subunit significantly diminished Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors and prevented their lysosomal degradation. We identified MIB2 as the E3 ligase triggering Lys-63-linked ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of GABAB receptors. Finally, we show that sustained activation of glutamate receptors, a condition occurring in brain ischemia that down-regulates GABAB receptors, considerably increased the expression of MIB2 and Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors. Interfering with Lys-63-linked ubiquitination by overexpressing ubiquitin mutants or GABAB1 mutants deficient in Lys-63-linked ubiquitination prevented glutamate-induced down-regulation of the receptors.

The number of neurotransmitter receptors at the cell surface available for signaling in neurons needs to be precisely tuned to a given cellular state and consequently must be dynamically adjusted to altered conditions. One key player regulating their amount as well as their life span is protein degradation. Two major cellular protein degradation systems control the number of neurotransmitter receptors, lysosomes and proteasomes. Interestingly, both systems rely on ubiquitination as a signal that tags most membrane proteins for degradation. For proteasomal degradation, primarily Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination is required, and for lysosomal degradation, primarily Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination is required (1Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Both degradation pathways are involved in the regulation of G protein-coupled GABAB receptors. GABAB receptors are heterodimers assembled from GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunits and are activated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, to regulate excitability of neurons. At presynaptic locations, GABAB receptors suppress neurotransmitter release mainly by inhibiting voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, whereas at postsynaptic sites they induce slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents by activating Kir3-type K+ channels (2Benke D. Zemoura K. Maier P.J. Modulation of cell surface GABAB receptors by desensitization, trafficking and regulated degradation.World J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 3: 61-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GABAB receptors are involved in the regulation of all main brain functions ranging from synaptic plasticity (3Pinard A. Seddik R. Bettler B. GABAB receptors: physiological functions and mechanisms of diversity.Adv. Pharmacol. 2010; 58: 231-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), neuronal network activity (4Craig M.T. McBain C.J.

Emerging neurotrophic role of GABAB receptors in neuronal circuit development.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An important factor regulating GABAB receptor signaling is the dynamic control of their cell surface expression via protein degradation. So far, the following two mechanisms have been identified: 1) proteasomal degradation of the receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; Ub, ubiquitin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PLA, proximity ligation assay; EGFP, enhanced GFP. and 2) lysosomal degradation of receptors internalized from the plasma membrane. The amount of GABAB receptors in the ER available for forward trafficking to the cell surface is determined by the rate of their proteasomal degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery (7Zemoura K.

Lysosomal degradation of GABAB receptors is most likely mediated via the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery (13Kantamneni S. Holman D. Wilkinson K.A. Corrêa S.A.

Interestingly, USP14 (ubiquitin-specific protease 14) has been implicated in sorting ubiquitinated GABAB receptors to lysosomal degradation (15Lahaie N. Kralikova M. Prézeau L. Blahos J. Bouvier M.

Lysosomal degradation of GABAB receptors appears to be tightly regulated because excessive activity of glutamate receptors, a condition occurring in brain ischemia, rapidly down-regulates GABAB receptors by preferential sorting them to the lysosomal degradation pathway at the expense of receptor recycling (16Guetg N.

The specific signal(s) that sorts GABAB receptors to lysosomal degradation under normal as well as pathological conditions is currently unknown. Here we show that Lys-63-linked ubiquitination by the E3 ligase mindbomb-2 (MIB2) of GABAB1 at multiple sites targets GABAB receptors to the lysosomal degradation pathway. GABAB receptors undergo fast constitutive dynamin and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Most of the receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane, although a minor fraction is sorted to the lysosomal degradation pathway (9Grampp T. Sauter K. Markovic B.

However, it is currently not known whether interfering with lysosomal degradation affects the expression of cell surface expression of GABAB receptors. Blocking lysosomal degradation in cultured cortical neurons with leupeptin for 12 h considerably increased total (GABAB1, 151 ± 6%; GABAB2, 160 ± 7% of control; Fig. 1A) as well as cell surface expression of GABAB receptors (GABAB1, 146 ± 9%; GABAB2, 147 ± 9% of control; Fig. 1B) to a similar extent. This suggests that constitutive lysosomal degradation is one factor determining the availability of GABAB receptors at the cell surface for signaling. The signal that sorts GABAB receptors to lysosomal degradation is unknown. Lys-48-linked ubiquitination tags proteins for degradation in proteasomes, whereas Lys-63-linked ubiquitination is involved in non-proteolytic functions and can serve as a sorting signal for lysosomal degradation (1Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). To test whether Lys-63-linked ubiquitination is involved in degrading GABAB receptors, we transfected neurons with a mutant of ubiquitin that is not able to form Lys-63-linked chains (Ub(K63R)) and analyzed them for cell surface expression of GABAB receptors. Inhibition of Lys-63-linked ubiquitination by overexpression of Ub(K63R) increased the expression level of cell surface GABAB receptors (GABAB1, 162 ± 12%; GABAB2, 136 ± 9% of control neurons transfected with wild-type ubiquitin; Fig. 2A), suggesting that GABAB receptor levels are regulated by Lys-63-linked ubiquitination. Next we tested whether regulation of GABAB receptor levels by lysosomal degradation requires direct Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of the receptor by in situ PLA using antibodies directed against GABAB1 and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin. Under basal conditions, GABAB receptors exhibited Lys-63-linked ubiquitination, which considerably increased upon inhibition of lysosomal activity with leupeptin (164 ± 8% of control, Fig. 2B). In contrast, Lys-48-linked ubiquitination (which targets the receptors to proteasomal degradation (7Zemoura K. Schenkel M. Acuña M.A. Yévenes G.E. Zeilhofer H.U. Benke D. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) controls cell surface expression of γ-aminobutyric acid, type B receptors.J. Biol.

Chem. 2014; 289: 7738-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) remained unaffected by blocking lysosomal activity (Fig. 2C). This suggests that direct Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors regulates lysosomal degradation of GABAB receptors. For identification of Lys-63-linked ubiquitination sites in GABAB receptors, we first determined whether GABAB1 or GABAB2 is the main target. HEK293 cells were either transfected with a GABAB1 mutant (GABAB1a(RSAR)) containing an inactivated ER retention signal, which permits ER exit and cell surface targeting of the subunit when expressed in the absence of GABAB2 (22Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D. Schuler V. Meigel I. Lampert C. Stein T. Prezeau L. Blahos J. Pin J. Froestl W. et al.C-terminal interaction is essential for surface trafficking but not for heteromeric assembly of GABAB receptors.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or with a combination of GABAB1 and GABAB2 and tested for Lys-63-linked ubiquitination with in situ PLA using antibodies directed against GABAB1 or GABAB2 and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin. We detected no difference in Lys-63-linked ubiquitination between HEK cells expressing GABAB1 alone and those expressing GABAB1 plus GABAB2, suggesting that GABAB1 is the main target for Lys-63-linked ubiquitination (Fig. 3A). We then searched for potential lysine residues serving as ubiquitination sites in the GABAB1 sequence by an in silico analysis. Four lysines with a high probability of being ubiquitinated were identified as follows: two in the cytoplasmic loop linking transmembrane domains three and four and two in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3B″). Inactivation of these sites by mutation to arginine (Lys → Arg) yielded the three mutants GABAB1a(K697R/K698R), GABAB1a(K892R), and GABAB1a(K960R). To test whether these sites are ubiquitinated, HEK293 cells were transfected with either wild-type GABAB1a or one of the GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants along with GABAB2 and analyzed for Lys-63-linked ubiquitination by in situ PLA. Numerous in situ PLA signals in cells transfected with wild-type GABAB1a indicated that a fraction of GABAB1a is Lys-63-linked ubiquitinated under basal conditions. In contrast, all three mutant GABAB1a displayed strongly reduced Lys-63-linked ubiquitination (GABAB1a(K697R/K698R), 43 ± 3%; GABAB1a(K892R), 38 ± 3%; GABAB1a(K960R), 37 ± 3%, of wild-type GABAB1a; Fig. 3B). This result indicates that lysines 697 and/or 698 and lysine 982 and lysine 960 in GABAB1 can be Lys-63-linked ubiquitinated under basal conditions. To analyze the effect of Lys-63-linked ubiquitination on cell surface expression of GABAB receptors, we transfected neurons with wild-type GABAB1a or GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants along with GABAB2 and immunostained for their total and cell surface expression levels. Total as well as cell surface expression of all three GABAB1a mutants was considerably increased as compared with transfected wild-type GABAB1a (total, GABAB1a(K697R/K698R), 457 ± 26%; GABAB1a(K892R), 511 ± 30%; and GABAB1a(K960R), 551 ± 22%, of wild-type GABAB1a; cell surface, GABAB1a(K697R/K698R), 508 ± 52%; GABAB1a(K892R), 504 ± 48%; and GABAB1a(K960R), 482.2 ± 42% of wild-type GABAB1; Fig. 4, A and B). Likewise, the cell surface expression of GABAB2 in neurons transfected with GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants was significantly increased (GABAB2 in GABAB1a (K697R/K698R)-transfected neurons, 158 ± 14%; GABAB2 in GABAB1a(K892R)-transfected neurons, 187 ± 17%; GABAB2 in GABAB1a(K960R)-transfected neurons, 178 ± 16% of control; Fig. 4B). The considerably lower increase in GABAB2 cell surface expression as compared with mutant GABAB1a was due to the fact that in the case of GABAB1 only transfected subunits were assayed (HA-tagged), but in the case of GABAB2 transfected as well as endogenously expressed subunits were detected. The results demonstrate that inactivation of any of the ubiquitination sites in GABAB1 (Lys-697/698, Lys-892, and Lys-960) decreased or prevented degradation of GABAB receptors and therefore increased their cell surface expression. The increased total and cell surface expression levels of GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants and their reduced Lys-63-linked ubiquitination suggest that ubiquitination of these lysine residues serves as signals for sorting the receptors to lysosomes for degradation. If this is the case, GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants should be resistant to lysosomal degradation, and their expression levels should not increase upon blocking lysosomal degradation. Indeed, in contrast to the expression level of wild-type GABAB1a, those of all three GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants remained unaffected by inhibition of lysosomal degradation with leupeptin (wild-type GABAB1a, 249 ± 30%; GABAB1a (K697R/K698R), 111 ± 5%; GABAB1a (K892R), 109 ± 5%; and GABAB1a (K960R), 108 ± 4% of control; Fig. 5A). To confirm this finding, we prevented lysosomal degradation by overexpressing a functionally inactive mutant of the small GTPase Rab7 (Rab7(DN)). Rab7 mediates trafficking from early endosomes via late endosomes to lysosomes (23Ng E.L. Gan B.Q. Ng F. Tang B.L. Rab GTPases regulating receptor trafficking at the late endosome-lysosome membranes.Cell Biochem. Funct. 2012; 30: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and therefore overexpression of Rab7(DN) disrupts this pathway. In line with the pharmacological data, overexpression of Rab7(DN) considerably enhanced total expression of wild-type GABAB1a but did not significantly affect the expression levels of GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants (wild-type GABAB1a, 174 ± 11%; GABAB1a (K697R/K698R), 105 ± 8%; GABAB1a (K892R), 117 ± 8%; and GABAB1a (K960R), 126 ± 9% of control; Fig. 5B). This indicates that preventing ubiquitination of specific sites in GABAB1 excluded the mutant receptors from entering the endosomal pathway that directs proteins to the lysosome. Therefore, our observations suggest that ubiquitination of multiple lysine residues in GABAB1 receptors regulates lysosomal degradation of GABAB receptors. In the next step, we aimed at identifying the E3 ligase mediating Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors. A recent comprehensive proteomic study determined proteins that robustly interact with GABAB receptors and most likely build basic GABAB receptor signaling complexes (24Schwenk J. Pérez-Garci E. Schneider A. Kollewe A. Gauthier-Kemper A. Fritzius T. Raveh A. Dinamarca M.C. Hanuschkin A. Bildl W. Klingauf J. Gassmann M. Schulte U. Bettler B. Fakler B. Modular composition and dynamics of native GABAB receptors identified by high-resolution proteomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A few E3 ligases, which did not pass their stringent criteria for a robustly associated protein and thus were not regarded as a permanent member of a basic GABAB receptor signaling complex, emerged in their screens (MIB2, TRIM9, and MYCBP2; additional tested E3 ligases were RNF112, RNF144, RNF167, and RNF152). Upon overexpression of those E3 ligases in neurons, we found that MIB2 significantly reduced cell surface (59 ± 3% of control, Fig. 6A) as well as total (78 ± 3% of control, Fig. 6B) GABAB receptor expression. MIB2 extensively colocalized with GABAB receptors in neurons (Fig. 6C) and interacted with GABAB receptors as tested by in situ PLA (Fig. 6D). Next we analyzed whether MIB2 mediates Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors. To demonstrate directly Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors by MIB2, we overexpressed MIB2 in neurons and tested for increased Lys-63-linked ubiquitination using in situ PLA. In fact, overexpression of MIB2 in neurons increased Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors to 156 ± 16% of controls (Fig. 7A). This result was corroborated by the observation that overexpression of mutant ubiquitin, which cannot form Lys-63 linkages (Ub(K63R)), inhibited the MIB2 effect on GABAB receptors (Fig. 7B). In contrast overexpression of MIB2 in neurons with either wild-type ubiquitin (WT Ub (59 ± 8% of control)), mutant ubiquitin that can only form Lys-63 linkages (Ub(Lys-63), 64 ± 6% of control), or mutant ubiquitin that is deficient in forming Lys-48 linkages (Ub(K48R), 57 ± 6% of control) did not affect MIB2-mediated down-regulation of GABAB receptors (Fig. 7B). To further substantiate that Lys-63-linked ubiquitination is mediated via MIB2, we analyzed the effect of overexpression of MIB2 on the three GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants, which are partially resistant to Lys-63-linked ubiquitination. In this set of experiments, overexpression of MIB2 reduced cell surface expression of wild-type GABAB1 to 33 ± 4% of controls (Fig. 8). However, cell surface expression of all three mutants remained unaffected by overexpression of MIB2 (Fig. 8). Prolonged activation of glutamate receptors (AMPA as well as NMDA receptors) leads to down-regulation of GABAB receptors via lysosomal degradation (16Guetg N. Abdel Aziz S. Holbro N. Turecek R.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13918-13923Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors serves as a lysosomal sorting signal in this process, we first tested whether the three GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants, which are partially resistant to Lys-63-linked ubiquitination, are resistant to glutamate-induced down-regulation. In contrast to the cell surface expression of wild-type GABAB1a (56 ± 8% of control, Fig. 9), the levels of all three GABAB1a(Lys → Arg) mutants remained unaffected by glutamate (GABAB1a(K697R/K698R), 90 ± 12%; GABAB1a(K892R), 115 ± 11%; GABAB1a (K960R), 108 ± 5% of control; Fig. 9). This suggests that Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB1 is the signal for down-regulating the receptors. To directly test for ubiquitination of the receptors in this mechanism, we exposed cortical neurons for 30 min to glutamate and determined Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of the receptors via in situ PLA. As expected, sustained activation of glutamate receptors strongly increased Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors (203 ± 34% of control; Fig. 10A). Next we tested whether preventing Lys-63-linked ubiquitination inhibits the down-regulation of GABAB receptors after treating neurons with glutamate. For this, cortical neurons were transfected either with wild-type Ub, a mutant of ubiquitin in which all lysines were mutated to arginines thereby preventing chain elongation and thus any kind of polyubiquitination (Ub(KO)), or with a mutant in which all lysines were mutated to arginines except for Lys-63 (Ub(Lys-63), able to form only Lys-63-linked ubiquitination) and stained for cell surface GABAB receptors after sustained glutamate application. Glutamate induced down-regulation of GABAB receptors from the plasma membrane in neurons expressing wild-type ubiquitin (Ub(WT), 53 ± 5% of control; Fig. 10B) or the mutant that only permits Lys-63-linked ubiquitination (Ub(Lys-63), 61 ± 6% of control, Fig. 10B) but not in neurons expressing the mutant unable to build polyubiquitin chains (Ub(KO), 95 ± 11% of control, Fig. 10B). Finally, we analyzed whether MIB2 is involved in glutamate-induced down-regulation of the receptors. Interestingly, treatment of neurons with glutamate significantly increased MIB2 expression in neurons (15 min of glutamate, 150 ± 9% of control; 30 min of glutamate, 179 ± 8% of control; Fig. 11A) and strongly increased the interaction of MIB2 with GABAB receptors as tested with in situ PLA (15 min of glutamate, 155 ± 13% of control; 30 min of glutamate, 218 ± 25% of control; Fig. 11B). These findings suggest that sustained activation of glutamate receptors induces MIB2-mediated Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of GABAB receptors, promoting their lysosomal degradation. The signaling strength of G protein-coupled receptors largely depends on the number of receptors present in the plasma membrane. The mechanisms determining cell surface expression of the receptors include exocytosis, endocytosis, recycling, and degradation. GABAB receptors assemble into heterodimeric GABAB1,2 complexes in the ER, which is a prerequisite for t"
https://openalex.org/W2513908306,"Renal tubulointerstitial injury often leads to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA). IF/TA is typically assessed in the renal cortex and can be objectively quantitated with computerized image analysis (IA). However, the human medulla accounts for a substantial proportion of the nephron; therefore, medullary scarring will have important cortical consequences and may parallel overall chronic renal injury. Trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and collagen III immunohistochemistry (IHC) were visually examined and quantitated on scanned whole slide images (WSIs) (N = 67 cases). When tuned to measure fibrosis, IA of trichrome and Trichrome-PAS (T-P) WSIs correlated for all anatomic compartments (among cortex, medulla, and entire tissue, r = 0.84 to 0.89, P all <0.0001); and collagen III deposition correlated between compartments (r = 0.69 to 0.89, P <0.0001 to 0.0002); however, trichrome and T-P measures did not correlate with collagen deposition, suggesting heterogeneous contributions to extracellular matrix deposition. Epithelial cell mass (EPCM) correlated between cortex and medulla when measured with cytokeratin IHC and with the trichrome red portion (r = 0.85 and 0.66, respectively, all P < 0.0001). Visual assessment also correlated between compartments for fibrosis and EPCM. Correlations were found between increasing medullary inner stripe (IS) width and fibrosis in all of the tissue and the medulla by trichrome morphometry (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001, and r = 0.48, P = 0.00008, respectively). Weak correlations were found between increasing IS width and decreasing visual assessment of all tissue EPCM. Microvessel density (MVD) and microvessel area (MVA) measured using a MVD algorithm applied to CD34 IHC correlated significantly between all compartments (r = 0.76 to 0.87 for MVD and 0.71 to 0.87 for MVA, P all < 0.0001). Overall, these findings demonstrate the interrelatedness of the cortex and medulla and the importance of considering the renal parenchyma as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2516733522,"Volumetric acquisition with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) is necessary to obtain accurate representations of the tissue structure and to account for asymmetries of the anterior eye anatomy. Additionally, recent interest in imaging of anterior segment vasculature and aqueous humor flow resulted in application of OCT angiography techniques to generate en face and 3D micro-vasculature maps of the anterior segment. Unfortunately, ASOCT structural and vasculature imaging systems do not capture volumes instantaneously and are subject to motion artifacts due to involuntary eye motion that may hinder their accuracy and repeatability. Several groups have demonstrated real-time tracking for motion-compensated in vivo OCT retinal imaging, but these techniques are not applicable in the anterior segment. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and low-cost pupil tracking system integrated into a custom swept-source OCT system for real-time motion-compensated anterior segment volumetric imaging. Pupil oculography hardware coaxial with the swept-source OCT system enabled fast detection and tracking of the pupil centroid. The pupil tracking ASOCT system with a field of view of 15 x 15 mm achieved diffraction-limited imaging over a lateral tracking range of +/- 2.5 mm and was able to correct eye motion at up to 22 Hz. Pupil tracking ASOCT offers a novel real-time motion compensation approach that may facilitate accurate and reproducible anterior segment imaging."

Kinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) improve outcomes in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but are not curative. Metastatic tumor tissue has not been comprehensively studied for kinase gene expression. Paired intra-patient kinase gene expression analysis in primary tumor (T), matched normal kidney (N) and metastatic tumor tissue (M) may assist in identifying drivers of metastasis and prioritizing therapeutic targets. We compared the expression of 519 kinase genes using NanoString in T, N and M in 35 patients to discover genes over-expressed in M compared to T and N tissue. RNA-seq data derived from ccRCC tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to demonstrate differential expression of genes in primary tumor tissue from patients that had metastasis at baseline (n = 79) compared to those that did not develop metastasis for at least 2 years (n = 187). Functional analysis was conducted to identify key signaling pathways by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Of 10 kinase genes overexpressed in metastases compared to primary tumor in the discovery cohort, 9 genes were also differentially expressed in TCGA primary tumors with metastasis at baseline compared to primary tumors without metastasis for at least 2 years: EPHB2, AURKA, GSG2, IKBKE, MELK, CSK, CHEK2, CDC7 and MAP3K8; p<0.001). The top pathways overexpressed in M tissue were pyridoxal 5'-phosphate salvage, salvage pathways of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, NF-kB signaling, NGF signaling and cell cycle control of chromosomal replication. The 9 kinase genes validated to be over-expressed in metastatic ccRCC may represent currently unrecognized but potentially actionable therapeutic targets that warrant functional validation."
https://openalex.org/W2511027284,"Formation of the vertebrate limb presents an excellent model to analyze a non-neuronal cholinergic system (NNCS). Here, we first analyzed the expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by IHC and of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) by ISH in developing embryonic chicken limbs (stages HH17-37). AChE outlined formation of bones, being strongest at their distal tips, and later also marked areas of cell death. At onset, AChE and ChAT were elevated in two organizing centers of the limb anlage, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), respectively. Thereby ChAT was expressed shortly after AChE, thus strongly supporting a leading role of AChE in limb formation. Then, we conducted loss-of-function studies via unilateral implantation of beads into chicken limb anlagen, which were soaked in cholinergic components. After varying periods, the formation of cartilage matrix and of mineralizing bones was followed by Alcian blue (AB) and Alizarin red (AR) stainings, respectively. Both acetylcholine (ACh)- and ChAT-soaked beads accelerated bone formation in ovo. Notably, inhibition of AChE by BW284c51, or by the monoclonal antibody MAB304 delayed cartilage formation. Since bead inhibition of BChE was mostly ineffective, an ACh-independent action during BW284c51 and MAB304 inhibition was indicated, which possibly could be due to an enzymatic side activity of AChE. In conclusion, skeletogenesis in chick is regulated by an ACh-dependent cholinergic system, but to some extent also by an ACh-independent aspect of the AChE protein."
https://openalex.org/W2511807361,"Reduced verbal fluency (VF) has been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), especially those treated by Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS). To delineate the nature of this dysfunction we aimed at identifying the particular VF-related operations modified by STN DBS.Eleven PD patients performed VF tasks in their STN DBS ON and OFF condition. To differentiate VF-components modulated by the stimulation, a temporal cluster analysis was performed, separating production spurts (i.e., 'clusters' as correlates of automatic activation spread within lexical fields) from slower cluster transitions (i.e., 'switches' reflecting set-shifting towards new lexical fields). The results were compared to those of eleven healthy control subjects.PD patients produced significantly more switches accompanied by shorter switch times in the STN DBS ON compared to the STN DBS OFF condition. The number of clusters and time intervals between words within clusters were not affected by the treatment state. Although switch behavior in patients with DBS ON improved, their task performance was still lower compared to that of healthy controls.Beyond impacting on motor symptoms, STN DBS seems to influence the dynamics of cognitive procedures. Specifically, the results are in line with basal ganglia roles for cognitive switching, in the particular case of VF, from prevailing lexical concepts to new ones."
https://openalex.org/W2517942340,"Water Productivity (WP) of a crop defines the relationship between the economic or physical yield of the crop and its water use. With this concept it is possible to identify disproportionate water use or water-limited yield gaps and thereby support improvements in agricultural water management. However, too often important qualitative and quantitative environmental factors are not part of a WP analysis and therefore neglect the aspect of maintaining a sustainable agricultural system. In this study, we examine both the physical and economic WP in perspective with temporally changing environmental conditions. The physical WP analysis was performed by comparing simulated maximum attainable corn yields per unit of water using the crop model Hybrid-Maize with observed data from 2005 through 2013 from 108 farm plots in the Central Platte and the Tri Basin Natural Resource Districts of Nebraska. In order to expand the WP analysis on external factors influencing yields, a second model, Maize-N, was used to estimate optimal nitrogen (N)-fertilizer rate for specific fields in the study area. Finally, a vadose zone flow and transport model, HYDRUS-1D for simulating vertical nutrient transport in the soil, was used to estimate locations of nitrogen pulses in the soil profile. The comparison of simulated and observed data revealed that WP was not on an optimal level, mainly due to large amounts of irrigation used in the study area. The further analysis illustrated year-to-year variations of WP during the nine consecutive years, as well as the need to improve fertilizer management to favor WP and environmental quality. In addition, we addressed the negative influence of groundwater depletion on the economic WP through increasing pumping costs. In summary, this study demonstrated that involving temporal variations of WP as well as associated environmental and economic issues can represent a bigger picture of WP that can help to create incentives to sustainably improve agricultural production."
https://openalex.org/W2518090013,"The presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an indicator of a worse long-term prognosis in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). Unfortunately, not much is known about renal function in the population of post-IS subjects. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of renal damage and impaired renal function (IRF) in the population of post-IS subjects.This prospective analysis concerned 352 consecutive post-IS survivors hospitalized in Pomeranian stroke centers (Poland) in 2009. In this group estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to MDRD (modification of diet in renal diseases) and CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formulas and urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) were determined.Among survivors decreased eGFR (<60 mL/min./1.73m2 according to MDRD or CKD-EPI) or ACR≥30mg/g were detected in 40.38% (23.07% Men, 55.32% Women; P<0.01). The highest prevalence of IRF was noted in post-IS subjects with atheromatic and lacunar IS. In multivariate analysis the ACR≥30mg/g was predicted by older age, diabetes mellitus (DM) and physical disability (modified Rankin scale 3-5 pts.). The association with reduced eGFR was proved for sex (female), DM and physical disability.CKD is a frequently occurring problem in the group of post-IS subjects, especially after lacunar and atheromatic IS. Post-IS patients, mainly the elderly women, with physical disability and diabetes mellitus, should be regularly screened for CKD. This could reduce the risk of further cardiovascular events and delay the progression of IRF."
https://openalex.org/W2507214393,"15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonist, has physiological properties including pronounced anti-inflammatory activity, though it binds strongly to serum albumin. The use of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) can improve therapeutic properties increasing drug efficiency and availability. 15d-PGJ2-SLN was therefore developed and investigated in terms of its immunomodulatory potential. 15d-PGJ2-SLN and unloaded SLN were physicochemically characterized and experiments in vivo were performed. Animals were pretreated with 15d-PGJ2-SLN at concentrations of 3, 10 or 30 μg·kg-1 before inflammatory stimulus with carrageenan (Cg), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or mBSA (immune response). Interleukins (IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-17) levels were also evaluated in exudates. The 15d-PGJ2-SLN system showed good colloidal parameters and encapsulation efficiency of 96%. The results showed that the formulation was stable for up to 120 days with low hemolytic effects. The 15d-PGJ2-SLN formulation was able to reduce neutrophil migration in three inflammation models tested using low concentrations of 15d-PGJ2. Additionally, 15d-PGJ2-SLN increased IL-10 levels and reduced IL-1β as well as IL-17 in peritoneal fluid. The new 15d-PGJ2-SLN formulation highlights perspectives of a potent anti-inflammatory system using low concentrations of 15d-PGJ2."
https://openalex.org/W2517815019,"Larval dispersal is an important ecological process of great interest to conservation and the establishment of marine protected areas. Increasing numbers of studies are turning to biophysical models to simulate dispersal patterns, including in the deep-sea, but for many ecologists unassisted by a physical oceanographer, a model can present as a black box. Sensitivity testing offers a means to test the models’ abilities and limitations and is a starting point for all modelling efforts. The aim of this study is to illustrate a sensitivity testing process for the unassisted ecologist, through a deep-sea case study example, and demonstrate how sensitivity testing can be used to determine optimal model settings, assess model adequacy, and inform ecological interpretation of model outputs. Five input parameters are tested (timestep of particle simulator (TS), horizontal (HS) and vertical separation (VS) of release points, release frequency (RF), and temporal range (TR) of simulations) using a commonly employed pairing of models. The procedures used are relevant to all marine larval dispersal models. It is shown how the results of these tests can inform the future set up and interpretation of ecological studies in this area. For example, an optimal arrangement of release locations spanning a release area could be deduced; the increased depth range spanned in deep-sea studies may necessitate the stratification of dispersal simulations with different numbers of release locations at different depths; no fewer than 52 releases per year should be used unless biologically informed; three years of simulations chosen based on climatic extremes may provide results with 90% similarity to five years of simulation; and this model setup is not appropriate for simulating rare dispersal events. A step-by-step process, summarising advice on the sensitivity testing procedure, is provided to inform all future unassisted ecologists looking to run a larval dispersal simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2508348196,"Efficiency in laboratory mouse breeding is hampered by poor reproductive performance, including the loss of entire litters shortly after birth. However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood and establishing the cause of death in laboratory mouse pups can be complicated. Newborn mouse pups are generally hidden in nests, dead pups are often eaten by the female, and the widespread practice of leaving periparturient females undisturbed complicates inspection, which may delay the discovery of pup loss. In order to efficiently prevent problems with litter loss, it is important to find key factors for survival. We investigated differences in periparturient behavior between female laboratory mice whose pups survived until weaning and females whose entire litters were lost. Video recordings of 82 primiparous females of the C57BL/6 strain or knockouts with C57BL/6 background were used. The mice were observed from 24 h before until 24 h after parturition and female behaviors coded using a pre-established ethogram. The relationship between behavior and survival was analyzed using logistic models, where litter survival was regressed on the proportion of 30-s observations with at least one occurrence of the behavior. We found that females with surviving litters performed more nest building behavior during the last 24 h before parturition (p = 0.004) and spent less time outside the nest during the entire observation period (p = 0.001). Increased litter survival was also associated with more passive maternal behaviors and the female ignoring still pups less. Females that lost their litters performed more parturition-related behaviors, suggesting prolonged labor. The results indicate that maternal behavior plays a significant role in laboratory mouse pup survival. Complications at parturition also contribute to litter mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2507691822,"Background Abnormalities in the cognitive processing of movement have been demonstrated in patients with dystonia. The sense of agency, which is the experience of initiating and controlling one’s own actions, has never before been studied in these patients. Objectives We investigated whether the sense of agency is altered in patients with cervical dystonia. Methods We used an explicit metacognitive agency task in which participants had to catch targets with a cursor by moving a computer’s mouse. The task included several conditions in which the control over the cursor could be disrupted by adding a spatial or a temporal discrepancy between the mouse and the cursor’s movements. Participants had to acknowledge these discrepancies and reflect them in metacognitive judgements of agency. Results Twenty cervical dystonia patients and 20 matched controls were included in the study. Despite performing equally well as the matched controls, cervical dystonia patients did not fully recognize alterations of agency when a temporal lag was added between their movement and the visual feedback. Moreover, they relied predominantly on their perceived performance to provide judgements of agency and less on their objective degree of controls. There was no correlation between agency scores and clinical severity of dystonia measured by the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale. Conclusion We demonstrated an abnormal processing of agency in cervical dystonia patients, even for motor actions not affected by dystonia. The exact contribution of abnormal agency to dystonia pathophysiology remains to be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W2509205835,"When groups compete for resources, some groups will be more successful than others, forcing out less successful groups. Group-level selection is the most extreme form of group competition, where the weaker group ceases to exist, becoming extinct. We implement group-level selection in a controlled laboratory experiment in order to study its impact on human cooperation. The experiment uses variations on the standard linear public goods game. Group-level selection operates through competition for survival: the least successful, lowest-earning groups become extinct, in the sense that they no longer are able to play the game. Additional control treatments include group comparison without extinction, and extinction of the least successful individuals across groups. We find that group-level extinction produces very high contributions to the provision of the public good, while group comparison alone or individual extinction fail to cause higher contributions. Our results provide stark evidence that group-level selection enhances within-group cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2518359259,"As forest communities continue to experience interactions between climate change and shifting disturbance regimes, there is an increased need to link ecological understanding to applied management. Limber pine (Pinus flexilis James.), an understudied species of western North America, has been documented to dominate harsh environments and thought to be competitively excluded from mesic environments. An observational study was conducted using the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIAD) to test the competitive exclusion hypothesis across a broad elevational and geographic area within the Intermountain West, USA. We anticipated that competitive exclusion would result in limber pine’s absence from mid-elevation forest communities, creating a bi-modal distribution. Using the FIAD database, limber pine was observed to occur with 22 different overstory species, which represents a surprising number of the woody, overstory species commonly observed in the Intermountain West. There were no biologically significant relationships between measures of annual precipitation, annual temperature, or climatic indices (i.e. Ombrothermic Index) and limber pine dominance. Limber pine was observed to be a consistent component of forest communities across elevation classes. Of the plots that contained limber pine regeneration, nearly half did not have a live or dead limber pine in the overstory. However, limber pine regeneration was greater in plots with higher limber pine basal area and higher average annual precipitation. Our results suggest limber pine is an important habitat generalist, playing more than one functional role in forest communities. Generalists, like limber pine, may be increasingly important, as managers are challenged to build resistance and resilience to future conditions in western forests. Additional research is needed to understand how different silvicultural systems can be used to maintain multi-species forest communities."
https://openalex.org/W2509984974,"Thousands of hours of physical practice substantially change the way movements are performed. The mechanisms underlying altered behavior in highly-trained individuals are so far little understood. We studied experts (handballers) and untrained individuals (novices) in visuomotor adaptation of free throws, where subjects had to adapt their throwing direction to a visual displacement induced by prismatic glasses. Before visual displacement, experts expressed lower variability of motor errors than novices. Experts adapted and de-adapted slower, and also forgot the adaptation slower than novices. The variability during baseline was correlated with the learning rate during adaptation. Subjects adapted faster when variability was higher. Our results indicate that experts produced higher consistency of motor outcome. They were still susceptible to the sensory feedback informing about motor error, but made smaller adjustments than novices. The findings of our study relate to previous investigations emphasizing the importance of action exploration, expressed in terms of outcome variability, to facilitate learning."
https://openalex.org/W2514192056,"There is growing evidence that insects living in high-density populations exhibit an increase in immune function to counter a higher risk of disease. This phenomenon, known as density-dependent prophylaxis, has been experimentally tested in a number of insect species. Although density-dependent prophylaxis is especially prevalent in insects exhibiting density-dependent phase polyphenism, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that the antibacterial activity of lysozyme is important for this process in the beet webworm Loxostege sticticalis. In this study, a lysozyme cDNA from L. sticticalis was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA is 1078 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 426 bp that encodes 142 amino acids. The deduced protein possesses structural characteristics of a typical c-type lysozyme and clusters with c-type lysozymes from other Lepidoptera. LsLysozyme was found to be expressed throughout all developmental stages, showing the highest level in pupae. LsLysozyme was also highly expressed in the midgut and fat body. Elevated LsLysozyme expression was observed in L. sticticalis larvae infected by Beauveria bassiana and in larvae reared under crowding conditions. In addition, the expression level of LsLysozyme in infected larvae reared at a density of 10 larvae per jar was significantly higher compared to those reared at a density of l or 30 larvae per jar. These results suggest that larval crowding affects the gene expression profile of this lysozyme. This study provides additional insight into the expression of an immune-associated lysozyme gene and helps us to better understand the immune response of L. sticticalis under crowding conditions."

We examined a poorly characterized variant of NCS-1 (Var2), identified only in humans where the N-terminal 22 amino acid residues of native NCS-1(MGKSNSKLKPEVVEELTRKTY) were replaced with 4 different residues (MATI). Because alterations in the level of expression of NCS-1 Var1 and the expression of NCS-1 variants have been correlated with several neurological diseases, the relative expression and functional role of NCS-1 Var2 was examined. We found that NCS-1 Var2 mRNA levels are not found in mouse tissues and are expressed at levels ~1000-fold lower than NCS-1 Var1 in three different human cell lines (SHSY5Y, HEK293, MB231). Protein expression of both variants was only identified in cell lines overexpressing exogenous NCS-1 Var2. The calcium binding affinity is ~100 times weaker in purified NCS-1 Var2 than NCS-1 Var1. Because truncation of NCS-1 Var1 has been linked to functional changes in neurons, we determined whether the differing properties of the NCS-1 variants could potentially contribute to the altered cell function. In contrast to previous reports showing that overexpression of NCS-1 Var1 increases calcium-dependent processes, functional differences in cells overexpressing NCS-1 Var2 were undetectable in assays for cell growth, cell death and drug (paclitaxel) potency. Our results suggest that NCS-1 Var1 is the primary functional version of NCS-1."
https://openalex.org/W2518013602,"The clathrin heavy chain N-terminal domain interacts with endocytic adapter proteins via clathrin binding motifs to assemble clathrin triskelia into cages. However, the precise mechanism of clathrin assembly is not yet known. Clathrin assembly protein AP180 has more clathrin binding motifs than any other endocytic protein and has a major role in the assembly of the clathrin coat during synaptic vesicle biogenesis. We now demonstrate that some of the previously identified binding motifs in AP180 may be non-functional and that a non-conventional clathrin binding sequence has a major influence on AP180 function. The related protein, clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM), has fewer clathrin binding motifs and functions ubiquitously in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The C-terminal ~16 kDa sub-domain in AP180, which has relatively high similarity with CALM, was shown in earlier work to have an unexplained role in clathrin binding. We identified the specific sequences in this sub-domain that bind to clathrin. Evidence for a role for these sequences in promoting clathrin binding was examined using in vitro and ex vivo experiments that compared the clathrin binding ability of site mutants with the wild type sequence. A sequence conserved in both AP180 and CALM (LDSSLA[S/N]LVGNLGI) was found to be the major interaction site and mutation caused a deficit in clathrin assembly, which is the first example of a mutation having this effect. In contrast, single or double mutation of DL(L/F) motifs in full length AP180 had no significant effect on clathrin binding, despite higher clathrin affinity for isolated peptides containing these motifs. We conclude that the novel clathrin interaction sites identified here in CALM and AP180 have a major role in how these proteins interface with clathrin. This work advances the case that AP180 and CALM are required to use a combination of standard clathrin N-terminal domain binding motifs and the sequence identified here for optimal binding and assembling clathrin."

A total of 211 HIV-positive plasma samples detected among 730,188 donations to the National Blood Centre between 2013 and 2014 were provided (90.5% male, median age: 27.0 years old). Recent or long-term infection status at the time of donation was determined using a limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg-Avidity EIA). HIV-1 gag-pol genes were amplified and sequenced from residual plasma for 149 cases followed by genotype determination using phylogenetic and recombination analyses. Transmitted antiretroviral resistance mutations were not observed among the blood donors, among which 22.7% were classified as recent or incident infections. Major circulating HIV-1 genotypes determined by neighbour-joining phylogenetic inference included CRF01_AE at 40.9% (61/149), CRF33_01B at 21.5% (32/149), and subtype B at 10.1% (15/149). Newly-described CRFs including CRF54_01B circulated at 4.0%, CRF74_01B at 2.0%, and CRF53_01B and CRF48_01B at 0.7% each. Interestingly, unique HIV-1 genotypes including African subtype G (8.7%), CRF45_cpx (1.3%), CRF02_AG (0.7%) and CRF07_BC (0.7%) from China were detected for the first time in the country. A cluster of subtype G sequences formed a distinct founder sub-lineage within the African strains. In addition, 8.7% (13/149) of HIV-infected donors had unique recombinant forms (URFs) including CRF01_AE/B' (4.7%), B'/C (2.7%) and B'/G (1.3%) recombinants. Detailed analysis identified similar recombinant structures with shared parental strains among the B'/C and B'/G URFs, some of which were sequenced from recently infected individuals, indicating the possible emergence and on-going spread of foreign clades of CRF candidates among the local population. The findings demonstrate extensive molecular complexity of HIV-1 among the infected blood donors in Malaysia, driven in part by the increased spread of recently described CRFs and multiple introductions of previously unreported genotypes from highly prevalent countries."
https://openalex.org/W2509024901,"This study compares heart rate variability (HRV) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients during urodynamic study (UDS) with able-bodied controls.Twenty four complete suprasacral SCI patients (12 tetraplegia and 12 paraplegia) and 12 age-matched able-bodied volunteers received BP and HRV evaluation throughout urodynamic examination. We chose seven time points during the examinations: resting, Foley catheter insertion, start of infusion, and infused volume reaching 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4 of maximal capacity. At each time point, electrocardiogram with a duration of 5 min was used for power spectral density analysis of HRV.Only control subjects displayed significant elevation of SBP during Foley catheter insertion compared to resting values. Both control and tetraplegic groups experienced significant elevation of SBP at maximal bladder capacity compared to resting values. Tetraplegic values were also significantly greater than the other two groups. Control subjects displayed significant elevation of low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratios during Foley catheter insertion and when approaching maximum bladder capacity. These findings were not seen in the paraplegic and tetraplegic groups. However, subgroup analysis of tetraplegic subjects with SBP elevation >50 mmHg demonstrated a similar LF/HF response to the able-bodied controls.Tetraplegic patients experienced BP elevation but did not experience significant changes in HRV during bladder distension. This finding may imply that different neurological pathways contribute to AD reaction and HRV changes during bladder distension. However, profound AD during UDS in tetraplegic patients was associated with corresponding changes in HRV. Whether HRV monitoring would be beneficial in SCI patients presenting with significant AD, it needs further studies to elucidate."
https://openalex.org/W2511764416,"The objective of this research is to examine the trends in the exchange rate markets of the ASEAN-5 countries (Indonesia (IDR), Malaysia (MYR), the Philippines (PHP), Singapore (SGD), and Thailand (THB)) through the application of dynamic moving average trading systems. This research offers evidence of the usefulness of the time-varying volatility technical analysis indicator, Adjustable Moving Average (AMA′) in deciphering trends in these ASEAN-5 exchange rate markets. This time-varying volatility factor, referred to as the Efficacy Ratio in this paper, is embedded in AMA′. The Efficacy Ratio adjusts the AMA′ to the prevailing market conditions by avoiding whipsaws (losses due, in part, to acting on wrong trading signals, which generally occur when there is no general direction in the market) in range trading and by entering early into new trends in trend trading. The efficacy of AMA′ is assessed against other popular moving-average rules. Based on the January 2005 to December 2014 dataset, our findings show that the moving averages and AMA′ are superior to the passive buy-and-hold strategy. Specifically, AMA′ outperforms the other models for the United States Dollar against PHP (USD/PHP) and USD/THB currency pairs. The results show that different length moving averages perform better in different periods for the five currencies. This is consistent with our hypothesis that a dynamic adjustable technical indicator is needed to cater for different periods in different markets."
https://openalex.org/W2515119599,"We previously demonstrated that IFN-γ induces an autophagy-regulated mimic extracellular trap cell death (ETosis) in A549 human lung cancer cells. Regarding reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in ETosis, this study investigated the role of oxidative stress. After IFN-γ stimulation, a necrosis-like cell death mimic ETosis occurred accompanied by the inhibition of cell growth, aberrant nuclear staining, and nucleosome release. ROS were generated in a time-dependent manner with an increase in NADPH oxidase component protein expression. STAT1-mediated IFN regulatory factor-1 activation was essential for upregulating ROS production. By genetically silencing p47phox, IFN-γ-induced ROS and mimic ETosis were significantly attenuated. This mechanistic study indicated that ROS may mediate DNA damage followed by histone H3 citrullination. Furthermore, ROS promoted IFN-γ-induced mimic ETosis in cooperation with autophagy. These findings further demonstrate that ROS regulates IFN-γ-induced mimic ETosis in lung epithelial malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2516655681,"To achieve effective visual tracking, a robust feature representation composed of two separate components (i.e., feature learning and selection) for an object is one of the key issues. Typically, a common assumption used in visual tracking is that the raw video sequences are clear, while real-world data is with significant noise and irrelevant patterns. Consequently, the learned features may be not all relevant and noisy. To address this problem, we propose a novel visual tracking method via a point-wise gated convolutional deep network (CPGDN) that jointly performs the feature learning and feature selection in a unified framework. The proposed method performs dynamic feature selection on raw features through a gating mechanism. Therefore, the proposed method can adaptively focus on the task-relevant patterns (i.e., a target object), while ignoring the task-irrelevant patterns (i.e., the surrounding background of a target object). Specifically, inspired by transfer learning, we firstly pre-train an object appearance model offline to learn generic image features and then transfer rich feature hierarchies from an offline pre-trained CPGDN into online tracking. In online tracking, the pre-trained CPGDN model is fine-tuned to adapt to the tracking specific objects. Finally, to alleviate the tracker drifting problem, inspired by an observation that a visual target should be an object rather than not, we combine an edge box-based object proposal method to further improve the tracking accuracy. Extensive evaluation on the widely used CVPR2013 tracking benchmark validates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2512084712,"Lung adenocarcinomas can be classified into terminal respiratory unit (TRU) and non-TRU types. We previously reported that non-TRU-type adenocarcinoma has unique clinical and morphological features as compared to the TRU type. Here we investigated whether micro (mi)RNA expression profiles can be used to distinguish between these two subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of 1205 human and 144 human viral miRNAs was analyzed in TRU- and non-TRU-type lung adenocarcinoma samples (n = 4 each) by microarray. Results were validated by quantitative real-time (qRT-)PCR and in situ hybridization. A comparison of miRNA profiles revealed 29 miRNAs that were differentially expressed between TRU- and non-TRU adenocarcinoma types. Specifically, hsa-miR-494 and ebv-miR-BART19 were up regulated by > 5-fold, whereas hsa-miR-551b was down regulated by > 5-fold in the non-TRU relative to the TRU type. The miRNA signature was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis using an independent set of paired adenocarcinoma (non-TRU-type, n = 21 and TRU-type, n = 12) and normal tissue samples. Non-TRU samples showed increased expression of miR-494 (p = 0.033) and ebv-miR-BART19 (p = 0.001) as compared to TRU-type samples. Both miRNAs were weakly expressed in the TRU type but strongly expressed in the non-TRU type. Neither subtype showed miR-551b expression. TRU- and non-TRU-type adenocarcinomas have distinct miRNA expression profiles, suggesting that tumorigenesis in lung adenocarcinoma occur via different pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2512311689,"RNase H (RNH) is a pivotal domain in retrovirus to cleave the DNA-RNA hybrid for continuing retroviral replication. The crucial role indicates that RNH is a promising drug target for therapeutic intervention. However, annotated RNHs in UniProtKB database have still been insufficient for a good understanding of their statistical characteristics so far. In this work, a computational RNH model was proposed to annotate new putative RNHs (np-RNHs) in the retroviruses. It basically predicts RNH domains through recognizing their start and end sites separately with SVM method. The classification accuracy rates are 100%, 99.01% and 97.52% respectively corresponding to jack-knife, 10-fold cross-validation and 5-fold cross-validation test. Subsequently, this model discovered 14,033 np-RNHs after scanning sequences without RNH annotations. All these predicted np-RNHs and annotated RNHs were employed to analyze the length, hydrophobicity and evolutionary relationship of RNH domains. They are all related to retroviral genera, which validates the classification of retroviruses to a certain degree. In the end, a software tool was designed for the application of our prediction model. The software together with datasets involved in this paper can be available for free download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/rhtool/files/?source=navbar."
https://openalex.org/W2510592145,"Sutherlandia frutescens is a medicinal plant that has been traditionally used in southern Africa for cancers, infections, and inflammatory conditions. We recently published experiments demonstrating that an aqueous extract of S. frutescens possessed potent immune-stimulatory activity. This work was carried out with murine macrophages, an immune cell type that plays a pivotal role in host defense from infection and in shaping host inflammatory and immune responses. Here, we conducted a series of follow-up experiments to explore the impact of consuming S. frutescens on host response to bacterial challenge using healthy mice. We found that feeding mice a diet containing S. frutescens failed to significantly alter host response to systemic infection by either a gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium (i.e., L. monocytogenes and E. coli, respectively). In contrast to the in vitro observations, we found no evidence that S. frutescens consumption stimulated in vivo inflammatory responses; instead, consumption of S. frutescens tended to diminish in vivo inflammatory responses. Several possible reasons for this are discussed."
