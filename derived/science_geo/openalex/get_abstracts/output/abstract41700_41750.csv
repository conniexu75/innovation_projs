https://openalex.org/W2015497140,"Low-stringency hybridization with human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) complementary DNA was used to isolate a new gene encoding a predicted 107-kilodalton polypeptide. Expression studies demonstrate its ability to bind aldosterone with high affinity and to activate gene transcription in response to aldosterone, thus establishing its identity as the human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR). This molecule also shows high affinity for glucocorticoids and stimulates a glucocorticoid-responsive promoter. Together the hMR and hGR provide unexpected functional diversity in which hormone-binding properties, target gene interactions, and patterns of tissue-specific expression may be used in a combinatorial fashion to achieve complex physiologic control."
https://openalex.org/W2043268620,"Thirty-four hundred lambda phage clones containing segments of the E. coli chromosome were isolated and used to construct a 4700 kb long integrated restriction map for eight six-base-recognizing enzymes by a rapid mass-analysis method. Our strategy was to measure the sizes of partial restriction enzyme digests by hybridization with a vector probe in a manner analogous to nucleotide sequencing. The data were sorted into groups by a computer program and the boundary clones were further correlated with each other using a mass hybridization method. These clones can be exploited for the isolation of any desired E. coli genes if their map positions are known. Also, the strategy is applicable to analyses of the genomes of other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2003102216,"A dramatic and specific induction of c-fos was observed in identifiable neuronal populations in vivo after administration of the convulsant Metrazole. This effect was time- and dose-dependent and was abolished by prior treatment with the anticonvulsant drugs diazepam or pentobarbital. About 60 minutes after administration of Metrazole, c-fos messenger RNA reached a maximum and declined to basal levels after 180 minutes. A further decrease below that in normal brain was observed before a return to basal levels after 16 hours. While Metrazole still elicited seizures during this period, reinduction of c-fos was largely refractory. At 90 minutes, c-fos protein was observed in the nuclei of neurons in the dentate gyrus, and in the pyriform and cingulate cortices. Subsequently, c-fos protein appeared throughout the cortex, hippocampus, and limbic system. Thus, seizure activity results in increased c-fos gene expression in particular subsets of neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1600112653,"Aggregation, fragmentation, amino acid modification, and proteolytic susceptibility have been studied following exposure of 17 proteins to oxygen radicals. The hydroxyl radical (.OH) produced covalently bound protein aggregates, but few or no fragmentation products. Extensive changes in net electrical charge (both + and -) were observed. Tryptophan was rapidly lost with .OH exposure, and significant production of bityrosine biphenol occurred. When incubated with cell-free extracts of human and rabbit erythrocytes, rabbit reticulocytes, or Escherichia coli, most .OH-modified proteins were proteolytically degraded up to 50 times faster than untreated proteins. The exceptions were alpha-casein and globin, which were rapidly degraded without .OH modification. ATP did not stimulate the degradation of .OH-modified proteins, but alpha-casein was more rapidly degraded. Leupeptin had little effect under any condition, and degradation was maximal at pH 7.8. The data indicate that proteins which have been denatured by .OH can be recognized and degraded rapidly and selectively by intracellular proteolytic systems. In both red blood cells and E. coli, the degradation appears to be conducted by soluble, ATP-independent (nonlysosomal) proteolytic enzymes. In contrast with the above results, superoxide (O2-) did not cause aggregation or fragmentation, tryptophan loss, or bityrosine production. The combination of .OH + O2- (+O2), which may mimic biological exposure to oxygen radicals, induced charge changes, tryptophan loss, and bityrosine production. The pattern of such changes was similar to that seen with .OH alone, although the extent was generally less severe. In contrast with .OH alone, however, .OH + O2- (+O2) caused extensive protein fragmentation and little or no aggregation. More than 98% of the protein fragments had molecular weights greater than 5000 and formed clusters of ionic and hydrophobic bonds which could be dispersed by denaturing agents. The results indicate a general sensitivity of proteins to oxygen radicals. Oxidative modification can involve direct fragmentation or may provide denatured substrates for intracellular proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1654460714,"Exposure of proteins to the hydroxyl radical (.OH) or to the combination of .OH plus the superoxide anion radical (.OH + O2-) causes gross structural modification. Such modified proteins can undergo spontaneous fragmentation or can exhibit substantial increases in proteolytic susceptibility. In the present study, with the representative protein bovine serum albumin (BSA), we report that alterations to primary structure underlie such gross structural modifications. All amino acids in BSA were susceptible to modification by both .OH and .OH + O2- +O2), although tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, and cysteine were particularly sensitive. At a radical/BSA molar ratio (nmol of radicals/nmol of BSA) of 10, we observed an average 9-10% destruction of amino acids; whereas at a ratio of 100, the average loss was 45%. Decreasing tryptophan fluorescence provided a useful index of amino acid loss and exhibited a clear dose dependence with .OH or with .OH + O2- (+O2). Linear production of the biphenol bityrosine was observed with .OH treatment. In contrast, .OH + O2- (+O2) induced only a limited bityrosine production rate which reached an early plateau. Studies with various chemical scavengers (t-butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, mannitol, urate) and gasses (N2O, N2, O2, air) revealed that .OH is the primary radical responsible for all amino acid modifications, but that O2- and O2 can further transform the products of .OH reactions. Thus, O2-/O2 can potentiate .OH-dependent destruction of many amino acids (e.g. tryptophan) while inhibiting production of bityrosine by reacting with tyrosyl (phenoxyl) radicals. No amino acid loss or bityrosine production occurred with exposure to O2- (+O2) alone. Amino acid modifications caused both by .OH alone and by .OH + O2- (+O2) progressively affected the overall electrical charge of BSA. In a pH range of 3.7-6.2, some 16 new isoelectric focusing bands were induced by .OH, and some eight new bands were induced by .OH + O2- (+O2). The alterations to primary structure observed provide the key to an understanding of the link between oxidative modification and increased proteolytic susceptibility."

https://openalex.org/W1503901149,"Proteins which have been exposed to the hydroxyl radical (.OH) or to the combination of .OH plus the superoxide anion radical and oxygen (.OH + O2- + O2) exhibit altered primary structure and increased proteolytic susceptibility. The present work reveals that alterations to primary structure result in gross distortions of secondary and tertiary structure. Denaturation/increased hydrophobicity of bovine serum albumin (BSA) by .OH, or by .OH + O2- + O2 was maximal at a radical/BSA molar ratio of 24 (all .OH or 50% .OH + 50% O2-). BSA exposed to .OH also underwent progressive covalent cross-linking to form dimers, trimers, and tetramers, partially due to the formation of intermolecular bityrosine. In contrast, .OH + O2- + O2 caused spontaneous BSA fragmentation. Fragmentation of BSA produced new carbonyl groups with no apparent increase in free amino groups. Fragmentation may involve reaction of (.OH-induced) alpha-carbon radicals with O2 to form peroxyl radicals which decompose to fragment the polypeptide chain at the alpha-carbon, rather than at peptide bonds. BSA fragments induced by .OH + O2- + O2 exhibited molecular weights of 7,000-60,000 following electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, but could be visualized as hydrophobic aggregates in nondenaturing gels (confirmed with [3H]BSA following treatment with urea or acid). Combinations of various chemical radical scavengers (mannitol, urate, t-butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol) and gases (N2O, O2, N2) revealed that .OH is the primary species responsible for alteration of BSA secondary and tertiary structure. Oxygen, and O2- serve only to modify the outcome of .OH reaction. Furthermore, direct studies of O2- + O2 (in the absence of .OH) revealed no measurable changes in BSA structure. The process of denaturation/increased hydrophobicity was found to precede either covalent cross-linking (by .OH) or fragmentation (by .OH + O2- + O2). Denaturation was half-maximal at a radical/BSA molar ratio of 9.6, whereas half-maximal aggregation or fragmentation occurred at a ratio of 19.4. Denaturation/hydrophobicity may hold important clues for the mechanism(s) by which oxygen radicals can increase proteolytic susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1994789528,The functional organization of the cerebral cortex is modified dramatically by sensory experience during early postnatal life. The basis for these modifications is a type of synaptic plasticity that may also contribute to some forms of adult learning. The question of how synapses modify according to experience has been approached by determining theoretically what is required of a modification mechanism to account for the available experimental data in the developing visual cortex. The resulting theory states precisely how certain variables might influence synaptic modifications. This insight has led to the development of a biologically plausible molecular model for synapse modification in the cerebral cortex.
https://openalex.org/W1623206089,"Proteolytic degradation of oxidatively damaged [3H] bovine serum albumin [( 3H]BSA) was studied during incubation with cell-free erythrocyte extracts and a wide variety (14) of purified proteases. [3H]BSA was pretreated by exposure (60Co radiation) to the hydroxyl radical (.OH), the superoxide anion radical (O2-), or the combination of .OH + O2- + oxygen. Treated (and untreated) samples were dialyzed and then incubated with erythrocyte extract or proteases for measurements of proteolytic susceptibility (release of acid-soluble counts). Both .OH and .OH + O2- + caused severalfold increases in proteolytic susceptibility (with extract and proteases), but O2- alone had no effect. Proteolytic susceptibility reached a maximum at 15 nmol of .OH/nmol of BSA and declined thereafter. In contrast, proteolytic susceptibility was still increasing at an .OH + O2-/BSA molar ratio of 100 (50% .OH + 50% O2-). Degradation in erythrocyte extracts was conducted by a novel ATP- and Ca2+-independent pathway, with maximal activity at pH 7.8. Inhibitor profiles indicate that this pathway may involve metalloproteases and serine proteases. Comparisons of proteolytic susceptibility with multiple modifications to BSA primary, secondary, and tertiary structure revealed a high correlation (r = 0.98) with denaturation/increased hydrophobicity by low concentrations of .OH. Covalent aggregation reactions (BSA cross-linking) may explain the declining proteolytic susceptibility observed at .OH/BSA molar ratios greater than 20. Protein denaturation may also have caused the increased proteolytic susceptibility induced by .OH + O2- + O2, but no simple correlation could be obtained. Results with .OH + O2- + O2 appear to have been complicated by direct BSA fragmentation reactions involving (.OH-induced) protein radicals and oxygen. These data indicate a direct and quantitative relationship between protein damage by oxygen radicals and increased proteolytic susceptibility. Oxidative denaturation may exemplify a simple, yet effective inherent mechanism for intracellular proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1562522900,"Extracellular superoxide (O2-.) was detected in cultures of monkey arterial smooth muscle cells as measured by the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c and acetylated cytochrome c. Reduction of cytochrome c by these cells required L-cystine in the incubation medium. A variety of other sulfur-containing amino acids, including D-cystine, L-cystathionine, L-methionine, and djenkolic acid did not support O2-. generation when present at concentrations equimolar to L-cystine. At millimolar concentrations, the chelators EDTA and diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid inhibited O2-. production by smooth muscle cells. This effect was maximal when the chelator was present at the same concentration as the sum of the Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the medium, suggesting a role for these cations in O2-. generation by cells. Modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by arterial smooth muscle cells, as assessed by changes in lipid peroxide content, mobility on agarose gel electrophoresis, and apoprotein B fragmentation, was also L-cystine-dependent. LDL modification also required micromolar concentrations of the transition metal ion Cu(II) or Fe(III) and was inhibited by superoxide dismutase. LDL modified by smooth muscle cells in the presence of L-cystine and Cu(II) was taken up and degraded less well than native LDL by human skin fibroblasts, suggesting that recognition by the LDL receptor was lost. In contrast, LDL modified by smooth muscle cells was taken up and degraded to a greater degree than native LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages, consistent with recognition by the scavenger receptor. These results indicate that monkey arterial smooth muscle cells produce O2-. and modify LDL by an L-cystine-dependent process. This may involve reduction of cystine to a thiol, possibly cysteine or a cysteine-containing peptide such as glutathione. Sulfur-containing amino acids may play a role in atherogenesis by supporting cell-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species and modification of lipoprotein to a form recognized by the scavenger receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2024739169,"We introduce a new method that removes portions of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells to form semi-intact cells. During preparation, these cells lose their soluble cytoplasmic contents, but retain secretory organelles such as the ER and Golgi complex in an intact form. Transport of protein between the ER and Golgi can be functionally reconstituted in vitro using these semi-intact cells by incubation in the presence of cytosol and ATP. Export of the vesicular stomatitis virus strain tsO45 G protein from the ER in vitro is temperature-sensitive, similar to the result observed in vivo. These cells allow direct access of chemicals and antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of the cell and may be a widely applicable model system for study of a broad range of problems in cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W1484628070,"The substrate specificity of human neutrophil collagenase was examined using both monomeric and fibrillar collagens. The neutrophil enzyme cleaved types I, II, and III collagens, but failed to attack types IV or V. Against monomeric collagen substrates at 25 degrees C, the neutrophil enzyme displayed values for the Michaelis constant (Km) of 0.6-1.8 X 10(-6) M, essentially indistinguishable from the substrate affinities that characterize human fibroblast collagenase. Catalytic rates, however, varied considerably; type I collagen was cleaved with a specificity (kappa cat/Km) some 20-fold greater than type III. Type II collagen was degraded with intermediate selectivity, approximately equal to 25% of the type I rate, but 450% that of type III. This specificity contrasted markedly with that of human fibroblast collagenase, which cleaved human type III collagen 15-fold faster than type I and greater than 500-fold more rapidly than type II. Interestingly, the 20-fold selectivity for type I over type III exhibited by neutrophil collagenase against monomeric collagens was largely abolished following the reconstitution of these substrates into insoluble fibrils, falling to a value of just 1.5-fold. The distinctive and opposite preference by the human fibroblast enzyme for monomeric type III collagen over type I (15-fold) was similarly reduced to less than 2-fold upon substrate aggregation. The transition from native soluble collagen monomers into insoluble fibrils appeared to be handled by both the human neutrophil and fibroblast collagenases with similar facility on type I substrates. By comparison, however, the neutrophil enzyme degraded type III collagen fibrils faster than would have been predicted from solution rates, while the fibroblast enzyme cleaved such fibrils much slower than expected from solution values. In exploring this phenomenon further, solvent deuterium isotope effects were measured. The deuterium studies suggest that neutrophil collagenase, acting on type III fibrils (kappa H2O/kappa D2O = 5.0), is less sensitive to factors which govern the availability of water at the relatively hydrophobic site of peptide bond hydrolysis in the collagen molecule than is fibroblast collagenase (kappa H2O/kappa D2O = 15.0)."
https://openalex.org/W1996938276,"The cells that make up the body column of hydra are extensively joined by gap junctions, capable of mediating the rapid exchange of small hydrophilic molecules between the cytoplasms of neighboring cells. Both the rate of transfer of small molecules through the gap junctions and the rate of return of gap junction coupling after grafting experiments are sufficiently rapid to mediate events in the patterning of hydra tissue. Antibodies to the major rat liver gap junction protein (27,000 daltons) recognize a gap junction antigen in hydra and are effective in eliminating junctional communication between hydra cells. The antibodies perturb the head inhibition gradient in grafting operations, suggesting that cell-cell communication via gap junctions is important in this defined tissue patterning process."
https://openalex.org/W1519900170,"The rat contains at least three homologous cytosolic proteins that bind long chain fatty acids, termed liver (L-), intestinal (I-), and heart (H-) fatty acid binding protein (FABP). I-FABP mRNA is confined to the gastrointestinal tract while L-FABP mRNA is abundantly represented in hepatocytes as well as enterocytes. We have isolated a rat heart FABP cDNA clone and determined the pattern of H-FABP mRNA accumulation in a wide variety of tissues harvested from late fetal, suckling, weaning, and adult rats. RNA blot hybridizations and primer extension analysis disclosed that the distribution of H-FABP mRNA in adult rat tissues is different from that of I- or L-FABP mRNA. H-FABP mRNA is most abundant in adult heart. This mRNA was also present in an adult slow twitch (type I) skeletal muscle (soleus, 63% of the concentration in heart), testes (28%), a fast twitch skeletal muscle (psoas, 17%), brain (10%), kidney (5%), and adrenal gland (5%). H-FABP mRNA was not detected in adult small intestine, colon, spleen, lung, or liver RNA. Distinct patterns of developmental change in H-FABP mRNA accumulation were documented in heart, placenta, brain, kidney, and testes. Myocardial H-FABP mRNA levels rise rapidly during the 48 h prior to and after birth, reaching peak levels by the early weaning period. The postnatal increase in myocardial H-FABP mRNA concentration and its relative distribution in adult fast and slow twitch skeletal muscle are consistent with its previously proposed function in facilitating mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids. However, the presence of H-FABP mRNA in brain, a tissue which does not normally significantly oxidize fatty acids in late postnatal life, suggests that H-FABP may play a wider role in fatty acid metabolism than previously realized. Mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids were utilized to map H-FABP. Using stringencies which did not produce cross-hybridization between L-, I-, and H-FABP DNA sequences, we found at least three loci in the mouse genome, each located on different chromosomes, which reacted with our cloned H-FABP cDNA. None of these H-FABP-related loci were linked to the gene which specifies a highly homologous adipocyte-specific protein termed aP2 or to genes encoding two other members of this protein family, cellular retinol binding protein and cellular retinol binding protein II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2119078085,"The effect of position and number and of another intracellular location signal on the activity of the nuclear location signal was investigated. A minimal signal was inserted into several sites within the polypeptide chain of pyruvate kinase. The results observed suggest that a nuclear location signal can function at a variety of positions within a protein but that in some locations its activity is masked. Multiple copies of a partially defective signal were integrated into pyruvate kinase. The data suggest that multiple signals can cooperate to enhance nuclear accumulation. A nuclear location signal failed to function when inserted into polyomavirus middle T but was active in an identical variant lacking the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic tail. We conclude that while a minimal nuclear location signal is sufficient for nuclear localization, its activity is crucially dependent on the protein context within which it is present."

This procaryotic glycoprotein has recently been shown to exhibit novel features with respect to saccharide structure and saccharide biosynthesis. The primary structure and the location of glycosylation sites were determined by cloning and sequencing of the glycoprotein gene of Halobacterium halobium. According to the predicted amino acid sequence, the glycoprotein is synthesized with a N-terminal leader sequence of 34 amino acid residues reminiscent of eucaryotic and procaryotic signal peptides. A hydrophobic stretch of 21 amino acid residues at the C terminus probably serves as a transmembrane domain. 14 threonine residues are clustered adjacent to this membrane anchor and linked to these threonines are all the disaccharides of the cell surface glycoprotein. 12 N-glycosylation sites are distributed over the polypeptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W2101502555,"Several tumor cells secrete significantly increased amounts of the plasminogen activator urokinase, a trypsinlike serine protease, whose biological function in tumor biology is unclear. In this study we report that cells of the human epidermal tumor cell line CCL 20.2 express about 80,000 high-affinity urokinase receptors per cell that bind active as well as diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated high-molecular-weight (HMW) urokinase. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) urokinase is not bound to the receptor. Occupation of these receptors by active HMW urokinase stimulates cell proliferation independently in the presence of plasminogen in the culture medium. LMW urokinase has again no effect on cell proliferation. Calculated on a molar basis, this effect is about 28% of that of epidermal growth factor. Active HMW urokinase might therefore provide an autocrine receptor-mediated growth-promoting mechanism for tumor cells similar to those described for other growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1575813177,The human cell surface antigen 4F2 is a disulfide-linked heterodimer consisting of a glycosylated heavy chain and a nonglycosylated light chain. The antigen is ubiquitously expressed on proliferating cells but only in resting cells from certain tissues. Its function has been proposed to relate to cellular Ca2+/Na+ exchange. We describe the molecular cloning of the 4F2 heavy chain gene and cDNA by a gene transfer approach. Part of the gene was isolated from a genomic lambda library constructed with DNA of a secondary transfectant L cell line that expresses 4F2 antigen. A gene-specific probe derived from the phage inserts was used to isolate two full length cDNA clones. Both cDNA clones directed the expression of 4F2 antigen in transfected mouse L cells. The 4F2 antigen heavy chain gene specifies a 2.1-kilobase mRNA with an open reading frame coding for a 529-residue protein of 58 kDa. The protein lacks an NH2-terminal signal peptide but contains an internal transmembrane-spanning region and four potential glycosylation sites in its COOH-terminal domain. We predict that the 4F2 antigen heavy chain is a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic NH2 terminus of 81 amino acids. The antigen shows no homology to known protein sequences.
https://openalex.org/W1983365530,"We describe a general protocol for controlled gene amplification, which allows conditional expression of high levels of amber suppressor activity in monkey kidney cells, and we demonstrate its use in the genetic analysis of animal viruses by the generation and propagation of the first nonsense mutant of poliovirus. A human amber suppressor tRNASer gene linked to the SV40 origin of replication and a second DNA carrying a temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen gene were cotransfected into monkey cells. Cell lines having stably integrated the DNAs were isolated. Shifting the cells from the nonpermissive temperature to a lower permissive temperature caused the amplification of the suppressor tRNA gene, which resulted in suppression efficiencies at amber codons of 50%-70%, as measured by suppression of an amber codon in the E. coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. A mutant of poliovirus, in which a serine codon in the replicase gene was converted to an amber codon, was efficiently propagated on the suppressor-positive cell lines. The mutant virus reverted to wild-type by a single base change to a serine codon at a frequency of approximately 2.5 x 10(-6), surprisingly low for a RNA genome."
https://openalex.org/W1507578651,"The nucleotide sequence was determined for a 3-kilobase genomic fragment containing the ornithine decarboxylase gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fragment contained two open reading frames. Gene disruption localized the ornithine decarboxylase gene to a 1398-nucleotide open reading frame. Transcription of the yeast gene initiated at several sites 171 to 211 nucleotides 5' of the translational start site. The 3' end of the transcript extended approximately 300 nucleotides beyond the end of the ornithine decarboxylase coding region and contained two copies of the yeast ARS core sequence. Translation of the ornithine decarboxylase gene appeared to initiate at the first AUG condon of the open reading frame based upon translational fusions with the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene. Since no introns were apparent, the 1398-nucleotide open reading frame was predicted to encode a 466-amino acid protein with a calculated Mr = 52,369. The deduced protein differed significantly in size from previous reports on yeast ornithine decarboxylase, but was very similar in size to mammalian ornithine decarboxylase. When the predicted amino acid sequence of yeast ornithine decarboxylase was compared with that of the mouse enzyme, alignment of the sequences revealed that 40% of the amino acid residues were identical. Chou-Fasman predictions of the secondary structure of the two enzymes indicated that secondary structure was also highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2057295102,"A murine model in which neurotropic retroviral infection can be studied over short periods of time was developed. Microinjection of Cas-Br-E virus into midgestation mouse embryos caused paralysis and death within 25 days after birth, in contrast to virus-infected neonates which develop disease only after 4 months. To evaluate whether antiviral drugs could cross the placental barrier and influence the course of the disease, the drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) was administered to infected embryos through the drinking water of pregnant females. AZT treatment markedly retarded the onset and course of virus-induced central nervous system disease, permitting animals to survive beyond 4 months of age. These results are evidence for effective antiviral treatment during gestation and in the perinatal period and are of potential significance for the management of maternal transmission of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus."
https://openalex.org/W2052357638,"Extrachromosomal elements that are stably maintained at a constant copy number through cell doublings are a good model system for the study of the regulation of DNA replication in higher eukaryotes. Previous studies have defined both cis and trans functions required for the regulated plasmid replication of the bovine papilloma virus in stably transformed cells. Here, a sequence known to be a cis-dominant element of the replication origin of the plasmid is shown to contain a promoter for transcription. Both in vitro and in vivo assays have been used to define this promoter and show that a sequence located just 3' to the transcriptional start site is required for activity. This DNA sequence element, which has been defined through deletions, coincides with a binding site for a cellular factor and is also required for a functional origin of replication. Possible models for how a transcription factor may play a role in the regulation of DNA replication are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1580622719,"The amounts of cAMP and cGMP in the rat pinealocyte are regulated by norepinephrine acting through synergistic dual receptor mechanisms involving alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors (Vanecek, J., Sugden, D., Weller, J.L., and Klein, D.C. (1985) Endocrinology 116, 2167-2173; Sugden, L., Sugden, D., and Klein, D.C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11608-11612). Based on the available evidence, it appears that Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase is involved in the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of beta-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP, but not in the stimulation of cGMP (Sugden, D., Vanecek, J., Klein, D.C., Thomas, T.P., and Anderson, W.B. (1985) Nature 314, 359-361). In the present study the role of protein kinase C in the adrenergic stimulation of cGMP was reinvestigated, with the purpose of determining whether protein kinase C activators would potentiate the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists on cGMP if cells were also treated with agents known to elevate intracellular free Ca2+. The protein kinase C activator 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) markedly elevated the cGMP content of beta-adrenergically stimulated pinealocytes which had also been treated with 1 microM A23187, 15 mM K+, or 1 microM ouabain. The effects of A23187 were blocked by EGTA and those of K+ were blocked by nifedipine, establishing the involvement of Ca2+. The stimulatory effects of PMA on cGMP accumulation were mimicked by other protein kinase C activators. PMA also stimulated cGMP accumulation in cells treated with cholera toxin (1 microgram/ml) and A23187 (1 microM), but not in cells treated only with cholera toxin. These results suggest that protein kinase C, which is activated in the pinealocyte by the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, is probably involved in the adrenergic regulation of cGMP accumulation at a step distal to receptor activation."

https://openalex.org/W1577491827,"The purpose of this work was to study vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors and the adenylate cyclase response to VIP upon enterocytic differentiation of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 in culture. The VIP-stimulated enzyme activity is very low, e.g. 20% above basal activity in undifferentiated cells (day 5) and is enhanced markedly at confluency reaching a maximum, e.g. 270%, above basal activity in fully differentiated cells (day 30). VIP potency is also slightly enhanced, the EC50 of VIP ranging from 0.31 nM at day 5 to 0.07 nM at day 30. Modifications of the adenylate cyclase system are not responsible for the development of VIP response. Indeed, forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is unchanged during differentiation supporting no alteration of the enzyme catalytic subunit. The same holds true for NaF and guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)trisphosphate, indicating a constant activity of the guanine nucleotide regulatory unit which mediates hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase (Ns). This is further supported by the similar extent of cholera toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the Ns protein that is observed during differentiation. In sharp contrast, a dramatic increase of VIP receptor concentration is observed ranging from 32 fmol/mg of protein at day 5 to 414 fmol/mg of protein at day 30. This is confirmed by affinity cross-linking experiments showing an increased specific incorporation of 125I-VIP in a major 66,000-dalton component during differentiation. A slight increase in receptor affinity is also observed during differentiation with Kd ranging from 0.39 nM at day 5 to 0.08 nM at day 30. These data indicate that one population of VIP receptors accumulates during Caco-2 cell differentiation, representing the crucial event in the development of adenylate cyclase response to the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1546385411,"Sphinganine has been proposed to be a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C. In the present study we have evaluated whether sphinganine is a convenient tool to probe for the role of protein kinase C in neutrophil function. Human neutrophils were loaded with the fluorescent probe quin2 and then tested in parallel for cytosolic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, membrane potential changes, O2- production, and exocytosis of primary granules (containing beta-glucuronidase) in response to various stimuli. In addition to inhibiting O2- production and exocytosis in a dose-dependent manner, sphinganine also blocked formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced [Ca2+]i, transients. Furthermore, sphinganine inhibited exocytosis elicited by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Although sphinganine blocked O2- production due to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the most striking finding was that the drug rendered the cells leaky. Thus, at similar concentrations as those inhibiting cellular functions, sphinganine was shown to lead to cell permeabilization, as assessed by release of quin2 and cytoplasmic markers into the extracellular medium, and changes in plasma membrane potential. We conclude, therefore, that sphinganine does not appear to be a suitable compound for the evaluation of the involvement of protein kinase C in neutrophil activation."
https://openalex.org/W1554420225,"The cell surface pool of metabolically labeled platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors in BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts was studied using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Exposure of intact cells to PDGF stimulates autophosphorylation of surface PDGF receptors and allowed immunoaffinity purification of only PDGF-activated receptors. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated appearance of newly synthesized receptors in a surface activatable pool within 30-45 min of synthesis. In the absence of exogenous PDGF, the apparent half-life of this pool was 2 h. The presence of both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide chains on cell surface PDGF receptors was demonstrated. Enzymatic removal of the N-linked oligosaccharide chains reduced the receptor's apparent Mr by approximately 40 kDa and removal of O-linked oligosaccharide caused approximately a 7-kDa reduction. Activation of receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation by PDGF did not require either processing of high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides to complex forms or the presence of sialic acid on receptor oligosaccharide chains. Tryptic cleavage of PDGF-activated surface receptors in intact cells yielded two discrete phosphotyrosine-containing fragments of 107 and 85 kDa. Cleveland digest patterns from each fragment indicate that both are derived from the intact PDGF receptor. These data indicate that PDGF receptors are synthesized and turn over rapidly in the absence of ligand. Partial characterization of the extracellular domain oligosaccharide contribution to receptor function and trypsin susceptibility is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2065347196,"It has recently been shown that activation of murine T-cell hybridomas with antigen inhibits their growth in vitro. The ""suicide"" of these neoplastic T cells upon stimulation with antigen suggested the possibility that activation via the antigen-specific receptor could also inhibit the growth of neoplastic T cells in vivo. To test this, mice were subcutaneously inoculated with antigen-specific T-cell hybridomas and then treated intraperitoneally with antigen. Administration of the appropriate antigen immediately after inoculation with the T-cell hybridoma abrogated tumor formation; antigen administered after tumors had become established decreased the tumor burden and, in a substantial fraction of animals, led to long-term survival. The efficacy of antigen therapy was due to both a direct inhibitory effect on tumor growth and the induction of host immunity. These studies demonstrate the utility of cellular activation as a means of inhibiting neoplastic T-cell growth in vivo and provide a rationale for studying the use of less selective reagents that can mimic the activating properties of antigen, such as monoclonal antibodies, in the treatment of T-cell neoplasms of unknown antigen specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1584312402,"In vivo labeled fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was immunopurified from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells that had been incubated in the presence of [32P] orthophosphate. Tryptic peptides from labeled enzyme were mapped by high performance liquid chromatography. Most of the radioactivity was found to be associated with the peptide Arg9 through Arg24, the same peptide which had been previously shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Rittenhouse, J., Harrsch, P. B., Kim, J. N., and Marcus, F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3939-3943). The amino acid sequence analysis suggests that phosphorylation occurs at the same site, Ser11. We have also determined the extent of phosphorylation at Ser11 of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in yeast cultures growing under various nutritional conditions by measuring the relative amounts of phospho- and corresponding dephosphopeptides in tryptic digests. Significant levels of phosphorylation of the enzyme were found in yeast cultures grown under gluconeogenic conditions that varied from 0.15 to 0.50 mol of phosphate per mol of enzyme subunit. However, phosphate incorporation rapidly increased to greater than 0.8 mol after addition of glucose to these cultures. An alternative technique, based solely on enzyme activity measurements, was also developed to estimate the extent of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase phosphorylation in yeast cultures. The results obtained with this technique agreed with those obtained by high performance liquid chromatography of tryptic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1590648471,"The aggregation factor (AF) of the marine sponge Geodia cydonium recognizes the aggregation receptor (AR) which is inserted in the plasma membrane, under formation of species-specific aggregates. The specific cell-binding fragment of the AF was used to investigate for the first time the phosphoinositide metabolism in a lower avertebrate system. We found that after binding of the cell-binding fragment to the aggregation receptor a strong and rapid stimulation of the phosphate incorporation into phosphatidylinositol occurs followed by an increased turnover of phosphoinositides in the Geodia cells. The consequences of an increased degradation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into the two second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol are 2-fold. First, after the addition of the extracellular stimulus the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration rises, resulting in a rapid increased Ca2+ efflux rate. The functional consequence of the increase of the extracellular Ca2+ level is an initiation of the aggregate formation that is mediated by the collagen assembly factor (= primary aggregation factor). Second, some experimental evidences are presented, showing that the other second messenger formed, diacylglycerol, causes a translocation of protein kinase C within the cell. Incubation of Geodia cells with the cell-binding fragment of the AF, or with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, resulted within 5 min after treatment in a 70% decrease in protein kinase C activity in the cytosolic fraction and in a 700% increase in enzyme activity in the membrane fraction. It is proposed that by membrane association protein kinase C becomes activated. As a result of this event a series of cellular proteins are phosphorylated, a process which ultimately leads to an unusually strong induction of DNA polymerase alpha activity. From these data we conclude that inositol trisphosphate and protein kinase C also play a fundamental role in cellular signal transduction in lower eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1495151808,"The single free cysteine at residue 95 of bovine adrenodoxin was labeled with the fluorescent reagent N-iodoacetylamidoethyl-1-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonate (1,5-I-AEDANS). The modification had no effect on the interaction with adrenodoxin reductase or cytochrome P-450scc, suggesting that the AEDANS group at Cys-95 was not located at the binding site for these molecules. Addition of adrenodoxin reductase, cytochrome P-450scc, or cytochrome c to AEDANS-adrenodoxin was found to quench the fluorescence of the AEDANS in a manner consistent with the formation of 1:1 binary complexes. Forster energy transfer calculations indicated that the AEDANS label on adrenodoxin was 42 A from the heme group in cytochrome c, 36 A from the FAD group in adrenodoxin reductase, and 58 A from the heme group in cytochrome P-450scc in the respective binary complexes. These studies suggest that the FAD group in adrenodoxin reductase is located close to the binding domain for adrenodoxin but that the heme group in cytochrome P-450scc is deeply buried at least 26 A from the binding domain for adrenodoxin. Modification of all the lysines on adrenodoxin with maleic anhydride had no effect on the interaction with either adrenodoxin reductase or cytochrome P-450scc, suggesting that the lysines are not located at the binding site for either protein. Modification of all the arginine residues with p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal also had no effect on the interaction with adrenodoxin reductase or cytochrome P-450scc. These studies are consistent with the proposal that the binding sites on adrenodoxin for adrenodoxin reductase and cytochrome P-450scc overlap, and that adrenodoxin functions as a mobile electron carrier."

We show that TK mRNA nuclear transport in this cell can be dramatically altered by introduction of specific DNA sequences into the nucleus. Introduction of DNA sequences encompassing the promoter results in enhancement, in trans, of a transport process that can deliver previously synthesized RNA to the cytoplasm. The report suggests that the promoter of a eukaryotic gene can functionally interact with the mechanism involved in mRNA nuclear transport."

https://openalex.org/W2085011026,"Phototransduction in rod cells is likely to involve an intracellular messenger system that links the absorption of light by rhodopsin to a change in membrane conductance. The direct effect of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) on excised patches of rod outer segment membrane strongly supports a role for cGMP as an intracellular messenger in phototransduction. It is reported here that magnesium and calcium directly affect the conductance of excised patches of rod membrane in the absence of cGMP and that magnesium, applied to intact rod cells, blocks a component of the cellular light response. The divalent cation-suppressed conductance in excised patches showed outward rectification and cation-selective permeability resembling those of the light-suppressed conductance measured from the intact rod cell. The divalent cation-suppressed conductance was partly blocked by a concentration of the pharmacological agent L-cis-diltiazem that blocked all of the cGMP-activated conductance. Divalent cations may act, together with cGMP, as an intracellular messenger system that mediates the light response of the rod photoreceptor cell."
https://openalex.org/W2090988223,"Mitotic spindles isolated from the diatom Stephanopyxis turris consist of two half-spindles of closely interdigitating microtubules that slide relative to one another in the presence of ATP, reinitiating spindle elongation (anaphase B) in vitro. Purified spindles that have been exposed to ATP-γ-S undergo ATP-dependent reactivation more readily than do control spindles. Thiophosphorylated proteins in such spindles are located in the spindle midzone, kinetochores, and a portion of the pole complex. One major thiophosphorylated peptide of 205 kd is detected in extracts prepared from spindles labeled with [35S]ATP-γ-S, and is also localized in the spindle midzone by using an antibody that recognizes thiophosphorylated proteins. It is likely that this 205 kd peptide is either a positive regulator or mechanochemical transducer of microtubule sliding when it is in a phosphorylated state."
https://openalex.org/W1559423886,"We have examined the functional properties and growth factor responsiveness of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger in pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and in a differentiated mesodermal derivative (MES-1) by analyzing the recovery of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) from an acute acid load under bicarbonate-free conditions. In the absence of exogenous growth factors, the mean steady-state pHi of undifferentiated P19 cells (7.49 +/- 0.03) is 0.55 unit higher than the value of differentiated MES-1 cells (6.94 +/- 0.01). In both cell types, recovery of pHi from an NH+4-induced acid load follows an exponential time course and is entirely mediated by the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger in the plasma membrane. Kinetic analysis indicates that the higher steady-state pHi in P19 EC cells is due to an alkaline shift in the pHi sensitivity of the Na+/H+ exchange rate, as compared to that in MES-1 cells. The Na+/H+ exchanger of MES-1 cells is responsive to epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, serum, phorbol esters, and diacylglycerol, as shown by a rapid amiloride-sensitive rise in pHi of 0.15-0.35 unit. This mitogen-induced alkalinization is attributable to an alteration in the pHi sensitivity of the exchanger. In contrast, the Na+/H+ exchanger of P19 EC cells fails to respond to any of these stimuli. Similarly, hypertonic medium rapidly activates the Na+/H+ exchanger in MES-1, but not in P19 EC cells. We conclude that the Na+/H+ exchanger in undifferentiated P19 EC stem cells is maintained in a fully activated state which is unaffected by extracellular stimuli, as if signal pathways normally involved in growth factor action are constitutively operative."
https://openalex.org/W1960162686,"A soybean phospholipid mixture produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of beta subunit autophosphorylation of the detergent-soluble, purified human placental insulin receptor. Although phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine also increased insulin receptor autophosphorylation, only phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) stimulated to a similar extent as the phospholipid mixture. The effect of PtdIns was biphasic, stimulating at low concentrations (75 microM), but having no stimulatory effect at high concentrations (1.0 mM). Phospholipids also stimulated the exogenous protein kinase activity of the insulin receptor toward histone H2B. Phosphorylation of PtdIns occurred with these purified insulin receptor preparations, but this activity was insulin-independent, and the turnover number for PtdIns phosphorylation in the presence of soybean phospholipid was 1/220th as small as the turnover number for the autophosphorylating activity. These results suggest that although PtdIns can modulate the activity of the insulin receptor kinase, PtdIns phosphorylation itself is not directly involved in this regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1854896380,"Elevation of rat abdominal skin flaps, followed by ligation and division of the left inferior neurovascular pedicle, resulted in only a 40% survival of the area normally perfused by the ligated artery and vein. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (EC 1.15.1.1) administered i.v. (20,000 U/kg) 30 min before flap elevation increased survival to 52%. SOD derivatized with polyethylene glycol, which increases circulating half-life, was more effective, increasing survival to 80%. This protective effect resulted from the catalytic activity of the derivatized enzyme because inactivation by treatment with H2O2 eliminated its effect on skin flap survival. An equimolar mixture of Desferal and MnCl2, which catalyzes the dismutation of O2− in vitro, improved survival to 72%. Desferal-Fe3+, which lacks in vitro SOD activity, or Mn2+ alone did not affect the survival of skin flaps, but Desferal alone was nearly as effective as the Desferal-Mn2+ mixture. This effect of Desferal may result from acquisition of and subsequent removal of iron in vivo. These results support the view that the superoxide radical or a product derived from it plays a role in limiting the survival of island skin flaps.— Huang, L.; Privalle, C. T.; Serafin, D.; Klitzman, B. Increased survival of skin flaps by scavengers of superoxide radical. FASEB J. 1: 129-132; 1987."

https://openalex.org/W1534977390,"When the carbon monoxide complex of fully reduced cytochrome c oxidase, reconstituted into liposomes, is mixed with oxygen-containing buffer, complex kinetic progress curves are observed. This pattern is seen irrespective of whether the oxidase used in reconstitution is the dimeric or monomeric (subunit III-depleted) enzyme. These findings are interpreted in the light of similar experiments on the detergent-solubilized enzyme reported by Gibson and Greenwood (Gibson, Q.H., and Greenwood, C. (1963) Biochem. J. 86, 541-554) and confirmed by ourselves. We conclude that reconstitution of monomeric (subunit III-less) enzyme yields, preferentially, vesicles containing more than one functional unit, possibly associated as dimers. This result is of significance to our understanding of the relationships between aggregation state and proton pumping capacity of cytochrome oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1492446048,"Abstract The cDNAs coding for human nonhistone chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins 14 and 17 have been introduced into the eukaryotic expression vector pSVL under the transcriptional control of the SV40 late promoter and the constructs used to transfect COS cells. Transfection with plasmid pSVL14s, containing the HMG-14 cDNA in the sense orientation, increased the endogenous levels of HMG-14 mRNA 50-fold and the levels of HMG-14 protein 3-fold. Transfection with pSVL17s, which contains the HMG-17 mRNA in the sense orientation, resulted in a 19-fold increase in mRNA levels and a 3-fold increase in the protein level. Transfection with pSVL17as, containing the HMG-17 in the antisense orientation, resulted in a noticeable decrease in the protein levels. The overproduction of HMG mRNAs does not affect the level of other cellular mRNAs and the increase in the cellular level of either HMG-14 or -17 did not affect the level of the other HMG or that of any other cellular protein examined. The results suggest that COS cells can tolerate large excess of HMG mRNAs and protein, that the relative amounts of HMG-14 and HMG-17 and their mRNAs are not constant, and that neither the transcription nor the translation of the proteins is coordinately regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1540789211,"Rat stimulated heavy gastric membranes enriched with (H+-K+)-ATPase, a marker for the apical membrane of the parietal cell, displayed a 32P-histone-dephosphorylating activity which appeared to be physically copurified with, but functionally independent of, the ATPase. The protein phosphatase activity was optimal at pH 7.5 and was inhibited by fluoride (50 mM), inorganic phosphate (50 mM), and p-chloromercuribenzoate (0.1 mM), but was insensitive to vanadate (1 mM). The 32P-phosphoproteins in the heavy gastric membranes were also dephosphorylated, apparently by their own membrane-bound phosphatase in the presence of Mg2+ at millimolar concentrations, which is likely to enhance membrane-membrane interaction. Heavy gastric membrane vesicles incubated with Mg2+ (2 mM) exhibited no alterations in K+-dependent ATP-hydrolyzing activity, Cl permeability, and protein and lipid compositions, but irreversibly lost the ATP, K+-dependent H+-pumping activity. Since valinomycin, a K+-specific ionophore, restored the intravesicular acidifying activity and an inhibitor of the protein phosphatase, inorganic phosphate, largely blocked the Mg2+-induced change in the membrane transport function, it is reasonable to propose that the phosphatase action on certain membrane proteins, possibly the putative K+ transporter or regulatory proteins, selectively decreases K+-conductance in the apical membranes of gastric parietal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1494237528,"The kinetics of rat liver glucose-6-phosphatase (D-glucose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.9) were studied with intact and detergent-disrupted microsomes from normal and diabetic rats. Glucose-6-P concentrations employed (12 microM to 1.0 mM) spanned the physiologic range. With the enzyme of intact microsomes from both groups, plots of v versus [glucose-6-P] were sigmoid. Hanes plots (i.e. [glucose-6-P]/v versus [glucose-6-P]) were biphasic (concave upwards). A Hill coefficient of 1.45 was determined with substrate concentrations between 12 and 133 microM. Disruption of microsomal integrity abolished these departures from classic kinetic behavior, indicating that sigmoidicity may result from cooperative interaction of glucose-6-P with the glucose-6-phosphatase system at the substrate translocase specific for glucose-6-P. With the enzyme from normal rats the [glucose-6-P] at which the enzyme was maximally sensitive to variations in [glucose-6-P] (which we term Smax), determined from plots of dv/d [glucose-6-P] versus [glucose-6-P], was in the physiologic range. The Smax of 0.13 mM corresponded well with the normal steady-state hepatic [glucose-6-P] of 0.16 mM, consistent with glucose-6-phosphatase's function as a regulatory enzyme. With the diabetic enzyme, in contrast, values were 0.30 and 0.07 mM for the Smax and steady-state level, respectively. We suggest that the decreasing sensitivity of glucose-6-phosphatase activity to progressively diminishing glucose-6-P concentration, inherent in its sigmoid kinetics, constitutes a mechanism for the preservation of a residual pool of glucose-6-P for other hepatic metabolic functions in the presence of elevated concentrations of glucose-6-phosphatase such as in diabetes."
