https://openalex.org/W2810485115,"Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte grafts can remuscularize substantial amounts of infarcted myocardium and beat in synchrony with the heart, but in some settings cause ventricular arrhythmias. It is unknown whether human cardiomyocytes can restore cardiac function in a physiologically relevant large animal model. Here we show that transplantation of ∼750 million cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) enhances cardiac function in macaque monkeys with large myocardial infarctions. One month after hESC-CM transplantation, global left ventricular ejection fraction improved 10.6 ± 0.9% vs. 2.5 ± 0.8% in controls, and by 3 months there was an additional 12.4% improvement in treated vs. a 3.5% decline in controls. Grafts averaged 11.6% of infarct size, formed electromechanical junctions with the host heart, and by 3 months contained ∼99% ventricular myocytes. A subset of animals experienced graft-associated ventricular arrhythmias, shown by electrical mapping to originate from a point-source acting as an ectopic pacemaker. Our data demonstrate that remuscularization of the infarcted macaque heart with human myocardium provides durable improvement in left ventricular function."
https://openalex.org/W2809779343,"Fibrosis is a pathological result of a dysfunctional repair response to tissue injury and occurs in a number of organs, including the lungs1. Cellular metabolism regulates tissue repair and remodelling responses to injury2-4. AMPK is a critical sensor of cellular bioenergetics and controls the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism5. However, the role of AMPK in fibrosis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis, AMPK activity is lower in fibrotic regions associated with metabolically active and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts. Pharmacological activation of AMPK in myofibroblasts from lungs of humans with IPF display lower fibrotic activity, along with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and normalization of sensitivity to apoptosis. In a bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice, metformin therapeutically accelerates the resolution of well-established fibrosis in an AMPK-dependent manner. These studies implicate deficient AMPK activation in non-resolving, pathologic fibrotic processes, and support a role for metformin (or other AMPK activators) to reverse established fibrosis by facilitating deactivation and apoptosis of myofibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2810023485,"CRISPR base editing enables the creation of targeted single-base conversions without generating double-stranded breaks. However, the efficiency of current base editors is very low in many cell types. We reengineered the sequences of BE3, BE4Gam, and xBE3 by codon optimization and incorporation of additional nuclear-localization sequences. Our collection of optimized constitutive and inducible base-editing vector systems dramatically improves the efficiency by which single-nucleotide variants can be created. The reengineered base editors enable target modification in a wide range of mouse and human cell lines, and intestinal organoids. We also show that the optimized base editors mediate efficient in vivo somatic editing in the liver in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2810326672,"Small-molecule inhibitors of the serine dipeptidases DPP8 and DPP9 (DPP8/9) induce a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis in mouse and human monocytes and macrophages1,2. In mouse myeloid cells, Dpp8/9 inhibition activates the inflammasome sensor Nlrp1b, which in turn activates pro-caspase-1 to mediate cell death3, but the mechanism of DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pyroptosis in human myeloid cells is not yet known. Here we show that the CARD-containing protein CARD8 mediates DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pro-caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in human myeloid cells. We further show that DPP8/9 inhibitors induce pyroptosis in the majority of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML samples, but not in cells from many other lineages, and that these inhibitors inhibit human AML progression in mouse models. Overall, this work identifies an activator of CARD8 in human cells and indicates that its activation by small-molecule DPP8/9 inhibitors represents a new potential therapeutic strategy for AML."
https://openalex.org/W2810416640,"The koala, the only extant species of the marsupial family Phascolarctidae, is classified as ‘vulnerable’ due to habitat loss and widespread disease. We sequenced the koala genome, producing a complete and contiguous marsupial reference genome, including centromeres. We reveal that the koala’s ability to detoxify eucalypt foliage may be due to expansions within a cytochrome P450 gene family, and its ability to smell, taste and moderate ingestion of plant secondary metabolites may be due to expansions in the vomeronasal and taste receptors. We characterized novel lactation proteins that protect young in the pouch and annotated immune genes important for response to chlamydial disease. Historical demography showed a substantial population crash coincident with the decline of Australian megafauna, while contemporary populations had biogeographic boundaries and increased inbreeding in populations affected by historic translocations. We identified genetically diverse populations that require habitat corridors and instituting of translocation programs to aid the koala’s survival in the wild. The assembly of the genome of the koala provides insights into its adaptive biology and identifies gene expansions that contribute to its ability to detoxify eucalyptus-derived compounds and perceive plant secondary metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2810797652,"The failure to develop effective therapies for pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is in part due to their intrinsic heterogeneity. We aimed to quantitatively assess the extent to which this was present in these tumors through subclonal genomic analyses and to determine whether distinct tumor subpopulations may interact to promote tumorigenesis by generating subclonal patient-derived models in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of 142 sequenced tumors revealed multiple tumor subclones, spatially and temporally coexisting in a stable manner as observed by multiple sampling strategies. We isolated genotypically and phenotypically distinct subpopulations that we propose cooperate to enhance tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy. Inactivating mutations in the H4K20 histone methyltransferase KMT5B (SUV420H1), present in <1% of cells, abrogate DNA repair and confer increased invasion and migration on neighboring cells, in vitro and in vivo, through chemokine signaling and modulation of integrins. These data indicate that even rare tumor subpopulations may exert profound effects on tumorigenesis as a whole and may represent a new avenue for therapeutic development. Unraveling the mechanisms of subclonal diversity and communication in pGBM and DIPG will be an important step toward overcoming barriers to effective treatments."

Functional studies with cellulose nanofibrils revealed that most of the substrate-binding affinity of full-length ScLPMO10C resides in the CBM. Comparison of the catalytic performance of full-length ScLPMO10C and its isolated catalytic domain revealed that the CBM is beneficial for LPMO activity at lower substrate concentrations and promotes localized and repeated oxidation of the substrate. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the interplay between catalytic domains linked to CBMs in LPMOs and CAZymes in general.

Here, we found that 26% of nonhuman primates infected with Asian/American ZIKV in early gestation experienced fetal demise later in pregnancy despite showing few clinical signs of infection. Pregnancy loss due to asymptomatic ZIKV infection may therefore be a common but under-recognized adverse outcome related to maternal ZIKV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2811397393,"South Asia continues to carry the greatest share and number of wasted children worldwide. Understanding the determinants of wasting is important as policymakers renew efforts to tackle this persistent public health and development problem. Using data from national surveys in Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan, this analysis explores factors associated with wasting among children aged 0 to 59 months (n = 252,797). We conducted multivariate mixed logistic regression and backwards stepwise methods to identify parsimonious models for each country separately (all p values <0.05). Younger children (0 to 5 months), and those whose mothers had a low body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2) had greater odds of being wasted in all countries. Later birth order, being male, maternal illiteracy, short maternal stature, lack of improved water source, and household poverty were also associated with wasting in various countries, but not systematically in all. Seasonality was also not consistently associated with wasting in the final models. These findings suggest that pre-conception (adolescence), pregnancy and early postpartum, represent windows of opportunity for tackling child wasting, not only stunting. Our analysis suggests that the underlying determinants of wasting and stunting in South Asia are similar, but not universal across geographies. Cost-effective interventions to prevent both stunting and wasting, and to treat severe wasting, need to be scaled up urgently. Separating these two manifestations of child undernutrition in conceptual and programmatic terms may unnecessarily impair progress to reach the Sustainable Development Goals targets aimed at addressing both child stunting and wasting."
https://openalex.org/W2810599150,"The gut microbiota has recently been recognized to play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune liver disease (AILD), mainly primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This study aimed to analyze and compare the composition of the oral microbiota of 56 patients with AILD and 15 healthy controls (HCs) and to evaluate its association with salivary immunological biomarkers and gut microbiota. The subjects included 39 patients with PBC and 17 patients with AIH diagnosed at our hospital. The control population comprised 15 matched HCs. Salivary and fecal samples were collected for analysis of the microbiome by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S rDNA. Correlations between immunological biomarkers measured by Bio-Plex assay (Bio-Rad) and the oral microbiomes of patients with PBC and AIH were assessed. Patients with AIH showed a significant increase in Veillonella with a concurrent decrease in Streptococcus in the oral microbiota compared with the HCs. Patients with PBC showed significant increases in Eubacterium and Veillonella and a significant decrease in Fusobacterium in the oral microbiota compared with the HCs. Immunological biomarker analysis showed elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-8) and immunoglobulin A in the saliva of patients with AILD. The relative abundance of Veillonella was positively correlated with the levels of IL-1β, IL-8 and immunoglobulin A in saliva and the relative abundance of Lactobacillales in feces. Dysbiosis of the oral microbiota is associated with inflammatory responses and reflects changes in the gut microbiota of patients with AILD. Dysbiosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AILD."
https://openalex.org/W2811210439,"Snail, also called Snai1, is a key regulator of EMT. Snail plays crucial roles in cancer progression, including resistance to anti-tumor drugs and invasion by various cancer cells. Slug, also known as Snai2, is also involved in the aggravation of certain tumors. In this study, we examined the roles of Slug in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Slug is highly expressed in these cells, and Slug siRNA effectively represses anti-tumor drug resistance and invasive properties. In addition, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β upregulates the expression of Snail and Slug and promotes resistance to anti-tumor drugs in OSCC cells. Surprisingly, Slug siRNA appears to upregulate Snail expression considerably in OSCC cells. Snail siRNA also appears to upregulate Slug expression. Thus, either Slug or Snail siRNA alone partially mitigates malignant phenotypes in the presence of TGF-β, whereas both Slug and Snail siRNAs together dramatically suppress them. Therefore, Slug and Snail in tandem, but not alone, are potential therapeutic targets for nucleic acid medicines to treat oral cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2810169789,"This study has used dense reconstructions from serial EM images to compare the neuropil ultrastructure and connectivity of aged and adult mice. The analysis used models of axons, dendrites, and their synaptic connections, reconstructed from volumes of neuropil imaged in layer 1 of the somatosensory cortex. This shows the changes to neuropil structure that accompany a general loss of synapses in a well-defined brain region. The loss of excitatory synapses was balanced by an increase in their size such that the total amount of synaptic surface, per unit length of axon, and per unit volume of neuropil, stayed the same. There was also a greater reduction of inhibitory synapses than excitatory, particularly those found on dendritic spines, resulting in an increase in the excitatory/inhibitory balance. The close correlations, that exist in young and adult neurons, between spine volume, bouton volume, synaptic size, and docked vesicle numbers are all preserved during aging. These comparisons display features that indicate a reduced plasticity of cortical circuits, with fewer, more transient, connections, but nevertheless an enhancement of the remaining connectivity that compensates for a generalized synapse loss."
https://openalex.org/W2810850382,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered associations of numerous SNPs and genes with obesity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms through which these SNPs and genes affect the predisposition to obesity remain not fully understood. Aims of our study are to comprehensively characterize obesity GWAS SNPs and genes through computational approaches.For obesity GWAS identified SNPs, functional annotation, effects on miRNAs binding and impact on protein phosphorylation were performed via RegulomeDB and 3DSNP, miRNASNP, and the PhosSNP 1.0 database, respectively. For obesity associated genes, protein-protein interaction network construction, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed by STRING, PANTHER and STRING, respectively.A total of 445 SNPs are significantly associated with obesity related phenotypes at threshold P < 5×10-8. A number of SNPs were eQTLs for obesity associated genes, some SNPs located at binding sites of obesity related transcription factors. SNPs that might affect miRNAs binding and protein phosphorylation were identified. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified the highly-interconnected ""hub"" genes. Obesity associated genes mainly involved in metabolic process and catalytic activity, and significantly enriched in 15 signal pathways.Our results provided the targets for follow-up experimental testing and further shed new light on obesity pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2809687257,"Exposure to fecal contamination in public areas, especially in dense, urban environments, may significantly contribute to enteric infection risk. This study examined associations between sanitation and fecal contamination in public environments in four low-income neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana. Soil (n = 72) and open drain (n = 90) samples were tested for E. coli, adenovirus, and norovirus. Sanitation facilities in surveyed households (n = 793) were categorized by onsite fecal sludge containment (""contained"" vs. ""uncontained"") using previous Joint Monitoring Program infrastructure guidelines. Most sanitation facilities were shared by multiple households. Associations between spatial clustering of household sanitation coverage and fecal contamination were examined, controlling for neighborhood and population density (measured as enumeration areas in the 2010 census and spatially matched to sample locations). E. coli concentrations in drains within 50m of clusters of contained household sanitation were more than 3 log-units lower than those outside of clusters. Further, although results were not always statistically significant, E. coli concentrations in drains showed consistent trends with household sanitation coverage clusters: concentrations were lower in or near clusters of high coverage of household sanitation facilities-especially contained facilities-and vice versa. Virus detection in drains and E. coli concentrations in soil were not significantly associated with clustering of any type of household sanitation and did not exhibit consistent trends. Population density alone was not significantly associated with any of the fecal contamination outcomes by itself and was a significant, yet inconsistent, effect modifier of the association between sanitation clusters and E. coli concentrations. These findings suggest clustering of contained household sanitation, even when shared, may be associated with lower levels of fecal contamination within drains in the immediate public domain. Further research is needed to better quantify these relationships and examine impacts on health."
https://openalex.org/W2809860986,"Postoperative complications after lung surgery are frequent, having a detrimental effect on patients' further course. Complications may lead to an increased length of hospital stay and cause additional costs. Several risk factors have been identified but it is still difficult to predict contemporary which patients are at risk. We hypothesized that patients who show an increased inflammatory response at the time of wound closure and 24 hours after surgery are at risk of postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery.Postoperative complications (pulmonary, cardiac, neurological and renal) of 96 patients scheduled for lung surgery at the Medical Center-University of Freiburg were analyzed in this prospective, clinical study. Blood samples for cytokine analysis (Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, Tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, IL-1ß and IL12p70) were taken before surgery, at wound closure and 24 hours after surgery. Cytokine levels of patients with and without postoperative complications were analyzed by Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. To adjust the results according to existing covariates a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted.The complication and non-complication group differed significantly according to nicotine dependency, Angiotensin-receptor-II blocker medication, rate of thoracotomy and preoperative lung function. The intraoperative hemodynamic parameters and therapy did not differ between the groups. Twenty-nine patients (30%) developed postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery. Plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-8 at the time of wound closure and 24 hours after surgery were higher in the complication group. Multivariate regression analysis on postoperative complications revealed an Odds ratio of 56 for patients with IL-6 and IL-8 levels above the 3rd quartile measured on the first postoperative day.Perioperative detection of increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in lung surgery may be used in addition to other clinical predictors to identify patients at risk for postoperative complications.German Clinical Trials Register 00006961."
https://openalex.org/W2809753722,"A significant portion of oil released during the Deepwater Horizon disaster reached the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) seafloor. Predicting the long-term fate of this oil is hindered by a lack of data about the combined influences of pressure, temperature, and sediment composition on microbial hydrocarbon remineralization in deep-sea sediments. To investigate crude oil biodegradation by native GOM microbial communities, we incubated core-top sediments from 13 GOM sites at water depths from 60-1500 m with crude oil under simulated aerobic seafloor conditions. Biodegradation occurred in all samples and followed a predictable compound class sequence dictated by molecular weight and structure. 45 to ~100% of total n-alkane and 3 to 60% of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were depleted. In reactors incubated at 4°C and at pressures of 6-15 MPa, the depletion in total n-alkane was inversely correlated to pressure (R2 ~ 0.85), equivalent to a 4% decrease in total n-alkane depletion for every 1 MPa increase. Our results indicated a modest inhibitory effect of pressure on biodegradation over our experimental range. However, the expansion of oil exploration to deeper waters (e.g., 5000 m) opens the risk of spills at conditions at which pressure might have a more pronounced effect."
https://openalex.org/W2809862271,"This study proposes and discusses a multi-scale spatial planning method implemented simultaneously at local and national level to prioritize ecosystem management actions across landscapes and seascapes. Mismatches in scale between the occurrence of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes, and the size and nature of the human footprint, and the different levels and scope of governance, are a significant challenge in conservation planning. These scale mismatches are further confounded by data resolution disparities across and amongst the different scales. To address this challenge, we developed a multi-resolution scale-linked marine spatial planning method. We tested this approach in the development of a Conservation Plan for a significant portion of South Africa's exclusive economic zone, adjacent to the east coast province of KwaZulu-Natal (the SeaPlan project). The study's dataset integrated the geographic distribution of 390 biodiversity elements (species, habitats, and oceanographic processes) and 38 human activities. A multi-resolution system of planning unit layers (PUL), with individual PUs ranging in resolution from 0.2 to 10 km, was designed to arrange and analyse these data. Spatial priorities for conservation were selected incrementally at different scales, contributing conservation targets from the fine-, medium- and large-scale analyses, and from the coast to the offshore. Compared to a basic single-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our multi-resolution scale-linked method selects 6% less conservation area to achieve the same targets. Compared to a multi-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our method requires only an additional 5% area. Overall, this method reflects the multi-scale nature of marine social-ecological systems more realistically, is relatively simple and replicable, and serves to better connect fine-scale and large-scale spatial management policies. We discuss the impacts of this study on protected area expansion planning processes in South Africa. This study showcases a methodological advance that has the potential to impact marine spatial planning practices and policies."
https://openalex.org/W2810491711,"This paper aims to evaluate the association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels, arterial hypertension (HT) prevalence, blood pressure values control, kidney function and intima media thickness (IMT), as a surrogate marker of early atherosclerosis, in a representative group of Romanian adult population.The study sample consists in 1920 adults included in SEPHAR III (Study for the Evaluation of Prevalence of Hypertension and cArdiovascular Risk in Romania) survey (mean age 48.63 years, 52.76% females) collecting data for SUA levels, blood pressure (BP) measurements, kidney function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and carotid IMT. SUA levels between 2,40-5,70mg/dl in females and 3,40-7,00mg/dl in males respectively were considered normal. HT and HT control were defined according to the current guidelines. IMT evaluation was assessed by B-mode Doppler ultrasound evaluation.Hypertensive subjects had significantly higher values of SUA compared with normotensive subjects, hypertensive patients were 1.713 times more likely to have higher values of SUA. Among treated hypertensive patients, those without optimal BP control had significantly higher SUA levels compared with those with optimal BP control, the presence of hyperuricemia increasing the odds of suboptimal BP control by 1.023. Hyperuricemic subjects had significantly lower eGFR values compared with normouricemic ones, on an average with 14.28ml/min/1.73m2 by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula (MDRD) and with 16.64ml/min/1.73m2 by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (CKD-EPI), with an indirect association between SUA levels and eGFR values (rs = -0.319 / -0.347), independent of age. IMT values recorded in hyperuricemic subjects were significantly increased, on an average with 0.08mm, compared with normouricemic subjects, with a direct association between SUA levels and IMT values (rs = 0.263), independent of BP values.The results of our study offers support that increased SUA levels are associated with arterial hypertension and with suboptimal BP control in treated hypertensive subjects. The decline in kidney function, independent of age, and also increased IMT values as a marker of atherosclerosis, were also correlated with elevated SUA values. Hyperuricemia screening may have a role in identifying patients at risk of developing HT and lowering SUA levels may improve not only BP control in treated HT patients but also decrease total cardiovascular mortality by slowing the progression of atherosclerosis and renal failure in hypertensive patients."

To characterize the H9N2 variant viruses from 2011 to 2014, 28 H9N2 influenza viruses were isolated from live poultry markets in China from 2011–2014 and were analyzed by genetic and biological characterization. Our findings showed that 16 residues that changed antigenicity, two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and one amino acid in the receptor binding site of the HA protein changed significantly from 2011–2014. Moreover, the HA and NA genes in the phylogenetic tree were mainly clustered into two independent branches, A and B, based on the year of isolation. H9N2 virus internal genes were related to those from the human-infected avian influenza viruses H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8. In particular, the NS gene in the phylogenetic tree revealed genetic divergence of the virus gene into three branches labeled A, B, and C, which were related to the H9N2, H10N8, and H7N9 viruses, respectively. Additionally, the isolates also showed varying levels of infection and airborne transmission. These results indicated that the H9N2 virus had undergone an adaptive evolution and variation from 2011–2014."
https://openalex.org/W2811047548,"Protein activity is often regulated by altering the oligomerization state. One mechanism of multimerization involves domain swapping, wherein proteins exchange parts of their structures and thereby form long-lived dimers or multimers. Domain swapping has been specifically observed in amyloidogenic proteins, for example the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors. Cystatins are twin-headed inhibitors, simultaneously targeting the lysosomal cathepsins and legumain, with important roles in cancer progression and Alzheimer's disease. Although cystatin E is the most potent legumain inhibitor identified so far, nothing is known about its propensity to oligomerize. In this study, we show that conformational destabilization of cystatin E leads to the formation of a domain-swapped dimer with increased conformational stability. This dimer was active as a legumain inhibitor by forming a trimeric complex. By contrast, the binding sites toward papain-like proteases were buried within the cystatin E dimer. We also showed that the dimers could further convert to amyloid fibrils. Unexpectedly, cystatin E amyloid fibrils contained functional protein, which inhibited both legumain and papain-like enzymes. Fibril formation was further regulated by glycosylation. We speculate that cystatin amyloid fibrils might serve as a binding platform to stabilize the pH-sensitive legumain and cathepsins in the extracellular environment, contributing to their physiological and pathological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2809801884,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive subtype of malignant gliomas. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients involves maximal surgical debulking, followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. Despite the advances in GBM therapy, its outcome remains poor with a median survival of less than two years. This poor outcome is partly due to the ability of GBM tumors to acquire adaptive resistance to therapy and in particular to radiation. One of the mechanisms contributing to GBM tumor progression and resistance is an aberrant activation of NF-ĸB, a family of inducible transcription factors that play a pivotal role in regulation of many immune, inflammatory and carcinogenic responses. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic terpenoid extracted from the gum Ayurvedic therapeutic plant Boswellia serrata. AKBA is anti-inflammatory agent that exhibits potent cytotoxic activities against various types of tumors including GBM. One of the mechanisms underlying AKBA anti-tumor activity is its ability to modulate the NF-ĸB signaling pathway. The present study investigated in vitro and in vivo the effect of combining AKBA with ionizing radiation in the treatment of GBM and assessed AKBA anti-tumor activity and radio-enhancing potential. The effect of AKBA and/or radiation on the survival of cultured glioblastoma cancer cells was evaluated by XTT assay. The mode of interaction of treatments tested was calculated using CalcuSyn software. Inducing of apoptosis following AKBA treatment was evaluated using flow cytometry. The effect of combined treatment on the expression of PARP protein was analysed by Western blot assay. Ectopic (subcutaneous) GBM model in nude mice was used for the evaluation of the effect of combined treatment on tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections was used to assess treatment-related changes in Ki-67, CD31, p53, Bcl-2 and NF-ĸB-inhibitor IĸB-α. AKBA treatment was found to inhibit the survival of all four tested cell lines in a dose dependent manner. The combined treatment resulted in a more significant inhibitory effect compared to the effect of treatment with radiation alone. A synergistic effect was detected in some of the tested cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining of AKBA treated cells indicated induction of apoptosis. AKBA apoptotic activity was also confirmed by PARP cleavage detected by Western blot analysis. The combined treatment suppressed tumor growth in vivo compared to no treatment and each treatment alone. Immunohistochemical analysis showed anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activity of AKBA in vivo. It also demonstrated a decrease in p53 nuclear staining and in Bcl-2 staining and an increase in IĸB-α staining following AKBA treatment both alone and in combination with radiotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated that AKBA exerts potent anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity, and significantly inhibits both the survival of glioblastoma cells in vitro and the growth of tumors generated by these cells. Combination of AKBA with radiotherapy was found to inhibit factors which involved in cell death regulation, tumor progression and radioresistence, therefore it may serve as a novel approach for GBM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2811402375,"Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) is a late onset, autosomal dominant eye disease that can lead to loss of vision. Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the third intron of the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene is highly associated with FECD. However, only about 75% of FECD patients in the northern European population possess an expansion of this repeat. The remaining FECD cases appear to be associated with variants in other genes. To better understand the pathophysiology of this disease, we compared gene expression profiles of corneal endothelium from FECD patients with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (RE+) to those that do not have a repeat expansion (RE-). Comparative analysis of these two cohorts showed widespread RNA mis-splicing in RE+, but not in RE- samples. Quantitatively, we identified 39 genes in which expression was significantly different between RE+ and RE- samples. Examination of the mutation profiles in the RE- samples did not find any mutations in genes previously associated with FECD, but did reveal one sample with a rare variant of laminin subunit gamma 1 (LAMC1) and three samples with rare variants in the gene coding for the mitochondrial protein peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 1 (TSPOAP1)."
https://openalex.org/W2809944244,"A natural pH gradient caused by marine CO2 seeps off the Methana peninsula (Saronikos Gulf, eastern Peloponnese peninsula) was used as a natural laboratory to assess potential effects of ocean acidification on coccolithophores. Coccolithophore communities were therefore investigated in plankton samples collected during September 2011, September 2016 and March 2017. The recorded cell concentrations were up to ~50 x103 cells/l, with a high Shannon index of up to 2.8, along a pH gradient from 7.61 to 8.18, with values being occasionally <7. Numerous holococcolithophore species represented 60–90% of the surface water assemblages in most samples during September samplings. Emiliania huxleyi was present only in low relative abundances in September samples, but it dominated in March assemblages. Neither malformed nor corroded coccolithophores were documented. Changes in the community structure can possibly be related to increased temperatures, while the overall trend associates low pH values with high cell densities. Our preliminary results indicate that in long-termed acidified, warm and stratified conditions, the study of the total coccolithophore assemblage may prove useful to recognize the intercommunity variability, which favors the increment of lightly calcified species such as holococcolithophores."

Activation of CRTh2, by its ligand prostaglandin (PG)D2, mediates production of type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), chemotaxis and inhibition of apoptosis. As such, the PGD2-CRTh2 pathway is considered important to the development and maintenance of allergic inflammation. Expression of CRTh2 is mediated by the transcription factor GATA3 during Th2 cell differentiation and within ILC2s. Other than this, relatively little is known regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating expression of CRTh2. Here, we show using primary human Th2 cells that activation (24hrs) through TCR crosslinking (αCD3/αCD28) reduced expression of both mRNA and surface levels of CRTh2 assessed by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. This effect took more than 4 hours and expression was recovered following removal of activation. EMSA analysis revealed that GATA3 and NFAT1 can bind independently to overlapping sites within a CRTh2 promoter probe. NFAT1 over-expression resulted in loss of GATA3-mediated CRTh2 promoter activity, while inhibition of NFAT using a peptide inhibitor (VIVIT) coincided with recovery of CRTh2 expression. Collectively these data indicate that expression of CRTh2 is regulated through the competitive action of GATA3 and NFAT1. Though prolonged activation led to NFAT1-mediated downregulation, CRTh2 was re-expressed when stimulus was removed suggesting this is a dynamic mechanism and may play a role in PGD2-CRTh2 mediated allergic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2811371292,"Psychologists often note that most people think they are above average in intelligence. We sought robust, contemporary evidence for this ""smarter than average"" effect by asking Americans in two independent samples (total N = 2,821) whether they agreed with the statement, ""I am more intelligent than the average person."" After weighting each sample to match the demographics of U.S. census data, we found that 65% of Americans believe they are smarter than average, with men more likely to agree than women. However, overconfident beliefs about one's intelligence are not always unrealistic: more educated people were more likely to think their intelligence is above average. We suggest that a tendency to overrate one's cognitive abilities may be a stable feature of human psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2810104866,"The immune system plays a significant role in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) progression, with CD8+ T cells being capable to directly kill tumor cells using perforin and granzymes. However, tumors avoid immune recognition by escape mechanisms. In this study, we aim to demonstrate tumor immune escape mechanisms that suppress CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity. 42 patients diagnosed with UBC were recruited. CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood (PB), sentinel nodes (SN), and tumor were analyzed in steady state and in vitro-stimulated conditions by flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, and ELISA. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used for identification of proteins from UBC cell line culture supernatants. Perforin was surprisingly found to be low in CD8+ T cells from SN, marked by 1.8-fold decrease of PRF1 expression, with maintained expression of granzyme B. The majority of perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells are effector memory T (TEM) cells with exhausted Tc2 cell phenotype, judged by the presence of PD-1 and GATA-3. Consequently, perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells from SN are low in T-bet expression. Supernatant from muscle invasive UBC induces perforin deficiency, a mechanism identified by MS where ICAM-1 and TGFβ2 signaling were causatively validated to decrease perforin expression in vitro. Thus, we demonstrate a novel tumor escape suppressing perforin expression in CD8+ T cells mediated by ICAM-1 and TGFβ2, which can be targeted in combination for cancer immunotherapy."

We analyzed the clinical features and cytokine responses of HRV isolates in children with respiratory infections. Quantitative analysis and genotyping of the HRV-positive samples from 601 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were performed using VP4/VP2 sequencing. To compare T-helper1 (Th1) type (IFN-γ, TNF-α) and Th2 type (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine responses between HRV-A, B and C, the levels of the four cytokines were measured. The HRV-positive children had shorter fever duration (P = 0.018), and higher frequencies of chest retraction (P = 0.002) and wheezing (P = 0.022) than did the HRV-negative group. HRV-A was identified in 55 cases (58.5%), HRV-B in 8 (8.5%), and HRV-C in 31 (33.0%). There were no significant differences in the clinical data or NPA cytokines levels between patients with HRV-A and HRV-C infections. HRV is an important pathogen of the lower respiratory tract in young children. HRV-A and HRV-C are the dominant species that cause respiratory difficulty in young children."
https://openalex.org/W2811241305,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Therapeutic hypothermia is standard clinical care for moderate hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) brain injury, however it reduces the risk of death and disability only by 11% and 40% of the treated infants still develop disabilities. Thus it is necessary to develop supplementary therapies to complement therapeutic hypothermia in the treatment of neonatal HIE. The modified Rice-Vannucci model of HI in the neonatal mouse is well developed and widely applied with different periods of hypothermia used as neuroprotective strategy in combination with other agents. However, different studies use different periods, time of initiation and duration of hypothermia following HI, with subsequent varying degrees of neuroprotection. So far most rodent data is obtained using exposure to 5-6h of therapeutic hypothermia. Our aim was to compare the effect of exposure to three different short periods of hypothermia (1h, 1.5h and 2h) following HI insult in the postnatal day 7 C57/Bl6 mouse, and to determine the shortest period providing neuroprotection. Our data suggests that 1h and 1.5h of hypothermia delayed by 20min following a 60min exposure to 8%O2 do not prove neuroprotective. However, 2h of hypothermia significantly reduced tissue loss, TUNEL+ cell death and microglia and astroglia activation. We also observed improved functional outcome 7 days after HI. We suggest that the minimal period of cooling necessary to provide moderate short term neuroprotection and appropriate for the development and testing of combined treatment is 2h."
https://openalex.org/W2811246946,"Reducing variability of quantitative suspension array assays is key for multi-center and large sero-epidemiological studies. To maximize precision and robustness of an in-house IgG multiplex assay, we analyzed the effect of several conditions on variability to find the best combination. The following assay conditions were studied through a fractional factorial design: antigen-bead coupling (stock vs. several), sample predilution (stock vs. daily), temperature of incubation of sample with antigen-bead (22°C vs. 37°C), plate washing (manual vs. automatic) and operator expertise (expert vs. apprentice). IgG levels against seven P. falciparum antigens with heterogeneous immunogenicities were measured in test samples, in a positive control and in blanks. We assessed the variability and MFI quantification range associated to each combination of conditions, and their interactions, and evaluated the minimum number of samples and blank replicates to achieve good replicability. Results showed that antigen immunogenicity and sample seroreactivity defined the optimal dilution to assess the effect of assay conditions on variability. We found that a unique antigen-bead coupling, samples prediluted daily, incubation at 22°C, and automatic washing, had lower variability. However, variability increased when performing several couplings and incubating at 22°C vs. 37°C. In addition, no effect of temperature was seen with a unique coupling. The expertise of the operator had no effect on assay variability but reduced the MFI quantification range. Finally, differences between sample replicates were minimal, and two blanks were sufficient to capture assay variability, as suggested by the constant Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of three and two blanks. To conclude, a single coupling was the variable that most consistently reduced assay variability, being clearly advisable. In addition, we suggest having more sample dilutions instead of replicates to increase the likelihood of sample MFIs falling in the linear part of the antigen-specific curve, thus increasing precision."

While PET intensity carries prognostic significance, the genetic abnormalities associated with increased intensity remain unspecified.NSCLC samples (N = 34) from 1999 to 2011 for which PET data were available were identified from a prospectively collected tumor bank. PET intensity was classified as mild, moderate, or intense based on SUVmax measurement or radiology report. Associations between genome-wide expression (RNAseq) and PET intensity were determined. Associations with overall survival were then validated in two external NSCLC cohorts.Overall survival was significantly worse in patients with PET-intense (N = 11) versus mild (N = 10) tumors (p = 0.039). Glycolytic gene expression patterns were markedly similar between intense and mild tumors. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated significant enhancement of cell-cycle and proliferative processes in FDG-intense tumors (p<0.001). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested associations between PET-intensity and canonical oncogenic signaling pathways including MYC, NF-κB, and HIF-1. Using an external cohort of 25 tumors with PET and genomic profiling data, common genes and gene sets were validated for additional study (P<0.05). Of these common gene sets, 20% were associated with hypoxia or HIF-1 signaling. While HIF-1 expression did not correlate with poor survival in the NSCLC validation cohort (N = 442), established targets of hypoxia signaling (PLAUR, ADM, CA9) were significantly associated with poor overall survival.PET-intensity is associated with a variety of oncogenic alterations in operable NSCLC. Adjuvant targeting of these pathways may improve survival among patients with PET-intense tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2810718432,"Acanthamoeba is normally free-living, but sometimes facultative and occasionally opportunistic parasites. Current therapies are, by necessity, arduous and yet poorly effective due to their inabilities to kill cyst stages or in some cases to actually induce encystation. Acanthamoeba can therefore survive as cysts and cause disease recurrence. Herein, in pursuit of better therapies and to understand the biochemistry of this understudied organism, we characterize its histidine biosynthesis pathway and explore the potential of targeting this with antimicrobials. We demonstrate that Acanthamoeba is a histidine autotroph, but with the ability to scavenge preformed histidine. It is able to grow in defined media lacking this amino acid, but is inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) that targets Imidazoleglycerol-Phosphate Dehydratase (IGPD) the rate limiting step of histidine biosynthesis. The structure of Acanthamoeba IGPD has also been determined in complex with 2-hydroxy-3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) propylphosphonate [(R)-C348], a recently described novel inhibitor of Arabidopsis thaliana IGPD. This compound inhibited the growth of four Acanthamoeba species, having a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging from 250–526 nM. This effect could be ablated by the addition of 1 mM exogenous free histidine, but importantly not by physiological concentrations found in mammalian tissues. The ability of 3AT and (R)-C348 to restrict the growth of four strains of Acanthamoeba spp. including a recently isolated clinical strain, while not inducing encystment, demonstrates the potential therapeutic utility of targeting the histidine biosynthesis pathway in Acanthamoeba."

However, it has also been well established that these antibiotics are not effective in killing non-growing or slow-growing bacteria and the mechanism of this ""antibiotic tolerance"" is not well understood. In this study, we report on the genetic basis and phenotypic properties of an antibiotic tolerant derivative of the methicillin susceptible S. aureus strain 27s. Cultures were exposed to ""pulses"" of high concentrations of oxacillin followed by outgrowth of the surviving bacteria. This procedure quickly selected for antibiotic tolerant mutants with an increased ability to survive antibiotic treatment without increase in the MIC value for the antibiotic. Such mutants also exhibited longer lag phase, decreased lysis, virtually no change in antibiotic susceptibilities, cross tolerance to D-cycloserine and vancomycin, and increase in biofilm formation in the presence of high concentrations of oxacillin. Whole genome sequencing showed that these altered properties were linked to mutations in the atl and gdpP genes."
https://openalex.org/W2810578994,"In the USA, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) has restored millions of acres of wetlands through its Wetland Reserve Easement (WRE) programs. However, few quantitative studies have explored whether WREs have enhanced wetland hydrology and wetland plant communities. Additionally, USDA Compatible Use Permits for cattle grazing and other management practices are sometimes issued for WREs, but little is known about potential benefits/detriments of such practice on the success of wetland restoration. In this study, we tested if hydrological restoration of previously drained species poor pastures increased water depth and hydroperiod. Restoration involved plugging key ditches, adding water control structures and a berm. We also tested if hydrological restoration increased plant diversity (alpha and beta), floristic quality (using coefficient of conservatism) and increased the cover of wetland species (using species wetland status). Finally, we tested if cattle grazing had an effect on the success of restoration by comparing grazed plots to fenced plots. We studied two conservation easements (a total of 748 acres) located on semi-native pastures in central Florida, USA. We monitored vegetation using permanent transects stratified by vegetation type before (2004-2005) and after (2012) the restoration (2008). We assessed wetland hydroperiod using groundwater wells set up in 2003 and located within and outside the boundaries of these two easements. We used linear mixed models and multivariate analyses to compare vegetation and hydroperiods pre- and post-restoration. Number of flooded days increased following restoration in one of the easements, but we did not detect significant changes in hydrology in the other easement. Floristic quality, beta diversity and cover of obligate wetland species increased in both conservation easements and in most vegetation types. These vegetation changes were likely due to restoration activities since annual rainfall was not significantly different pre- and post-restoration. Cattle grazing did not have a negative or positive effect on the success of restoration, nor did we detect any positive effect of grazing on the success of restoration. Overall, our study shows that hydrological restoration can enhance wetland hydroperiod, water depth and wetland vegetation, but more resources should be allocated to short- and long-term monitoring of the restoration success."

The Hurst exponents, calculated using a rescaled range analysis, demonstrate a significant differential response between healthy and PTSD samples which may lead to diagnostic applications. To overcome the non-stationarity of EEG data, we apply an appropriate window length wherein the EEG data displays stationary behavior. We then use the Hurst exponents for each channel as hypothesis test statistics to identify differences between PTSD cases and controls. Our study included a cohort of 12 subjects with half healthy controls. The Hurst exponent of the PTSD subjects is found to be significantly smaller than the healthy controls in channel F3. Our results indicate that F3 may be a useful channel for diagnostic applications of Hurst exponents in distinguishing PTSD and healthy subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2811272841,"Background and purpose There is growing evidence that visuospatial neglect (VSN) is associated with lower functional performance in other modalities and is not restricted to the lesioned hemisphere alone, and may also affect the non-lesioned hemisphere in severe first-ever strokes. We aimed to investigate the longitudinal association between the severity of VSN, as reflected by the extent of ipsilesional and contralesional spatial attention deficit, and clinical severity of stroke. Methods This is a secondary data analysis with merged data from two prospective cohort studies. Resulting in 90 patients and 8 longitudinal measurements at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, and 26 weeks post-stroke onset. A letter cancellation test (LCT) was used as the primary outcome measure to demonstrate presence and severity of VSN. The clinical severity of stroke was classified using the Bamford Classification. Results No significant association between clinical severity and the number of ipsilesional, as well as contralesional, omissions on the LCT was observed. Recovery of VSN at the contralesional hemiplegic, as well as ipsilesional non-hemiplegic side, was only dependent on ‘time’ as a reflection of spontaneous neurobiological recovery post-stroke. The recovery of the ipsilesional extension of VSN was significantly slower for the total anterior circulation infarct (TACI) group compared to the non-TACI group. Conclusions Larger strokes have a significant negative impact on recovery of visual attention at the non-hemiplegic side. No clinical determinants that regulate spontaneous time-dependent recovery of VSN were found. While early ‘stroke severity’ has been regarded as a strong predictor of functional outcome at a group level, other prognostic factors (demographic, stroke related) need to be determined.

The main objective of the work described here was to test the hypothesis that incorporation of heparin into a PCL carrier could serve as bio-compatible material capable of inhibiting Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The idea of firmly anchoring heparin to capture soluble virus, vs. a slow heparin release to inhibit a virus in solution was tested. Thus, one material was produced via conventional heparin matrix encapsulation and electrohydrodynamic fiber processing in one step. A second type of material was obtained via heparin crosslinking. This was achieved by running a carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling reaction on preformed PCL fibers. In vitro HPV16 L1 protein binding capacity studies were performed. Infectivity assays were done using HPV16 pseudoviruses (PsVs) carrying a GFP plasmid to directly test the ability of the fibrous mats to prevent internalization of HPV PsVs. The crosslinked heparin material presented a dissociation constant (Kd) value comparable to those found in the literature for different heparin-protein L1 peptide interactions. Both materials significantly reduced internalization of HPV PsVs, with a reduction of 94% of PsVs internalization when matrix encapsulated heparin-loaded material was present. Differences in performance between the two proposed structures are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2810497416,"The field of dermal fillers is evolving rapidly and numerous products are currently on the market. Biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) have been found to be compatible with several body tissues, and this makes them an ideal material for dermal filling purposes. Hollow PCL spheres were developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to serve both as an anchor point and a “tissue harbour” for cells. Particles were tested for cytotoxicity and cell adherence using mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF). MEFs adhered to the particles and no significant toxic effects were observed based on morphology, cell growth, cell viability and cell cycle analysis, suggesting that the particles are suitable candidates for cell delivery systems in an in vivo setting. The objective of providing a “tissue harbour” was however not realized, as cells did not preferentially migrate into the ported particles. In vivo studies were conducted in BALB/c mice into whom particles were introduced at the level of the hypodermis. Mice injected with PCL particles (ported and non-ported; with or without MEFs) showed evidence of local inflammation and increased adipogenesis at the site of injection, as well as a systemic inflammatory response. These effects were also observed in mice that received apparently inert (polystyrene) particles. Ported PCL particles can therefore act as a cell delivery system and through their ability to induce adipogenesis, may also serve as a dermal bulking agent."

Design Randomized, single-blind, dose-response, controlled, clinical study (Phase 1/2). Methods The patients in this trial were enrolled between January 2014 and December 2016. A total of 99 patients were randomly divided into 5 groups as follows: the Non-administration group received the conventional extraction; the Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) 100 mg control group received the PLGA matrix without lidocaine; the SRLS 100 mg group received a single sheet of SRLS 100 mg; the SRLS 200 mg group received double sheets of SRLS 100 mg; and the SRLS 400 mg administration group received four sheets of SRLS 100 mg. A study drug was inserted into the defect socket after the extraction, and postoperative pain intensity, satisfaction with postoperative pain relief, adverse events, and postoperative supplemental analgesic rescue use (time, dose) were investigated by patient self-report. Results In total, 94 (94.9%) patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in postoperative pain intensity, satisfaction with postoperative pain relief, and postoperative supplemental analgesic rescue use among the 5 groups. There were no serious side effects, including a plasma concentration increase of lidocaine, attributable to the SRLS. Conclusions Administration of the SRLS at 100 mg may have clinical therapeutic potential for pain relief following tooth extraction.

Methods A cost analysis was undertaken comparing the costs under the HiNH program and the current practice, in parallel with a pre-post controlled study design. The study was conducted in two Queensland public hospitals: the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (intervention hospital) and the Logan Hospital (control hospital). Main outcome measures were the associated incremental costs or savings concerning the HiNH program provision and the acute hospital care utilisation over one year after intervention. Results The initial deterministic analysis calculated the total induced mean costs associated with providing the HiNH program over one year as AU$488,116, and the total induced savings relating to acute hospital care service utilisation of AU$8,659,788. The total net costs to the health service providers were thus calculated at -AU$8,171,671 per annum. Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (based on 10,000 simulations) showed the mean and median annual net costs associated with the HiNH program implementation were -AU$8,444,512 and–AU$8,202,676, and a standard deviation of 2,955,346. There was 95% certainty that the values of net costs would fall within the range from -AU$15,018,055 to -AU$3,358,820. Conclusions The costs relating to implementing the HiNH program appear to be much less than the savings in terms of associated decreases in acute hospital service utilisation. The HiNH service model is likely to have the cost-saving potential while improving the emergency care provision for RACF residents."
https://openalex.org/W2811373718,"Bone substitutes are frequently used in clinical practice but often exhibit limited osteoinductivity. We hypothesized that unfocused shockwaves enhance the osteoinductivity of bone substitutes and improve osteointegration and angiogenesis. Three different bone substitutes, namely porous tricalcium phosphate, porous hydroxyapatite and porous titanium alloy, were implanted in a critical size (i.e. 6-mm) femoral defect in rats. The femora were treated twice with 1500 shockwaves at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery and compared with non-treated controls. The net volume of de novo bone in the defect was measured by microCT-scanning during 11-weeks follow-up. Bone ingrowth and angiogenesis in the bone substitutes was examined at 5 and 11 weeks using histology. It was shown that hydroxyapatite and titanium both had an increase of bone ingrowth with more bone in the shockwave group compared to the control group, whereas resorption was seen in tricalcium phosphate bone substitutes over time and this was insensitive to shockwave treatment. In conclusion, hydroxyapatite and titanium bone substitutes favour from shockwave treatment, whereas tricalcium phosphate does not. This study shows that osteoinduction and osteointegration of bone substitutes can be influenced with unfocused shockwave therapy, but among other factors depend on the type of bone substitute, likely reflecting its mechanical and biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W2809880448,"Recently, many autologous tumor antigens have been examined for their potential use in cancer immunotherapy. However, the success of cancer vaccines in clinical trials has been limited, partly because of the limitations of using single, short peptides in most attempts. With this in mind, we aimed to develop multivalent synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines containing multiple cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. However, to confirm whether a multivalent vaccine can induce an individual epitope-specific CTL, the only viable screening strategies currently available are interferon-gamma (IFN-μ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or expensive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-expressing mice. In this report, we evaluated the use of our developed murine-20S immunoproteasome (i20S) digestion assay, and found that it could predict the results of IFN-μ ELISPOT assays. Importantly, the murine-i20S digestion assay not only predicted CTL induction, but also antitumor activity in an HLA-expressing mouse model. We conclude that the murine-i20S digestion assay is an extremely useful tool for the development of “all functional” multivalent SLP vaccines."

This research set out to explore if differences in colours and contrasting colour designs used in mono and multi-coloured capsules result in different levels of attractiveness. This was performed using two study settings: a laboratory setting (out of context), and by comparison, a more ecologically valid setting, mimicking the real-world. Capsule attractiveness to toddlers was measured by visual attention (measured through eye tracking) and grasping choice (measured as frequency of grasping in a behavioural task). Results from the research in the out of context setting showed statistically significant differences in visual attention and grasping choice between colours and contrasting designs. In the visual attention study a preference for multi-coloured capsules was shown. In the grasping choice study, in addition to multi-coloured, mono-coloured white or purple capsules were also preferred. In the more ecologically valid setting, there were no statistically significant differences in the visual attention or grasping choice between any of the capsules. These results were consistent with each other and in line with market data reflecting poisoning incident rates, which show no change with colour or contrasting colour design. We suggest that the results from out of context studies might not be a reliable indicator of real world behaviour. Given the importance of toddler home safety, using a methodology that is aligned with market numbers is crucial to develop countermeasures."
https://openalex.org/W2811384674,"Growing evidence suggests that workload has an adverse effect on quality of care and patient safety in nursing homes. A novel job resource that may improve quality of care and patient safety and alleviate the negative effect of workload in nursing homes is team support for strengths use. This refers to team members' beliefs concerning the extent to which the team they work in actively supports them in applying their individual strengths at work. The objective was to investigate the relationships between workload, team support for strengths use, quality of care, and patient safety in nursing homes. We collected (cross-sectional) survey data from 497 caregivers from 74 teams in seven different nursing homes. The survey included measures on perceived workload, team support for strengths use, caregivers' perception of the quality of care provided by the team and four safety incidents (i.e. fall incidents, medication errors, pressure ulcers, incidents of aggression). After controlling for age, team size, team tenure, organizational tenure, and nursing home, multilevel regression analyses (i.e. individual and team level) showed that perceived workload was not significantly related to perceived team-based quality of care and the frequency of safety incidents. Team support for strengths use was positively related to perceived team-based quality of care, negatively related to medication errors, but not significantly related to fall incidents, pressure ulcers, and aggression incidents. Finally, we found that perceived workload had a negative effect on perceived team-based quality of care when team support for strengths use is low and no significant effect on perceived team-based quality of care when team support for strengths use is high. This study provides promising evidence for a novel avenue for promoting team-based quality of care in nursing homes."

It is, however, invasive and has several limitations. Here we tested a simple noninvasive language lateralization test performed with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methods We recorded auditory MEG responses to pairs of vowels and pure tones in 16 epilepsy surgery candidates who had undergone IAP. For each individual, we selected the pair of planar gradiometer sensors with the strongest N100m response to vowels in each hemisphere and—from the vector sum of signals of this gradiometer pair—calculated the vowel/tone amplitude ratio in the left (L) and right (R) hemisphere and, subsequently, the laterality index: LI = (L–R)/(L+R). In addition to the analysis using a single sensor pair, an alternative analysis was performed using averaged responses over 18 temporal sensor pairs in both hemispheres. Results The laterality index did not correlate significantly with the lateralization data obtained from the IAP. However, an MEG pattern of stronger responses to vowels than tones in the left hemisphere and stronger responses to tones than vowels in the right hemisphere was associated with left-hemispheric language dominance in the IAP in all the six patients who showed this pattern. This results in a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 67% of this MEG pattern in predicting left-hemispheric language dominance (p = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). In the analysis using averaged responses over temporal channels, one additional patient who was left-dominant in IAP showed this particular MEG pattern, increasing the sensitivity to 78% (p = 0.003). Significance This simple MEG paradigm shows promise in feasibly and noninvasively confirming left-hemispheric language dominance in epilepsy surgery candidates. It may aid in reducing the need for the IAP, if the results are confirmed in larger patient samples."

We then estimated the proportion of cesarean sections that could be prevented if the cardiometabolic risk factor in pregnant women were eliminated (the population-attributable risk [PAR]).In a single multivariable model, maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were independently associated with cesarean delivery: RR (95% CI) abnormal glucose screening 1.04 (1.01-1.08); gestational diabetes 1.18 (1.11-1.18) and pre-existing diabetes 1.60 (1.49-1.71); pre-existing hypertension 1.16 (1.10-1.23); overweight 1.27 (1.24-1.30); obese class I 1.46 (1.42-1.51); obese class II 1.73 (1.67-1.80); and obese class III 1.97 (1.88-2.07); adjusting for established risk factors, medical facility and year. The associations between maternal cardiometabolic risk factors and primary cesarean delivery remained among infants with appropriate weights for gestational age. The PARs were 17.4% for overweight/obesity, 7.0% for maternal hyperglycemia, 2.0% for pre-existing hypertension and 20.5% for any cardiometabolic risk factor.Maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were independently associated with risk of primary cesarean delivery, even among women delivering infants born at an appropriate size for gestational age. Effective strategies to increase the proportion of women entering pregnancy at an optimal weight with normal blood pressure and glucose before pregnancy could potentially eliminate up to 20% of cesarean deliveries."
https://openalex.org/W2811109059,"This study addresses the nonlinear structure-extended cavity interaction simulation using a new version of the multilevel residue harmonic balance method. This method has only been adopted once to solve a nonlinear beam problem. This is the first study to use this method to solve a nonlinear structural acoustic problem. This study has two focuses: 1) the new version of the multilevel residue harmonic balance method can generate the higher-level nonlinear solutions ignored in the previous version and 2) the effect of the extended cavity, which has not been considered in previous studies, is examined. The cavity length of a panel-cavity system is sometimes longer than the panel length. However, many studies have adopted a model in which the cavity length is equal to the panel length. The effects of excitation magnitude, cavity depth, damping and number of structural modes on sound and vibration responses are investigated for various panel cases. In the simulations, the present harmonic balance solutions agree reasonably well with those obtained from the classical harmonic balance method. There are two important findings. First, the nonlinearity of a structural acoustic system highly depends on the cavity size. If the cavity size is smaller, the nonlinearity is higher. A large cavity volume implies a low stiffness or small acoustic pressure transmitted from the source panel to the nonlinear panel. In other words, the additional volume in an extended cavity affects the nonlinearity, sound and vibration responses of a structural acoustic system. Second, if an acoustic resonance couples with a structural resonance, nonlinearity is amplified and thus the insertion loss is adversely affected."

Therefore, cloning host miRNA-recognition sequences into the genome of RNA viruses represents a rational strategy for manipulating viral replication. Here, we performed deep sequencing to obtain small-RNA (sRNA)-expression profiles from in vitro-cultured MARC-145 cells post infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and chose six candidate miRNAs of different abundance (miR-21, miR-140-3p, miR-185, miR-26a, miR-505, and miR-199a) for further study. Based on the full-length cDNA clone p7USC, we constructed a number of PRRSV mutants that provided complementary base-pairing target sites for the miRNAs in 3' untranslated regions. Our results showed that all low- and moderate- abundant miRNA-target mutants showed similar growth properties, whereas the highest-abundant miRNA-target mutant blocked both viral transcription and replication. Discontinuous mutations in high-abundant miRNA-target sites subsequently recovered viral viability and propagation. These results demonstrated the copy number of endogenous miRNAs and the extent of sRNA complementarity were key factors to silence potential mRNA expression/translation, thereby determining PRRSV viability. Interestingly, the mutant containing miR-140-target sites (v140-t) showed strong suppression of viral replication from P1 to P3 in vitro, as shown by virus titer, plaque morphology, and qRT-PCR assays. To assess genetic stability, sequencing of v140-t (P1, P3, P5 and P10) revealed spontaneous mutations preferentially located among several nucleotides near the 3' end of the insertion region and corresponding to the ""seed region"" of miR-140-3p, explaining the induced viral repression and the direction of virus evolution. This approach provided a general silencing strategy for limiting PRRSV replication by endogenous miRNAs in MARC-145 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2810373834,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that is known to cause changes in the extracellular matrix, including changes in hyaluronan (HA) deposition. However, little is known about the factors that modulate its deposition or the potential consequences. Asthmatics with high levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) are characterized by greater airway reactivity and greater evidence of airway inflammation. Based on these data and our previous work we hypothesized that excessive NO promotes the pathologic production of HA by airway smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Exposure of cultured SMCs to various NO donors results in the accumulation of HA in the form of unique, cable-like structures. HA accumulates rapidly after exposure to NO and can be seen as early as one hour after NO treatment. The cable-like HA in NO-treated SMC cultures supports the binding of leukocytes. In addition, NO produced by murine macrophages (RAW cells) and airway epithelial cells also induces SMCs to produce HA cables when grown in co-culture. The modulation of HA by NO appears to be independent of soluble guanylate cyclase. Taken together, NO-induced production of leukocyte-binding HA by SMCs provides a new potential mechanism for the non-resolving airway inflammation in asthma and suggests a key role of non-immune cells in driving the chronic inflammation of the submucosa. Modulation of NO, HA and the consequent immune cell interactions may serve as potential therapeutic targets in asthma."
