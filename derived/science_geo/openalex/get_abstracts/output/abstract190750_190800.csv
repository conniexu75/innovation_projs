https://openalex.org/W2020666761,"I HAVE already reported some of the results of my search for resistance to the potato root eelworm among the South American tuber-forming Solanum species in the Commonwealth Potato Collection1,2. This work, begun in 1941, is now practically complete, and more than 1,200 lines, belonging to more than sixty species, have been tested in duplicate on at least one occasion. Very few have been found to be resistant; one such line, Solanum ballsii, has certain disadvantages for breeding work as it is a diploid, whereas the domestic potato, S. tuberosum, is a tetraploid. In 1948, however, I was fortunate in finding a further five apparently resistant lines (C.P.S. numbers, 1673, 1685, 1692, 1595 and 1647), four of which belong to S. tuberosum sub-species andigenum, a group of tetraploids very close to the domestic potato and readily crossed with it; the other (1647) is a sterile triploid. Tests in later years have confirmed the early promise of these lines."

https://openalex.org/W2072131024,"AT the John Innes Horticultural Institution we have recently raised hybrids between pears and apples; they were obtained in the following way. The occurrence of apomixis in the Pomoideæ1, and the high frequency of diploid seedlings, 23 out of 39, in a family of pears we raised from crossing the diploid variety Fertility with the triploid variety Beurre Diel, suggested that they may have been apomictically, or in part apomictically, reproduced. To test this possibility one of us (E. M.) isolated a tree of Fertility, emasculated sixteen flowers and brushed the ovaries over with a 40 p.p.m. solution of β-naphthoxy-acetic acid. Four flowers were pollinated with the pollen of an unnamed tetraploid variety of apple and twelve with the pollen of the diploid apple Crawley Beauty. Twenty-four hours later the ovaries were again treated with β-naphthoxy-acetic acid. Three fruits developed from pollination with the tetraploid apple and twelve from pollination with the diploid. Seed content and germination are shown in the following table."

Since Strohl reviewed the excretory mechanism in the Mollusca, work on a few European marine, freshwater and terrestrial gastropods has been extended1–4. Since no data are available for an amphibious snail and no parallel record for an Indian form, so far as we know, a study was undertaken on the common Indian apple-snail Pila globosa (Swainson). This particular form, besides being amphibious, develops through a cleidoic egg. The most active period of this snail's life is during the rainy season, when it lives in fresh water and feeds and also breeds on the banks. With the approach of the winter it becomes less active and burrows in the mud to æstivate for the rest of the year until the onset of the next rainy season."

https://openalex.org/W1998138348,"THE nutrient requirements of the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria are simple, but among the elements which seem to be essential for them are phosphorus and magnesium. Bomeke1 reported that Nitrobacter would not grow in media from which either phosphate or magnesium was omitted; and Nitrosomonas would not grow in medium with magnesium omitted. Wimmer2 found that phosphate was necessary for the growth of both organisms, but the minimum requirement was only 0.02 mgm. phosphorus per litre for both Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas."
https://openalex.org/W2024349308,"SINCE the geometrical problem of protein structure is mainly that of the configuration of the polypeptide chains, the geometry of the peptide link itself is a matter of prime importance. However, very few crystal-structure data have yet been published from which precise dimensions of the peptide link may be derived. We have recently carried out a three-dimensional X-ray analysis of the structure of glycyl-L-asparagine which provides an additional source of these data. Our analysis also provides information concerning the molecular configuration of asparagine, an amino-acid the structure of which has recently been discussed in Nature by Steward and Thompson1."

https://openalex.org/W2036203118,"THE number of chromosomes of the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis L.) is a controversial issue (the names Bubalus bubalus L. and B. buffelus L. are synonyms of B. bubalis L.). Pchakadze1 stated that it is 2n = 56. Makino2, on the contrary, reported the diploid number of chromosomes to be 48. In view of this disagreement, it was considered worth while to study the number of the Indian water buffalo."

The experiments were carried out on pea tissue, and the degree of curvature of split pea cotyledons measured in accordance with the standard Went pea curvature test3."

https://openalex.org/W2032967096,"BRANCHING characteristics of the vast majority of plants are not a desirable character in a fibre crop like jute. Some foreign varieties of Corchorus capsularis like Halmahera, Jap Red and Jap G, unlike the Indian varieties, do not usually branch, as the axillary buds are normally absent in the axils of the leaves. These varieties supply the gene for non-branching character to be incorporated in the high-yielding Indian varieties. Though the anatomy of normal jute plant has been investigated in detail by Kundu1,2, the organization of the shoot apex in the non-branching plants requires study, to find whether the absence of axillary buds is merely due to dormancy or complete absence of bud meristem in the axils of leaves. Such a study will doubtless help in rigid selection for non-branching varieties. A comparative developmental anatomy of four varieties of Corchorus capsularis, D154 (a branching variety), Halmahera, Jap Red and Jap G (non-branching varieties), was taken up in order to get precise information about the nature of non-branching character."

https://openalex.org/W2008845779,"ISOLATED cambium – phloem strips from Bryophyllum calycinum Salisb. show a curvature with the cambium at the concave surface, and this curvature is increased when the strips are placed in water. Plasmolysis causes the complete relaxation of the strip. Partial relaxation can be obtained in solutions of indolylacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in concentrations of 1–50 parts per million, the action of indolylacetic acid being in some cases reversible. It can be shown that the average width of the cambium cells decreases immediately after placing the strip in the hormone solution. The reaction is strongly influenced by temperature; it occurs between 15° and 30° C., with an optimum near 30° C. At 29° C. a maximal curvature of the strip (or shrinkage of the cambium cells) is obtained within five minutes. In indolylacetic acid, 1–20 p.p.m., a reversal of this shrinkage occurs which may lead to an increase beyond the original size of the cell; this might properly be considered as growth. At 29° C. the reversal appears twenty minutes after the beginning of the experiment."

https://openalex.org/W2987766676,"IN Nature of September 27, p. 547, Dr. L. G. E. Bell asks for the source of Edmond About's information on the technique of the preservation of tissues described in 1862 in About's scientific novel “L'homme à l'oreille cassée”. The material that I am actually collecting for the purpose of writing the history, which covers nearly a century, of the Marine Laboratory at Concarneau, enables me, I believe, to reply."
