https://openalex.org/W2147126871,"Many aspects of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle have not been reproduced in cell culture, which has slowed research progress on this important human pathogen. Here, we describe a full-length HCV genome that replicates and produces virus particles that are infectious in cell culture (HCVcc). Replication of HCVcc was robust, producing nearly 10 5 infectious units per milliliter within 48 hours. Virus particles were filterable and neutralized with a monoclonal antibody against the viral glycoprotein E2. Viral entry was dependent on cellular expression of a putative HCV receptor, CD81. HCVcc replication was inhibited by interferon-α and by several HCV-specific antiviral compounds, suggesting that this in vitro system will aid in the search for improved antivirals."
https://openalex.org/W2038164948,"We have fabricated nanometer-scale gold dipole antennas designed to be resonant at optical frequencies. On resonance, strong field enhancement in the antenna feed gap leads to white-light supercontinuum generation. The antenna length at resonance is considerably shorter than one-half the wavelength of the incident light. This is in contradiction to classical antenna theory but in qualitative accordance with computer simulations that take into account the finite metallic conductivity at optical frequencies. Because optical antennas link propagating radiation and confined/enhanced optical fields, they should find applications in optical characterization, manipulation of nanostructures, and optical information processing."

These inferences were specific to competence and occurred within a 1-second exposure to the faces of the candidates. The findings suggest that rapid, unreflective trait inferences can contribute to voting choices, which are widely assumed to be based primarily on rational and deliberative considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2098876115,"Removal of top predators from ecosystems can result in cascading effects through the trophic levels below, completely restructuring the food web. Cascades have been observed in small-scale or simple food webs, but not in large, complex, open-ocean ecosystems. Using data spanning many decades from a once cod-dominated northwest Atlantic ecosystem, we demonstrate a trophic cascade in a large marine ecosystem. Several cod stocks in other geographic areas have also collapsed without recovery, suggesting the existence of trophic cascades in these systems."
https://openalex.org/W2130957548,"The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) has been attributed to the rapid release of ∼2000 × 10 9 metric tons of carbon in the form of methane. In theory, oxidation and ocean absorption of this carbon should have lowered deep-sea pH, thereby triggering a rapid (&lt;10,000-year) shoaling of the calcite compensation depth (CCD), followed by gradual recovery. Here we present geochemical data from five new South Atlantic deep-sea sections that constrain the timing and extent of massive sea-floor carbonate dissolution coincident with the PETM. The sections, from between 2.7 and 4.8 kilometers water depth, are marked by a prominent clay layer, the character of which indicates that the CCD shoaled rapidly (&lt;10,000 years) by more than 2 kilometers and recovered gradually (&gt;100,000 years). These findings indicate that a large mass of carbon (»2000 × 10 9 metric tons of carbon) dissolved in the ocean at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and that permanent sequestration of this carbon occurred through silicate weathering feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2057835358,"Chemically cross-linked polymers are inherently limited by stresses that are introduced by post-gelation volume changes during polymerization. It is also difficult to change a cross-linked polymer's shape without a corresponding loss of material properties or substantial stress development. We demonstrate a cross-linked polymer that, upon exposure to light, exhibits stress and/or strain relaxation without any concomitant change in material properties. This result is achieved by introducing radicals via photocleavage of residual photoinitiator in the polymer matrix, which then diffuse via addition-fragmentation chain transfer of midchain functional groups. These processes lead to photoinduced plasticity, actuation, and equilibrium shape changes without residual stress. Such polymeric materials are critical to the development of microdevices, biomaterials, and polymeric coatings."
https://openalex.org/W1977278056,"Repetitive microsatellites mutate at relatively high rates and may contribute to the rapid evolution of species-typical traits. We show that individual alleles of a repetitive polymorphic microsatellite in the 5′ region of the prairie vole vasopressin 1a receptor ( avpr1a ) gene modify gene expression in vitro. In vivo, we observe that this regulatory polymorphism predicts both individual differences in receptor distribution patterns and socio-behavioral traits. These data suggest that individual differences in gene expression patterns may be conferred via polymorphic microsatellites in the cis-regulatory regions of genes and may contribute to normal variation in behavioral traits."
https://openalex.org/W2128830532,"The skin and its major appendages are prominent target organs and potent sources of key players along the classical hypothalamic-pituitary axis, such as corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and even express key steroidogenic enzymes. Therefore, it may have established local stress response systems that resemble the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, functional evidence that this is indeed the case in normal human skin in situ has still been missing. We show that microdissected, organ-cultured human scalp hair follicles respond to CRH stimulation by up-regulating proopiomelanocortin (POMC) transcription and immunoreactivity (IR) for ACTH and alpha-MSH, which must have been processed from POMC. CRH, alpha-MSH, and ACTH also modulate expression of their cognate receptors (CRH-R1, MC1-R, MC2-R). In addition, the strongest stimulus for adrenal cortisol production, ACTH, also up-regulates cortisol-IR in the hair follicles. Isolated human hair follicles secrete substantial levels of cortisol into the culture medium, and this activity is further up-regulated by CRH. CRH also modulates important functional hair growth parameters in vitro (hair shaft elongation, catagen induction, hair keratinocyte proliferation, melanin production). Finally, human hair follicles display HPA axis-like regulatory feedback systems, since the glucocorticoid receptor agonist hydrocortisone down-regulates follicular CRH expression. Thus, even in the absence of endocrine, neural, or vascular systemic connections, normal human scalp hair follicles directly respond to CRH stimulation in a strikingly similar manner to what is seen in the classical HPA axis, including synthesis and secretion of cortisol and activation of prototypic neuroendocrine feedback loops."
https://openalex.org/W2121690059,"In animal societies, chemical communication plays an important role in conflict and cooperation. For ants, cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) blends produced by non-nestmates elicit overt aggression. We describe a sensory sensillum on the antennae of the carpenter ant Camponotus japonicus that functions in nestmate discrimination. This sensillum is multiporous and responds only to non-nestmate CHC blends. This suggests a role for a peripheral recognition mechanism in detecting colony-specific chemical signals."
https://openalex.org/W2156746279,"Biological control of malaria mosquitoes in Africa has rarely been used in vector control programs. Recent developments in this field show that certain fungi are virulent to adult Anopheles mosquitoes. Practical delivery of an entomopathogenic fungus that infected and killed adult Anopheles gambiae, Africa's main malaria vector, was achieved in rural African village houses. An entomological inoculation rate model suggests that implementation of this vector control method, even at the observed moderate coverage during a field study in Tanzania, would significantly reduce malaria transmission intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2076903823,"Using a rodent malaria model, we found that exposure to surfaces treated with fungal entomopathogens following an infectious blood meal reduced the number of mosquitoes able to transmit malaria by a factor of about 80. Fungal infection, achieved through contact with both solid surfaces and netting for durations well within the typical post-feed resting periods, was sufficient to cause &gt;90% mortality. Daily mortality rates escalated dramatically around the time of sporozoite maturation, and infected mosquitoes showed reduced propensity to blood feed. Residual sprays of fungal biopesticides might replace or supplement chemical insecticides for malaria control, particularly in areas of high insecticide resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2142327930,"The geothermal heat flux is an important factor in the dynamics of ice sheets; it affects the occurrence of subglacial lakes, the onset of ice streams, and mass losses from the ice sheet base. Because direct heat flux measurements in ice-covered regions are difficult to obtain, we developed a method that uses satellite magnetic data to estimate the heat flux underneath the Antarctic ice sheet. We found that the heat flux underneath the ice sheet varies from 40 to 185 megawatts per square meter and that areas of high heat flux coincide with known current volcanism and some areas known to have ice streams."
https://openalex.org/W1992506108,"In Schizosaccharomyces pombe , the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery converts pericentromeric transcripts into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and is required for the assembly of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Here we describe a mutation in the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Both wild-type and mutant RNAPII localized to the pericentromere. However, the mutation resulted in the loss of heterochromatic histone modifications and in the accumulation of pericentromeric transcripts, accompanied by the loss of siRNAs. This phenotype resembles mutants in RNAi and suggests that RNAPII couples pericentromeric transcription with siRNA processing and heterochromatin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2015871383,"In response to the 26 December 2004 tsunami, a survey team of scientists was dispatched to Sri Lanka. Measurements made by the team show that the tsunami elevation and runup ranged from 5 to 12 meters. Eyewitnesses report that up to three separate waves attacked the coast, with the second or third generally the largest. Our conclusion stresses the importance of education: Residents with a basic knowledge of tsunamis, as well as an understanding of how environmental modifications will affect overland flow, are paramount to saving lives and minimizing tsunami destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2164327707,"Dopamine (DA) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-SN) are two key molecules associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). We have identified a novel action of DA in the initial phase of alpha-SN aggregation and demonstrate that DA induces alpha-SN to form soluble, SDS-resistant oligomers. The DA:alpha-SN oligomeric species are not amyloidogenic as they do not react with thioflavin T and lack the typical amyloid fibril structures as visualized with electron microscopy. Circular dichroism studies indicate that in the presence of lipid membranes DA interacts with alpha-SN, causing an alteration to the structure of the protein. Furthermore, DA inhibited the formation of iron-induced alpha-SN amyloidogenic aggregates, suggesting that DA acts as a dominant modulator of alpha-SN aggregation. These observations support the paradigm emerging for other neurodegenerative diseases that the toxic species is represented by a soluble oligomer and not the insoluble fibril."
https://openalex.org/W2099231263,"A key adaptation enabling the fetus to survive in a limited energy environment may be the reprogramming of mitochondrial function, which can have deleterious effects. Critical questions are whether mitochondrial dysfunction progressively declines after birth, and if so, what mechanism might underlie this process. To address this, we developed a model of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in the rat that leads to diabetes in adulthood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress gradually increased in IUGR islets. ATP production was impaired and continued to deteriorate with age. The activities of complex I and III of the electron transport chain progressively declined in IUGR islets. Mitochondrial DNA point mutations accumulated with age and were associated with decreased mitochondrial DNA content and reduced expression of mitochondria-encoded genes in IUGR islets. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulted in impaired insulin secretion. These results demonstrate that IUGR induces mitochondrial dysfunction in the fetal β-cell, leading to increased production of ROS, which in turn damage mitochondrial DNA. A self-reinforcing cycle of progressive deterioration in mitochondrial function leads to a corresponding decline in β-cell function. Finally, a threshold in mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production is reached, and diabetes ensues.

Uteroplacental insufficiency, the most common cause of in utero growth retardation, limits the supply of critical substrates such as oxygen, glucose, and amino acids to the fetus and results in poor fetal growth (13.Ogata E.S.

However, these alterations in mitochondrial function can have deleterious effects, especially in cells that have a high energy requirement, such as the β-cell.

A critical question is whether mitochondrial dysfunction that is induced by an abnormal intrauterine milieu in fetal cells is permanently interrupted, and if so, what mechanism(s) might underlie this process. Using this model, we have tested the hypothesis that uteroplacental insufficiency disrupts the function of the electron transport chain in the fetal β-cell and leads to a debilitating cascade of events: increased production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn damage mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and cause further production of ROS. The net result is progressive loss of β-cell function and eventual development of type 2 diabetes in the adult. We have described our surgical methods previously (13.Ogata E.S. Bussey M. Finley S.

In brief, time-dated Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats were individually housed under standard conditions and allowed free access to standard rat chow and water. On day 18 of gestation (term is 22 days), the maternal rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal xylazine (8 mg/kg) and ketamine (40 mg/kg), and both uterine arteries were ligated (IUGR). This results in an approximately 50% reduction in uteroplacental blood flow. Rats recovered within a few hours and had ad lib access to food and water. The pregnant rats were allowed to deliver spontaneously, and the litter size was randomly reduced to 8 at birth to assure uniformity of litter size between IUGR and control litters. The pups were fostered to unoperated normal female rats and remained with their foster mothers until they were weaned. Unless otherwise noted, all studies were carried out in day 21 fetuses and animals at 1, 7, and 15 weeks of age to evaluate the evolution of the disease process prior to the onset of diabetes. Only male animals were studied to avoid the potentially confounding hormonal variables associated with female rats. Blood glucose concentrations were determined in duplicate using the HemoCue blood glucose analyzer (Angelholm, Sweden). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured in duplicate by radioimmunoassays using rat insulin as the standard (Linco, St. Louis, MO). The within- and between-assay coefficients of variation for the insulin assay were 4 and 10%, respectively. Insulin secretion was measured by standard static incubation methods used at the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes Center and by other laboratories (43.Gauthier B.R. Brun T. Sarret E.J. Ishihara H.

Islets were cultured for 3 days in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 11 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). 100 islets were subjected to static incubation experiments under the following conditions: 3.3 mmol/liter glucose, 16.7 mmol/liter glucose, or 20 mmol/liter leucine. Briefly, islets were incubated in a shaking water bath for 60 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 129 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mmol/liter HEPES at pH 7.4, 5 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm glucose. Islets were then incubated for 120 min in the presence of glucose or leucine plus glucose. Insulin was measured in the incubation medium at 20, 40, 60, and 120 min, and the results were expressed in microunits/ng of DNA and normalized for β-cell mass. β-Cell mass was determined using point-counting morphometry as previously described (19.Stoffers D.A. Desai B.M. Ng D.D. Simmons R.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Insulin concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as a standard. Total cellular ATP was determined in fetal islets immediately after isolation and in postnatal islets after 3 days of culture by chemiluminescence using a reagent based on firefly luciferase. Islets were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer without glucose for 60 min prior to ATP measurement. ATP production was then monitored at 37 °C in the presence of ADP, inorganic phosphate, and glucose (3.3 and 16.7 mmol/liter) or leucine (20 mmol/liter). ATP production was calculated per μg of protein in the islet homogenate. ROS production in islet cells was measured using dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) fluorescence. The non-fluorescent dye generates a fluorescence signal after reacting with ROS. ROS were measured in fetal islets immediately after isolation and in postnatal islets cultured for 48 h under standard conditions as described above. Postnatal islets were then cultured for an additional 24 h in either 5.5 mol/liter or 16.7 mmol/liter glucose. Islets were then loaded with 100 μm dichlorofluorescin diacetate for 3 h at 37 °C. This long incubation period allows for the diffusion of the oxidized dye into the culture medium. Islets were dispersed into a cell suspension to determine complete diffusion out of islet cells into the culture medium. Fluorescence was determined in the culture medium using a fluorescence plate reader with excitation wavelength at 505 nm and emission wavelength at 540 nm. Data are expressed per μg of islet protein. Complex I—Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) was assayed in flash frozen islets using the synthetic, short-chain ubiquinone analog Q as the electron acceptor. The suspension was diluted to a protein concentration of ∼2 mg/ml in 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm inorganic phosphate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), and 1 mm ADP, pH 7.4 buffer. Enzyme activity was assayed at several protein concentrations ranging from 40 to 120 μg/ml. The assay was repeated at several protein concentrations, and a protein concentration in the range in which activity was linear with respect to protein concentration was used. Assay buffer contained potassium phosphate, K+EDTA, KCN, and NADH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Q1 solution (in ethanol). Oxidation of NADH was followed at 340 nm for 3 min. Using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm-1, the rate was determined electronically. The assay was repeated in the presence of rotenone. Complex I activity was then calculated as the difference between the total rate and the rate in the presence of rotenone. Complex II—Complex II (succinic dehydrogenase) activity was assayed using Q1 as an intermediate electron acceptor and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as a final electron acceptor. The assay buffer contained potassium phosphate, KCN, MgCl2, rotenone, and antimycin. The enzyme was activated in the presence of succinate. After activation, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol was added. After a short period of temperature reequilibration, Q1 was added to initiate the reaction. Reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol was followed. After a linear rate was observed, malonate (a specific complex II inhibitor) was added, and a second rate was recorded. Complex II activity was calculated as the difference between the total rate and the malonate-inhibited rate. Complex III—Complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) activity was assayed using the short-chain Q analog, Q2 as the electron donor, because it gives a lower nonenzymatic (background) rate than Q1. A fully reduced solution of Q2 was prepared (Q2, 80% absolute ethanol, HCl, sodium borohydride). Cyclohexane was then added. The solution was extracted, phases were broken by centrifugation, supernatant was transferred, and extracts were pooled. The solution was stored at -20 °C until use. Prior to assay, a sodium cholate solution was added to mitochondrial protein and stored frozen overnight. After thawing, an aliquot of the suspension was assayed with cytochrome c with buffer (potassium phosphate, KCN, and rotenone). The reaction was started by adding Q2H2, and reduction of cytochrome c was followed at 550 nm. The cytochrome c was then fully reduced by adding dithionite, and the absorbance of the fully reduced solution was then determined. Since Q2H2 can directly reduce cytochrome c nonenzymatically, a background (nonenzymatic) rate was determined by carrying out the above assay without the addition of mitochondrial protein. Both rates were calculated as first order rate constants, and the true enzymatic rate was determined by subtracting the rate without mitochondrial protein (nonenzymatic background) from the rate with mitochondrial protein. Complex IV—To assay complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity, a solution of reduced cytochrome c was prepared. An excess of ascorbic acid was added to the solution and allowed to fully reduce. A Sephadex G50 column was equilibrated with assay buffer, and the reduced cytochrome c solution was pipetted onto the column. Fractions of eluted cytochrome c were collected. Prior to assay, the reduced cytochrome c solution was checked to make sure that it has remained reduced by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm, adding dithionite, and rechecking the absorbance. Mitochondrial protein was added to the reduced cytochrome c solution and the rate recurred. A fully oxidized absorbance value was obtained by adding ferricyanide to the cuvette. Activity was calculated as a first-order constant. Islet protein was subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE using 12% Tris-glycine gels. Proteins were electroblotted from the gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with either an MnSOD antibody (StressGen, Victoria, Canada) or trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) antibody (generously donated by Dr. Koji Uchida, Nagoya University, Japan), followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Enzyme-catalyzed chemiluminescence (ECL) mediated by horseradish peroxidase was developed with the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences and detected with Super RX x-ray film from Fuji Medical Systems (Stamford, CT). Single-strand Conformation of Polymorphism (SSCP) Analysis—Total DNA was prepared from frozen islets of 15-week IUGR and control animals. To screen for mtDNA mutations, PCR restriction fragment SSCP was carried out. This method is based on the differential electrophoretic mobility of single-stranded DNA under nondenaturing conditions (45.Kim Y.L. Brown M.C. Wallace D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46.Barros F. Lareu M.V. Salas A. Carracedo A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For this study, the region encoding ATPase 6 was chosen for SSCP analysis, since there is less sequence divergence in this region (47.Hilsdorf A.W. Krieger J.E. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1999; 32: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 48.Lane R.H. Flozak A.S. Simmons R.A. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1996; 59: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DNA from islets of five IUGRs and five controls at 15 weeks of age was PCR-amplified using primers to ATPase 6. Amplifications were performed on 100 ng of template DNA. PCR conditions were as follows: cycle 1, 5 min at 92 °C, 1 min at 55 °C (or the calculated Tm, 5 °C for the respective oligomer pair), 2 min at 72 °C; cycles 2-30, 1 min at 92 °C, 1 min at the calculated annealing temperature, 2 min at 72 °C. PCR products were digested by SacI or AccI at 37 °C for 60 min. Electrophoresis was carried out using 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. 3.5-μl aliquots from 25-μl PCRs were mixed with 5.5 μl of formamide and then denatured for 5 min (95 °C) and placed on ice and located into the preformed slots. The electrophoretic separation was carried out on a horizontal electrophoresis apparatus in room temperature. Autoradiography was carried out with an intensifying screen using Kodak X-Omat film for 17 h. Sequencing—To determine whether IUGR induced specific mutations or deletions, sequence analysis was carried out. Total DNA was prepared from islets of IUGR and control fetuses, 1-week, 7-week, and 15-week-old animals, and their respective mothers. PCR was used to amplify the region of the mtDNA genome encoding ATPase subunit 6. Three sets of primers were used (set 1, 7681-8027; set 2, 7965-8347; set 3, 8278-8641). To control for PCR artifacts, amplification was repetitively done on each DNA sample, and the sequences from at least two separate amplifications that matched were used for analysis. Sequencing reactions (20 μl) contained 0.1-0.5 μg of template, 100 pmol of primer, and either 4 or 8 μl of the Big-Dye Terminator Ready Reaction Mix (ABI). Reaction conditions were 96 °C for 1 min and then 25 cycles of 96 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 10 s, and 60 °C for 4 min. Reaction products were ethanol-precipitated according to instructions supplied by ABI and then analyzed on an ABI DNA sequencer. Sequences were compared with the sequences of each animal's corresponding mother's mtDNA sequence. Sequences were also compared with sequences in the mitochondrial DNA sequence data base. mtDNA Content—To determine the amount of nuclear DNA relative to mtDNA, we used quantitative real time PCR. The TaqMan 7900HT sequence detection system was used to perform real time PCR amplification for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the mtDNA region, ATPase 6. TaqMan probes were labeled with 5′ 6-carboxyfluorescein (fluorescent reporter) and 3′ 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (fluorescence quencher). PCR amplifications were carried out in buffer containing 16.6 mm ammonium sulfate, 67 mm Tris base, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Me2SO, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 600 nm each of forward and reverse primers, 200 nm TaqMan probe, 0.6 units of Platinum Taq polymerase, and 2% Rox reference dye. The real time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate. mtDNA/nuclear DNA ratios were calculated by dividing the mtDNA signal for ATPase 6 by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal and expressing the ratio as a percentage of controls set at 100%. Total RNA was extracted from islets using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc.). Real time PCR, using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a standard, was used to determine levels of mRNA. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance and Student's unpaired t test. Each independent measurement for fetuses was derived from pooled islets of three litters from IUGR and two litters of control rats. Each independent measurement for 1-week-old pups were derived from pooled islets of 1-2 litters from IUGR and 1 litter of control rats. All data were normalized to the ratio of non-β-cell mass to β-cell. These studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. As previously reported (16.Simmons R.A. Templeton L.J. Gertz S.A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), birth weights of IUGR animals were significantly less than controls (5.33 ± 0.24 versus 7.19 ± 0.25 g, SGA (n = 85) versus control (n = 101), respectively; p < 0.05). By 7 weeks of age, IUGR and control rats had similar weights (Table I). At 1 week of age, glucose and insulin levels were similar in the two groups. Glucose levels remained normal at 7 weeks in IUGR animals; however, fasting insulin levels were modestly elevated compared with controls (Table I). At 15 weeks of age, fasting glucose levels were moderately increased, and insulin levels remained elevated in IUGRs compared with controls (Table I). β-Cell mass in IUGR rats was mildly decreased compared with controls at 7 weeks of age (7.6 ± 1.8 versus 9.5 ± 1.7 mg, IUGR versus control respectively, p < 0.05). By 15 weeks of age, β-cell mass was markedly reduced in IUGR animals (6.0 ± 2.8 versus 12.7 ± 1.8 mg of IUGR versus control, respectively, p < 0.05). The proportion of non-β-cells in the islet increased with age in IUGR animals and was about 50% of total islet cells at 15 weeks (compared with 36% for controls, p < 0.05).Table IWeights, plasma glucose, and insulin levels in IUGR and control animalsAgeWeight (grams)GlucoseIRIControlIUGRControl (n = 40)IUGR (n = 38"

In addition, a reciprocal mechanism of transactivation is important in cell movement toward growth factors, like PDGF, or toward antigen (20Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A.

According to this paradigm, activation of PDGFR or cross-linking of the high affinity IgE receptor FcϵRI stimulates and translocates SphK1 to the plasma membrane, resulting in spatially restricted formation of S1P. S1P, in turn, activates S1P1, a critical event for directed cell movement toward PDGF or antigen (20Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S.

However, it is still not known whether endogenous SphK2 has redundant, overlapping, or antagonistic functions to SphK1 in cell motility.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against unique SphK1 and SphK2 peptide sequences (EPPPSWKPQQMPPPEEPL and QALHIQRLRPKPEARPR, respectively, Biosynthesis, Lewisville, TX). Antiserum was purified on a protein A column followed by affinity purification on a Sulfolink gel conjugated with the antigenic peptide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Catalytically Inactive SphK1 and SphK2—Expression vectors for human SphK1 and SphK2 were described previously (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to prepare catalytically inactive SphK1 (G82D mutation) as described (27Toman R.E. Payne S.G. Watterson K. Maceyka M. Lee N.H. Milstien S. Bigbee J.W. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and catalytically inactive SphK2 (G213E mutation primers: forward, 5′-GTGTCTGGAGACGAGCTGCTTTACGAGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCTCGTAAAGCAGCTCGTCTCCAGACAC-3′). All sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293, ATCC CRL-1573) and human MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells (ATCC HB-8506) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) and cultured overnight. Transfection efficiencies were typically about 90%. SphK1 and SphK2 expression were down-regulated with sequence-specific siRNAs. siRNA for human SphK1 (GGGCAAGGCCUUGCAGCUCdTT and GAGCUGCAAGGCCUUGCCCdTT) and control siRNA were from Qiagen. Cells were transfected with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). SphK2 expression was also down-regulated with sequence-specific pSilencer-siSphK2 (Ambion). Complementary oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-GATCCCGCTGGGCTGTCCTTCAACCTTCAAGAGAGGTTGAAGGACAGCCCAGCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGCTGGGCTGTCCTTCAACCTCTCTTGAAGGTTGAAGGACAGCCCAGCGG-3′) were annealed and ligated into the pSilencer vector according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). Cells were transfected with pSilencer vector or pSilencer-siSphK2 using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). In some experiments, SphK2 expression was also down-regulated by transfection with siRNA from Ambion (sense, 5′-GGAUUGCGCUCGUCGCUUUCAU-3′; antisense, 5′-AUGAAAGCGAGCGCAAUCCTG-3′). Sphingosine Kinase Activity—Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in SphK buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 20% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine). Lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and then at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain cytosol and membrane fractions. SphK1 activity was determined in the presence of 50 μm sphingosine and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi, 1 mm) containing MgCl2 (10 mm) in 0.25% Triton X-100, which inhibits SphK2, as described previously (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). SphK2 activity was determined with sphingosine added as a complex with 4 mg/ml BSA and [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 1 m KCl, conditions in which SphK2 activity is optimal and SphK1 strongly inhibited (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Labeled S1P was extracted and separated by TLC on silica gel G60 with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (10:4:3:2:1, v/v) as solvent. Radioactive bands corresponding to S1P were quantified with a FX Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). SphK specific activity is expressed as picomoles of S1P formed per min per mg protein. It should be noted that SphK activity determined in the presence of 1 m KCl or in 0.25% Triton X-100 is only an operational differentiation method developed with overexpressed SphK1 and SphK2 (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). When using these protocols to determine the endogenous isoenzymes, it is not possible to unequivocally rule out a small amount of cross-contamination. Thus, these differential SphK assays should not be used alone as an index of relative isoenzyme levels but taken together with Western blot data and quantitative PCR measurements of mRNA levels. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transblotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SphK1 and SphK2 (1:1000), stripped, and re-probed with anti-calnexin, anti-tubulin, anti-PDI, or anti-EGFR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as loading controls. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). For real-time PCR, pre-mixed primer-probe sets were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and cDNA-amplified with ABI 7900HT. Measurement of Intracellular S1P Levels—HEK 293 cells (8 × 106) were transfected with vector or SphK2 in poly-d-lysine-coated 10-cm plates. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated without or with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of methanol containing 2.5 μl of concentrated HCl. S1P was isolated and measured as previously described (28Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were suspended in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 m sucrose. Subcellular fractionation was performed by sequential centrifugation, essentially as described (29Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized at 4 °C with a Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The postnuclear supernatants were further centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in the same buffer. The 5,000 × g supernatants were centrifuged for 15 min at 17,000 × g, and the P2 pellets (intracellular membrane fraction containing endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) were re-suspended in the same buffer. The remaining supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosol (S) and pelleted plasma membrane fractions (PM). Cell Migration Assays—Chemotaxis was measured in a modified Boyden chamber using polycarbonate filters (25 × 80 mm, 12-μm pore size) coated with collagen type I (50 μg/ml in 5% acetic acid) for HEK 293 cells and collagen type IV (10 μg/ml) for MDA-MB-453 cells (30Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Edsall L. Nava V.E. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6185-6191PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, chemoattractants were added to the lower chambers, and cells (5 × 104 per well) were added to the upper chambers. At the indicated times, nonmigratory cells on the upper membrane surfaces were mechanically removed and the cells that traversed and spread on the lower surfaces of the filters were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik. Migratory cells were counted using a microscope with a 10× objective. Statistical Analysis—Experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. For each experiment, data from triplicate samples were calculated and expressed as means ± S.D. Statistics were performed using SigmaStat statistical software version 2.0. EGF Activates SphK2—EGF contributes to the progression, invasion, and maintenance of the malignant phenotype in human breast cancers. Recently, it was suggested that intracellular metabolism of S1P may play an important role in EGF-directed cell migration (31Le Stunff H. Mikami A. Giussani P. Hobson J.P. Jolly P.S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34290-34297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because SphK1 and SphK2 are key enzymes in regulating S1P levels, it was important to determine their roles in motility of cells toward EGF. Although various growth factors, including PDGF, EGF, and VEGF, stimulate SphK1 and increase S1P levels (reviewed in Ref. 1Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar), their effects on SphK2 have not yet been investigated. To first determine whether SphK2 can be activated by EGF, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with SphK2. These cells had significantly increased SphK2 activity compared with vector transfectants, and thus the ectopically expressed SphK2 contributed most of the measured activity in the cytosol and membrane fractions. Treatment with EGF markedly stimulated membrane-associated SphK2 (Fig. 1A). Because previous studies suggest that growth factors induce translocation of SphK1 to the plasma membrane (5Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), we next examined whether EGF also induced changes in the distribution of ectopically expressed SphK2. However, localization of SphK2 was not affected by EGF (Fig. 1B). It was important to determine whether EGF-stimulated SphK2 activity measured in vitro resulted in increased intracellular formation of S1P. Similar to previous reports demonstrating that overexpression of SphK1 results in only a modest increase in cellular S1P that does not correlate with the large -fold increase in SphK1 activity measured in vitro (33Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), overexpression of SphK2 caused a 2-fold increase in S1P levels (Fig. 1, C and D). Treatment with EGF significantly increased S1P levels in vector as well as in SphK2 expressing cells by 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1C). Because the localization of SphK2 appears to be cell type-specific (25Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), we examined its localization in HEK 293 cells after subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation and Western blot analysis with anti-SphK2 antibodies. In lysates from cells expressing V5-tagged SphK2, the SphK2 antibody detected a single protein with the same molecular mass of ∼70 kDa that was also detected by anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 1E). Although expression of SphK2 was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction, it was also present at significant levels in P2 (mitochondria), P3 (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi), and cytosol fractions (Fig. 1E). In agreement with previous studies (25Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), there was little or no detectable expression of SphK2 in nuclear fractions of HEK 293 cells overexpressing SphK2 (data not shown). Although overexpression of proteins is a useful approach, an associated caveat is that the ectopically expressed protein does not always exactly mimic the localization and functions of its endogenous counterpart particularly when overexpressed to a very high level. Although all experiments with overexpression of SphK2 were restricted to moderate increases in SphK2 expression (∼10-fold compared with 100-fold in previous studies (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar)), it was important to examine localization of endogenous SphK2. In parental HEK 293 cells, endogenous SphK2 was also expressed mainly in the plasma membrane fraction and was present at lower levels in the P2 and P3 fractions and at barely detectable levels in the cytosol (Fig. 1F). EGF Stimulates Endogenous SphK2 without Affecting Localization—Next, we determined whether EGF activates endogenous SphK1 and/or more importantly, endogenous SphK2. Both SphK1 and SphK2 are expressed in HEK 293 cells and can be qualitatively distinguished by differences in enzymatic activities measured when the substrate sphingosine is added as a BSA complex in the presence of 1 m KCl or when added in a micellar form with Triton X-100 (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Whereas Triton X-100 strongly inhibits SphK2 but not SphK1, 1 m KCl inhibits SphK1 but not SphK2 (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). SphK1 activity in lysates from naive HEK 293 cells measured in the presence of Triton X-100 was rapidly increased by EGF, reaching a maximum within 1 min (Fig. 2A). EGF stimulation of sphingosine phosphorylating activity, as measured with sphingosine complexed with BSA (a measure of SphK1 plus SphK2 activities), appeared somewhat slower, with a maximum increase at 5–10 min (Fig. 2A), and was higher than when measured with sphingosine in Triton X-100 micelles. To examine whether EGF activates and translocates endogenous SphK2, cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared from naive and EGF-stimulated HEK 293 cells. Similar to the overexpressed SphK2 (Fig. 1A), EGF stimulated the activity of membrane-associated endogenous SphK2 (Fig. 2B). In agreement, most of the endogenous SphK2 protein, determined by immunoblotting with a SphK2-specific antibody, was present in the membrane fraction and was not cytosolic (Fig. 2C). Similar to ectopically expressed SphK2, EGF did not induce redistribution of endogenous SphK2 protein (Fig. 2C). SphK1 but Not SphK2 Is Involved in EGF-induced Migration of HEK 293 Cells—As a first approach to examining the involvement of SphKs in EGF-induced migration, we utilized DMS, a potent and specific inhibitor of SphK1 and SphK2 (22Kohama T.

Van Brocklyn J.R. Cuvillier O. Kleuser B. Spiegel S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12892-12898Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). DMS markedly decreased migration of HEK 293 cells toward EGF (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of SphK1 increased EGF-induced migration by nearly 2-fold (Fig. 3B). In contrast, SphK2 expression had no effect on migration toward EGF (Fig. 3B), even though its activity was significantly stimulated by EGF (Figs. 1 and 2). Cells were transfected with catalytically inactive SphK mutants to further examine the involvement of specific SphK isoforms. Both SphK1 and SphK2 have an ATP binding sequence (SGDGX17–21K(R)) present within their conserved C2 domains (23Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T.

Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis of the equivalent residue in SphK2 (G213E) resulted in a complete loss of sphingosine-phosphorylating activity (data not shown). Although there were no significant differences in expression of these mutants, transient expression of SphK1G82D in HEK 293 cells decreased cell migration toward EGF (Fig. 3B). In contrast, expression of SphK2G213E had no effect on EGF-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggest that, although EGF stimulates both SphK1 and SphK"
https://openalex.org/W2171294643,"Celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is a new anticarcinogenic agent. Its antitumor effects depend on the one hand on its COX-2-inhibiting potency, but on the other hand on COX-2-independent mechanisms, which until now have not been fully understood. Here, we investigated whether celecoxib has an impact on the APC/beta-catenin pathway, which has been shown to play a pivotal role in the development of various cancers, especially of the colon. After only 2 h of treatment of human Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells with 100 muM celecoxib, we observed a rapid translocation of beta-catenin from its predominant membrane localization to the cytoplasm. Inhibition of the glycogen-synthase-kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) by LiCl prevented this celecoxib-induced translocation, suggesting that phosphorylation of beta-catenin by the GSK-3beta kinase was essential for this release. Furthermore, the cytosolic accumulation was accompanied by a rapid increase of beta-catenin in the nuclei, starting already 30 min after celecoxib treatment. The DNA binding activity of beta-catenin time dependently decreased 2 h after celecoxib treatment. After this cellular reorganization, we observed a caspase- and proteasome-dependent degradation of beta-catenin after 8 h of drug incubation. Celecoxib-induced beta-catenin degradation was also observed in various other tumor cell lines (HCT-116, MCF-7, and LNCAP) but was not seen after treatment of Caco-2 cells with either the anticarcinogenic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug R-flurbiprofen or the highly COX-2-selective inhibitor rofecoxib. These findings indicate that the anticarcinogenic effects of celecoxib can be explained, at least partly, by an extensive degradation of beta-catenin in human colon carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964614264,"Langendorff-perfused rat hearts treated with EPO exhibited significantly improved postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and reduced infarct size compared with control hearts. Perfusion with the mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 just before and concomitant with EPO treatment abolished EPO-induced phosphorylation of the MEK substrate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but had no effect of EPO-mediated cardioprotection. EPO treatment of the perfused hearts induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) epsilon isoform to the membrane fraction of the hearts and the protective effect of EPO was significantly inhibited by the PKC catalytic inhibitor chelerythrine added before and concomitant with EPO. These data demonstrate that EPO-mediated activation of the PKC signaling pathway before or during ischemia is required for the cardioprotective effect of EPO during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Perfusion with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin just before and concomitant with EPO treatment attenuated EPO-induced phosphorylation of the PI3K substrate Akt but had no effect on EPO-mediated cardioprotection. However, when wortmannin was added during EPO treatment and continued during reperfusion, EPO-mediated cardioprotection was significantly inhibited. We also show that postischemia EPO treatment at the onset of reperfusion significantly improved recovery of LVDP and reduced infarct size. Postischemia cardioprotection by EPO required the PI3K pathway but was not affected by inhibition of PKC at the time of EPO treatment."

In many cases, GPCR quaternary structure seems to be defined early in the processes of receptor synthesis and maturation with the GPCR being transported to the cell surface as a preformed dimer/oligomer (15.White J.H.

The potential quaternary structure of a range of chemokine receptors has also been explored by using similar approaches (18.Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. de Ana A.M. Albar J.P. Martinez-A C.

Although a substantial number of chemokine receptors have been shown to possess such quaternary structure, a number of features of certain chemokine receptors are either controversial or seem not to follow the general model outlined above. For example, dimerization/oligomerization of a number of chemokine receptors appears to be promoted by the binding of chemokine ligands (18.Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. de Ana A.M. Albar J.P. Martinez-A C. Mellado M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19.Vila-Coro A.J. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Martin De Ana A. Moreno-Ortiz M.C.

Equally, it appears that mutation of certain chemokine receptors to prevent dimerization does not restrict membrane delivery (24.Hernanz-Falcon P. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Serrano A. Juan D. del Sol A. Soriano S.F. Roncal F. Gomez L. Valencia A. Martinez A.C. Mellado M. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 216-223Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Among the chemokine receptors (25.Horuk R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), the closely related CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors share a common agonist ligand in interleukin 8 (IL8, also called CXCL8). They are widely co-expressed on immune cells, including neutrophils, CD8(+) T cells, and mast cells; and noncompetitive allosteric inhibitors of these receptors have been suggested to offer a general means to inhibit polymorphonuclear cell recruitment in vivo (26.Bertini R. Allegretti M. Bizzarri C. Moriconi A. Locati M. Zampella G. Cervellera M.N. Di Cioccio V. Cesta M.C. Galliera E. Martinez F.O. Di Bitondo R. Troiani G. Sabbatini V. D'Anniballe G. Anacardio R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40980-40988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have reported that the CXCR2 receptor forms a constitutive dimer when expressed in HEK293 cells and also in cerebellar neurons in which it is expressed endogenously. By contrast, these workers reported (23.Trettel F. Di Bartolomeo S. Lauro C. Catalano M. Ciotti M.T. Limatola C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40980-40988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that the CXCR1 receptor was unable to dimerize. As well as homodimeric/oligomeric interactions, many related GPCRs have been shown to have the capacity to form heterodimers. This can result in alterations in receptor pharmacology and signal transduction characteristics (27.Levac B.A. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28.Breit A. Lagace M. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

A number of chemokine receptors have been reported to have the capacity to form heterodimers (30.Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Mellado M. Martinez-A C. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 612-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but again, Trettel and co-workers (23.Trettel F. Di Bartolomeo S. Lauro C. Catalano M. Ciotti M.T. Limatola C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40980-40988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported the lack of interactions between the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors following their co-expression. Given the general parsimony of structure and function of closely related proteins, we decided to re-examine the capacity of the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors to form homo- and heterodimers. By using a wide range of approaches, we show that both CXCR1 and CXCR2 form homodimer/oligomers at an early stage in synthesis and maturation and that when co-expressed CXCR1 and CXCR2 form heterodimers as effectively as homodimers. The extent of neither the CXCR1-CXCR2 heterodimer nor the corresponding homodimers is affected by the presence of IL8. 125I-IL8 (2000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. All reagents for BRET2 studies were from Packard Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Interactiva, Ulm, Germany. The anti-human CXCR1 antibody was from R & D Systems, (Abingdon, UK). The human CXCR1 receptor was used as a PCR template for all CXCR1 constructs. For the N-terminally modified forms of the receptor, primers encoded the appropriate epitope tag sequence and introduced a stop codon after the last amino acid of the receptor sequence.

A KpnI site present in the sense primer and an EcoRI site present in the antisense primer are underlined, and the amplified fragment was digested and ligated into pcDNA3. To generate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trapped form of HA-CXCR1 (HA-CXCR1-ER), primers encoding the C-terminal 14-amino acid segment of the α2c-adrenoreceptor were annealed to HA-CXCR1. The primers are as follows: sense, 5′-AATTCAAGCATATCCTCTTTCGAAGGAGGAGAAGGGGCTTCAGGCAATGAT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTAGATGATTGCCTGAAGCCCCTTCTCCTCCTTCGAAAGAGGATATGCTTG-3′.

The amplified fragment was digested and ligated into pcDNA3 upstream and in-frame with CFP ligated between HindIII and XhoI. CXCR2—Human CXCR2 was used as a PCR template for all CXCR2 constructs. These were generated in a similar fashion to the CXCR1 constructs. For the N-terminally modified forms of the receptor, primers encoded the appropriate epitope tag sequence and introduced a stop codon after the last amino acid of the receptor sequence. FLAG-CXCR2—The primers are as follows: sense, 5′-AAAAGAATTCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGATAAGGAAGATTTTAACATGGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-AAAAGAATTCGAGAGTGGAAGTGTGCCC-3′.

Pellets of cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (TE buffer), and the cells were homogenized using 40 strokes of a glass on Teflon homogenizer. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant fraction was removed and passed through a 25-gauge needle 10 times before being transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and subjected to centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in TE buffer. Protein concentration was assessed, and membranes were diluted to 1 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C until required. Reaction mixtures were established in a volume of 100 μl containing 5 μg of membrane protein, 100 pm 125I-IL8, and a range of concentrations of nonradiolabeled IL8. Samples were incubated for 90 min at room temperature prior to filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism, and IC50 values were determined via nonlinear regression using one-site competition analysis. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of IL8 was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (31.Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h following transfection and resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NaPO4, 5% ethylene glycol). The cell pellet was disrupted as above and placed on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube containing 200 μl of 1× RIPA and 50 μl of protein G beads (Sigma) to pre-clear the samples. Following incubation on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4 °C, the samples were re-centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined. Samples containing equal protein amounts were incubated overnight with 40 μl of protein G beads, 5 μg of M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, and fractions were reserved to monitor protein expression in the cell lysates. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the protein G beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer. Following addition of Laemmli buffer and heating to 85 °C for 4 min, both immunoprecipitated samples and cell lysate controls were revolved by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast 4-12% acrylamide Novex Bistris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. These membranes were incubated in 5% (w/v) low fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (v/v) solution at room temperature on a rotating shaker for 2 h and then with primary antibody overnight in 5% (w/v) low fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (v/v) solution at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS before addition of secondary antibody. Following further washes, the membrane was subsequently developed using ECL solution (Pierce). Cells were imaged using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 5 pascal) equipped with a 63× oil-immersion Plan Fluor Apochromat objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.4. A pinhole of 20 and an electronic zoom of 1 or 2.5 were used (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). The excitation laser line for GFP and YFP was the 488-nm argon laser with detection via a 505-530 band pass filter. Alexa 594 label was detected using a 543-nm helium/neon laser and detected via a 560 long pass filter. The images were manipulated using MetaMorph imaging software (version 6.1.3; Universal Imaging Corp., Downing, PA). In some experiments, fixed cells were used. Cells grown on coverslips were transiently transfected and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 5% sucrose. The cells were washed a further three times in ice-cold PBS prior to being fixed onto microscope slides with 40% glycerol in PBS. HEK293T cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-treated coverslips and transiently transfected with appropriate CFP/YFP fusion proteins. Coverslips were placed into a microscope chamber containing physiological saline solution (130 nm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4). Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E fluorescence inverted microscope, and images were obtained individually for enhanced YFP, CFP, and FRET filter channels using an Optoscan monochromator (Cairn Research, Faversham, Kent, UK) and a dichroic mirror 86002v2bs (Chroma Inc., Rockingham, VT). The filter sets used are as follows: YFP (excitation 500/5 nm; emission 535/30 nm), CFP (excitation 430/12 nm; emission 470/30 nm), and FRET (excitation 430/12 nm; emission 535/30 nm). The illumination time was 250 ms and binning modes 2 × 2. MetaMorph imaging software was used to quantify the FRET images using the sensitized FRET method. Corrected FRET was calculated using a pixel-by-pixel methodology using the equation FRETc = FRET - (coefficient B × CFP) - (coefficient A × YFP), where CFP, YFP, and FRET values correspond to background corrected images obtained through the CFP, YFP, and FRET channels. B and A correspond to the values obtained for the CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) bleed through coefficients, respectively, calculated using cells singly transfected with either the CFP or YFP protein alone. To correct the FRET levels for the varying amounts of donor (CFP) and acceptor (YFP), normalized FRET was calculated using the equation FRETn = FRETc/CFP × YFP, where FRETc, CFP, and YFP are equal to the fluorescence values obtained from single cells. 10-cm2 dishes of HEK293T cells were transfected to express N-terminally c-Myc or FLAG-tagged forms of CXCR1 or CXCR2 individually or in combination. 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold PBS. Anti-c-Myc Eu3+ and anti-FLAG allophycocyanin (APC) antibodies were diluted in 50% newborn calf serum; 50% PBS to final concentrations of 5 and 15 nm, respectively. Samples were mixed and incubated on a rotating wheel at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were covered in aluminum foil to minimize exposure of the fluorophores to light. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the antibody mixture was removed from the cell pellet. The pellet was then washed two times in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 250 μl of PBS. To investigate the agonist effect on energy transfer, 90 μl of cells were transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with the chosen concentration of agonist at 37 °C. To measure the energy transfer, 40 μl of each sample was dispensed in triplicate into a black 384-well plate. Blank wells containing PBS were also included. Tr-FRET was determined using a Victor2 plate reader (Packard Bioscience). Excitation was at 340 nm, and emission filters generated data representing donor (615 nm) and acceptor (665 nm) fluorescence. Normalized FRET was calculated using the following equation: normalized FRET = ((A665 - BLK)/D615) - C, where A665 is the fluorescent emission from the acceptor, D615 is the fluorescent emission from the donor, and BLK represents the background reading at 665 nm from wells containing PBS. C represents the cross-talk between the donor and acceptor windows for the samples incubated with only anti-c-Myc Eu3+ and is equal to A665 - BLK/D615. Single Point BRET2—Cells were washed twice in PBS supplemented with 1 g/liter glucose and resuspended in a final volume of 1 ml. 160 μl of cells were dispensed into a white-walled 96-well plate (Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and either 20 μl of agonist or PBS/glucose added. If agonist was tested then the plate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. DeepBlueC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) substrate was diluted 1:20 in PBS/glucose, and the mixture was kept protected from light until required. 20 μl of substrate was added to each well resulting in a final concentration of 10 μm, and BRET2 was measured using a Mithras LB940 (Berthold Technology, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Readings were taken using 410 nm (band pass 80 nm) corresponding to light emission resulting from Renilla luciferase catalyzing the substrate to coelenteramide. Transferred energy emitted by GFP2 was detected using a 515-nm (band pass 30 nm) filter, and a ratiometric reading was obtained corresponding to the ratio of light intensity (515 nm) to light intensity (410 nm). Saturation BRET2—In saturation BRET2 experiments cells were transfected with a constant amount of the energy donor (Renilla luciferase) construct and a varying amount of energy acceptor (GFP2) construct. Cells were harvested, and membranes were prepared and diluted to 0.5 mg/ml. BRET2 was assessed as above for intact cells. Luminescence and fluorescence measurements were also obtained. 50 μl of cell membranes were dispensed into white-walled 96-well plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for luminescence measurements and black-walled 386-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) for fluorescence measurement. For luminescence measurement h-coelenterazine (5 μm) was added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to measurement at 410 nm using a Mithras LB 940. GFP2 fluorescence was assessed using Victor2 1420 Multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). BRET2 readings were corrected for energy transfer resulting from bleed through of signal from the Renilla luciferase construct expressed alone but detected in the GFP2 channel. Fluorescence readings were corrected for endogenous fluorescence of HEK293T cell membranes alone. Graphpad Prism 4 was used to analyze data using a one-site binding hyperbola equation yielding BRETmax and BRET50 values. Cells were grown onto coverslips and transiently transfected. 24 h later medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with 20 mm HEPES/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the appropriate dilution of primary antibody for 40 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. IL8 (50 nm) was added, and the coverslip was incubated for 30 min. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were fixed by incubating with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 5% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature. Following three further washes the cells were permeabilized with 0.15% Triton-X-100, 3% nonfat milk, PBS for 10 min. The coverslips were incubated with a secondary antibody (5 mg/ml) conjugated to an Alexa 594 fluorophore. Following incubation for 1 h, cells were washed twice in 0.15% Triton X-100, 3% nonfat milk, PBS and three times in PBS. Coverslips were then mounted onto microscope slides with 40% glycerol in PBS. HEK293T cells were transfected to express either HA-CXCR1 or an ER-retained version of this construct that has the C-terminal 14 amino acids of the α2c-adrenoreceptor attached to the C-terminal tail (HA-CXCR1-ER). Such cells were co-transfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged forms of various receptors. 48 h following transfection the cells were harvested and counted using a hemocytometer. 5 × 105 cells were dispensed into individual Eppendorf tubes, and the cells were incubated with 15 nm APC-labeled anti-FLAG antibody and 1 μm Hoechst nuclear stain on a rotating wheel for 1 h. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the cell pellet was washed three times with PBS. The ce"

Conflicting data with N. meningitidis indicate that Omp85 functions either in assembly of OM proteins or in export of OM lipids. The role of YaeT in E. coli was investigated with a new temperature-sensitive mutant harboring nine amino acid substitutions. The mutant stops growing after 60 min at 44 °C. After 30 min at 44 °C, incorporation of [35S]methionine into newly synthesized OM proteins is selectively inhibited. Synthesis and export of OM phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide are not impaired. OM protein levels are low, even at 30 °C, and the buoyant density of the OM is correspondingly lower. By Western blotting, we show that levels of the major OM protein OmpA are lower in the mutant in whole cells, membranes, and the growth medium. SecA functions as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive phenotype and partially restores OM proteins.

OM protein levels are low, even at 30 °C, and the buoyant density of the OM is correspondingly lower. By Western blotting, we show that levels of the major OM protein OmpA are lower in the mutant in whole cells, membranes, and the growth medium. SecA functions as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive phenotype and partially restores OM proteins. Our data are consistent with a critical role for YaeT in OM protein assembly in E. coli. The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of an inner membrane (IM) 1The abbreviations used are: IM inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; ts, temperature-sensitive; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.

The OM has a lipid and protein profile distinct from that of the IM (4Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). The OM contains phospholipids on its inner surface and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on its outside surface (3Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C.

The most abundant OM proteins are the trimeric porins, but many additional minor proteins, including some enzymes, are also present (3Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C.

All OM protein structures studied to date are characterized by an inside-out β-barrel architecture not found in IM proteins (9Wimley W.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The only exceptions are the lipoproteins, which associate with the OM through their N-terminal lipid-modified cysteine residues (10Wu H.C. Neidhardt F.C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The lipids and proteins of the OM are synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the IM, transported across the IM and periplasm, and assembled into the OM (2Cronan J.E. Annu. Rev.

The transport of lipoproteins from the outer face of the IM to the OM requires the LolABCDE machinery (11Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent genetic and structural studies of the IM protein MsbA, an essential ABC transporter, have established its role as a flippase or pump required for the export of LPS and phospholipids (21Zhou Z.

The mechanisms by which nascent proteins, phospholipids, and LPS are assembled into the OM following transport across the periplasm remain poorly characterized. OM proteins are synthesized with signal peptides that are cleaved at the periplasmic surface of the IM (26Wickner W. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). OM protein folding in the periplasm prior to insertion into the OM is facilitated by chaperones, such as SurA and HlpA, and may be accelerated by LPS (27Bulieris P.V. Behrens S. Holst O.

Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Subsequent steps are uncertain. Some OM proteins, like FhuA, have high affinity LPS-binding sites (31Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). OM proteins are generally not required for growth (4Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). However, in Neisseria meningitidis, Omp85 is a minor, essential OM protein (32Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 33Genevrois S. Steeghs L. Roholl P. Letesson J.J. Van Der Ley P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Depletion experiments have led to contradictory conclusions regarding Omp85 function. Genevrois et al. (33Genevrois S. Steeghs L. Roholl P. Letesson J.J. Van Der Ley P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that transport of lipids to the OM is selectively blocked, as in MsbA mutants (22Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, Voulhoux et al. (32Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) demonstrated that OM protein folding and oligomerization are defective. Both groups employed a construct with a chromosomal deletion of omp85 and an intact copy of the omp85 gene behind an inducible promoter on a plasmid. This strategy required a prolonged (>6 h) incubation to deplete pre-existing Omp85. Recently, Kahne and co-workers (34Wu T. Malinverni J. Ruiz N. Kim S. Silhavy T.J. Kahne D. Cell. 2005; 121: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) discovered that YaeT exists in a heterooligomeric OM complex with three lipoproteins of unknown function: YfgL, NlpB, and YfiO. Their findings confirm that YaeT is essential for viability in Escherichia coli and demonstrate a role for YaeT in OM biogenesis. However, lipid trafficking, global outer membrane protein composition, and buoyant density were not examined. YaeT is the E. coli ortholog of Omp85 (35Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar). We have now examined the function of YaeT. We confirm that yaeT is essential in E. coli, as in other bacteria (32Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar) and downstream of uppS (38Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J.

We have constructed a yaeT deletion mutant covered by a plasmid that expresses a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of yaeT that stops growing after 60 min at 44 °C. The levels of major OM proteins are greatly reduced, and the OM buoyant density is reduced. The level of new OM proteins is low at the permissive temperature and is almost undetectable after only 30 min at 44 °C, but lipid synthesis and export are relatively unaffected. Moderate overexpression of SecA, a component of the pre-protein translocase (41Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 42Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 686-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), largely restores OM proteins and growth to normal rates at 44 °C. Our data are consistent with a critical role for YaeT in the assembly of OM proteins in E. coli. Materials—Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco. Radioisotopes and Enhance were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and custom-made primers were from Invitrogen. Pfu DNA polymerase and the GeneMorph PCR mutagenesis kit were obtained from Stratagene.

All other chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Mallinckrodt. Plasmid Construction—Standard recombinant DNA techniques were utilized in the construction of plasmids (44Sambrook J.

The forward primer was YaeTNdeI, and the reverse primer was YaeTBamHI (Table II). These primers were used at a final concentration of 2.5 ng/μl in a 100-μl PCR mixture containing 100 ng of genomic DNA and 5 units of Pfu polymerase. The reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C denaturation for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C (denaturation) for 1 min, 55 °C (annealing) for 1 min, and 72 °C (extension) for 2.5 min. This was followed by a 10-min run-off at 72 °C. The gel-purified PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated into an NdeI/BamHI- and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pET23a vector (Novagen), yielding pWTD25. Plasmid pWTD27 was constructed by cloning the XbaI/BamHI fragment of pWTD25 (containing a 5′ ribosomal binding site) into XbaI/BamHI- and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated vector, pMAK705 (46Hamilton C.M.

Primers were SecANdeI and SecABamHI (Table II). pWTD32 was constructed by cloning the XbaI/BamHI fragment of pWTD31 (containing a 5′ ribosomal binding site) into XbaI/BamHI- and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pACYC184. pWTD33 was constructed by cloning the XbaI/BamHI fragment of pWTD31 into XbaI/BamHI- and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pWSK29. Plasmids were sequenced at the Duke University sequencing facility. When appropriate, antibiotics were added as follows: chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml; kanamycin, 25 μg/ml; and ampicillin, 90 μg/ml. In experiments with the ts mutant, the nonpermissive temperature was defined as 42 °C for plate grown bacteria and 44 °C for liquid grown bacteria. Replacement of the yaeT Gene—Replacement of yaeT with the kan gene from pUC4K was done using λ-RED-mediated recombination (48Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The kan gene was amplified by PCR from plasmid DNA using primers YaeTkoA and YaeTkoB (Table II). The gel-purified DNA was treated with DpnI to remove contaminating methylated plasmid DNA and was used to transform E. coli strain DY330/pWTD27 by electroporation. Following a 2-h outgrowth in LB broth (49Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) at 30 °C, the cells were plated on LB agar plates containing kanamycin and incubated overnight at 30 °C. A P1vir lysate made from DY330 (yaeT::kan)/pWTD27 was used to transduce W3110/pWTD27 to KmR (50Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar). The resulting strain was designated WD401/pWTD27. Isolation of ts yaeT Mutation by Error-prone PCR—PCR mutagenesis was carried out using the GeneMorph kit from Stratagene. The target DNA was pWTD25, which was used at a final concentration of 300 or 30 pg/μl. Primers were YaeTBamHI and T7 promoter (Table II). A 50-μl reaction mixture contained the Mutazyme reaction buffer (1×), 200 μm dNTPs, 125 ng of primers, and 2.5 units of Mutazyme DNA polymerase. The reaction conditions were as follows: a 94 °C denaturation step for 1 min was followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2.5 min. This was followed by a 10-min run-off at 72 °C. The DNAs from both high and low target concentration reactions were pooled and gel-purified. The DNA was then digested with BamHI/XbaI and used in a ligation reaction containing similarly digested vector pWSK29. Following ligation, E. coli W3110 cells were transformed with the plasmid DNA containing mutagenized yaeT. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, ∼1000 AmpR colonies were scraped and pooled into 5 ml of LB broth. These cells were diluted into 50 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin, grown overnight, and used as the recipient cells for a P1vir transduction using a lysate prepared from WD401/pWTD27. KmR colonies (which were also AmpR because of the presence of the vector pWSK29) were screened by streaking on LB/ampicillin plates and incubating overnight at 30 and 42 °C. A representative construct with the desired ts phenotype was designated WD401/pWTD30-9. E. coli Genomic DNA Library Construction—Genomic DNA from E. coli W3110 (50 μg) was partially digested with 2 units of Sau3A1 for 15 min at 37 °C in 0.2 ml of Sau3A1 buffer. Then 6 μlof0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, was added to stop the reaction, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate the enzyme. The DNA was resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and fragments corresponding to 2–6.5 kb were recovered. Plasmid pACYC184 was opened with BamHI, gel-purified, and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. For the ligation reaction, 200 ng of partially digested genomic DNA was incubated at 16 °C overnight with 200 ng of treated plasmid and 2 units of T4 DNA ligase in a total volume of 25 μl of ligase buffer. E. coli XL1-Blue cells were transformed with the ligation mixture, and CmR transformants were selected. Ligation reactions containing both the vector and insert yielded ∼10-fold more colonies than a control ligation reaction containing vector alone. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, ∼20,000 CmR colonies were recovered. These were pooled with a cell scraper and transferred to 250 ml of SOC medium (44Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing chloramphenicol. Cells were grown to stationary phase. Plasmid DNA was isolated, divided into aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. Multicopy Suppressors of the ts Growth of WD401/pWTD30-9 —Competent WD401/pWTD30-9 cells were transformed with 100 ng of the pACYC184-based E. coli genomic DNA library, described above. Following a 2-h outgrowth at 30 °C in the absence of antibiotic, the cells were plated on LB broth containing chloramphenicol. A few plates were incubated at 30 °C to assess transformation efficiency, and the rest were incubated at 42 °C. Colonies appeared at 42 °C at a frequency of ∼0.1% versus 30 °C. Plasmid DNA was isolated and used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells to CmR. Plasmid DNA was then isolated from these recipient cells, and the ends of the inserts were sequenced with primers designed to flank the BamHI site of pACYC184 (pACYC184/BamHIA and pACYC184/BamHIB; Table II). Labeling, Membrane Preparation, and Sucrose Gradients—Cells were grown in 25 ml of LB broth to A600 = 1.0 at 30 °C and then diluted 4-fold into fresh, pre-warmed LB broth at 44 °C. After 30 min of growth at 44 °C, cells were labeled with 4 μCi/ml 32Pi (9000 Ci/mmol) or 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (1175 Ci/mmol) for 10 min. Cells were cooled rapidly on ice and harvested by centrifugation. Spheroplasts were prepared at 0 °C by lysozyme/EDTA treatment and broken by mild sonic irradiation (22Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C.

Anti-pro-OmpA and anti-SecA antibodies were generously provided by Dr. William Wickner (Dartmouth University) and Dr. Timothy Yahr (University of Iowa) and were used at titers of 1:20,000 and 1:10,000, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from Pierce was used at a titer of 1:200,000. The ECL Plus kit from Amersham Biosciences was used for detection. YaeT Is Essential in E. coli—To study YaeT function in E. coli, we attempted to disrupt the chromosomal copy of yaeT by replacing it with a kanamycin resistance cassette (kan). Experiments without a covering plasmid were unsuccessful. Therefore, we amplified yaeT from E. coli W3110 genomic DNA (Tables I and II) and cloned it into the vector pMAK705, which carries a ts origin of replication (46Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of NF-κB-mediated regulation of gene expression, and the signaling molecules participating in the NF-κB pathway in the central nervous system are, to date, poorly understood. To identify such molecules, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using NIK as bait. As a result, we identified a novel NIK and IKKβ binding protein designated NIBP that is mainly expressed in brain, muscle, heart, and kidney. Interestingly, low levels of expression were detected in immune tissues such as spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes, where NF-κB is known to modulate immune function. We demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that NIBP expression in the brain is localized to neurons. NIBP physically interacts with NIK, IKKβ, but not IKKα or IKKγ. NIBP overexpression potentiates tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activation through increased phosphorylation of the IKK complex and its downstream IκBα and p65 substrates. Finally, knockdown of NIBP expression by small interfering RNA reduces tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activation, prevents nerve growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation, and decreases Bcl-xL gene expression in PC12 cells. Our data demonstrate that NIBP, by interacting with NIK and IKKβ, is a new enhancer of the cytokine-induced NF-κB signaling pathway. Because of its neuronal expression, we propose that NIBP may be a potential target for modulating the NF-κB signaling cascade in neuronal pathologies dependent upon abnormal activation of this pathway.

NF-κB is a multipotent transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in a wide array of biological responses such as inflammation, immunity, apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity (1Shishodia S.

Yu Z. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In mammals, the NF-κB family of transcription factors consists of five members: p65 (or RelA), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (or p105, precursor of p50), and NF-κB2 (or p100, precursor of p52). To date, two principal pathways for NF-κB activation have been characterized, a classical and an alternative pathway (5Patke A. Mecklenbrauker I. Tarakhovsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Perkins N.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7553-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). The classical pathway is triggered by stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; IL-1, interleukin-1; TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2; NGF, nerve growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; IL-1, interleukin-1; TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2; NGF, nerve growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAP, mitogen-activated protein.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway depends on the IκB kinase (IKK) signalsome, which consists of at least two catalytic subunits (IKKα or IKK1, and IKKβ or IKK2) and a regulatory subunit (IKKγ or NEMO). The activated IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitor proteins of NF-κB (IκBs) to induce their ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the translocation of NF-κB dimers (mainly p65/p50) to the nucleus and transcriptional activation of specific target genes. This pathway is crucial for the activation of innate immunity and inflammation. The alternative pathway is activated by lymphotoxin-β (8Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C.

It relies on the phosphorylation of IKKα homodimers by NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) to induce p100 processing and nuclear translocation of RelB/p52 dimers (7Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). This alternative pathway is necessary for secondary lymphoid organ development, maturation of B cells, and adaptive humoral immunity.NF-κB is involved in the regulation of both physiological and pathological processes. Synaptic stimulation activates NF-κB, which then participates in long-term potentiation, a process associated with memory formation (13Lynch M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 87-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-κB has anti-apoptotic properties in neurons because blocking its activation increases their sensitivity to TNFα-induced apoptosis (14Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar, 15Chen C. Edelstein L.C. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Induction of NF-κB is also associated with several neurological diseases such as Parkinsons (16Hunot S. Brugg B. Ricard D. Michel P.P. Muriel M.P. Ruberg M. Faucheux B.A. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7531-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), Alzheimers (17Bales K.R. Du Y.

Spine. 2004; 1: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). NIK also appears to perform specific functions in the central nervous system and has been implicated in the activation of both the classical and alternative pathways.NIK was originally identified as a serine/threonine protein kinase related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP3K) that interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), IKKα, IKKβ, and can strongly activate NF-κB following TNF/NGF receptor family stimulation (22Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Although earlier overexpression studies using mutant NIK pointed to a crucial role for NIK in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, later studies using NIK knock-out mice challenged this view, finding NIK to be an essential component only of the alternative pathway. More recent data, however, indicated that NIK participates in signaling events initiated by specific inducers that activate both the classical and alternative pathways (23Ramakrishnan P. Wang W. Wallach D. Immunity. 2004; 21: 477-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).The first demonstration of the function of NIK in the central nervous system was the observation that Aly mice, in which a naturally occurring mutation in the alymphoplasia allele causes NIK to be non-functional, displayed progressive neurological abnormalities leading to hind limb paralysis (24Miyawaki S. Nakamura Y. Suzuka H. Koba M. Yasumizu R. Ikehara S. Shibata Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Moreover, in PC12 cells, NIK promotes neurite formation and prevents apoptosis (25Foehr E.D. Bohuslav J. Chen L.F. DeNoronha C. Geleziunas R. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34021-34024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms of NIK and, in general, of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the central nervous system are not well understood. To investigate these mechanisms, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library with NIK as bait. As a result, we identified a novel protein designated NIBP (for NIK and IKKβ binding protein), which interacts directly with NIK and IKKβ and is expressed in neurons. NIBP functions as an enhancer of cytokine-mediated NF-κB activation and IKK kinase activity. Finally, preliminary in vitro studies suggest that NIBP may be a regulator of Bcl-xL gene expression as well as neuronal differentiation, because it is required for NGF-induced neurite extension in PC12 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed with the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System II (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The bait, encoding the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-145) of NIK, was inserted into the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the yeast expression vector pBridge (Clontech) as previously described (26Hu W.H.

The yeast strain G1945 was transformed with pBridge-NIK followed by the pACT2 expression vector that contained a human brain cDNA library fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain.Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant TNFα, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and NGF as well as antibodies against MAP2, FLAG, β-actin, and β-tubulin were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against phospho-IKKα/β, phospho-p65, phospho-IκBα, NIK, and p65 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against IKKα/β, IKKα, NIK, and IκBα were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A peptide corresponding to amino acids 417VYNPMPFELRVENMGLLTSGVEF439 of NIBP (100% homology between human, mouse, and rat) was used as an immunogen to generate polyclonal antiserum in rabbit. The crude NIBP antiserum was affinity-purified (Proteintech Group, Inc.) and its specificity was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry.Expression Vectors—The NF-κB-luciferase and interferon response factor-1-luciferase reporter constructs were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Mammalian expression vectors encoding TRAF2, NIK, IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, and Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase were previously described (27Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

NIBP was generated by conventional PCR from a mouse cDNA library and cloned into the pCMV-Tag 2B mammalian expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The C-terminal portion (211 amino acids) of NIBP was generated by PCR and cloned into a cytomegalovirus promoter-based pRK7 vector (28Shu H.B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).Northern Blot—Tissue-specific expression of NIBP mRNA was examined by hybridization of a human multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) with a PCR-produced, [32P]dCTP-labeled 630-bp probe. Hybridizations were conducted in the ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) at 65 °C for 2 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. The same blots were then stripped and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 300-bp β-actin probe as control.Immunohistochemistry—Fifteen-μm cryostat sections from mouse brain and spinal cord were incubated overnight with anti-NIBP (1: 1000). Antibody labeling was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining using the Vector Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). HEK293T cells (Clontech) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). Mouse primary cortical neurons were prepared as previously described (30Lee J.M. Shih A.Y. Murphy T.H. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37948-37956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Ten-cm dishes containing 3 × 106 HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique.Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay—The C-terminal portion (211 amino acids) of NIBP was cloned into the pGEX-4T-2 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate a GST-NIBP(cd) fusion protein, which was incubated with in vitro translated NIK, IKKα, IKKγ, and truncated IKKβ. In vitro translation was performed with the TnT® System (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Truncated IKKβ (288 amino acids from the C terminus) was generated by EcoRI digestion. In vitro translation mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins coupled to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. Following multiple washes (wash buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), GST-bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and detected by autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments were performed according to standard procedures as previously described (31Hu W.H. Hausmann O.N. Yan M.S. Walters W.M. Wong P.K. Bethea J.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Reporter Gene Assay—The chemiluminescent reporter gene assay for the combined detection of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was performed with the Dual-Light Combined Reporter Gene Assay System from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase. Four separate experiments were conducted and, in each experiment, data were calculated as the average ± S.E. of triplicate samples.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (32Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as previously described (20Bethea J.R. Castro M. Keane R.W. Lee T.T. Dietrich W.D. Yezierski R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3251-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded NF-κB consensus oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; Promega) were 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), and added to binding reactions in the presence of poly(dI-dC):poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), herring sperm DNA (Invitrogen), and nuclear extracts. Equal amounts of extracts, varying from 5 to 20 μg/sample, were loaded in each binding reaction. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, samples were loaded onto a pre-electrophoresed 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA buffer, 6% polyacrylamide gel, and run at 150 V for ∼1.5 h. Gels were then fixed and dried, and autoradiograms obtained.Lentiviral siRNA Vector and Infection—Lentiviral-mediated U6-promoted NIBP siRNA constructs were generated using a modified PCR-based strategy (33Rubinson D.A.

Sense and antisense NIBP oligonucleotides were cloned into the XbaI/XhoI site of the pLL3.7 vector (a kind gift from Dr. Van Parijs Lab, MIT Center for Cancer Research). Three NIBP siRNA lentiviral vectors containing nucleotides 586-607 (NR), 1762-1784 (MR), and 2303-2321 (CR) of mouse NIBP (GenBank™ accession number AY630620) were generated. Packaging, purification, and determination of virus titer was performed as described (33Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T.

Cells were plated on collagen-coated 24-well dishes at a density of 104 cells/well. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with NGF (100 ng/ml). Three days after treatment, the fluorescence of enhanced green fluorescent protein in infected cells was observed.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of DNase I-treated RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexanucleotide primers.

From 3 × 106 yeast transformants, 40 clones were both histidine and β-galactosidase positive. Sequence analysis of the positive clones revealed the presence of several known gene products encoding for proteins previously reported as NIK interacting partners (e.g. TRAF3 (36Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and TRAF2 (37Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar)). In addition, several novel clones were identified, one of which, TNAP, is a negative regulator of cytokine-induced NF-κB activation (26Hu W.H. Mo X.M. Walters W.M. Brambilla R. Bethea J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35975-35983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study we report the identification of a 211-amino acid C-terminal portion of a novel protein, NIBP. Data base analysis showed that NIBP is identical to GenBank sequence KIAA1882 (TULARIC GENE 1), the function of which had not been described. Human NIBP, a 1246-amino acid peptide (139.4 kDa), is found on chromosome 8q24.3, contains 23 exons, and shares a high degree of homology (80-90%) with rat and mouse sequences. Northern blot analysis of human tissues indicated that NIBP is expressed at high levels in muscle and kidney, and at lower levels in brain, heart, and placenta (Fig. 1a). At least two different transcripts were detected in muscle, kidney, liver, and heart, suggesting that two or more isoforms of NIBP may exist. Interestingly, NIBP transcripts were absent or only weakly detectable in immune organs and cells such as thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes, where the NF-κB signaling pathway is known to play key regulatory roles. Immunostaining of mouse brain and spinal cord sections with an antibody raised against a peptide sequence conserved between mouse, rat, and human NIBP indicated the presence of NIBP in neuronal cells. Strong NIBP staining was observed in both the cell bodies and processes of neurons of the pyramidal layer of the cortex (Fig. 1b, A and B), in spinal cord motor neurons (Fig. 1b, C and D), and white matter neurons (data not shown). Positive NIBP immunolabeling was also detected in primary neurons from mouse cortex and colocalized with the neuronal-specific marker MAP2 (Fig. 1c).NIBP Interacts with NIK and IKKβ and but Not IKKα or IKKγ—To confirm the interaction between NIBP and NIK in a mammalian system, Myc-tagged NIK and FLAG-tagged NIBP C-terminal 211 amino acid domains (NIBP(cd)) were coexpressed in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2a, NIBP(cd) was coimmunoprecipitated with NIK, indicating that they are interacting partners in the same signaling complex. Because NIK interacts with and activates the IKK complex (37Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 38Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that NIBP could also interact with subunits of the IKK complex. Indeed, immunoprecipitation analysis of HEK293T cells cotransfected with Myc-NIBP and FLAG-IKKα, FLAG-IKKβ, or FLAG-IKKγ showed that NIBP interacts strongly with IKKβ, weakly with IKKα, and does not interact with IKKγ (Fig. 2b). The strong interaction between IKKβ and NIBP could also be detected endogenously in mouse brain lysate following immunoprecipitation with the rabbit polyclonal anti-NIBP antibody (Fig. 2c). Likewise, NIK was also found to interact with NIBP (Fig. 2c), supporting the results obtained in the overexpression system (Fig. 2b). No interaction was detected with either IKKα or IKKγ (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the weak interaction detected between NIBP and IKKα in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2b) could be an artifact of the overexpression system. It is noteworthy that we could detect endogenous NIK in brain lysates only following immunoprecipitation with NIBP (Fig. 2c). Endogenous NIBP was also detected following reciprocal immunoprecipitation of mouse brain lysate with an anti-IKKα/β and two anti-NIK antibodies (Fig. 2d). We ruled out that the interaction between NIBP and IKKα/β could be because of an interaction solely with IKKα, because no NIBP was detected when brain lysate was immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-IKKα antibody (Fig. 2d). In support of the physiological relevance of such interactions, these findings were replicated in other systems, such as in PC12 cells (Fig. 6a) and MCF7 cells (data not shown). By using the GST pull-down assay we determined that NIBP binding to NIK and IKKβ is direct. Interestingly, it appears that the interaction between NIK and NIBP is enhanced in the presence of IKKβ (Fig. 2e). Finally, no binding was detected with either IKKα or IKKγ, in agreement with our previous results in endogenous mouse brain (Fig. 2e).Fig. 2NIBP interacts with NIK and IKKβ. a, lysates (Lys) from HEK293T cells cotransfected with Myc-NIK and FLAG-NIBP(cd) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by Western blot with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies. NIK was immunoprecipitated in the presence of anti-FLAG (IP lane), but not in the presence of a control IgG (IgG lane). b, lysates from HEK293T cells cotransfected with Myc-NIBP and FLAG-IKKα, FLAG-IKKβ, or FLAG-IKKγ were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and probed with an anti-NIBP antibody. NIBP was coimmunoprecipitated with IKKβ and IKKα, but not IKKγ. c, brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-NIBP and analyzed by Western blot with anti-IKKα, anti-IKKβ, anti-IKKγ, anti-NIK, or anti-NIBP antibodies. Two different anti-NIK antibodies were used to confirm the identification of endogenous NIK. One representative blot (IB) is shown. IKKβ and NIK were coimmunoprecipitated with NIBP. d, mouse brain lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-NIK, anti-IKKα/β, and anti-IKKα antibodies, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-NIBP, anti-NIK, anti-IKKβ, or anti-IKKα antibodies. NIBP was coimmunoprecipitated with NIK and IKKβ. e, GST-pull down assay to evaluate direct protein-protein interactions. Purified GST or GST-NIBP(cd) fusion protein (Coomassie staining, left) was incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled full-length NIK, IKKα, IKKγ, or truncated IKKβ and analyzed by autoradiography. GST-NIBP interacted directly with IKKβ and NIK, and when cold IKKβ was added to 35S-labeled NIK, the interaction of NIBP with NIK was enhanced (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6NIBP regulates NGF-induced gene expression and differentiation in PC12 cells. a, PC12 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-NIBP antibody or control IgG, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-IKKα, anti-IKKβ, anti-IKKγ, and anti-NIK antibodies.

We described previously a cytoplasmic PEST sequence in ABCA1 and showed that deletion of the PEST sequence results in a prominent increase in the cell surface concentration of ABCA1. In the current study we evaluated the hypothesis that the PEST sequence-deleted ABCA1 might display defective internalization and trafficking to the late endosomes/lysosomes. As assessed by monensin treatment and cell surface biotinylation, the internalization rate of PEST sequence-deleted ABCA1 (ABCA1-dPEST) was markedly decreased compared with wild-type ABCA1 (ABCA1-wt). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of ABCA1-wt showed both plasma membrane localization and substantial co-localization with LAMP2 in late endosomes. In contrast, ABCA1-dPEST showed more prominent plasma membrane localization but little co-localization with LAMP2. To assess cholesterol efflux from late endosomes, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with scavenger receptor A (SR-A) and incubated with [3H]cholesterol/acetyl low density lipoprotein (acLDL). Although ABCA1-dPEST showed higher cholesterol efflux than did ABCA1-wt following cell surface labeling ([3H]cholesterol/acLDL in the absence of SR-A co-transfection), it showed impaired cholesterol efflux after late endosomal labeling ([3H]cholesterol/acLDL in the presence of SR-A). Thus, deletion of the PEST sequence leads to a decrease in the internalization of ABCA1 and decreased cholesterol efflux from late endosomal cholesterol pools, providing evidence that the internalization and trafficking of ABCA1 is functionally important in mediating cholesterol efflux from intracellular cholesterol pools.

It is generally thought that ABCA1 functions on the cell surface as suggested by its plasma membrane localization and apoA-I binding (7Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

However, markedly defective cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in Niemann-Pick C1 macrophages, which are defective in lysosomal cholesterol trafficking, suggested that ABCA1 stimulates cholesterol efflux from a late endosomal/lysosomal pool (10Chen W.

Together these data suggested that trafficking of ABCA1 between the cell surface and late endosomes/lysosomes could be involved in cholesterol efflux. However, direct evidence that internalization of ABCA1 facilitates cholesterol efflux from intracellular sites is lacking. We recently described a cytoplasmic domain PEST sequence in ABCA1 and showed that the PEST sequence has a role in regulating ABCA1 protein turnover at least in part by promoting calpain degradation of ABCA1 (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In cells expressing a mutant form of ABCA1 in which the PEST sequence was deleted (ABCA1-dPEST) there was a striking increase in the cell surface concentration of ABCA1 without an increase in the overall level of ABCA1 in cell lysates. This suggested the possibility of a defect in the internalization of ABCA1-dPEST. In the current study we have confirmed the defective internalization of ABCA1-dPEST and have shown that the mutant has a parallel defect in mediating cholesterol efflux from cells after cholesterol is introduced into late endosomes/lysosomes via scavenger receptor A (SR-A). These studies provide evidence that ABCA1 internalization and trafficking to late endosomes is functionally important in mediating cholesterol efflux from this intracellular location. Materials—All of the cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen. Human apoA-I was commercially obtained (BioDesign). Acetyl low density lipoprotein (acLDL) was from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody were from Sigma. Mouse anti-human LAMP2 antibody, developed by Dr. J. T. August, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Plasmid Constructs and Internalization of Cell Surface ABCA1—C-terminally FLAG-tagged murine wild-type ABCA1 (ABCA1-wt) and ABCA1-dPEST plasmids were constructed as described previously (12Wang N.

Internalization of cell surface ABCA1 was monitored using a modification of the protocol described previously (14Michaely P. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34023-34031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly HEK293 cells transiently transfected with ABCA1-wt or ABCA1-dPEST were incubated with 10 μm monensin to prevent recycling of the internalized protein back to the plasma membrane. After the treatment, cells were cooled down on ice and then biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 50 min. After washing, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A; Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation, the supernatant of cell lysates was incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation and washing, the collected agarose beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The biotinylated ABCA1 was detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells transiently transfected with ABCA1-wt or ABCA1-dPEST in glass chamber slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with primary anti-FLAG and anti-LAMP2 antibodies (each at 1:200 dilution) in 2% milk/phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min. Alexa568- or -486-labeled secondary antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution. After washing and fixing, cells were examined by Zeiss LSM 510 META scanning confocal microscope. Cholesterol Labeling and Efflux Assays—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. One day before transfection, the cells were plated on 24-well plates. The next day, cells at about 85% confluence were transfected with 0.5 μg of ABCA1-wt or ABCA1-dPEST using Lipofectamine 2000. To label the late endosomal/lysosomal pool, cells were incubated for 4 h with cholesterol/acLDL (final concentration, 20 μg of acLDL/ml, 0.5 μCi/ml) in 0.1% BSA/DMEM under co-transfection of 0.5 μg of SR-A. To label the surface pool, cells were incubated with cholesterol/acLDL without SR-A co-transfection (i.e. with empty vector). After 4 h of labeling, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.1% BSA/DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min for equilibration. Cholesterol efflux was performed by incubating the cells with or without 10 μg/ml apoA-I in 0.1% BSA/DMEM for 4 h. After efflux, medium was collected and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min. Radioactivity in supernatant medium was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide and 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity was determined. Cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percentage of the radioactivity released from cells into the medium relative to the total radioactivity in cells and medium. Results were shown as net efflux (efflux with apoA-I minus efflux with 0.1% BSA alone). ApoA-I Cellular Association and Internalization—HEK293 cells transiently transfected with ABCA1-wt or ABCA1-dPEST were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml [125I]apoA-I (1750 cpm/ng) with or without 100 μg/ml apoA-I in 0.1% BSA/DMEM. The cells then were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm calcium chloride and 0.1% BSA. Cell association of [125I]apoA-I was measured as the cpm in total cell lysates. In parallel plates, following the 30-min incubation and washings, cells were returned to 37 °C and chased for 1 h in 0.1% BSA/DMEM. At the completion of the chase period, cells were washed and lysed. Residual [125I]apoA-I was measured as the cpm in the cell lysates. Internalization ratio (%) of [125I]apoA-I was calculated as the percentage of residual [125I]apoA-I/cell-associated [125I]apoA-I. We showed previously a prominent increase in the cell surface concentration of ABCA1-dPEST compared with ABCA1-wt (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Here we measured the internalization rate of ABCA1 by monitoring the disappearance of cell surface ABCA1 in transiently transfected HEK293 cells treated with monensin to block transporter recycling (14Michaely P. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34023-34031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The basal level of cell surface ABCA1 was increased for ABCA1-dPEST compared with ABCA1-wt, whereas total ABCA1 in cell lysates was similar for both forms, as reported previously (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although during 2 h of incubation in the presence of monensin, cell surface ABCA1-wt gradually decreased, there was little change in cell surface ABCA1-dPEST (Fig. 1A). Quantification of data from four experiments with a 2-h monensin incubation showed that cell surface ABCA1-wt decreased to 30% of the starting level (p < 0.001), whereas ABCA1-dPEST showed no change (375% of the starting ABCA1-wt level versus 415% after a 2-h monensin treatment, p > 0.05, n = 4) (Fig. 1B). The results indicate decreased internalization of ABCA1-dPEST. To evaluate the possibility that decreased internalization was secondary to an increase in the cell surface pool of ABCA1, we treated cells expressing ABCA1-wt with apoA-I. Previous data suggested that apoA-I increases the cell surface concentration of ABCA1 by decreasing calpain proteolysis (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although apoA-I treatment resulted in an increase in cell surface ABCA1-wt comparable with that observed for ABCA1-dPEST, there was no defect in the internalization of ABCA1-wt after the apoA-I treatment (Fig. 1C). This indicated that the defect in internalization of ABCA1-dPEST was not simply secondary to an increase in pool size. To further evaluate a possible defect in the internalization of ABCA1-dPEST, the cellular distribution of ABCA1-wt and ABCA1-dPEST was visualized directly by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. ABCA1-wt showed substantial co-localization with LAMP2 in late endosomes (Fig. 2A), as reported previously (11Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K.

In contrast, there was little co-localization of ABCA1-dPEST with LAMP2 and more prominent plasma membrane localization (Fig. 2B). A direct comparison of cellular distributions was also made using ABCA1-wt and ABCA1-dPEST labeled with different tags. Cells were co-transfected with ABCA1-wt (HA-tagged in the first extracellular loop) and ABCA1-dPEST (FLAG-tagged in the C terminus). ABCA1-wt (HA-tagged) showed both plasma membrane and intracellular localizations (Fig. 3A, green), whereas ABCA1-dPEST (FLAG-tagged) showed more prominent plasma membrane localization in the same cells (Fig. 3, B (red) and C (merge of A and B, yellow)). The different distribution of proteins was not due to the HA or FLAG tagging, as HA-tagged and FLAG-tagged ABCA1-wt constructs showed complete co-localization (Fig. 3, D-F). Incubation of ABCA1-wt or ABCA1-dPEST with apoA-I did not cause any change in their overall cellular distribution (not shown). Together these studies suggested a defect in internalization and endosomal trafficking of ABCA1-dPEST.Fig. 3Cellular localization of ABCA1-wt and ABCA1-dPEST. ABCA1-wt (HA-tagged in the first extracellular loop)- and ABCA1-dPEST (C-terminally FLAG-tagged)-co-transfected HEK293 cells were detected by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy following cell permeabilization and labeling with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, ABCA1-wt (HA-tagged, green); B, ABCA1-dPEST (FLAG-tagged, red); C, merge of A and B (yellow); D, ABCA1-wt (HA-tagged, green); E, ABCA1-wt (C-terminally FLAG-tagged, red); F, merge of D and E (yellow).

Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the functional consequences of these defects, we developed a method for cholesterol labeling of the late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol pool. SR-A is well known to bind and internalize modified LDL and deliver it to late endosomes/lysosomes (15Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). To label late endosomes/lysosomes, HEK293 cells transiently transfected with SR-A and ABCA1 (-wt or -dPEST) were loaded with cholesterol/acLDL, and then cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was measured (Fig. 4). Cells that were not transfected with SR-A (i.e. they received empty vector) were similarly incubated with cholesterol/acLDL (Fig. 4A). A time course study showed that following the latter procedure (cell surface labeling), ABCA1-dPEST gave rise to higher levels of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I than did ABCA1-wt (Fig. 4A), consistent with previous studies in which cells were labeled with cholesterol/10% fetal bovine serum or cholesterol/cyclodextrin (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, in cells labeled with cholesterol/acLDL and transfected with SR-A, the opposite result was obtained i.e. there was a defect in cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1-dPEST compared with that mediated by ABCA1-wt (Fig. 4B). To calculate the specific component of efflux attributable to expression of SR-A, the results in Fig. 4B were subtracted from those in Fig. 4A. This showed a major defect for ABCA1-dPEST compared with ABCA1-wt (Fig. 4C). Results from four different experiments in which efflux was measured during a constant time period (4 h) showed the same findings: ABCA1-dPEST showed increased cholesterol efflux from cell surface compared with that shown by ABCA1-wt (2.30 ± 0.18% (mean ± S.E.) versus 1.95 ± 0.18%, t test, p < 0.05, n = 4). However, there was impaired cholesterol efflux from the late endosomal/lysosomal pool in ABCA1-dPEST compared with that in ABCA1-wt (3.05 ± 0.68% versus 5.64 ± 0.94%, t test, p < 0.01, n = 4). ABCA1-dPEST showed only about 40% of SR-A-specific efflux to apoA-I compared with that shown by ABCA1-wt. Taken together the data suggested a major defect in cholesterol efflux from the late endosomal pool from ABCA1-dPEST. The results in Fig. 4 were not normalized for expression levels of ABCA1 protein. Thus, the experiment was repeated at the 4-h time point, and levels of ABCA1 protein were measured in the cell surface and in total cell lysates. Unexpectedly, SR-A co-transfection resulted in increased levels of both forms of ABCA1, especially in total cell lysates (Fig. 5A). Similar observations were made in five different experiments. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. However, as assessed by confocal microscopy, the cellular distribution patterns of ABCA1-wt and ABCA1-dPEST were not affected by SR-A expression (not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, when the efflux was expressed as cholesterol radioactivity in the medium, cholesterol efflux without SR-A co-transfection was higher for ABCA1-dPEST than for ABCA1-wt, whereas cholesterol efflux with SR-A was higher for ABCA1-wt than for ABCA1-dPEST (Fig. 5B). Normalization of efflux data for cell surface ABCA1 levels (Fig. 5C) or total levels of ABCA1 in cell lysates (not shown) showed that efflux for ABCA1-wt was markedly enhanced by SR-A, whereas efflux for ABCA1-dPEST was not changed by SR-A. This finding indicates that increased efflux by ABCA1-wt with SR-A is not due simply to increased levels of ABCA1 but likely reflects internalization and trafficking of ABCA1-wt to late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast, ABCA1-dPEST failed to show increased efflux in the presence of SR-A once data were normalized for protein expression levels, suggesting defective internalization and trafficking. It has been reported that apoA-I internalization and recycling is involved in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (16Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We measured cell-associated and residual [125I]apoA-I in cells after a 0.5-h incubation of [125I]apoA-I and a 1-h chase at 37 °C (Fig. 6). Consistent with increased cell surface expression of ABCA1-dPEST, there was increased cell association of [125I]apoA-I for cells expressing ABCA1-dPEST compared with those expressing ABCA1-wt; however, internalized [125I]apoA-I at the end of 1 h (residual) was less for cells expressing ABCA1-dPEST, consistent with decreased ABCA1-dependent internalization of [125I]apoA-I. The ratio of internalized ligand/cell-associated [125I]apoA-I can be used as a measure of internalization efficiency (17Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ratio, which should be independent of ABCA1 protein expression levels, showed a decrease for ABCA1-dPEST compared with ABCA1-wt, suggesting defective internalization of apoA-1 bound to ABCA1-dPEST. The two major classes of endosomal-lysosomal sorting signals for transmembrane proteins are referred to as “tyrosine-based” and “dileucine-based” motifs (18Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). No typical NPXY tyrosine-based motif is found within or around the PEST sequence. However, there is a putative dileucine-based motif near the PEST sequence (RETDLL, underlined; PEST sequence in capital letters): 1280sclhPFTEDDAVAPNDSDIDPESRETDlls1309. Deletion of the PEST sequence would disrupt this motif and affect the trafficking of ABCA1 if the motif were responsible for ABCA1 internalization. However, mutation of the LL motif to AA did not reproduce the ABCA1-dPEST phenotype (data not shown), suggesting that this motif is not responsible for internalization of ABCA1. Thus, the effects of deletion of the PEST sequence on the internalization of ABCA1 may be mediated indirectly. Several lines of evidence suggested previously that ABCA1 promotes cholesterol efflux from late endosomes and that trafficking of ABCA1 to this site may be involved in this process. In macrophages expressing similar amounts of ABCA1, there were 2-3-fold higher levels of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I following delivery of cholesterol in acLDL to late endosomes, compared with techniques that initially label predominantly the plasma membrane (cholesterol/fetal bovine serum or cholesterol/cyclodextrin) (10Chen W. Sun Y. Welch C. Gorelik A. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43564-43569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Also, Niemann-Pick C1-deficient cells in which there is defective release of cholesterol from late endosomes showed a severe defect in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (10Chen W. Sun Y. Welch C. Gorelik A. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43564-43569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Neufeld et al. (11Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) showed localization of ABCA1 to late endosomes and trafficking of ABCA1 between late endosomes and the cell surface. Moreover, Tangier disease fibroblasts showed an accumulation of cholesterol and Niemann-Pick C1 protein in late endosomes, leading to the suggestion that the trafficking of ABCA1 to late endosomes might be involved in cholesterol efflux from this location (19Neufeld E.B. Stonik J.A. Demosky Jr., S.J. Knapper C.L. Combs C.A. Cooney A. Comly M. Dwyer N. Blanchette-Mackie J. Remaley A.T. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, such co-localization studies do not prove that ABCA1 in late endosomes has a functional role. The present studies provide strong new evidence to support a functional role of ABCA1 in late endosomes by showing that a mutant ABCA1 with a defect in internalization from the cell surface also has a defect in cholesterol efflux after cholesterol labeling of late endosomes via SR-A. In contrast, the mutant shows higher cholesterol efflux after cell surface labeling, indicating specificity for the defect in late endosomal cholesterol efflux. The magnitude of the defect in late endosome cholesterol efflux (Figs. 4C and 5) represents a minimal estimate because movement of [3H]cholesterol between late endosomes and cell surface pools undoubtedly occurs during the SR-A-mediated [3H]cholesterol/acLDL uptake and labeling procedures. In studies carried out before the discovery of the role of ABCA1 in lipid efflux, Takahashi and Smith (16Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) showed that in macrophages treated with cAMP (which is now known to up-regulate ABCA1) apoA-I is cell-associated and re-secreted in increased amounts in association with increased cholesterol efflux. This suggested that cholesterol efflux involves a process of endocytosis and re-secretion of apoA-I (16Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), possibly in association with ABCA1. The decreased internalization efficiency of [125I]apoA-I in cells expressing ABCA1-dPEST is consistent with this hypothesis as are studies suggesting co-localization of ABCA1 and apoA-I in late endosomes (19Neufeld E.B. Stonik J.A. Demosky Jr., S.J. Knapper C.L. Combs C.A. Cooney A. Comly M. Dwyer N. Blanchette-Mackie J. Remaley A.T. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The PEST sequence in ABCA1 was originally identified as facilitating degradation of ABCA1 by calpain protease (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Calpain probably degrades ABCA1 at the plasma membrane. Thus, the primary defect causing increased cell surface concentration of ABCA1-dPEST is likely decreased calpain proteolysis. The defect in internalization could arise because of alteration of an internalization motif or saturation of the internalization machinery secondary to increased cell surface concentration. However, the second explanation seems unlikely as increased cell surface concentration of ABCA1-wt secondary to apoA-I treatment (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) did not result in a defect in internalization (Fig. 1C). The PEST sequence does not contain any classical internalization motifs (18Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Although it disrupts a putative dileucine-based motif, this was shown to be functionally unimportant. Thus, it seems likely that the effects of deleting the PEST sequence on the internalization of ABCA1 either involve a nonclassical signal within the PEST sequence or are mediated indirectly, e.g. secondary to a conformational change involving a distant internalization motif. The model suggested by our data is that in late endosomes cholesterol is released from degraded lipoproteins and deposited in the surrounding membrane. The activity of ABCA1 may serve to maintain a cholesterol gradient across the membrane. Although apoA-I can accept cholesterol from ABCA1 at the cell surface, it may also be internalized in association with ABCA1, picking up cholesterol in late endosomes followed by re-secretion from the cells. The latter could be a major pathway for ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophage foam cells."
https://openalex.org/W2158587776,"Docetaxel is one of the most active drugs used to treat breast cancer. The cellular target of docetaxel is the microtubule, specifically the beta-tubulin subunit, that comprises a series of isotypes and that can modulate function. This study has examined the role of alteration in beta-tubulin isotypes in vitro and has sequenced the beta-tubulin gene to determine if there were mutations, both of which may represent important mechanisms of acquired resistance to docetaxel. Breast cancer cells, MCF-7 (oestrogen-receptor positive) and MDA-MB-231, (oestrogen-receptor negative) were made resistant to docetaxel in vitro. Expression of beta-tubulin isotypes (class I, II, III, IVa, IVb, and VI) was determined at the RNA and protein level using RT-PCR and western analysis, respectively. DNA sequencing evaluated the beta-tubulin gene. At the mRNA level, class I, II, III, and IVa beta-tubulin mRNA isotypes were over-expressed in docetaxel-resistant MCF-7 cells when compared with the docetaxel-sensitive parental cells. However, class VI beta-tubulin mRNA isotype expression was decreased in resistant cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, there was a decrease in expression of the class I and class IVa beta-tubulin mRNA. However, there were increased expressions in class II, IVb, and VI beta-tubulin mRNA isotypes in resistant cells. Western analysis has confirmed corresponding increases in beta-tubulin protein levels in MCF-7 cells. However, in MDA-MB-231 cells, there were decreased protein levels for class II and class III beta-tubulin. This study demonstrates that altered expression of mRNA beta-tubulin isotypes and modulation of beta-tubulin protein levels are associated with acquired docetaxel resistance in breast cancer cells. This allows further understanding and elucidation of mechanisms involved in resistance to docetaxel."
https://openalex.org/W2080842591,"Cyclin D1 is postulated to be a target of the canonical Wnt pathway and critical for intestinal adenoma development. We show here that, unlike cyclin D1 reporter assays, endogenous cyclin D1 levels are not affected following antagonism of the Wnt pathway in vitro, nor is cyclin D1 immediately up-regulated following conditional loss of Apc in vivo. Cyclin D1 levels do, however, increase in a delayed manner in a small subset of cells, suggesting such up-regulation occurs as a secondary event. We also analyzed the immediate consequences of Apc loss in a cyclin D1-/- background and failed to find any cyclin D1-dependent phenotypes. However, we did observe elevated cyclin D1 expression in lesions developing 20 days after Apc loss. In these circumstances, all adenomas (but not smaller lesions) showed cyclin D1 up-regulation. Finally in a smaller study, we analyzed whether cyclin D1 deficiency affected adenoma formation 20 days following induced loss of Apc. Unlike AhCre+ Apcfl/fl mice (which all developed adenomas), doubly mutant AhCre+ Apcfl/fl cyclin D1-/- mice only developed small lesions. Taken together, this argues that cyclin D1 up-regulation in intestinal neoplasia is important for tumor progression rather than initiation.

The APC 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF, T cell factor; dnTCF, dominant negative TCF. 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF, T cell factor; dnTCF, dominant negative TCF. gene encodes the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein, germ line mutation of which characterizes familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal syndrome characterized by multiple colorectal lesions (1.Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Inactivation of APC is also recognized as a key early event in the development of sporadic colorectal cancers (2.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly clear that the mechanism by which Apc mediates tumor suppression is primarily by targeting β-catenin for degradation and thereby regulating Wnt signaling (3.Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). The immediate cellular consequences of Wnt deregulation include perturbed proliferation, migration, and differentiation in the murine small intestine (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 has been proposed as a Wnt target gene because β-catenin has been shown to regulate cyclin D1 in colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro (5.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar, 6.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, cyclin D1 overexpression has been observed in human colorectal cancers and in adenomas arising in the ApcMin/+ mouse (7.Arber N. Hibshoosh H. Moss S.F. Sutter T. Zhang Y. Begg M. Wang S. Weinstein I.B. Holt P.R. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 669-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8.Zhang T. Nanney L.B. Luongo C. Lamps L.

However, several recent transcriptome studies have failed to confirm cyclin D1 as an immediate target of perturbed Wnt signaling (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 9.van de Wetering M. Sancho E.

Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyclin D1 is not essential for the development of intestinal tumorigenesis because ApcMin/+ cyclin D1-/- mice still develop adenomas, albeit at a lower frequency (10.Wilding J. Straub J. Bee J. Churchman M. Bodmer W. Dickson C. Tomlinson I. Ilyas M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4562-4565PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Hulit J. Wang C. Li Z. Albanese C. Rao M. Di Vizio D. Shah S. Byers S.W. Mahmood R. Augenlicht L.H. Russell R. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7598-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, in some settings, loss of cyclin D1 can actually accelerate tumorigenesis (for example, following activation of β-catenin signaling within the mammary gland) (12.Hatsell S. Rowlands T. Hiremath M. Cowin P. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These studies have cast doubt on both the timing and significance of the up-regulation of cyclin D1 following loss of Apc. We have therefore investigated the up-regulation cyclin D1 in vivo following conditional loss of Apc and activation of β-catenin. Furthermore we have investigated the significance of loss of cyclin D1 to the early stages of intestinal tumorigenesis. Luciferase Reporter Assay—To measure TCF/β-catenin-driven transactivation, a luciferase reporter assay was performed using TCF reporter constructs TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH (9.van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). TOPFLASH contains TCF binding sites upstream of a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, driving luciferase. The control plasmid FOPFLASH carries mutated TCF binding sites. The cyclin D1 promoter constructs have been described previously and were a kind gift of Dr. F. McCormick (5.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, 250,000 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 500 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter and 50 ng of TKRenilla (Promega) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Expression of dnTCF was induced by the addition of doxycycline to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml (9.van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E.

Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) 24 h after induction. Cell Lines—All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Colorectal cancer cell lines carrying inducible dnTCF have been described previously (9.van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D.

In short, LS174T cells carrying mutated β-catenin and DLD1 cells carrying mutated APC were transfected with pCDNA6TR (Invitrogen). Stable clones with high levels of tetracycline repressor activity were subsequently transfected with pCDNA4TO-dnTCF1 or pCDNA4TO-dnTCF4 to generate inducible dnTCF cell lines. Maintenance and Induction of Cre Recombinase in Mice—All experiments were performed according to UK Home Office regulations. Mice were segregating for the C57BL6/J, 129/Ola, and C3H genomes at a ratio of 75%, 12.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. Siblings were used as controls. AhCre+ mice were intercrossed with mice carrying a LoxP-flanked Apc allele (Apc580s), Rosa 26 LacZ reporter allele (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E.

For induction of Cre recombinase, mice were given three intraperitoneal injections of 80 mg/kg β-napthoflavone and harvested 3, 4, and 5 days later. To achieve the later time points of 6 and 8 days, mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 80 mg/kg β-napthoflavone, which yielded levels of recombination of ∼30% (15.Ireland H. Kemp R. Houghton C. Howard L. Clarke A.R. Sansom O.J. Winton D.J. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1236-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To achieve adenoma formation, mice were fed a dietary supplement of 0.8 mg/ml β-napthoflavone for 3 days. This was then removed, and mice were left for 20 days or longer until they developed adenomas. LacZ wholemount staining was performed as described in Ireland et al. (15.Ireland H. Kemp R. Houghton C.

Immunohistochemistry—Cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry was performed using mouse monoclonal antibody DCS-6 at a dilution of 1:100 (Nova Castra), and antigen retrieval was performed using a high pH target retrieval solution from Dako at 99 °C for 30 min. β-Catenin immunohistochemistry was performed as described in Sansom et al.

Northern Blotting—Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on 1.25% agarose and transferred to Zeta-Probe Membrane (Bio-Rad). Loading was checked by EtBr staining. Hybridization was performed using ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (Clontech). Indicated probes were labeled using RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Assaying Apoptosis and Proliferation—Apoptosis was scored from hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections as previously described in Sansom et al. (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H.

Proliferation was scored through S phase labeling; mice received injection 2 h before harvesting with 0.25 ml of bromodeoxyuridine (Amersham Biosciences), and bromodeoxyuridine immunohisto-chemistry was performed (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Wnt Signaling Does Not Cause Reduction in Endogenous Levels of Cyclin D1 in Vitro—Previous studies by Tetsu and McCormick (5.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar) and Shtutman et al. (6.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar) have proposed cyclin D1 as a direct Wnt target gene within colorectal cancer cell lines. However, both of these studies used promoter reporter constructs to measure increases in cyclin D1 rather than examining endogenous cyclin D1 expression. To directly test whether results from these promoter reporter constructs reflect regulation of the gene by β-catenin, we studied endogenous cyclin D1 levels and two cyclin D1 luciferase reporters following inhibition of β-catenin signaling. This was achieved using colorectal cancer cell lines LS174T and DLD1 (which express an active mutant β-catenin protein and a truncated APC protein, respectively) and carry doxycycline-inducible expression plasmids encoding N-terminally truncated versions of TCFs. These dnTCF proteins act as potent inhibitors of the endogenous β-catenin/TCF-driven transactivation present in colorectal cancer (9.van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that following induction of dnTCF4 or dnTCF1, there is an inhibition of β-catenin signaling that induces a rapid cell cycle arrest and down-regulation of a number of Wnt target genes including MYC, BMP4, and EPHB3. However, no changes in levels of cyclin D1 RNA were detectable in either cell line 24 h following induction of either dnTCF1 or dnTCF4 (Fig. 1A). Using the same two cyclin D1 promoter reporter constructs (-1748CD1) and (-962CD1) used by Tetsu and McCormick (5.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar), luciferase activity was measured following dnTCF4 induction in LS174T cells. Unlike endogenous levels of cyclin D1, which stay constant, an inhibition of cyclin D1 promoter activity as measured by both reporter constructs was observed following dnTCF4 induction (Fig. 1B). Cyclin D1 Is Not Immediately Up-regulated following Apc Loss in Vivo—Given the failure to see up-regulation of endogenous cyclin D1 in vitro, we next investigated the consequences of Wnt deregulation upon cyclin D1 levels in vivo. To achieve this, a Cre-Lox-based murine system was used to delete Apc in the adult murine intestine. In this system, deletion of Apc is mediated by exposure to β-napthoflavone, which induces expression of Cre recombinase through activation of a CYP1A1 promoter (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In conjunction with an Apc allele carrying LoxP sites flanking exon 14 (Apc580s) (18.Galceran J. Hsu S.C. Grosschedl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8668-8673Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this allows inducible inactivation of Apc. This system delivers near 100% recombination of the target allele in adult murine small intestine (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). We have previously performed a microarray to analyze the expression profiles of adult small intestine tissues 4 and 5 days following the loss of Apc (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). This analysis failed to reveal an up-regulation of cyclin D1 at either time point. Unlike β-catenin, which was nuclear in every cell (Fig. 2, A and B, inset), immunohistochemical analysis of cyclin D1 at 4, 6, and 8 days following Apc loss in AhCre+ Apcfl/fl mice (Fig. 2, A-D) showed up-regulation in only a small number of cells at the leading edge of the phenotypic abnormalities, where Apc-deficient cells are directly juxtaposed to Apc-positive cells on the villus (see Sansom et al. (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) for Apc staining). Cyclin D1 Deficiency Does Not Alter the Immediate Phenotypes of Apc Deficiency in Vivo—The failure to see up-regulation of cyclin D1 raised the possibility that early phenotypes associated with Apc deficiency are cyclin D1-independent. Previously, we have shown that conditional deletion of Apc in the murine small intestine leads to marked increases in crypt size, proliferation (as determined through bromodeoxyuridine incorporation), and apoptosis, together with an abrogation of migration and differentiation (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). We therefore intercrossed cyclin D1-deficient mice with AhCre+ Apcfl/fl mice to investigate whether cyclin D1 deficiency modified any of these immediate phenotypes. Fig. 3 shows that cyclin D1 deficiency did not rescue the increase in crypt size, the enhanced and position-independent proliferation, or the induction of apoptosis seen following Apc loss. These features are therefore all independent of cyclin D1. Hulit et al. (11.Hulit J. Wang C. Li Z. Albanese C. Rao M. Di Vizio D. Shah S. Byers S.W. Mahmood R. Augenlicht L.H. Russell R. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7598-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have recently reported that ApcMin/+ mice show a relative deficiency of goblet cells and that cyclin D1 deficiency restores the goblet cell number to wild type levels. We have previously shown that in the absence of Apc, there is a complete block on goblet cell differentiation (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether this phenotype could be rescued by cyclin D1 deficiency. However, no Alcian blue staining was observed in the AhCre+ Apcfl/fl cyclin D1-/- crypts, showing that rescue was not occurring. This failure to restore goblet cell differentiation presumably reflects a dose dependence, with hemizygosity for Apc in the previous study leading to perturbed rather then blocked differentiation, a state that can be rescued by cyclin D1 deficiency. Cyclin D1 Is Up-regulated in All Adenomas and Required for Efficient Adenoma Formation—Because studies have shown that cyclin D1 is up-regulated in adenomas arising in the ApcMin/+ mouse, we next investigated the profile of cyclin D1 up-regulation in a range of lesions. To achieve this, we modified our Cre induction procedure so that mice were fed with a dietary supplement of 0.8 mg/ml β-napthoflavone for 3 days. This causes a lower level of Cre-mediated recombination (Fig 4, A-K). Within the smaller number of recombined crypts, this protocol leads to an identical phenotype at day 4 to that observed following high efficiency recombination (i.e. perturbed differentiation and migration as described above). Importantly, this lower recombination protocol allowed the development of a range of intestinal lesions and adenomas 20 days after induction in AhCre+ Apcfl/fl mice (Fig. 4, C-F). This spectrum of lesions observed at this time point was similar to those we have classified previously from the ApcMin/+ mouse (16.Kongkanuntn R. Bubb V.J. Sansom O.J. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. Clarke A.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7219-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), ranging from a single dysplastic crypt to adenomas. This range of lesion types developing within an individual mouse allowed us to profile the pattern of cyclin D1 up-regulation. Fig. 4, G-J, shows the pattern of cyclin D1 expression in the different lesion types observed in AhCre+ Apcfl/fl 20 days after induction of Cre recombinase. Small lesions (n = 30; Fig. 4, G and H) showed a similar pattern of cyclin D1 up-regulation to the Apc-deleted intestine at days 4–8, with a small number of cells up-regulating cyclin D1. All adenomas (n = 10) showed up-regulation of cyclin D1 in virtually all the epithelial cells (Fig. 4J). Finally, to test whether this up-regulation of cyclin D1 was important for efficient tumorigenesis, we investigated adenoma formation in AhCre+ Apcfl/fl cyclin D1-/- mice 20 days after induction. All AhCre+ Apcfl/fl cyclin D1+/+ mice developed a minimum of 20 adenomas within this time period (n = 8; Fig. 4C); however, none of the AhCre+ Apcfl/fl cyclin D1-/- mice developed adenomas over the 20-day period. Instead, AhCre+ Apcfl/fl cyclin D1-/- mice developed much smaller lesions (no greater than 1 mm in diameter) over this time period that were only able to be visualized on wholemount sections due to the presence of the Rosa 26 R LacZ reporter (Fig. 4K). Cyclin D1 Is Not an Immediate Wnt Target Gene in Vitro or in Vivo—Our failure to see changes in endogenous cyclin D1 levels both in vitro and in vivo indicates that cyclin D1 is not an immediate target gene of β-catenin. This contrasts with data obtained using cyclin D1 reporter constructs in the same cells in vitro, indicating that strategies reliant solely on reporter construct assays do not always accurately reflect changes in endogenous gene expression levels and so may lead to an over-estimation of the number of direct Wnt target genes. The definitive evidence that cyclin D1 is not an immediate target gene came from the in vivo data, in which cyclin D1 was up-regulated in a delayed manner in a small subset of Apc-deficient cells that juxtaposed wild type cells. Notably, up-regulation of cyclin D1 has previously been reported within the leading edge of human colorectal adenocarcinomas (17.Jung A. Schrauder M. Oswald U. Knoll C. Sellberg P. Palmqvist R. Niedobitek G. Brabletz T. Kirchner T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1613-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the additional factors required to up-regulate cyclin D1 may derive from the interaction between wild type and Apc-deficient cells. This contrasts with a number of immediate Wnt target genes (such as C-MYC and CD44) that we have previously shown to be up-regulated coincidentally with nuclear relocalization of β-catenin (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). A number of genes such as brachyury have been shown to require TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor signaling for maintenance rather than initiation of expression (18.Galceran J. Hsu S.C. Grosschedl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8668-8673Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 may fit into this class of genes that has TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor binding sites but requires other factors to initiate expression because dysregulation of β-catenin expression per se is not enough to immediately up-regulate cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 Is Important for Efficient Adenoma Formation— Unlike the very early stages of intestinal tumorigenesis, we found that cyclin D1 was up-regulated in all the adenomas of AhCre+ Apcfl/fl mice. This consolidates previous data showing up-regulation of cyclin D1 in adenomas from the ApcMin/+ mouse and also implicates cyclin D1 in tumor growth rather than initiation. Our failure to find any adenomas in the AhCre+ Apcfl/fl cyclin D1-/- mice at 20 days is also strongly consistent with the notion that cyclin D1 is required for efficient intestinal tumorigenesis. However, cyclin D1 deficiency slows rather than stops this process, and it seems likely that the numerous small lesions in the double-null mice may progress to adenomas, albeit in a delayed time frame. This interpretation is consistent with the documented reduction of adenoma formation in ApcMin/+ cyclin D1-/- mice (10.Wilding J. Straub J. Bee J. Churchman M. Bodmer W. Dickson C. Tomlinson I. Ilyas M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4562-4565PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Hulit J. Wang C. Li Z. Albanese C. Rao M. Di Vizio D. Shah S. Byers S.W. Mahmood R. Augenlicht L.H. Russell R. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7598-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and also with the delayed and lesion-specific pattern of cyclin D1 up-regulation reported here. Single knockouts of cyclin D1, D2, and D3 show very restricted abnormalities and are characterized by up-regulation of the other family members (19.Ciemerych M.A. Kenney A.M. Sicinska E. Kalaszczynska I. Bronson R.T. Rowitch D.H. Gardner H. Sicinski P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3277-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In contrast, when mice are generated with only one functional cyclin D family member, this leads to early mortality due to localized abnormalities in tissues unable to up-regulate the remaining cyclin D family member. Indeed our array analysis has indicated that cyclin D2 is immediately up-regulated following Apc loss (4.Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that the Pitx-2 transcription factor, which controls cyclin D2 expression, is activated by Wnt signaling (20.Briata P. Ilengo C. Corte G. Moroni C. Rosenfeld M.G. Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21.Kioussi C. Briata P. Baek S.H. Rose D.W. Hamblet N.S. Herman T. Ohgi K.A. Lin C. Gleiberman A. Wang J. Brault V. Ruiz-Lozano P. Nguyen H.D. Kemler R. Glass C.K. Wynshaw-Boris A. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 111: 673-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Given this possible up-regulation of cyclin D2, our data therefore suggest that therapies targeted against the cyclin D proteins should not be restricted to cyclin D1 alone. Taken together, our data indicate that cyclin D1 is not a direct target of Wnt signaling and that cyclin D1 is not important for the very early stages of intestinal tumorigenesis. Indeed, a recent study has also shown that cyclin D1 is not up-regulated in all intestinal cells following Apc loss (22.Andreu P. Colnot S. Godard C. Gad S. Chafey P. Niwa-Kawakita M. Laurent-Puig P. Kahn A. Robine S. Perret C. Romagnolo B. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, deficiency of cyclin D1 does not modify any of the immediate phenotypes associated with Apc loss. However, it is clear that cyclin D1 does become rapidly deregulated as a secondary event and that cyclin D1 status is an important factor in adenoma establishment and growth.

Four proteins are in the focus of recent investigation, namely the bacterial outer membrane proteins Omp85 and ShlB, the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tob55/Sam50, and the chloroplast outer envelope protein Toc75. ShlB is an outer membrane protein involved in the secretion of hemolysins or adhesins in various Gram-negative pathogens (8.Schiebel E. Schwarz H. Braun V. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 853-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Omp85 is an essential component for outer membrane biogenesis in Neisseria meningitidis that might have two functions: the assembly of outer membrane proteins (5.Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and the translocation of lipids (10.Genevrois S. Steeghs L. Roholl P. Letesson J.J. van der Ley P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discussed that the effect on lipid transfer by Omp85 depletion might be indirect and explained by an assembly defect of the required outer membrane protein, suggesting a function of Omp85 in outer membrane protein assembly only (11.Voulhoux R. Tommassen J. Res. Microbiol. 2004; 155: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As for ShlB, a β-barrel transmembrane structure was suggested for Omp85 (5.Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Recently, a new polypeptide-transporting protein was identified in the outer membrane of mitochondria and termed Sam50 (3.Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B.

The fourth investigated β-barrel-type polypeptide transporter is the 75-kDa subunit of the translocon of the outer envelope of chloroplasts, Toc75. Toc75 forms a complex with Toc34, Toc64, and Toc159 (16.Soll J. Schleiff E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other identified polypeptide transporters, such as Omp85, the translocation of proteins through Toc75 requires the action of assisting proteins, such as Toc159 (17.Schleiff E. Jelic M. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but still Toc75 seems to contain a preprotein-binding site as determined by electrophysiological measurements (1.Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Topological modeling of Toc75 from Pisum sativum (18.Sveshnikova N. Grimm R. Soll J.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggests a β-barrel-type structure. Previously, it was proposed that Toc75 might have evolved from the ShlB (20.Bölter B.

Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). This relationship to prokaryotic proteins is in line with the theory that chloroplasts have evolved from the ancestor of cyanobacteria (22.Martin W. Rujan T. Richly E. Hansen A. Cornelsen S. Lins T.

To understand the evolutionary relationship between Toc75 and alr 2269, we investigated the specific properties of the two proteins. We here present experimental evidence that the N-terminal domain of β-barrel-type polypeptide transporters is involved in the recognition of substrates and complex assembly, whereas the C-terminal domain assembles the poreforming β-barrel.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was used as the template for the generation of psA, psB, psC, and psD (Fig. 1) by PCR. The alr2269 cDNA was amplified from genomic Nostoc PCC7120 DNA. Constructs were generated by PCR, cloned into pTrcHis2 TOPO® TA (Invitrogen), and controlled by sequencing. BL21 cells (Novagen) transformed with plasmids were incubated in LB medium at 37 °C, and expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction and lysed using a French press (at 40 megapascals) in 50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). Full-length proteins and C-terminal constructs (Fig. 1D) were accumulated in inclusion bodies. After centrifugation for 15 min at 25,000 × g at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm NaPi, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, and 5 m urea. The solution was centrifuged at 20,000 revolutions/min for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was subjected to nickel-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the protein was purified according to the manual. Soluble fragments (Figs. 1D and 2A) were loaded onto nickel-agarose after centrifugation of lysed cells for 15 min at 25.000 × g at 4 °C. After purification, proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm NaPi, pH8, 100 mm NaCl. Their concentration was determined by Lowry analysis. The rapid translation system RTS 100 Escherichia coli HY Kit (Roche Applied Science) was used for in vitro translation. Antibodies against alr2269 were produced as previously described (1.Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Fig. 2The preprotein-binding region of psToc75. A, purified proteins representing the N-terminal region of psToc75 (lanes 1–4) or alr2269 (lanes 5–8) were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For purity control, 1 μl(lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or 5 μlof the indicated protein (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) were loaded. B, the far UV CD spectrum of anaA (1 μm, gray line) or anaB (5 μm, black line) was recorded as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, pOE23 (lanes 1–3) or mSSU (lanes 4–6) were coupled to Toyopearl in equal molar amounts, as described, and incubated with 35S-labeled psA (upper panel) or psB (lower panel). A 20% translation product is shown (TP). Flow-through (F, lanes 1 and 4), wash (W, lanes 2 and 5), and elution (E, lanes 3 and 6) were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive labeled proteins were visualized. D, pOE23 (lanes 1–3), mSSU (lanes 4–6), or pOE33 (lanes 7–9) were coupled to Toyopearl (lanes 10–12) in equal molar amounts and incubated with expressed psA (L, upper panel) or psB (L, lower panel). Flow-through (F, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), wash (W, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11), and elution (E, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. E, the transit peptide of pSSU is shown as a bar diagram, and the positions of the synthetic peptides (E2, black; A1, white; B2, gray) are indicated. F, psB (1 μg) was incubated with A1 (lane 2)-, B2 (lane 3)-, E2 (lane 4)-, or bovine serum albumin (lane 5)-charged affinity matrix (charging was controlled by absorption spectroscopy of the flowthrough). Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunodecoration using αToc75 antibodies. 10% input is shown (lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell Fractionation of Nostoc PCC7120 —Nostoc PCC7120 was grown photoautotrophically at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (26.Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) under constant illumination at 70 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 with aeration by air containing 1% CO2. Cells were harvested at OD750 = 1.0 by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min and then washed and lysed by French press at 40 megapascals. Broken cells were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 55% sucrose solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Floating sucrose density gradients were prepared by overlaying the cell/sucrose mixture with 40, 30, and 10% sucrose solutions and centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Plasma membrane, thylakoid membrane, and outer membrane were collected, diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and collected by centrifugation at 380,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and resuspended and stored at –20 °C. Binding Analysis—The peptides A1, B2, and E2 were synthesized at the Department of Peptide and Protein Chemistry, Charite (Berlin, Germany). Binding experiments using nickel-agarose or Toyopearl-AF-Tresyl 650 m (TosoHaas Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were performed as described previously (24.Schleiff E. Motzkus M. Soll J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25.Becker T. Jelic M. Vojta A. Radunz A. Soll J. Schleiff E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here, for one experiment similar molar amounts of preproteins (Fig. 2), synthetic peptides (Fig. 2), or constructs of alr2269 or Toc75 (Figs. 3 and 4) were coupled to the material. The coupled amount was controlled by adding defined amounts for coupling and analyzing the concentration of proteins or peptides in the flow-through not associated with the matrix. For cross-linking analysis, wheat germ-translated 35S-labeled pSSU was incubated with psToc75 or alr2269 constructs at 1 μm in 50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl in 50 μl of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (1 mm final, BS3; Perbio, Bonn, Germany) was added and quenched after 45 min of incubation at 4 °C by the addition of glycine (100 mm final). The binding efficiency was determined using AIDA software, expressed to the percent of loaded material and normalized to the indicated binding reaction.Fig. 4The N-terminal domain of the proteins is involved in complex formation. A, 35S-labeled Toc34ΔTM was incubated with psA, psB (upper panel), anaA, or anaB (lower part) coupled to Ni-NTA. Flow-through (FT, lanes 2 and 4) and elution (E, lane 3, 5) were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity-visualized. 100% of the translation product is shown (TP, lane 1). B, interaction between the fragments of psToc75 or alr2269 and Toc34ΔTM was quantified and normalized to the interaction efficiency of psA and Toc34ΔTM. The average of at least three experiments is shown. C, 35S-labeled pSSU was incubated with psA (lanes 1–3) or anaA (lanes 4–6) coupled to Ni-NTA in the presence of expressed Toc34ΔTM (T34, lanes 2 and 5) or the transit peptide of pSSU (P, lanes 3 and 6). Bound protein was collected and visualized by phosphorimaging. 100% of the translation product is shown (TP). D, 35S-labeled anaA was incubated with psA, psB (upper panel), anaA, or anaB (lower panel) coupled to Ni-NTA (empty). Flow-through (FT, lanes 2, 4, and 6) and elution (E, lanes 3, 5, and 7) were collected and radioactivity-visualized. 100% of the translation product is shown (TP, lane 1). E, the interaction between the fragments of psToc75 or alr2269 and anaA (black bars) or anaB (gray bars) was quantified and normalized to the interaction efficiency of anaA dimerization. The average of at least three experiments is shown. F, a model of the interacting regions and the recognized targets for alr2269 and psToc75 is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Liposome Swelling Assay and Transport-specific Fractionation—Lipids for reconstitution were supplied by Nutfield Nurseries (Surrey, UK). Liposomes were prepared and proteins were reconstituted as described previously (17.Schleiff E. Jelic M. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The insertion was controlled by extraction. Swelling analysis was performed as previously established (27.Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of NaCl or sucrose were added into liposome-containing solution, and the optical density at 500 nm (Fig. 5, B and C) or the integral of the optical density between 400–700 nm (D and E) was determined. Transport-specific fractionation was previously described (28.Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For visualization, 0.1 mol % of rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Inc., Alabaster) was added to the lipid mixture. Bioinformatic Tools—The alignment was conducted using ClustalW at the BCM search launcher server (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/multi-align/multi-align.html) and visualized with Boxshade 3.21 (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). Electrophysiological Measurements—Mega-9 (80 mm final) was added to purified psC, alr2269 or anaC. l-α-phosphatidylcholine (type IV-S, Sigma) was dissolved in 80 mm Mega-9, 10 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0). Both samples were mixed (1 mg of protein/20 mg of lipid) and dialyzed against 2 liters of 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, for 2 h at 25 °C and subsequently overnight at 4 °C. Planar lipid bilayers were produced using the painting technique (29.Mueller P. Rudin D. Tien R. Westcott W.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1963; 67: 534-535Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A solution of 75 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylcholine in n-decan was applied to a hole in a Teflon septum, separating the two 3-ml chambers. To form a stable bilayer in 20 mm KCl, the 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, solution level was raised and lowered several times. The solution of the cis chamber was then exchanged to 250 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.0. Proteoliposomes were added to the cis chamber below the bilayer to allow the flow of the liposomes across the bilayer. The solution in the cis chamber was stirred to promote fusion. After fusion, the electrolytes in both compartments were changed to the final composition. Silver/AgCl electrodes were connected to the chambers through 2 m KCl-agar bridges. The electrode of the trans compartment was connected directly to the head stage of a current amplifier (GeneClamp500B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The amplified currents were recorded using the pCLAMP9 software (Axon Instruments). Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in 1-nm steps for 2 s of integration time, and a slit width of 2 nm in 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl on a Jobin Yvon CD6 spectrometer (Division d'Instruments, SA) at 22 °C using a cuvette with a 1-mm path length. 15 spectra were recorded and averaged. The rough data were further manipulated as described previously (30.Schleiff E. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13043-13051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previously, the protein slr1227 from Synechocystis PCC6803 was described as a protein related to Toc75 (20.Bölter B. Soll J. Schulz A. Hinnah S. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15831-15836Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21.Reumann S. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). More recently, it was proposed that the Nostoc gene complement is most closely related to that of the ancestor of plastids based on the analysis of Nostoc punctiforme (22.Martin W. Rujan T. Richly E. Hansen A. Cornelsen S. Lins T. Leister D. Stoebe B. Hasegawa M. Penny D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12246-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). To understand the evolutionary development of the polypeptide-transporting β-barrel protein Toc75, we wanted to compare the properties of psToc75 from P. sativum and a protein of the genus Nostoc. We therefore analyzed the genome of the two species N. punctiforme and Nostoc PCC7120 for the presence of a homologue of the polypeptide transporters Omp85 from N. meningitidis (5.Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and psToc75 (1.Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (supplemental figure, panel A). We identified two proteins related to psToc75/Omp85, namely Npun02006512 and alr2269. Sequence alignment of these two proteins revealed a sequence identity of 71% (supplemental figure). Because the two proteins identified from species N. punctiforme and Nostoc PCC7120 share such high identity, it is reasonable to use the protein encoded by the Nostoc PCC7120 gene alr2269 for further analysis (Fig. 1A). The protein encoded by alr2269 shares 19.4% identity and 29.3% similarity with psToc75 and 15.8% identity and 25.9% similarity with nmOmp85. The similarity in regard to the proposed topologies of the proteins is very high (Fig. 1D) (5.Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 19.Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to alr2269, two further homologues to psToc75 and Omp85 can be found in the Nostoc PCC7120 proteome, namely alr4893 and alr0075 (31.Moslavac S. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Soll J. von Haeseler A. Schleiff E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32.Inoue K. Potter D. Plant J. 2004; 39: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The two latter proteins are shorter than Omp85 with predicted molecular mass values of 72 and 54 kDa, respectively. Further, these two gene products are not as similar to psToc75 and Omp85 as alr2269 (not shown). Finally, in mass spectrometric analysis of outer membranes, only alr2269 could be detected (33.Moslavac S. Bredemeier R. Mirus O. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. Schleiff E. J. Proteome Res. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we have focused in this study on the analysis of alr2269. The existence of the coding RNA was demonstrated by reverse transcription-mediated PCR (Fig. 1B). Immunodecoration of isolated fractions of Nostoc PCC7120 shows that the protein encoded by alr2269 is localized in the outer membrane (Fig. 1C, lane 3), but not in the thylakoid membrane (lane 1) or plasma membrane (lane 2). Topological modeling of alr2269 (Fig. 1D) revealed two dominant regions, an N-terminal mostly soluble part and a C-terminal portion mostly involved in transmembrane β-strand formation. The localization of the domains in regard to the two sides of the membrane cannot be defined, because further experimental data have to be accumulated, as has been done for Toc75 (18.Sveshnikova N. Grimm R. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19.Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To test the predicted domain architecture, we constructed mutants of psToc75 and alr2269 comprising specific sections of these proteins. The first mutant (referred to as A in Fig. 1D, aa 161–470 of alr2269 and aa 149–440 of psToc75, empty box and box with bricks) was chosen in regard to the proposed polypeptide transport-associated domain (POTRA) (34.Sanchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Genevrois S. Vicente M. Valencia A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 523-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The domain does not include the previously predicted transit peptide of psToc75 ending at amino acid 131 (35.Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). AnaB (aa 388–470) or psB (aa 365–440) (Fig. 1D, box with bricks) covers the third loop region in the topological model. The third construct (referred to as C in Fig. 1D, aa 469–833 of alr2269 and aa 439–809 of psToc75, box with crossed lines and box with transversal lines) represents the entire postulated pore-forming region (5.Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 19.Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The last mutant (referred to as D in Fig. 1D, aa 702–833 of alr2269 and aa 678–809 of psToc75, box with transversal lines) reflects the region with high similarity among the polypeptide transporters containing two structural motifs and eight proposed β-strands (31.Moslavac S. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Soll J. von Haeseler A. Schleiff E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The generated constructs of the N-terminal region (Fig. 1D, constructs A and B) were expressed in E. coli and purified as soluble proteins to high homogeneity (Fig. 2A). The constructs C and D (in Fig. 5A) were expressed as insoluble proteins and purified under denaturing conditions. To confirm the structural content of the N-terminal constructs CD spectroscopy was performed. All N-terminal constructs showed a defined spectrum in the far UV region (Fig. 2B) (not shown for psA and psB), accounting for a secondary structure content (30.Schleiff E. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13043-13051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using a simple approach for the estimation of the secondary structure content (30.Schleiff E. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13043-13051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36.Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar), we observed that the A constructs contained both helical (∼50%) and β-sheet (∼20%) content, whereas for the B constructs only helical content could be determined (∼65%). From the obtained result, we concluded that the soluble expressed N-terminal constructs can be used for in vitro interaction analysis in solution. psToc75 Contains an N-terminal Preprotein-binding Domain—Previously, it was suggested that psToc75 interacts with the transit peptide of chloroplast preproteins (1.Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We now investigated whether the N-terminal region of psToc75 could mediate this interaction. When a matrix charged with the precursor of the subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex of 23 kDa (pOE23) was incubated with radioactive labeled psA or psB (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6) or 2-fold molar excess of psA or psB (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–9), both domains of psToc75 were associated with the matrix charged with the preprotein (Fig. 2C, lane 3; 2D, lanes 3 and 9) but not with the empty matrix or a matrix charged with the mature form of the small subunit of Rubisco (Fig. 2C, lane 6; 2D, lanes 6 and 12). Interestingly, the results for the qualitative (radioactive labeled psToc75 constructs; Fig. 2C) or quantitative approach (expressed psToc75 constructs; Fig. 2D) are comparable. In addition, the two psToc75 constructs associated in a similar quantitative manner with the precursor of the 33- or 23-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (pOE33/23) (Fig. 2D, lane 9). These results suggest that psToc75 contains a transit peptide-binding site in its N-terminal region. To confirm this notion, synthetic peptides representing the transit sequence of the model preprotein pSSU were coupled to an affinity matrix. Here, the E2 peptide"

The V-ATPases are composed of a peripheral domain (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and an integral domain (V0) that conducts protons. Dissociation of V1 and V0 is an important mechanism of controlling V-ATPase activity in vivo. The crystal structure of subunit C of the V-ATPase reveals two globular domains connected by a flexible linker (Drory, O., Frolow, F., and Nelson, N. (2004) EMBO Rep. 5, 1-5). Subunit C is unique in being released from both V1 and V0 upon in vivo dissociation. To localize subunit C within the V-ATPase complex, unique cysteine residues were introduced into 25 structurally defined sites within the yeast C subunit and used as sites of attachment of the photoactivated sulfhydryl reagent 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone (MBP). Analysis of photocross-linked products by Western blot reveals that subunit E (part of V1) is in close proximity to both the head domain (residues 166-263) and foot domain (residues 1-151 and 287-392) of subunit C. By contrast, subunit G (also part of V1) shows cross-linking to only the head domain whereas subunit a (part of V0) shows cross-linking to only the foot domain. The localization of subunit C to the interface of the V1 and V0 domains is consistent with a role for this subunit in controlling assembly of the V-ATPase complex.

V-ATPases present in intracellular compartments function in such processes as receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular targeting, protein processing and degradation, coupled transport of small molecules and ions, and the entry of certain viruses and toxins from endocytic compartments into cells (1Nishi T.

The V-ATPases are composed of a peripheral V1 domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and an integral V0 domain that carries out proton translocation (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

V1 is a 600-650-kDa complex with the subunit composition A3B3C1D1E1F1G2H1-2 (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 2Inoue T.

The nucleotide binding sites are located at the interface of the A and B subunits (which form an alternating hexamer), with the catalytic sites located mainly on the A subunit and “non-catalytic” sites located mainly on the B subunit (12Liu Q.

The three proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) each contain a buried glutamic acid residue that is essential for proton transport (16Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The V-ATPases thus resemble the F-ATPases (or ATP synthases), which are involved in ATP synthesis (18Weber J. Senior A.E.

It is rotation of the ring of proteolipid c subunits relative to subunit a that is believed to drive proton transport (19Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Comparison of amino acid sequences of the V- and F-ATPases reveals clear sequence homology both between the nucleotide binding subunits and between the proteolipid subunits of the two classes (33Zimniak L.

Because there is virtually no sequence similarity for the remaining subunits, it has not been possible to deduce the function or localization of the remaining V-ATPase subunits from their primary sequence. Electron microscopy studies indicate that like the F-ATPases (35Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the V-ATPases also contain multiple stalks connecting the peripheral and integral domains (36Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J.

To determine the composition of the central and peripheral stalks of the V-ATPase, we have previously employed cysteine mutagenesis and photochemical cross-linking using MBP to determine the arrangement of subunits relative to subunit B (39Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that subunit D is located in the central stalk whereas subunits E and G form part of the peripheral stalk connecting V1 and V0. These assignments have been confirmed by rotation experiments demonstrating that subunits D and F are present in the central rotor (41Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2312-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) whereas subunit G is located in the peripheral stator (42Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G.-H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23714-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used a similar photochemical cross-linking approach to localize subunit C within the V-ATPase complex. This subunit is of particular interest because of its putative role in regulating dissociation of the V-ATPase complex in vivo (43Curtis K.K. Francis S.A. Oluwatosin Y. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8979-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Dissociation of V1 and V0 represents an important mechanism of controlling V-ATPase activity in cells (44Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Early F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and occurs with release of subunit C from both the V1 and V0 domains. Subunit C has therefore been suggested to function in triggering dissociation of the V-ATPase in vivo (43Curtis K.K. Francis S.A. Oluwatosin Y. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8979-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The availability of a recently published high resolution crystal structure of subunit C (46Drory O. Frolow F. Nelson N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has allowed us to introduce unique cysteine residues into structurally defined sites within this protein. The results have identified specific contacts between subunit C and other subunits present in the peripheral stalk of the V-ATPase and are consistent with a role for subunit C in controlling the stability of the interactions between the V1 and V0 domains. Materials and Strains—Zymolyase 100T was purchased from Seikagaku America, Inc. Concanamycin A was obtained from Fluka Chemical Corp. 9-Amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. SDS, nitrocellulose membranes (0.45-μm pore size), Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Bio-Rad. 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone (MBP) and most common chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The yeast strain lacking subunit C (Vma5p) was constructed from YPH500 by replacing the VMA5 gene with the TRP1 gene (47Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The strain was first selected on tryptophan-minus plates and the growth phenotype was then assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibodies 3F10 (against the HA antigen) with and without conjugation to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Roche Applied Sciences. The monoclonal antibody 10D7 against the 100 kDa a subunit was from Molecular Probes. The polyclonal antibody against subunit E (Vma4p) was a gift from Dr. Daniel Klionsky (University of Michigan). The polyclonal antibody against subunit G (Vma10p) was a gift from Dr. Tom Stevens (University of Oregon). Cloning of the VMA5 Gene Encoding Subunit C—The VMA5 gene was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from the yeast strain YPH500 using the following primers with unique restriction enzyme sites, SacI and KpnI (underlined): forward, 5′-GAGCTCGATATCATGTGCTTTCAAGCAGGATTTGTCACAGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTACCACTAGTGCTAAATCCTGTAGATTTCCGTGCCAATTT-3′. The resulting PCR product was then cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). This construct was then digested with SacI and KpnI, and the VMA5 gene ligated into pRS316. An HA epitope tag was introduced at the N terminus of Vma5p using a PCR-based recombination method (48Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34122-34130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Construction of Mutants—Site-directed mutants of Vma5p were constructed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The VMA5 gene containing the HA tag was cloned into the pALTER-1 vector using the SacI and KpnI restriction sites. The Cys-less form of VMA5 was made by substituting the single endogenous cysteine residue at position 340 with serine using the oligonucleotide: 5′-CTCTCTAAATCCAAGTCTGAA-3′. Single cysteine mutants were then constructed starting with the Cys-less form of the VMA5 gene (C340S) in pALTER-1. The oligonucleotides for the single cysteine mutants constructed are as follows: G27C, 5′-GTTACCGCCCCTTGCTCCAAAAC-3′; R42C, 5′-CCTTAATCGGGGGTTGTGCATTTGTTTCTG-3′; D47C, 5′-GCATTTGTTTCTTGTTTCAAAATTCC-3′; S57C, 5′-CAAAATTGGCTGTTTAGACACATTG-3′; S69C, 5′-CGGAAGAACTGTGTAAAGTAGATAAC-3′; E84C, 5′-GGCAAAATCATTTGCATTCTTCAAGGC-3′; N90C, 5′-CTTCAAGGCCTCTGCGAGACCAGCACC-3′; N104C, 5′-CTTTACCTATCAATTGTATGCCAGTTCC-3′; R119C, 5′-CAATGGCAAACCTGCAAGTTCAAGTTAG-3′; N136C, 5′-ACATTGATTTCTTGTGAATCTTCTCAA-3′; T157C, 5′-CAACAGCGCTAAATGTAACTTGGCTGC-3′; S171C, 5′-GGTGACCTTTGTGTCAGATCC-3′; N187C, 5′-GACTTCGTTCTTTGTTCTGAACATTTAAC-3′; N216C, 5′-CGAAACTTTATCCAAGTGCGTTGTACCAGC-3′; A220C, 5′-CCAAGAACGTTGTACCATGCTCTGCCAGCGTGATTGC-3′; A226C, 5′-CTGCCAGCGTGATTTGCGAGGATGCTGAGTATG-3′; A229C, 5′-GATTGCAGAGGATTGTGAGTATGTTTTG-3′; Q244C, 5′-GTTCAAGAAAAACGTTTGCGAATTCACAACAGCTGC-3′; K253C, 5′-CAACAGCTGCTAGAGAGTGTAAATTCATTCCTCGTG-3′; Q269C, 5′-GGAGGAATTAATTGACTGTTTGAAAAAAGAGCATG-3′; H274C, 5′-GTTGAAAAAAGAGTGTGACTCTGCTGCC-3′; Q287C, 5′-CAATCTTTGCGCGTCTGCTTGGTAAGATTGGCC-3′; H324C, 5′-CGGGTTGCCACCTTGCTTTAACATCAAG-3′; N354C, 5′-GGATTTCTTGGTGGCTGTGCCTTCATGAAGG-3′; E383C, 5′-GTCGACACAGAGTATTGCCCATTTGTGATGTAT-3′. After the mutagenesis reaction, the SacI/KpnI fragment was cleaved and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragment was used to generate mutant forms of VMA5 in pRS316 encoding single cysteine-containing subunit C proteins. The sequence of all mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. No other mutations were detected in the final products. Transformation and Selection—Yeast cells lacking functional endogenous Vma5p were transformed using the lithium acetate method (49Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on uracil-minus plates, and the growth phenotypes were assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Isolation of Vacuolar Membrane Vesicles—Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated using a modification of the protocol described by Uchida et al. (50Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C to 5 × 107 cells/ml in 1 liter of selective medium. Cells were pelleted, washed twice with water, and resuspended in 50 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, cells were pelleted again, washed once 25 ml of YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm MES-Tris (pH 7.5), resuspended in 25 ml of YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.5, and 2 mg of Zymolase 100T, and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min with gentle shaking. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and the vacuoles were isolated by flotation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients and diluted in transport buffer (15 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.0, 4.8% glycerol). Photochemical Cross-linking of the V-ATPase with MBP—Vacuolar membranes (200 μg of protein) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. 1 μl of 100 mm MBP dissolved in dimethylformamide or 1 μl of dimethylformamide (negative control) were added to the washed vacuoles. After incubation at 23 °C for 30 min in the dark, the unreacted MBP was quenched by addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol. The vacuole membranes were pelleted, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer, and irradiated with a long wavelength (366 nm) ultraviolet lamp at 4 °C for 5 min. The vacuolar membranes were then solubilized with 2% C12E9 and the V-ATPase complex immunoprecipitated using the anti-HA antibody (3F10), and protein G-agarose. Analysis of Cross-linked Products—Immunoprecipitated V-ATPase complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% acrylamide gels (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar), and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was then performed using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against the HA epitope tag attached to subunit C and antibodies specific for other V-ATPase subunits, as previously described (39Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (52Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A as described previously (14Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proton transport was measured using the fluorescence probe ACMA in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A as described previously (14Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Construction of Single Cysteine-containing Mutants of Vma5p and the Effect of Mutations on Growth Phenotype, Assembly, ATPase Activity, and Proton Transport Activity—To determine the arrangement of subunits in the V-ATPase complex relative to subunit C, we have employed a strategy involving cysteine-mediated cross-linking using the photoactivated cross-linking reagent MBP (39Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Subunit C was chosen for this study in part because of the recently published high resolution crystal structure of this protein (46Drory O. Frolow F. Nelson N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This structure facilitated the introduction of unique cysteine residues into structurally defined sites on the surface of subunit C (Fig. 1). A vma5Δ strain was constructed from YPH500 by replacing the VMA5 gene with the TRP1 gene. The wild-type VMA5 gene was cloned from YPH500 genomic DNA and inserted into the pRS316 vector, which contains the URA3 selectable marker. An HA epitope tag was introduced at the N terminus of Vma5p to facilitate immunoprecipitation of the V-ATPase complex and to permit detection of subunit C and its cross-linked products by Western blot. Transformation of the vma5Δ strain with this epitope-tagged construct gave a wild-type growth phenotype (see below) and gave rise to a V-ATPase complex possessing wild-type assembly and activity properties (data not shown). Thus wild type in this study refers to cells transformed with this epitope-tagged construct of Vma5p. To construct mutants of Vma5p containing single cysteine residues, it was first necessary to construct a Cys-less form of Vma5p in which the single endogenous cysteine residue at position 340 was replaced with serine. This was accomplished using site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using the Cys-less form of Vma5p as a starting point, 25 mutants containing single cysteine replacements were then constructed using the same mutagenesis protocol. Cysteine residues were introduced at exposed sites on each of the surfaces of the protein, as indicated from the x-ray structure of subunit C (Fig. 1). All mutants were selected on uracil-minus plates and tested for growth on YEPD plates buffered to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Both the Cys-less Vma5p and the single cysteine-containing mutants were able to grow at both pH 7.5 and 5.5, indicating that they were able to complement the vma- phenotype of the vma5Δ strain. Based upon previous studies (54Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), this suggests that the mutants possessed at least 20% of wild-type levels of activity. To assess the assembly competence of the Vma5p mutants, vacuolar membranes were isolated from each strain, and Western blotting was performed using an anti-HA antibody. It has previously been observed that loss of any V-ATPase subunit (with the exception of Vma13p) results in failure of V1 subunits to associate with the vacuolar membrane (55Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, all mutants showed near wild-type levels of Vma5p present in isolated vacuolar membranes. As a test of the functional properties of the V-ATPase complexes containing the mutant forms of Vma5p, concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport (as measured by fluorescence quenching of ACMA) were determined for vacuolar membranes isolated from each of the yeast strains. As shown in Fig. 2B, vacuolar membranes from all of the mutant strains displayed concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and proton transport that was at least 70% of that measured for wild-type vacuolar membranes. These results indicate that the mutations introduced into Vma5p do not significantly perturb the assembly or activity properties of the resultant V-ATPase complexes. Photochemical Cross-linking of V-ATPase Complexes Containing Mutant Forms of Vma5p Using MBP—To determine the proximity of other V-ATPase subunits to each of the unique cysteine residues introduced into subunit C, photochemical cross-linking was carried out using the photoreactive sulfhydryl reagent MBP (39Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This reagent reacts with sulfhydryl groups via the maleimide moiety and, upon irradiation with UV light, generates a reactive intermediate capable of insertion into proximal residues. As a result, cross-linking between the initial sulfhydryl-containing polypeptide and the protein that reacts with the photoactivated group occurs. The linker arm within MBP requires that the cross-l"

Trying to address this question, we have produced immortalized cell lines from wild-type (T-FGM-AhR+/+) and mutant (T-FGM-AhR-/-) mouse mammary fibroblasts by stable co-transfection with the simian virus 40 (SV-40) large T antigen and proto-oncogenic c-H-Ras. Both cell lines had a myofibroblast phenotype and similar proliferation, doubling time, SV-40 and c-H-Ras expression and activity, and cell cycle distribution. AhR+/+ and AhR-/- cells were also equally able to support growth factor- and anchorage-independent proliferation. However, the ability of T-FGM-AhR-/- to induce subcutaneous tumors (leimyosarcomas) in NOD/SCID-immunodeficient mice was close to 4-fold lower than T-FGM-AhR+/+. In culture, T-FGM-AhR-/- had diminished migration in collagen-I and decreased lamellipodia formation. VEGFR-1/Flt-1, a VEGF receptor that regulates cell migration and blood vessel formation, was also down-regulated in AhR-/- cells. Signaling through the ERK-FAK-PKB/AKT-Rac-1 pathway, which contributes to cell motility and invasion, was also significantly inhibited in T-FGM-AhR-/-. Thus, the lower tumorigenic potential of T-FGM-AhR-/- could result from a compromised adaptability of these cells to the in vivo microenvironment, possibly because of an impaired ability to migrate and to respond to angiogenesis.

Although very important, this xenobiotic-related activity of the AhR does not appear to be its only function in the organism.

Thus, this receptor is activated by the natural compounds indirubin and indigo (14.Adachi J. Mori Y. Matsui S. Takigami H. Fujino J. Kitagawa H. Miller 3rd, C.A. Kato T. Saeki K. Matsuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31475-31478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), diosmin and diosmetin (15.Ciolino H.P. Wang T.T. Yeh G.C.

Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An AhR repressor was identified that regulates AhR activity by binding and sequestering the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (17.Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Additional work has also shown that protein kinase C cooperates with ligand binding for receptor activation (18.Carrier F. Owens R.A. Nebert D.W. Puga A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1856-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19.Long W.P. Pray-Grant M. Tsai J.C. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and that proteasome inhibition activates the AhR in mouse embryo primary fibroblasts in the absence of xenobiotics (20.Santiago-Josefat B. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21.Santiago-Josefat B. Pozo-Guisado E. Mulero-Navarro S. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1700-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Among the physiological functions that could require AhR activity, the regulation of the cell cycle and the control of cell proliferation are the best analyzed (reviewed in Ref. 22.Puga A. Xia Y. Elferink C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); yet, the role of this receptor in cell proliferation is still controversial because it can promote or block cell cycle progression. Several studies support the AhR as an oncoprotein: (i) AhR-defective (AhR-D) mouse hepatoma cells had a prolonged duplication time because of a delayed G1/S transition (23.Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); (ii) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) lacking AhR entered senescence much earlier than wild-type cells (24.Alexander D.L. Ganem L.G. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F. Jefcoate C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and had a diminished proliferation rate and increased levels of transforming growth β-1 (TGFβ-1) (25.Elizondo G. Fernandez-Salguero P.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); (iii) the AhR was relevant in DNA synthesis mediated by p300 and the adenovirus E1A (27.Tohkin M. Fukuhara M. Elizondo G. Tomita S. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); and finally, (iv) constitutive activation of this receptor increased hepatocarcinogenesis in transgenic B6C3F1 mice (28.Moennikes O. Loeppen S. Buchmann A. Andersson P. Ittrich C. Poellinger L. Schwarz M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4707-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The AhR also has tumor suppressor activity. It arrests cell proliferation at the G1/S transition in 5L rat hepatoma cells through interaction with hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb) protein (29.Ge N.L. Elferink C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22708-22713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 and in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, TCDD induced AhR binding and displacement of p300 from E2F-dependent promoters (30.Marlowe J.L. Knudsen E.S. Schwemberger S. Puga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29013-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A constitutively active AhR induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells by arresting cell cycle progression at G1 (31.Ito T. Tsukumo S. Suzuki N. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mimura J. Lin T.M. Peterson R.E. Tohyama C. Nohara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25204-25210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and AhR activation by ligand binding blocked cell cycle by increasing p27Kip1 expression (32.Kolluri S.K. Weiss C. Koff A. Gottlicher M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1742-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this context, a recent report has shown that while the AhR had growth inhibitory activity in epithelial MCF-7 cells, it promoted proliferation in HepG2 hepatoma cells, further suggesting that the contribution of this receptor to proliferation is cell type-dependent (33.Abdelrahim M. Smith 3rd, R. Safe S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, although the contribution of the AhR to cell proliferation is strongly supported, its role in tumor development in the absence of xenobiotics remains largely unknown.It is increasingly recognized that the stroma plays a major role in determining the rate of tumor growth and invasiveness in vivo (34.Noel A. Foidart J.M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1998; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35.Weaver V.M. Fischer A.H. Peterson O.W. Bissell M.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 833-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts, as one of the most abundant cell types in connective tissue, regulate the synthesis, degradation, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts are particularly important in diseases such as breast cancer in which their conversion to smooth muscle α-actin-expressing myofibroblasts is considered a stromal reaction to the invading epithelial tumor cells (desmoplastic reaction) (36.Ronnov-Jessen L. Petersen O.W. Bissell M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 69-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 37.Elenbaas B. Weinberg R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Because secretion of cytokines, proteases, and growth factors by stromal fibroblasts promotes proliferation of tumor cells (38.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), therapeutic targeting of stromal components constitutes a relevant tool to deprive tumor cells from critical factors needed for their growth, proliferation, and migration. In this context, it is interesting to note that the livers of AhR-/- mice had thickening of the stromal tissue surrounding the portal triads with increased staining for the fibroblast markers vimentin and smooth muscle α-actin (39.Corchero J. Martin-Partido G. Dallas S.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as well as altered vascular architecture (11.Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).In an attempt to analyze the contribution of the AhR to tumor development in absence of xenobiotics, we have immortalized primary mammary gland fibroblasts from AhR+/+ and AhR-/- mice by stable co-transfection with the SV-40 large T-antigen and proto-oncogenic c-H-Ras. Although both cell lines had similar proliferation rates, cell cycle distribution and a transformed phenotype in vitro, the ability of T-FGM-AhR-/- to induce subcutaneous tumors in immunodeficient mice was markedly reduced. These results suggest that the absence of AhR could compromise the ability of myofibroblasts to adapt to the in vivo microenvironment and identify this receptor as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human cancers of fibroblastic origin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—TaqDNA polymerase and MMLV reverse transcriptase were from Ecogen and from Ambion, respectively. Mouse β-actin and secondary rabbit-TRITC antibodies, DAPI, enzymes, and hormones were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Collagenase, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (DMEM/F12), OPTI-MEM, Lipofectamine Plus reagent, neomycin sulfate, and trypsin-EDTA were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Bio-Whittaker and was heat-inactivated before use. Complete protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate was obtained from Pierce. [methyl-3H]Thymidine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A/G plus agarose, antibodies against p-Tyr, cyclin D1, cyclin E, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p-PKB/AKT, PKB/AKT, p-ERK, ERK, H-pan-Ras, and secondary anti-mouse-FITC were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Rac-1 and anti-FAK antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies for SV-40 large T antigen, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 were from NeoMarkers. Smooth muscle α-actin 1A4 and desmin antibodies were from Anacrom Diagnósticos. Anti-vimentin was obtained from DAKO and anti-CD49f/α6 integrin from Immunotech.Mice and Primary Culture of Mammary Gland Fibroblasts—AhR-null and wild-type control mice of the same genetic background (C57BL6/N × 129/sV) were produced as previously described (9.Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Animals were housed in a germ-free facility in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Guidelines of the University of Extremadura. Mice were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism of tail DNA as described (26.Santiago-Josefat B. Mulero-Navarro S. Dallas S.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mammary gland stromal fibroblasts were isolated from 8 to12-week old virgin female mice of each genotype. Briefly, mice were killed, and the mammary glands quickly removed, washed twice in Hank's salt solution, and finely minced. Tissues were digested by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h in Hank's containing 10% FBS, 3500 units/ml collagenase, and 2000 units/ml hyaluronidase. The resulting cell suspension was briefly centrifuged, and the pellet resuspended in DMEM/F12 and filtered through a 41-μm nylon mesh. Single fibroblasts passing through the mesh were collected, centrifuged, and resuspended in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 11 mm d-glucose, 5 μg/ml insulin, 125 units prolactin, and 2 μg/ml hydrocortisone. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until 80-90% confluence and stored in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots from these primary cultures were propagated for 1-2 passages and used for transfection at 30-40% confluence.Stable Co-transfection with SV-40 Large T Antigen and AU5-c-H-Ras—Stable co-transfection was performed on AhR-null and wild type mammary fibroblasts using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent and 0.5 μg of EcoRI-linearized DNA. Plates were transfected with either pSV3Neo (SV-40), pCEFL-AU5-c-H-Ras (proto-oncogenic H-Ras) or a 1:1 mix of both DNA constructs. Proto-oncogenic (cellular) human H-Ras was used rather than the oncogenic, hyperactivated protein, because previous studies had revealed that while AhR activity remained unaffected by expression of the H-Ras proto-oncogene it was inhibited by the oncogenic protein (40.Reiners Jr., J.J. Jones C.L. Hong N. Clift R.E. Elferink C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were obtained after 4-5 weeks of selection in complete medium containing 400 μg/ml neomycin (G418). After isolation and re-plating, clones were considered to be at passage 1.Hematoxylin Staining and Immunocytochemistry—After removing the medium, plates were washed with PBS, fixed in cold methanol for 10 min at -20 °C and air-dried. For hematoxylin staining, cells were hydrated in PBS and incubated for 3 min in 50% Harris's hematoxylin. After an additional wash in PBS, cultures were photographed using a Nikon E600 microscope. For immunocytochemistry, cells were permeabilized with three 5-min washes in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). Blocking was performed for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum. Cells were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with primary anti-vimentin, anti-smooth muscle α-actin 1A4, anti-CD49f/α6 integrin, anti-SV-40, anti-AU5, or anti-VEGFR-1 antibodies. After washing in TBS-T, anti-mouse-FITC or anti-rabbit-TRITC secondary antibodies were added, and incubation continued at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were finally washed in PBS as above. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 5 min and cells observed and photographed using a Nikon E600 fluorescence microscope.Cell Proliferation, Cell Number, and Duplication Time—Cell proliferation was determined by measuring the rate of DNA synthesis. Cultures growing in 24-well plates were incubated with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (specific activity, 7 Ci/mmol) for 2 h. Labeling medium was removed and cells fixed for 2 h at room temperature in 1 ml of methanol/acetic acid (1:1). Fixed cells were washed with 80% ethanol and incubated in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed for 5 min at room temperature by the addition of 1% (w/v) SDS and incorporated thymidine quantitated in a Beckman LS 3801 liquid scintillation counter. The number of cells attached to the plates was determined in parallel cultures after trypsinization (see above) and cell counting using a hemocytometer. For some experiments, cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium without FBS. Duplication time was determined from the slope of a semilogarithmic plot representing log of cell number against time.Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cell cycle distribution and ploidy status of the cultures were determined by flow cytometry DNA analysis. Cells were released from the plates by the addition of 0.25% trypsin, washed in PBS, fixed at 4 °C in 70% cold ethanol, and treated with RNase (10 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA content per cell was determined in a Cyan flow cytometer (DAKO Cytomation) after staining with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. For cell cycle analysis, only signals from single cells were considered (10,000 cells/sample).Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with PBS and scraped from the plates at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture). For PKB/AKT and ERK proteins, the following lysis buffer was used: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysed cultures were centrifuged at 15000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (with prior 10-min shaking at 4 °C for PKB/AKT and ERK). Protein concentration was determined in the supernatants using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as standard. For immunoblotting, 15 μg of protein were denatured, separated on 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk and incubated for another 2 h with the corresponding primary antibodies (H-pan-Ras, AU5, cyclin D, cyclin E, p21, p27, β-actin, PKB/AKT, pAKT, ERK, pERK, Rac-1, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2). After washing in TBS-T, blots were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following additional washing in TBS-T, the SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate was added, and the blots were exposed and developed using the Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad).Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed on ice for 15 min with IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged and protein concentration determined in the supernatants as indicated above. An amount of 0.8-1 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-SV-40 or anti-FAK antibodies, followed by 2-h incubation at 4 °C with protein A/G plus agarose. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in IP buffer, denatured, separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked as indicated above and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against p53 (1:1000), Rb (1:300), or pTyr (1:1000). After washing and incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, the SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate was added and membranes exposed and developed using a Molecular Imager FX System.Subcutaneous Mouse Xenograft Model for AhR+/+ and AhR-/- Myofibroblasts—Male or female NOD.CB17 PRKDC/J mice (Charles River Laboratories) at 6 weeks of age were used for this assay. T-FGM-AhR+/+ and T-FGM-AhR-/- myofibroblasts were grown and passed at 50-60% confluence. At the time of injection, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and counted. Aliquots of 250 μl of PBS containing 1.5 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously per flank in each mouse. Mice were sacrificed at 7-8 weeks after injection and tumors measured and processed for immunohistochemistry as indicated below. Tumor volume was calculated from the equation: tumor volume = x2y/2, where x and y correspond to the width and thickness of the tissue.Immunohistochemistry—Tumors were fixed in 5% buffered formalin, dehydrated in serially diluted ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm serial sections obtained and mounted on immunohistochemically pretreated slides. Sections were then dewaxed in xylene and gradually rehydrated to deionized distilled water. Antigen unmasking was performed by incubating the slides at 100 °C for 5 min in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Incubation with antibodies against smooth muscle α-actin 1A4, desmin, or vimentin was carried out for 1 h at room temperature using an automatic immunostainer. Protein-antibody complexes were revealed by avidin-biotin complex (ABC) staining.Soft Agar Assay—Colony formation in soft agar was analyzed in 60-mm cell culture dishes coated with two layers of agarose. A 1:5 dilution of cell culture-grade agarose was made in prewarmed culture medium for a final concentration of 1% agar, and 4 ml of this solution added to each culture plate. Agarose was allowed to solidify at room temperature for 10 min and plates placed in the CO2 incubator for pH equilibration. A 1:10 dilution of agarose was also prepared in prewarmed culture medium for a final concentration of 0.5%. T-FGM-AhR+/+ and T-FGM-AhR-/- cells were trypsinized and serially diluted to 103, 5 × 103, 104, or 105 cells/ml. A 100-μl aliquot of each cell dilution was mixed with 900 μl of 0.5% agarose to give final concentrations of 102, 5 × 102, 103, and 104 cells/ml. These cell dilutions were poured on top of the 1% agarose layer previously solidified in each agar plate. Cells were fed twice per week by the addition of 400 μl of complete culture medium. After 22 days, clones were stained with crystal violet and counted under the microscope.Cell Migration and Wound Closure Assays—Migration assays were performed using Biocoat 24-well collagen I culture inserts and matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences). A total of 7000 cells were seeded into the upper compartment of each well. Complete culture medium was placed in both lower and upper chambers. After 48 h, inserts were removed from the plates, washed in PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and incubated for 15 min with 10 ng/ml RNase in PBS. Next, cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide at room temperature in the dark and migration-analyzed in a 2100 Radiance confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). For wound closure assays, cells were allowed to reach confluence in serum-containing medium. Wounds were performed in the plates with the aid of a 1-ml pipette tip, and cultures were incubated for 18 h in serum-free medium. Closure was monitored by microscopy after staining the cells with hematoxylin.Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity—MMP activity was determined in conditioned culture medium from T-FGM-AhR+/+ and T-FGM-AhR-/- by gelatin zymography. Cells were grown in OPTI-MEM for 60 h and culture medium recovered and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells attached to the plates at the time of the experiment were trypsinized and counted. A volume of medium equivalent to the same number of cells was mixed with non-reducing Laemmli's sample buffer (62.2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue) and applied to 8% SDS-PAGE gels polymerized in the presence of 1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed three times in a solution containing 2.5% Triton X-100 to eliminate the SDS and to allow reconstitution of the proteins. MMP activity was stimulated by incubating the gels at 37 °C for 16 h in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% sodium azide). The position of the MMPs was visualized by staining the gels in Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 solution.Rhodamine Phalloidin Staining—Complete medium of cultures at 20-30% confluence was replaced by serum-free DMEM/F12 for 18 h. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C and permeabilized i"

In an attempt to discover additional lipid A modifications important for polymyxin resistance, we generated polymyxin-sensitive mutants of an E. coli pmrAC strain, WD101. A subset of polymyxin-sensitive mutants produced a lipid A that lacked both the 3′-acyloxyacyl-linked myristate (C14) and l-Ara4N, even though the necessary enzymatic machinery required to synthesize l-Ara4N-modified lipid A was present. Inactivation of lpxM in both E. coli and S. typhimurium resulted in the loss of l-Ara4N addition, as well as, increased sensitivity to polymyxin. However, decoration of the lipid A phosphate groups with pEtN residues was not effected in lpxM mutants. In summary, we demonstrate that attachment of l-Ara4N to the phosphate groups of lipid A and the subsequent resistance to polymyxin is dependent upon the presence of the secondary linked myristoyl group.

In summary, we demonstrate that attachment of l-Ara4N to the phosphate groups of lipid A and the subsequent resistance to polymyxin is dependent upon the presence of the secondary linked myristoyl group. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid; l-Ara4N, 4-amino-4-dexoy-l-arabinose; pEtN, phosphoethanolamine; ArnT, l-4-aminoarabinose transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. is the major surface molecule of Gram-negative bacteria and is held in the outer membrane by a unique phospholipid domain known as lipid A. The typical lipid A backbone consists of a β-1′,6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine that is phosphorylated and multiply acylated. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium), the disaccharide backbone is acylated at the 2-, 3-, 2′-, and 3′-positions with (R)-3-hydroxymyristate and phosphorylated at the 1- and 4′-positions (1.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). A secondary lauroyl (C12) and myristoyl (C14) group is attached at the 2′- and 3′-positions, respectively, of the distal glucosamine in an acyloxyacyl linkage resulting in the hexa-acylated structure shown in Fig. 1A (1.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). The lipid A domain is attached to the polysaccharide portion of LPS via the Kdo (3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid) sugars (Fig. 1) (1.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Modification of the lipid A domain of E. coli and S. typhimurium with the cationic sugar 4-amino-4-dexoy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) promotes resistance to the cyclic antimicrobial lipopeptide, polymyxin (2.Helander I.M.

Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of polymyxin killing is not completely understood, the peptide is thought to access the outer surface of the bacterium by interacting with the negatively charged phosphate groups of lipid A. A similar mechanism is employed by cationic antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system (6.Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 395-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Masking of lipid A phosphate groups with positively charged amine-containing residues is predicted to decrease binding of polymyxin to the bacterial surface promoting survival. In E. coli and S. typhimurium, the polymyxin-resistant phenotype is primarily under the control of the PmrA/PmrB two-component regulatory system that is activated during growth under conditions of low pH, high Fe3+, and in a PhoP/PhoQ-dependent manner during Mg2+ starvation (7.Wosten M.M.

Previously, Trent and co-workers (10.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) demonstrated that periplasmic addition of l-Ara4N to lipid A is catalyzed by l-4-aminoarabinose transferase (ArnT), a PmrA-regulated glycosyltransferase (10.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because the transferase utilizes an undecaprenyl-linked donor substrate, undecaprenyl-phosphate-α-l-Ara4N, its active site is predicted to lie in the periplasmic region of the cell (11.Trent M.S.

(12.Doerrler W.T. Gibbons H.S. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; : 45102-45109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that modification of lipid A with l-Ara4N and pEtN is dependent upon its transport across the inner membrane by MsbA. We now report that, in E. coli K12 and S. typhimurium, addition of l-Ara4N to the lipid A domain of LPS in living cells is dependent upon the presence of the acyloxyacyl-linked myristoyl group at the 3′-position. Loss of myristoylation of lipid A in both E. coli and S. typhimurium by inactivation of lpxM resulted in loss of l-Ara4N modification and in a significant decrease in polymyxin resistance. However, the pEtN modification of the lipid A phosphate groups was not effected by loss of myristoylation. Chemicals and Other Materials—[γ-32P]ATP and 32Pi were obtained from Amersham International. Silica Gel 60 (0.25-mm) thin layer plates were purchased from EM Separation Technology (Merck). Yeast extract and Tryptone were from Difco. Triton X-100 and bicinchoninic acid were from Pierce. Polymyxin B sulfate was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from either Sigma or Mallinckrodt. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains are described in Table I. Typically bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 10 g of NaCl, 10 g of Tryptone, and 5 g of yeast extract per liter. When required for plasmid selection, cells were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 12 μg/ml tetracycline, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 30 μg/ml kanamycin.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidDescriptionSource or Ref.E. coliW3110Wild type, F-, λ-E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale UniversityWD101W3110, pmrAc, polymyxinr11.Trent M.S.

DNA fragments were isolated from gels using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were purchased from New England Biolabs. All modifying enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of Polymyxin-sensitive Mutants—Polymyxin-sensitive mutants were generated by random mutagenesis of the E. coli strain, WD101. WD101, a polymyxin-resistant E. coli K12 strain, contains a mutation in the pmrA (basR) gene resulting in a pmrAC phenotype promoting polymyxin resistance (11.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). E. coli WD101 was treated with 40 μg/ml of the mutagen N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine for 10 min at 37 °C. To obtain clones that were sensitive to polymyxin, mutagenized cells were first grown on LB agar plates (∼100/plate). Sensitive mutants were identified by replica plating onto LB agar plates containing 2 μg/ml polymyxin B sulfate at 37 °C. Sensitive clones were re-purified and their sensitivity to polymyxin verified. Approximately 10,000 colonies were screened by the above method, and ∼100 polymyxin-sensitive mutants were identified including strains F2-1 and C1-1. Generation of E. coli Strain WD103—WD103 was generated by P1vir transduction of the polymyxin-resistant genotype (pmrAC) of strain WD101 into the E. coli lpxM mutant MLK1067 (W3110 lpxM::Ωcam) (13.Clementz T.

Construction of LpxM Covering Plasmids, pWSLpxM and pRM17A— E. coli lpxM was cloned into the multiple cloning site of the low-copy expression vector pWSK29 (15.Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) resulting in plasmid pWSLpxM. The latter was used to complement the pmrAC E. coli lpxM mutant, WD103. The S. typhimurium lpxM covering plasmid was constructed by subcloning the Salmonella lpxM gene into a pACYC derivative, pR1A. The resulting plasmid was named pRM17A and was used to complement the S. typhimurium lpxM mutant. Isolation and Analysis of 32P-Labeled Lipid A Species—32Pi-Labeled lipid A was isolated from cells uniformly labeled with 2.5 μCi/ml of 32Pi in 5 ml of LB broth as previously described (16.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled lipid A domain was released from LPS by hydrolysis of the Kdo dissacharide and processed by the method of Zhou and co-workers (16.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

Lipids were spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (10,000 cpm/lane) and developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). Labeled lipids were visualized by phosphorimaging. Isolation and Analysis of 32P-Labeled Undecaprenyl-Phosphate-α-l-Ara4N—Cells were uniformly labeled with 32Pi as described above. The glycerolphospholipid fraction containing the undecaprenyl-phosphate-α-l-Ara4N was isolated and analyzed by TLC as described by Trent and co-workers (11.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T.

Preparation of Cell-free Extracts, Double-Spun Cytosol, and Washed Membranes—Typically, 200-ml cultures of E. coli or S. typhimurium were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.0 and harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min. All samples were prepared at 4 °C. Cell-free extract, double-spun cytosol, and washed membranes were prepared as previously described (17.Trent M.S. Pabich W. Raetz C.R. Miller S.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Addition of the l-Ara4N was visualized as a shift to a slower migrating lipid species previously termed Lipid IIA (21.Raetz C.R. Purcell S. Meyer M.V. Qureshi N. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16080-16088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymyxin Sensitivity Assays—E. coli and S. typhimurium strains were assayed for polymyxin resistance as described by Gunn and Miller (8.Gunn J.S. Miller S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6857-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). After growth to an A600 nm of ∼0.5, bacteria were diluted to ∼2,500 colony forming units/ml in LB broth. Cells (200 μl) were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of polymyxin in a microtiter plate. Following exposure to polymyxin, 100 μl of treated bacteria were plated on LB agar plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Colony counts were determined for each concentration of polymyxin tested, and the results were expressed as the percentage of colonies resulting from untreated cells. Large Scale Isolation of Lipid A—E. coli or S. typhimurium were cultured in 200 ml of LB medium at 37 °C or N-minimal media containing 10 μm Mg2+, respectively. The cultures were allowed to reach an A600 nm ∼ 0.8, harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The final cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Lipid A was released from cells and purified as previously described (16.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

Mass Spectrometry of Lipid A Species—Mass spectra of the purified lipids were acquired in the negative ion mode using a matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (AXIMA-CFR, Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK), equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The instrument was operated using 20-kV extraction voltage and time-delayed extraction, providing a mass resolution of about ±1 atomic mass units for compounds with Mr ∼ 2000. Each spectrum represented the average of 100 laser shots. Saturated 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile and 10% tribasic ammonium citrate (9:1, v/v) served as the matrix. The samples were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v), and deposited on the sample plate followed by an equal portion of matrix solution (0.3 μl). The sample was dried at 25 °C prior to mass analysis. Isolation and Characterization of Polymyxin-sensitive Mutants of E. coli WD101—Addition of the amine-containing residues, l-Ara4N and pEtN, to the phosphate groups of lipid A (Fig. 1) is associated with increased resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides, including the peptide polymyxin (2.Helander I.M.

E. coli strain WD101 contains a mutation in the pmrA gene resulting in a pmrAC phenotype and modification of the lipid A structure with l-Ara4N and pEtN, helping to provide resistance to polymyxin at concentrations of up to 20 μg/ml on solid media (10.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Originally, we sought to determine additional modifications to the lipid A structure that were important for polymyxin resistance. Using WD101 as the parent strain, a library of mutants displaying sensitivity to polymyxin at 2 μg/ml was generated via random chemical mutagenesis. Approximately 10,000 colonies were replica plated on LB agar containing 2 μg/ml of polymyxin, and ∼100 colonies showing sensitivity to the peptide were purified for further analysis. Each mutant was uniformly labeled in the presence of 32Pi, and the lipid A fraction analyzed by TLC. Fig. 2 shows the modification patterns found in the lipid A fractions isolated from selected polymyxin-sensitive mutants. Overall, four different lipid A phenotypes were found among the polymyxin-sensitive mutants. For example, some mutants produced lipid A identical to that of wild type E. coli strain W3110. W3110 synthesizes a bis-phosphorylated hexa-acylated lipid A species lacking modified phosphate groups (Fig. 2, lane 1) and shows sensitivity to polymyxin at concentrations <0.1 μg/ml on solid media (data not shown). Mutant B1-1 produced lipid A species (Fig. 2, lane 4) identical to those of the WD101 parent strain (Fig. 2, lane 2) modified with l-Ara4N, and pEtN yet showed sensitivity to the peptide at 2 μg/ml. These results suggest that other mechanisms involved in conferring polymyxin resistance to E. coli may remain as yet unidentified. As expected, in some cases sensitivity arose from the inability to synthesize l-Ara4N- or pEtN-modified species. For example, strain A1-1 (Fig. 2, lane 3) produced lipid A modified with one or two pEtN residues, whereas mutant D1-1 produced species modified with only l-Ara4N (lane 6). The changes in the lipid A domain of A1-1 and D1-1 most likely arose from lack of l-Ara4N or pEtN transferase activities, respectively (data not shown). Finally, strains C1-1 and F2-1 produced very hydrophilic lipid A species that had not been previously identified, and for this reason these strains were chosen for further analysis. Strains C1-1 and F2-1 Have the Enzymatic Machinery to Synthesize and Transfer l-Ara4N to Lipid A—Transfer of l-Ara4N to lipid A occurs in the periplasmic region of the cell catalyzed by the inner membrane glycosyltransferase, ArnT. The enzyme utilizes an undecaprenyl carrier lipid, undecaprenyl-phosphate-α-l-Ara4N, as the donor substrate (10.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Loss of ArnT function or the inability to synthesize the undecaprenyl-linked substrate results in loss of polymyxin resistance (5.Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 23.Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S. Van Velkinburgh J.C. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because mutants C1-1 and F2-1 showed sensitivity to polymyxin, we determined if these mutants contained the necessary enzymatic machinery to synthesize and transfer l-Ara4N to the lipid A domain of their LPS. The phospholipid fraction from 32Pi-labeled cells was analyzed by TLC for the presence of the undecaprenyl-phosphate-α-l-Ara4N donor lipid. As previously shown by Trent et al. (11.Trent M.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the l-Ara4N donor lipid was produced by the polymyxin-resistant strain WD101 (Fig. 3A, lane 1), but absent in the polymyxin-sensitive wild type strain, W3110 (lane 2). However, examination of the phospholipid fraction from mutants C1-1 and F2-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) showed the presence of the l-Ara4N donor lipid. Furthermore, mutants C1-1 and F2-1 contained functional ArnT. Membranes isolated from either C1-1 or F2-1 catalyzed the transfer of l-Ara4N from the donor substrate to [4′-32P]lipid IVA (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5), a tetra-acylated bis-phosphorylated precursor of lipid A. From this data we were able to conclude that a decrease in polymyxin resistance in strains C1-1 and F2-1 did not arise from the inability to produce or transfer l-Ara4N to lipid A. Analysis of Lipid A Produced by Polymyxin-sensitive Mutants C1-1 and F2-1 by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—The lipid A species of mutants C1-1 or F2-1 were isolated as previously described and separated based upon charge using anion-exchange chromatography (16.Zhou Z.

Mass spectrometry of the lipid A species containing unmodified phosphate groups revealed the presence of a penta-acylated bis-phosphorylated species as indicated by [M-H]– at m/z 1587.6 in the negative mode. The major ion peak at 1587.6 (Fig. 4A) corresponds to the loss of myristate (C14) from E. coli lipid A that is found in E. coli mutants lacking a functional myristoyltransferase, LpxM (MsbB) (24.Vorachek-Warren M.K.

Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The majority of the penta-acylated lipid was modified with either one or two pEtN groups as indicated by major ion peaks at m/z 1710.6 (Fig. 4A) and 1832.6 (Fig. 4B), respectively. Interestingly, mutants C1-1 or F2-1 were unable to produce lipid A modified with l-Ara4N even though both mutants contain the necessary enzymatic machinery required for transfer of l-Ara4N to lipid A (see Fig. 3). The only additional modification present was addition of palmitate (C16) to species containing either one or two pEtN groups producing minor ion peaks at m/z 1948.9 and 2071.4, respectively (Fig. 4). Addition of the palmitoyl group is catalyzed by the outer membrane enzyme, PagP (26.Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R.

Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This data were suggestive that the increased polymyxin sensitivity seen displayed by mutants C1-1 or F2-1 resulted from a loss of l-Ara4N addition. Second, these results suggest that myristoylation of E. coli lipid A in vivo is a requirement for l-Ara4N addition. Generation and Characterization of a pmrAC, lpxM::Ωcam E. coli Mutant—To determine whether loss of l-Ara4N modification in mutants C1-1 and F2-1 arose from a loss of addition of myristate to lipid A, we constructed the E. coli strain WD103. A P1vir bacteriophage lysate of polymyxin-resistant WD101 was used to transduce the pmrAC mutation into an existing E. coli lpxM (msbB) mutant, MLK1067 (13.Clementz T. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14.Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was referred to as WD103. Cultures of the various mutants and their corresponding parent strains were labeled with 32Pi, and the lipid A fraction isolated to determine possible modifications in vivo. As expected, the polymyxin-sensitive parent strains MLK1067 (Fig. 5, lane 3) and W3110 (Fig. 5, lane 1) produced unmodified penta- or hexa-acylated lipid A, respectively. The lipid A species shown in lane 5 isolated from WD103 (pmrAC, lpxM::Ωcam) were found to migrate with identical RF values of those isolated from mutants C1-1 (Fig. 5, lane 4) or F2-1 (data not shown). Complementation of strain WD103 with a low-copy vector expressing E. coli lpxM, pWSLpxM, resulted in production of lipid A identical to that found in the polymyxin-resistant parent strain WD101 (Fig, 5, lane 7). This was not the case when WD103 was complemented with the empty vector control, pWSK29 (lane 6). Analysis of the lipid A fraction of E. coli WD103/pWSK29 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry produced results identical to those shown in Fig. 4 for the polymyxin-sensitive mutant C1-1 (data not shown). WD103/pWSK29 produced pEtN-modified lipid A lacking both myristate and l-Ara4N. However, the lipid A of WD103/pWSLpxM produced major ions at m/z 1929.7, 2052.7, and 2290.7, corresponding to hexa-acylated lipid A modified with l-Ara4N (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W1999176994,"Alignment of sequences of vertebrate β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase-1 (BCMO1) and related oxygenases revealed four perfectly conserved histidines and five acidic residues (His172, His237, His308, His514, Asp52, Glu140, Glu314, Glu405, and Glu457 in mouse BCMO1). Because BCMO1 activity is iron-dependent, we propose that these residues participate in iron coordination and therefore are essential for catalytic activity. To test this hypothesis, we produced mutant forms of mouse BCMO1 by replacing the conserved histidines and acidic residues as well as four histidines and one glutamate non-conserved in the overall family with alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. Our in vitro and in vivo data showed that mutation of any of the four conserved histidines and Glu405 caused total loss of activity. However, mutations of non-conserved histidines or any of the other conserved acidic residues produced impaired although enzymatically active proteins, with a decrease in activity mostly due to changes in Vmax. The iron bound to protein was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Bound iron was much lower in preparations of inactive mutants than in the wild-type protein. Therefore, the conserved histidines and Glu405 are absolutely required for the catalytic mechanism of BCMO1. Because the mutant proteins are impaired in iron binding, these residues are concluded to coordinate iron required for catalytic activity. These data are discussed in the context of the predicted structure for the related eubacterial apocarotenal oxygenase.

The most recent addition to the characterized carotenoid oxygenases is cyanobacterial apocarotenoid 15,15′-oxygenase PCC 6803 (ACO) (13Ruch S. Beyer P. Ernst H. Al-Babili S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Despite their unique functionalities and the obvious importance of these proteins, structural studies on this family have been hindered by technical difficulties, and only recently has the crystal structure of eubacterial ACO been published (14Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Originally, Drosophila BCMO1 was identified by homology to a previously characterized plant 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (15Tan B.C. Schwartz S.H. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and by its ability to cleave β-carotene (4von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mouse BCMO1 was identified by our laboratory based on its homology to mammalian RPE65 (3Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because the biochemical function and mechanism of BCMO1 have been studied in detail (3Redmond T.M.

Although there is a weak overall identity (<10%) among these proteins, there are four histidines and five acidic residues that are absolutely conserved and a well conserved acidic stretch (which we call the “signature” sequence) that is common to the superfamily (see Fig. 1). In the original characterization of its activity, iron was found to be an essential cofactor for intestinal BCMO1 (17Goodman D.S. Huang H.S. Science. 1965; 149: 879-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Olson J.A. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Iron is also required for the activity of other members of the family such as lignostilbene dioxygenase (8Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that four conserved histidines and five acidic residues would be the best candidates as putative metal-binding residues in BCMO1. In this study, we demonstrate the necessity of the conserved histidines and acidic residues in the catalytic mechanism of BCMO1, supporting our hypothesis that these residues are necessary for iron coordination in BCMO1. Our data agree well with the crystal structure prediction for an iron(II) center coordinated by four conserved histidines and fixed by three glutamates in the related ACO (14Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and provide empirical evidence for the validity of this prediction. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A panel of mutant BCMO1 proteins was made using a previously described pBAD/BCMO1 construct (3Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E.

This construct contains the BCMO1 open reading frame with a C-terminal V5 epitope and polyhistidine tag. The 15 residues of mouse BCMO1 under study (His49, Asp52, His58, Glu140, His172, His174, His237, His308, His309, Glu314, Glu405, Glu450, Glu457, Glu469, and His514) were mutated to alanine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The validity of all point mutations and the integrity of the open reading frame were verified by sequencing. Escherichia coli Expression and Partial Purification of Mouse BCMO1 and Mutants—Wild-type BCMO1 and all 15 single-point mutants containing a polyhistidine tag fusion were expressed in E. coli strain TOP10 as described previously (3Redmond T.M.

Briefly, overnight cultures of E. coli cells transformed with constructs were grown in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. These cultures were used to inoculate 500-ml cultures. At mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6-0.8), protein expression was induced with 0.02% (w/v) l-arabinose. Cultures were allowed to grow for an additional 4.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in B-PER detergent (Pierce; one-twenty-fifth of the initial culture volume) with one EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)/25 ml. After a 10-min incubation on ice, soluble proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Recombinant His-tagged protein was purified using Talon CellThru resin (Clontech). The B-PER extract was applied to the resin and incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 4°C. The resin was extensively washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2 and then transferred to a column from which bound protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole supplemented with EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor. The purified enzyme was stored in 40% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C until used. Prior to use, protein was concentrated on Amicon Ultra-15 filters with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000. In Vivo Assay of the Enzymatic Activity of Mouse BCMO1 and Mutants—pBAD/BCMO1, pBAD/mutant BCMO1, and pBAD/LacZ expression constructs were transformed into competent cells prepared as described (19Chung C.T.

Overnight cultures of pAC-BETA-transformed E. coli cells with constructs were grown in LB broth supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C. One ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB broth supplemented with the same antibiotics. The culture was allowed to grow at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A600 ∼ 0.6) and was then split; one-half was induced with 0.02% (w/v) l-arabinose, whereas the other was not induced. Both cultures were grown for another 3 h at 30°C; the absorbance was measured; and cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were frozen in dry ice and stored at -70 °C. To quantify the activity of the various constructs, β-carotene and all-trans-retinal were extracted from frozen bacterial cultures. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (0.9 ml/20 ml of initial culture with A600 ∼ 1.8) containing 0.1 m Tricine, 0.1 m NaCl, 4% formaldehyde, 0.5% Tween, 1% pyrogallol, and 1.18 μm α-tocopherol acetate as an internal standard. Resuspended cells were divided into three equal aliquots, and each was centrifuged at 16,060 × g for 1 min. Supernatants were collected, and carotenoids were extracted from each pellet with three sequential aliquots of 300 μl of acetonitrile with rigorous vortexing. Supernatants and acetonitrile extracts were combined and filtered, and 100 μl was injected onto a reverse phase HPLC column (see below). The amount of β-carotene was quantified as the area of β-carotene peak normalized to the area of the α-tocopherol acetate internal standard. Samples were assayed in triplicate from induced and uninduced cultures, and the activity is expressed as the ratio (%) of β-carotene extracted from induced cells to β-carotene extracted from uninduced cells, normalized to cell density. In Vitro Enzymatic Activity Assay—The in vitro assays were performed following the method of Lindqvist and Andersson (5Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Typically, reactions were run in glass vials under subdued light in volume of 200 μl in 100 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0) supplemented with 10 μm FeSO4, 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydroxychloride, 1% (w/v) octyl β-d-1-thioglucopyranoside, and 10-20% (v/v) glycerol. The BCMO1 enzyme concentration in preparations varied between 100 and 1600 ng/reaction as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The concentration of β-carotene in the reaction mixtures ranged from 0.1 to 20 μm (from a stock solution of 34 pmol/μl). The substrate was solubilized in hexane with 50 μl of 4% octyl β-d-1-thioglucopyranoside in a glass vial, and the solvent was evaporated under argon. The assay buffer with substrate/detergent was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min; the enzyme in glycerol was added; and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 45 min to 2 h. To analyze reaction products, we used a modified protocol of During et al. (21During A. Nagao A. Hoshino C. Terao J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fifty μl of 37% (v/v) formaldehyde was added to stop the reaction, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, 500 μl of acetonitrile was added, and the solution was vortexed and put on ice at 4 °C for 5 min. The upper acetonitrile phase was collected, and 100 μl was injected and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. HPLC Analysis of β-Carotene and All-trans-retinal—β-Carotene, all-trans-retinal, and α-tocopherol acetate (internal standard for in vivo assays) were separated on a 4.6 × 250-mm Supelco Supelcosil LC318 C18 5-μm column with a flow rate 1 ml/min and simultaneous UV detection at 451, 383, and 292 nm (Agilent 1100 HPLC series). The initial conditions consisted of acetonitrile and 0.015 m ammonium acetate (60:40) and were held for 5 min (0 min for in vivo method), followed by a linear gradient to 50:50 acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol over 10 min (5 min for the in vivo method), which was held for an additional 10 min. β-Carotene and all-trans-retinal were quantified from their peak area using standard curves obtained with 2-220 and 0.5-20 ng of material, respectively, in 60:40 acetonitrile/lysis buffer. ELISA for Measurement of Immunoreactive BCMO1—Direct ELISA was used to determine BCMO1 concentrations in the partially purified protein preparations obtained from bacteria by one-step His tag affinity purification. Additional purification steps led to a total loss of enzymatic activity. As the standard, the BCMO1 construct was amplified using a His tag linear template generation set (Roche Applied Science). The resultant PCR product with regulatory elements and a C-terminal His tag was subcloned into the pCR4TOPO vector and used as a template for the in vitro transcription and translation system (Rapid Translation System (RTS) 500 HY kit, Roche Applied Science). Expressed protein was recovered from inclusion bodies by solubilization in 6 m guanidine HCl, refolding by the rapid dilution method in 0.5 m arginine, and subsequent dialysis and concentration (22Arora D. Khanna N. J. Biotechnol. 1996; 52: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Purified protein was stored in 40% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C, and the same batch of purified protein was used as a standard for all ELISAs. 96-Well OptiPlate-96FHB (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plates were coated with 2-100 ng of standard and 0.5-4-μl samples/well in 100 μl of imidazole-buffered saline (IBS) containing 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydroxychloride and one Complete protease inhibitor tablet/50 ml. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C; rinsed with IBS wash buffer (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD); and blocked with 300 μl of 10% BlokHen II (Aves Labs Inc., Tigard, OR), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10% SuperBlock solution (Pierce) in IBS for 1 h at room temperature. After a brief rinse with IBS wash buffer, the plates were incubated with chicken anti-BCMO1 antibody (raised against the mouse BCMO1 peptide sequence NYIRKIDPQTLETLEK (Aves Labs, Inc.)) in IBS with 20% fetal bovine serum and SuperBlock for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with IBS, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY (1:1200 in IBS with 20% fetal bovine serum and SuperBlock). The plate was then thoroughly washed (3 × 300 μl/well) and developed for 2 h with 5 μm 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (100 μl/well) in 100 mm diethylamine buffer (pH 9.6) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 3.2 mm Na3N. Fluorescence was read with 355/460-nm filters. All samples were run in duplicate. Iron Determinations—Proteins were purified as described above for in vitro assays. Samples (0.5 ml) were diluted 16-fold with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 100 nm FeSO4 and then reconstituted to the original volume using Amicon Ultra filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 30,000. Analytical reagent blanks were prepared by running buffers through the whole procedure using the same filters, glassware, plasticware, and pipette tips used to process the protein samples. Each sample and the corresponding blank of the same weight (ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 g) were placed in acid-cleaned quartz tubes and dry-ashed (23Baker S.A. Miller-Ihli N.J. Meyers R.A. Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry: Applications of Instrumental Methods. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., West Sussex, United Kingdom2000: 3888-3912Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to a final volume of 3 ml using 18 megohm-cm purity water and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). A Leeman PS3000 spectrometer was used (combination simultaneous and sequential high resolution echelle-based ICP-AES system). Detailed instrumental operating conditions as well as calibration information are summarized elsewhere (24Miller-Ihli N.J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1996; 44: 2675-2679Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NIST-SRM 1640 Trace Elements in Natural Water was run as standard along with all samples to ensure analytical accuracy; iron concentrations determined were in good agreement with the certified value of 34.4 ± 1.6 ng/g. Miscellaneous—Total protein concentration was measured routinely using the Advanced protein assay reagent (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). The NanoOrange protein quantification kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used for measurement of diluted protein solutions (<1 μg/ml). Identification of Perfectly Conserved Amino Acid Residues—Alignment of all known family members from taxonomically diverse organisms revealed ∼40 residues to be absolutely conserved not only in BCMO1 and RPE65, but also in ACO and BCMO2 proteins (Fig. 1). Included among these are four histidines and five acidic residues (not including two in the signature sequence) that we propose to be putative iron-binding residues in all family members. To determine the role of these four histidines and five acidic residues in the catalytic mechanism of BCMO1, we constructed a set of alanine substitution mutants (Fig. 2). We also replaced each of four non-conserved histidines and one non-conserved acidic residue (Glu450) with alanines. These residues are present only in the mammalian members of the family (BCMO1, BCMO2, and RPE65). If our hypothesis is correct, these latter residues should not be crucial for activity or participate in iron binding. We also replaced the first conserved residue in the very acidic signature sequence (Glu469) with alanine. Because we propose that the signature sequence might take part in electron transfer and that overall negative charge is more important than individual residues, this replacement should reduce but not eliminate the catalytic activity. Production of Mutant Forms of BCMO1 and in Vivo Enzymatic Activity—We made use of β-carotene-accumulating pAC-BETA-transformed E. coli cells (20Cunningham Jr., F.X. Pogson B. Sun Z. McDonald K.A. DellaPenna D. Gantt E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1613-1626PubMed Google Scholar) as an in vivo system for measurement of enzymatic activity. In these experiments, pBAD mutant constructs were transformed into competent β-carotene-producing E. coli cells. Cultures were split at mid-log phase; one portion was induced, and the other was not induced. After several hours, induced cultures expressing the wild-type protein and some of the mutants were completely bleached, whereas cultures expressing other mutants did not show bleaching (data not shown). To quantify the amount of all-trans-retinal formed or β-carotene consumed by the enzyme, all-trans-retinal and β-carotene extracted from induced cells were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. Cells were grown in the dark at 30 °C for 3 h after induction, which was the bleach end point for the wild-type protein as judged visually. However, the amount of all-trans-retinal extracted from cells did not linearly correlate with the amount of β-carotene cleaved or the time after induction. This was probably due to further metabolism of all-trans-retinal in the bacterial cells. Therefore, all-trans-retinal production could not be used as a measure of activity in this system. On the other hand, the loss of β-carotene could be used to determine activity by comparing the β-carotene produced by the uninduced portion of the same culture used as a control with that in the induced portion of the culture. The catalytic activity is expressed as the ratio (%) of β-carotene extracted from the induced culture to β-carotene extracted from the uninduced culture, normalized to cell density. It should be emphasized that the presence of all-trans-retinal in cell extracts is an important enzymatic characteristic of the functionally active expressed protein and is an important qualitative correlate of activity. Results for all 15 mutant proteins expressed in the in vivo system are presented in Fig. 3. pBAD/BCMO1 (wild-type) was used as the positive control and pBAD/LacZ as the negative control in our scale of enzymatic activity. We found that all four mutants with replaced conserved histidines (H172A, H237A, H308A, and H514A) neither lost β-carotene nor accumulated all-trans-retinal and thus failed to convert β-carotene to all-trans-retinal, as detected in cell extracts. Mutation of Glu405 to Ala also eliminated catalytic activity (∼100%, no loss of β-carotene). Replacement of the conserved Glu457 led to a substantial reduction in activity (∼80% of β-carotene remaining). On the other hand, mutation of any of the four non-conserved histidines (H49A, H58A, H174A, and H309A) as well as the conserved Glu314 and non-conserved Glu450 did not lead to a dramatic decrease in activity in comparison with wild-type BCMO1. The amount of β-carotene extracted from induced cells compared with uninduced cells was 17.6 ± 1.2% for wild-type BCMO1 and up to 42.6 ± 2.2% for the H309A mutant (Fig. 3). Although these mutations influenced the catalytic activity of the enzyme, they clearly did not abolish it. It is likely that these amino acids are not necessary for metal ion coordination or can be compensated for. The change in the signature sequence Glu469 to Ala led to a significant decrease in activity (52.3 ± 4.9%) in 3 h, and cells expressing the E469A construct were bleached if left growing overnight. In cells expressing either the D52A or E140A mutant, all-trans-retinal was still produced, but the amount of β-carotene degraded was <50%. To investigate further the importance of the last two acidic residues, we constructed two double mutants (D52A/E140A and E140A/H49A) and tested them for activity. The loss of β-carotene was insufficient to make a conclusive comparison with single mutants; however, we found that the E140A/H49A mutant was still able to produce all-trans-retinal, whereas the D52A/E140A mutant failed to do so (Fig. 4). Therefore, these two acidic residues in combination are required for catalytic activity.Fig. 4Reverse phase chromatograms of E. coli cultures expressing the D52A/E140A (red line) and E140A/H49A (blue line) mutants with diode array detection at 383 nm for all-trans-retinal. Cells were induced and grown in the dark for 18 h before extraction. mAu, milli-absorbance units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the different mutants produce comparable amounts of protein in vivo, immunoblots of extracts from 13 cell lines transformed with mutant BCMO1 constructs were analyzed. All cells except for those transformed with the empty pBAD/LacZ construct expressed comparable amounts of proteins of appropriate size (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with the additional mutant cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, the change in the β-carotene extracted reflects a change in the catalytic activity of the mutant enzymes. Kinetic Parameters of Altered Enzymes—To compare the biochemical characteristics of the mutant proteins, we developed an in vitro assay based on the protocol of Lindqvist and Andersson (5Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In recombinant mutant proteins purified by metal affinity (Co2+) chromatography, we could maintain activity for several weeks with storage at -20 °C in 40% glycerol with protease inhibitors. As this procedure resulted in an only partially purified preparation (10-15%), the specific concentration of BCMO1 in the preparation was determined by ELISA using highly purified Rapid Translation System-expressed recombinant BCMO1 as a standard. Recombinant wild-type protein had similar characteristics as reported earlier (3Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with Km = 1.2 μm and Vmax = 104.8 pmol of all-trans-retinal/μg of BCMO1 protein/h. Km and Vmax values were calculated from the averaged Hanes plot (s/v versus s) (Fig. 6). Comparison with published data demonstrated that all previously described single-step affinity-purified preparations of BCMO1 have comparable Km values (1-7 μm), whereas Vmax values based on total protein concentration from the studies of Redmond et al.

https://openalex.org/W2046050946,"Skeletal myopathy is a common complication of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoid excess, yet its pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. There is accumulating evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved in this process. To explore the glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional adaptations that may affect mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, we studied gene expression profiles in dexamethasone-treated primary human skeletal myocytes using a cDNA microarray, which contains 501 mitochondria-related genes. We found that monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) was the most significantly up-regulated gene. MAO-A is the primary enzyme metabolizing catecholamines and dietary amines, and its role in skeletal muscle remains largely unexplored. Dexamethasone induced dose- and time-dependent increases of MAO-A gene and protein expression, while its effects on MAO-B were minimal. Both the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the Sp1 transcription factor were required for dexamethasone-induced MAO-A mRNA expression, as blockade of the GR with RU 486 or ablation of Sp1 binding with mithramycin abrogated MAO-A mRNA induction. The observed dexamethasone effect was biologically functional, as this steroid significantly increased MAO-mediated hydrogen peroxide production. We suggest that MAO-A-mediated oxidative stress can lead to cell damage, representing a novel pathogenetic mechanism for glucocorticoid-induced myopathy and a potential target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2157976102,"CD147, also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer, is a regulator of matrix metalloproteinase production and also serves as a signaling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins. Previously, we demonstrated that cell surface expression of CD147 is sensitive to cyclophilin-binding drug cyclosporin A, suggesting involvement of a cyclophilin in the regulation of intracellular transport of CD147. In this report, we identify this cyclophilin as cyclophilin 60 (Cyp60), a distinct member of the cyclophilin family of proteins. CD147 co-immunoprecipitated with Cyp60, and confocal immunofluorescent microscopy revealed intracellular co-localization of Cyp60 and CD147. This interaction with Cyp60 involved proline 211 of CD147, which was shown previously to be critical for interaction between CD147 and another cyclophilin, cyclophilin A, in solution. Mutation of this proline residue abrogated co-immunoprecipitation of CD147 and Cyp60 and reduced surface expression of CD147 on the plasma membrane. Suppression of Cyp60 expression using RNA interference had an effect similar to that of cyclosporin A: reduction of cell surface expression of CD147. These results suggest that Cyp60 plays an important role in the translocation of CD147 to the cell surface. Therefore, Cyp60 may present a novel target for therapeutic interventions in diseases where CD147 functions as a pathogenic factor, such as cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or rheumatoid arthritis.

Cyclophilins are a family of proteins which share peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) 1The abbreviations used are: PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase; CypA, cyclophilin A; Cyp60, cyclophilin 60; EMMPRIN, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CsA, cyclosporin A; PE, phycoerythrin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FAM, carboxyfluorescein; MFI, mean fluorescent intensity. activity and serve as receptors for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The PPIase activity of cyclophilins is the basis for their proposed role in protein folding (1Ivery M.T. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Another established activity of cyclophilins is regulation of protein trafficking in cells. Cyclophilin A has been shown to be a component of the transport complexes that regulate surface expression of asialoglycoprotein receptor expression in human cells (2Huang T. Deng H. Wolkoff A.W. Stockert R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37798-37803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Drosophila cyclophilin homolog, NinaA, participates in trafficking of rhodopsin, the most abundant subclass of photoreceptors (3Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S.

NinaA and its mammalian counterparts are retina-expressed integral membrane proteins with the cyclophilin-homologous domain located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and intracellular transport vehicles (4Baker E.K.

In all these examples cyclophilins were found to form a specific stable complex with the substrate, suggesting that they function as a chaperone escorting its protein substrate through the traffic pathway. Recent reports suggest that cyclophilins may be involved in cell surface externalization of three other proteins, namely, insulin receptor (8Shiraishi S. Yokoo H. Kobayashi H. Yanagita T. Uezono Y. Minami S. Takasaki M. Wada A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 293: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Flt3 ligand (13Chklovskaia E. Nissen C. Landmann L. Rahner C. Pfister O. Wodnar-Filipowicz A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and CD147 (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In all these cases, treatment of the cells with CsA reduced the cell surface expression of these proteins (insulin receptor, Flt3L, CD147) without altering their total cellular levels, suggesting a block at the level of transition from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. The cyclophilin(s) involved in regulation of trafficking of these proteins have not yet been identified. The mechanisms by which cyclophilins regulate protein trafficking remain unknown. Molecular studies of Drosophila ninaA mutants have shown that CsA has only a minor effect on rhodopsin transport, and ninaA mutations need not be within the PPIase/CsA-binding domain to cause severe reductions in rhodopsin levels (10Ondek B.

Nature. 1989; 338: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cell surface expression of the Flt3 ligand, insulin receptor, and CD147 was greatly reduced by CsA, suggesting involvement of the PPIase/CsA-binding domain of cyclophilin in the regulation of trafficking of these proteins (8Shiraishi S.

The cyclophilin-interacting site has been identified in CD147 as the proline-containing region at the end of the transmembrane helix adjacent to the extracellular domain (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T.

CD147 is a type 1 integral membrane protein shown to regulate intercellular adhesion pathways through an intracellular signaling-mediated mechanism (14Kasinrerk W. Tokrasinwit N. Phunpae P. Immunology. 1999; 96: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and EMMPRIN expressed by cultured tumor cells stimulates fibroblasts to produce very high levels of collagenase activity, which likely facilitates tumor metastasis (15Ellis S.M. Nabeshima K. Biswas C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3385-3391PubMed Google Scholar, 16Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting its key role in the processes of tumorigenesis and metastasis, EMMPRIN was reported as one of the most constantly up-regulated mRNA in metastatic cells (17Klein C.A. Seidl S. Petat-Dutter K. Offner S. Geigl J.B. Schmidt-Kittler O. Wendler N. Passlick B. Huber R.M. Schlimok G. Baeuerle P.A. Riethmuller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Another physiologic role of CD147 relates to its activity as a receptor for extracellular cyclophilins (18Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol.

Since cyclophilins emerge as mediators of intercellular communication that may regulate chemotactic responses in many physiologic and pathologic processes, such as cell-mediated immunity and inflammation (20Bukrinsky M.I. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 323-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), regulation of CD147 expression may determine the outcome of these events. A related activity of CD147 is its role as a cofactor in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, where CD147 likely functions as a receptor for virion-associated CypA, thus increasing virus entry into target cell (21Pushkarsky T. Zybarth G. Dubrovsky L. Yurchenko V. Tang H. Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6360-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify the cyclophilin regulating cell surface expression of CD147 as cyclophilin 60 (Cyp60), a previously described 60-kDa member of the cyclophilin family of proteins (22Wang B.B.

These results suggest that Cyp60 may be an important regulator of intracellular transport. Antibodies and Reagents—Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or PE-conjugated anti-CD147 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Ancell (Bayport, MN), peridinin-chlorophyll protein-cojugated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody was from BD Biosciences, and PE-labeled anti-CD71 monoclonal antibody was from CALTAG Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Anti-GM130 mouse monoclonal antibody was from BD Biosciences, mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-CypA antibody was from United States Biological (Swampscott, MA), and rhodamine and Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cyclosporin A was purchased from Sigma, TOPRO-3 iodide was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Co-immunoprecipitation—CHO cells were transfected with GFP- or CD147.wt-GFP-expressing vectors, cultured for 15 h, and harvested with 2 mm EDTA. Approximately 6 × 105 cells were lysed in TNEP lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100), spun at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and the supernatant (300 μl) was collected and incubated on ice for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Mannheim, Germany). Immune complexes were precipitated by adding protein G beads (50 μl of 50% slurry in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were eluted from beads by adding non-reducing sample buffer to each sample and heating at 60 °C for 3 min. Supernatants were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Western blotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-CypA (1:1000; Affinity Bioreagents) or anti-GFP (1:5000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) antibodies and developed by the ECL procedure (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with vector expressing FLAG-Cyp60 (23Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) together with CD147-GFP or CD147.P211A-GFP-expressing vector. Cells were cultivated for 15 h and harvested with 2 mm EDTA. Approximately 6 × 105 cells were lysed in TNEP lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100), and cell lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and incubated with mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads to remove nonspecifically binding material. NaCl concentration was then adjusted to 300 mm, and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Chemicon) or mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) was added to the lysates. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein G-conjugated beads were added and immune complexes collected, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), goat polyclonal anti-CD147 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Abcam). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. HeLa cells transfected or not with FLAG-Cyp60 were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) raised against recombinant Cyp60 or commercially available polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Affinity BioReagents) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin. They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa546-labeled goat polyclonal antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:1000 and stained with Hoechst 33258 (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Cells were covered with a drop of Gel/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and then viewed and photographed with a Nikon Eclipse E800M microscope equipped with a color chilled 3CCD camera (model C5810; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). CHO K1 cells transfected with CD147-GFP were fixed, permeabilized by incubation in 100 mm glycine in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature using primary mouse monoclonal antibody against Golgi marker GM130 (BD Biosciences) in 4% goat serum in PBS, followed by staining with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at 1:100 dilution. HEK 293T cells co-transfected with CD147-GFP and FLAG-Cyp60 were stained using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Chemicon) and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). TOPRO dye (Molecular Probes) was added together with the secondary antibody to counterstain the nuclei. All images of CHO K1 and HEK 293T cells were acquired using a BX-60 Olympus Epifluorescence microscope (Melville, NY) with an Evolution MP digital camera using Image-Pro Plus Version 4.5 acquisition software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Analysis of CD147 Expression after Subtilisin Treatment—HEK 293T (human embryonic kidney epithelial) cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with 0.3 mg/ml of subtilisin B (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated in RPMI/10% FBS with or without CsA (5 μg/ml). Samples were collected for analysis before the treatment, immediately after the treatment, and following various incubation times. Cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD147 or anti-CD71 antibodies or isotype control and analyzed by flow cytometry. Suppression of Cyp60 Expression by RNA Interference—siRNAs labeled with 6-FAM at the 5′ end were synthesized by IDT Inc. (Coralville, IA). The sequence of the positive strands of siRNAs was as follows: siRNA.wt, 5′-CAGCAACAGGUCUCAAUUCUU-3′ (wild type); siRNA.mut, 5′-CAGCAACAGcagUCAAUUCUU-3′. The small letters denote three changed nucleotides in the mutant siRNA. siRNAs were transfected into HEK 293T cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cyclophilin 60 Co-immunoprecipitates with CD147—Our recent results suggested that cell surface expression of CD147 is regulated by a cyclophilin (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also showed that mutation of proline 211 in the transmembrane domain of CD147 (CD147.P211A) abrogates binding of CypA to CD147 in solution and abolishes sensitivity of CD147 surface expression to CsA. Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that CD147 has extended half-life on the cell surface (data not shown), suggesting that its turnover is a relatively slow process. Since CD147 interaction with cyclophilin regulates delivery of CD147 to the plasma membrane (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the best chances to detect it are in CD147-transfected cells characterized by unregulated high level expression of CD147. To test whether CD147 associates intracellularly with cyclophilin, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation analysis. As our previous studies (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were done in CHO cells, we used the same cells in the first experiments. CHO cells were transfected with the GFP-CD147- or GFP-CD147.P211A-expressing constructs and cultivated in the presence or absence of CsA for 48 h. Untransfected CHO cells or cells transfected with the GFP-expressing vector were used as negative controls. GFP-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to CypA (the most abundant cellular cyclophilin) or GFP. It should be noted that the polyclonal anti-CypA antibody used here recognizes most cyclophilins in different species (data not shown). Therefore, it was expected to react with hamster CypA, should it co-precipitate with CD147. To our surprise, no CypA-specific band (∼18 kDa) was revealed (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Instead, in the immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with GFP-CD147, the antibody to CypA revealed a band (marked with a star on the upper panel of Fig. 1A) corresponding to a protein with an approximate molecular mass of 60 kDa. The intensity of this band was substantially weaker in the immunoprecipitate from CsA-treated GFP-CD147-transfected cells (consistent with demonstrated sensitivity of CD147 cell surface expression to CsA (9.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar)), and no such band was observed in the immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with the GFP-CD147.P211A mutant construct (defective in binding to CypA (9.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar)) or in untransfected or GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 1A, upper panel). To verify that the same amount of proteins was loaded in each lane, we stripped the blot and re-developed it using anti-GFP antibody. Two bands (57 and 76 kDa) and a smear above the 76-kDa band revealed in cells transfected with wild-type or mutant GFP-CD147 correspond to variously glycosylated forms of the GFP-CD147 fusion protein (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). We conclude that CD147 interacts intracellularly with a cyclophilin that has a molecular mass of 60-kDa. Among various cyclophilins described in the literature, only one species, Cyp60, has been reported to have a molecular mass close to 60 kDa (22Wang B.B. Hayenga K.J. Payan D.G. Fisher J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cyp60 associates with CD147 in human cells, we transfected HEK 293T cells with FLAG-tagged Cyp60, immunoprecipitated it using anti-FLAG antibody, and tested for CD147 in the immunoprecipitate using anti-CD147 mAb. Indeed, CD147 was found in the precipitate (Fig. 1B), while β-actin, used to control the specificity of interaction, was not precipitated (data not shown). Several CD147-specific bands on the blot relate to differently glycosylated forms of the protein. In a reverse pull-down analysis, FLAG-Cyp60 was revealed in the immunoprecipitate with the anti-GFP antibody from HEK 293T cells co-transfected with FLAG-Cyp60 and CD147-GFP (Fig. 1C). Cyclosporin A greatly reduced the amount of FLAG-Cyp60 co-immunoprecipitating with CD147-GFP, supporting the hypothesis that CD147-Cyp60 interaction involves the enzymatic site of Cyp60. Interaction between CD147 and Cyp60 was also abrogated by the mutation of the proline residue 211 (Fig. 1D), which was shown previously to be critical for interaction between CD147 and cyclophilin A in solution (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that Cyp60 interacts with CD147 in a CsA-dependent fashion; this interaction also involves the Pro211 residue of CD147. Cyp60 Regulates the Cell Surface Expression of CD147— Previously, we demonstrated that cell surface expression of CD147 is sensitive to CsA (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To check whether Cyp60-CD147 interaction accounts for the observed sensitivity to CsA, we suppressed Cyp60 expression in HEK 293T cells using the RNA interference approach. Cyp60-specific siRNA (siRNA.wt) greatly reduced expression of Cyp60 without affecting expression of CypA (Fig. 2A). This effect of siRNA was eliminated by changing three nucleotides in the Cyp60 siRNA sequence (siRNA.mut), thus demonstrating the specificity of the observed inhibition. We next studied the effect of Cyp60 suppression on reconstitution of cell surface CD147 after treatment with subtilisin, which is commonly used as a plasma membrane protein stripping agent (24Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Kane B.P. Busch L.K. Johnson D.G. Sowder R.C. Chertova E.N. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7734-7743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, CD147 surface expression on HEK 293T cells was greatly reduced (although not completely eliminated) by subtilisin treatment (peak with light shading marked “sub 0h”) but was almost completely restored after 12 h of incubation in complete medium (this peak was identical to the peak showing fluorescence distribution in cultures treated with CsA solvent, ethanol, which is labeled “sub 12h”). In the presence of CsA, reconstitution of CD147 on the cell surface was delayed: at the 12 h time point, expression of CD147 (presented as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI)) was almost 2-fold lower in CsA-treated cells (peak labeled “sub 12h + CsA”) than in cells treated with ethanol (relative mean fluorescence intensity (RMFI) = 1.9, Fig. 2B). Importantly, no such reduction was observed with another transmembrane protein, transferrin receptor (CD71), thus indicating the specificity of the CsA effect. We then analyzed CD147 re-expression in HEK 293T cells transfected with siRNA.wt or siRNA.mut. The siRNAs used for this analysis were labeled with FAM, thus allowing to gate on transfected cells. Results presented in Fig. 2C (upper left panel) demonstrate that surface expression of CD147 was reduced in cultures transfected with siRNA.wt as compared with cultures transfected with siRNA.mut. The reduction (∼2-fold) was similar to that observed with CsA (Fig. 2B and the left panel in the bottom row), suggesting that Cyp60 is the main (and likely the only) cyclophilin that regulates CD147 intracellular trafficking. This conclusion was supported by our finding that treatment with CsA did not further reduce CD147 surface expression in cells transfected with siRNA.wt (middle left panel in Fig. 2C). The observed effects were specific for CD147, as expression of the transferrin receptor (CD71) was not affected by Cyp60-specific siRNAs (right panel in the top row in Fig. 2C), consistent with its insensitivity to CsA (right panels in Fig. 2B and in the bottom row in Fig. 2C). Similarly, no shift in CD71 reconstitution was induced by a combination of CsA and Cyp60-specific siRNA (right panel in the middle row in Fig. 2C). Cyp60 Partially Co-localizes with CD147—Cyp60 was previously reported to localize to the cell nuclei when overexpressed in transfected cells (22Wang B.B. Hayenga K.J. Payan D.G. Fisher J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using anti-FLAG antibody, we analyzed the intracellular localization of FLAG-Cyp60 in transfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, in many cells FLAG-Cyp60 was found to be almost evenly distributed between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. In HEK 293T cells co-transfected with FLAG-Cyp60 and CD147-GFP, partial co-localization of Cyp60 and CD147 was observed (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the most prominent co-localization of these proteins occurred at the plasma membrane (yellow staining marked by arrows in the merged image on Fig. 3B). Therefore, Cyp60 appears to accompany CD147 to the plasma membrane, thus functioning as a classical chaperone molecule. Taken together, these results support the model where cyclophilin 60, via interaction with the proline-containing region adjacent to the transmembrane domain of CD147, regulates CD147 transport from the Golgi network to the plasma membrane. The experiments presented in this report demonstrate that the surface expression of CD147 is regulated by a distinct member of the cyclophilin family, Cyp60. The mechanism of this activity involves interaction of Cyp60 with the proline-containing region within or adjacent to the predicted transmembrane domain CD147. When this interaction was blocked, either by CsA or by mutating the critical proline residue, expression of CD147 on the cell surface was significantly delayed. This effect is consistent with the proposed role of cyclophilins in assisting the transport of the proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (4Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Shiraishi S. Yokoo H. Kobayashi H. Yanagita T. Uezono Y. Minami S. Takasaki M. Wada A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 293: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cyp60 has been previously cloned from a Raji B lymphocyte library in a two-hybrid screen using serine proteinase inhibitor eglin c as bait (22Wang B.B. Hayenga K.J. Payan D.G. Fisher J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Wang and co-authors reported nuclear localization of Cyp60 and suggested that it may chaperone nuclear proteins or be involved in their proper folding (22Wang B.B. Hayenga K.J. Payan D.G. Fisher J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our analysis demonstrated that in cells overexpressing Cyp60 it localizes both to the nuclei and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Localization of endogenous Cyp60 awaits preparation of a specific antibody that would distinguish this cyclophilin from the other members of this family of proteins. Cyp60 co-localized with CD147 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this cyclophilin may function as a chaperone escorting CD147 through the secretory pathway. Previously, a similar function was described for Drosophila cyclophilin homolog NinaA, which regulates secretion of its protein target rhodopsin (4Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Cyp60, however, is the first mammalian cyclophilin implicated in protein transport to the plasma membrane. It appears to be the only cyclophilin involved in CD147 membrane transport, as cyclosporin A treatment did not add anything to the effect of Cyp60-specific siRNA (Fig. 2C). Cyp60 interaction with CD147 involves proline 211 in the transmembrane domain. This proline residue is close to the extracellular domain of CD147 and is likely to be accessible in the lumen of the Golgi vesicles (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CD147-interacting domain of Cyp60 must be on the luminal side of the Golgi membrane to access this site. Since, unlike NinaA, Cyp60 is not predicted to be an integral transmembrane protein, it is likely secreted into the lumen. In contrast, CypA is a cytosolic protein and thus may not have access to Pro211 of CD147, which may explain why no CypA was co-immunoprecipitated with CD147, despite CypA binding to CD147 in solution (25Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CD147 has been shown to interact with several other proteins that may influence its localization. For example, when association of CD147 with monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 was disrupted by mutating a critical glutamic acid residue 218 in the transmembrane domain of CD147, neither CD147 nor MCT1 reached the plasma membrane (26Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3666-3672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CD147 also interacts with caveolin-1 on a cell surface and this interaction seems to negatively regulate clustering and activity of CD147 (27Tang W. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11112-11118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although its role in CD147 cell surface expression has not been investigated. Finally, leucine 252 in the cytoplasmic domain of CD147 was identified as a basolateral signal which targets CD147 to the basolateral membrane in extraocular epithelia (28Deora A.A. Gravotta D. Kreitzer G. Hu J. Bok D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4148-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This signal seems to function only in some cell types (e.g. it was not recognized in human retinal pigment epithelium cells (28Deora A.A. Gravotta D. Kreitzer G. Hu J. Bok D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4148-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)), suggesting that it mediates interaction with some cell-specific regulator of protein trafficking. Future studies will hopefully integrate these findings to suggest a comprehensive model of CD147 trafficking. Our finding that CD147 expression is regulated by Cyp60 opens new opportunities for treating diseases where CD147 functions as a pathogenic factor. One example is rheumatoid arthritis, where levels of CD147 on reactive neutrophils and cyclophilin in synovial fluids have been shown to correlate with disease severity (29Konttinen Y.T. Li T.F. Mandelin J. Liljestrom M. Sorsa T. Santavirta S. Virtanen I. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Another is cancer where CD147 (EMMPRIN) was shown to be enriched on the surface of tumor cells and may play a key role in matrix metalloproteinase production and tumor cell invasion (30Sameshima T. Nabeshima K. Toole B.P. Yokogami K. Okada Y. Goya T. Koono M. Wakisaka S. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Sun J. Hemler M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2276-2281PubMed Google Scholar). Yet another example is human immunodeficiency virus infection, which depends on CD147 for high virus replication (21Pushkarsky T. Zybarth G. Dubrovsky L. Yurchenko V. Tang H. Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6360-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that expression of CD147 can be reduced by agents targeting Cyp60, such as CsA or Cyp60-specific siRNA, suggesting new approaches to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS, or prevention of metalloproteinase-dependent cancer metastasis. In conclusion, our results identify a novel mechanism for regulation of plasma membrane expression of CD147/EMMPRIN and, by inference, a family of related integral membrane proteins. This mechanism involves interaction between the proline-containing transmembrane region of CD147 and cyclophilin 60, which leads to efficient trafficking of the protein from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Future studies will identify other proteins regulated by Cyp60 and will determine the molecular events involved in this regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2044053799,"The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes a life-threatening meningoencephalitis by expression of virulence factors such as melanin, a black pigment produced by the cell wall-associated enzyme laccase. In previous studies (Heung, L. J., Luberto, C., Plowden, A., Hannun, Y. A., and Del Poeta, M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21144–21153) we proposed that the sphingolipid enzyme inositol-phosphoryl ceramide synthase 1 (Ipc1) regulates melanin production through the generation of diacylglycerol (DAG), which was found to activate in vitro protein kinase C1 (Pkc1). Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which DAG regulates Pkc1 in vivo and the effect of this regulation on laccase activity and melanin synthesis. To this end we deleted the putative DAG binding C1 domain of C. neoformans Pkc1 and found that the C1 deletion abolished the activation of Pkc1 by DAG. Deletion of the C1 domain repressed laccase activity and, consequently, melanin production. Finally, we show that these biological effects observed in the C1 deletion mutant are mediated by alteration of cell wall integrity and displacement of laccase from the cell wall. These studies define novel molecular mechanisms addressing Pkc1-laccase regulation by the sphingolipid pathway of C. neoformans, with important implications for understanding and targeting the Ipc1-Pkc1-laccase cascade as a regulator of virulence of this important human pathogen.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that infects humans via the respiratory tract. Dissemination of the infection leads to development of a life-threatening meningoencephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients. An important factor that enables C. neoformans to cause disease is the pigment melanin, which is proposed to protect the fungus from the host immune response (1.Williamson P.R. Front.

Despite the importance of laccase and melanin to the path-ogenicity of C. neoformans, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which they are regulated.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), have proposed roles in the regulation of laccase. The Gα protein-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway has also been shown to regulate melanin production by C. neoformans (12.Alspaugh J.A. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3206-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13.Alspaugh J.A. Pukkila-Worley R. Harashima T. Cavallo L.M. Funnell D. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Kronstad J.W. Heitman J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3179-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). More recently, we have identified a novel regulatory pathway initiated by the sphingolipid enzyme inositol-phosphoryl ceramide synthase (Ipc1), 1The abbreviations used are: Ipc1, inositol-phosphorylceramide synthase 1; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; DAG, diacylglycerol; Pkc1, protein kinase C 1; NAT1, nourseothricin acetyltransferase 1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DPG, dipalmitoylglycerol; WT, wild type. which transfers an inositol-phosphoryl moiety from phosphatidylinositol to phytoceramide to produce inositol-phosphorylceramide (IPC) and diacylglycerol (DAG). We found that the effects of Ipc1 on melanin production are potentially propagated through the generation of DAG and the subsequent activation of protein kinase C 1 (Pkc1) (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The sphingolipid pathway is an important source of cell signaling molecules not only in mammalian cells but also in fungal cells. For example, the sphingolipid pathway has crucial roles in the heat stress response (16.Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17.Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19.Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The roles and mechanisms of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in pathogenic fungi, however, have not been extensively explored. The putative Ipc1-DAG-Pkc1 pathway is the first evidence that the sphingolipid pathway is crucial to the regulation of fungal virulence. Additionally, the existence of this pathway establishes a key role for DAG generated from sphingolipid metabolism in eukaryotic signal transduction. C. neoformans Pkc1 contains a putative DAG binding domain, or C1 domain, which is highly homologous to the C1 domain of DAG-dependent mammalian PKCs (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The role of the C1 domain as a mediator of DAG-Pkc1 signaling in fungal organisms is not well defined. Whereas biochemical data suggests that C. neoformans Pkc1 is activated by DAG (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), fungal Pkc1 homologs from S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans are not regulated by DAG (20.Watanabe M. Chen C.Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16829-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Paravicini G. Mendoza A. Antonsson B. Cooper M. Losberger C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16821-16828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian PKC isoforms regulated by DAG have conserved residues in the C1 domain required for DAG activation (Pro11, Gly23, and Gln27) as well as five hydrophobic residues surrounding the DAG-binding site (positions 8, 13, 20, 22, and 24) (23.Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The three DAG-binding site residues and four of the five hydrophobic residues are conserved in the C1 domain of C. neoformans Pkc1 (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) but largely absent from the C1 domains of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans Pkc1 enzymes (24.Schmitz H.P. Heinisch J.J. Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, C. neoformans Pkc1 presents a unique opportunity to study the role of the C1 domain as a site of DAG regulation in a fungal system. In the present study we investigated the in vivo mechanism of DAG-Pkc1 signaling and the role of this regulation in laccase activity and melanin formation. We found that the C1 domain is required for the activation of Pkc1, and in vivo the C1 deletion decreases laccase activity and melanin production in C. neoformans. We further established that through the regulation of cell wall integrity, the Ipc1-DAG-Pkc1 pathway may modulate the proper localization of the laccase enzyme to the fungal cell wall. Strains, Growth Media, and Reagents—C. neoformans var. grubii serotype A strain H99 (wild type) and C. neoformans strain GAL7::IPC1 (25.Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were routinely grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium or Difco™ yeast nitrogen base (YNB) plus 2% glucose. Yeast extract/peptone (YP) or YNB media supplemented with 2% galactose or 2% glucose was used for the up- and down-regulation of IPC1 expression in the GAL7::IPC1 strain. All chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Lipid Extraction—Approximately 5 × 109 cells were collected from overnight liquid cultures, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (26.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The amount (nmol) of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in each sample was measured as previously described (27.Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triton-X-100/lipid mixed micelles were prepared (28.Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with lipids at 8 mol% (based on Pi measurements) and used in the in vitro kinase assay with recombinant C. neoformans Pkc1 protein, which was expressed in S. cerevisiae and immunoprecipitated as described previously (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Tagging of PKC1 Gene—To facilitate the study of endogenously expressed Pkc1 in Cryptococcus, the PKC1 gene was tagged with the V5 epitope in both wild type and GAL7::IPC1 strains. To produce the PKC1::V5 construct, a fragment of the 3′-untranslated region of the PKC1 locus was amplified using the primers PKCTAG3 (5′-CAT GAT ATC CAC GAC GAA GAG CAT GAG CAT GGA C-3′) and PKCTAG4 (5′-CTA CTC GAG GAG TGT GTG TGT CAT GTC TAG AGG C-3′, which contains a XhoI site (boldface and underlined)). This 3′-untranslated region (UTR) fragment was subcloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen), digested with EcoRI, blunted, digested with XhoI, and ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO-NAT1 (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which had been digested with EcoRV and XhoI, thereby yielding pNAT1–3′-UTR. This plasmid contains the nourseothricin acetyltransferase 1 gene (NAT1) that confers resistance to the antibiotic nourseothricin (Werner BioAgents, Jena-Cospeda, Germany). The 3′ end of the PKC1 gene was amplified using the primers PKCTAG1 (5′-CAT GAG CTC CAA TCC GAG AAA CGT GTG TTT TTG-3′, which contains a SacI site (boldface and underlined)) and PKCTAG2 (5′-CTA GGA TCC CTA CGT AGA ATC GAG ACC GAG GAG AGG GTT AGG GAT AGG CTT ACC GGC TTG TGC TGC AGC CCA AGG AGC-3′, which contains a BamHI site (boldface and underlined) and V5 epitope tag (italics)). This PKC1::V5 fragment was digested with SacI and BamHI and ligated into pNAT1–3′-UTR region digested with SacI and BamHI. The resulting pPKC1::V5 was transformed into C. neoformans strains H99 and GAL7::IPC1 by biolistics as described previously (29.Toffaletti D.L. Rude T.H. Johnston S.A. Durack D.T. Perfect J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates containing 100 mg/liter nourseothricin. Genomic DNA was extracted from stable transformants, digested with EcoRV, and used for Southern blot analysis. Deletion of the C1 Domain of Pkc1—A ΔC1-PKC1 construct was produced by amplifying fragments of the PKC1 gene upstream and downstream of the C1 domain using the primers 5′C1-up (5′-CAT AGA GCT CCG ATA TGA CGC ACC ACT GAC C-3′) and 3′C1-up (5′-GCG CAA GCT TAC CAT TCA TTT CGT AGA CAT C-3′), which contain SacI and HindIII sites, respectively (boldface and underlined), and C1-down (5′-CGT CAA GCT TGG TAT GAC TAT GGA GAT GGC C-3′), which contains a HindIII site (boldface and underlined) and PKCTAG2 (see sequence above), which contains a BamHI site and V5 epitope tag. The two fragments were subcloned separately into pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). Next, pPKC1::V5 (see above) was digested with SacI and BamHI to excise the PKC1::V5 fragment, and the remaining vector was ligated with the C1-up and C1-down fragments that had been digested from pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector. The resulting pΔC1-PKC1::V5 was transformed into C. neoformans H99 and GAL7::IPC1 strains by biolistics, and transformants were selected on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates containing 100 mg/liter nourseothricin. Genomic DNA was extracted from stable transformants, digested with EcoRI, and used in Southern blot analysis. Laccase Activity and Melanin Production—Laccase activity was measured using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as a substrate, as previously described (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The specific activity of laccase is defined as nmol of ABTS oxidized (ϵ420 nm = 36 mm-1 cm-1) (30.Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar)/min/107 cells. Melanin production was assessed by growing cells on agar plates containing l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, as previously described (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Pkc1 and ΔC1-PKC1 Proteins and Measurement of Kinase Activity—C. neoformans IPC1/PKC1::V5 and IPC1/ΔC1-PKC1::V5 strains were grown in YP-glucose broth for 24 h in a 30 °C shaker. After 2 washes with sterile distilled deionized water, cells were then inoculated into YP-galactose broth and grown for 18 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected, resuspended in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and lysed by mechanical disruption as previously described (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration of the cell lysates was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay. To prepare antibody-bead complexes, 2 μl of anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) were combined with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (50% slurry) (Amersham Biosciences) in 1-ml final volume of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °Con a rocking platform. The antibody-bead complexes were washed twice with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. To pre-clear the cell lysate, an aliquot containing 30 μg of total protein was placed in 1-ml final volume of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 200 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry), rocked at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was added to the antibody-bead complexes, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The activities of immunoprecipitated Pkc1 and ΔC1-PKC1 enzymes were measured as previously described (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzymes conjugated to protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow were washed twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor). The reaction was started by the addition of the reaction mixture (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml histone type III-SS (Sigma H-4524), 1× Triton-X-100/lipid mixed micelles, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, 5 μCi/reaction of [γ-32P]ATP). Triton-X-100/lipid mixed micelles were prepared as previously described (28.Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 2.5 mol% dipalmitoylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 4× Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, loaded in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in a 50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid solution, rehydrated, and dried on gel blot paper. Radioactively labeled phosphorylated histone was visualized by auto-radiography and quantitated by the PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Specific activity was defined as pmol of histone phosphorylated/min/mg of lysate, although it may vary according to the level of expression of the recombinant protein. The moles of phosphorylated histone were calculated using a standard curve of reaction mix containing both unlabeled ATP and [γ-32P]ATP, which had been spotted onto gel blot paper and scanned by phosphorimaging concurrently with the dried gels. The amount of total lysate corresponding to the amount of recombinant immunoprecipitated Pkc1 used in the assay was determined by running an aliquot of the immunoprecipitate with a standard curve of total lysate containing the recombinant protein on Western. Spheroplast Measurements—Spheroplasting of C. neoformans cells was performed as previously described (31.Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Cryptoccus neoformans. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 381-405Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in YNB supplemented with 2% glucose or galactose for 16 h. The pellet was washed 3 times with 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, resuspended in a 5% β-mercaptoethanol solution in sterile water, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in SCE solution (1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 0.01 m EDTA) containing lysing enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum (Sigma) at 10 mg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with occasional mixing. Spheroplasts were counted using differential interference contrast on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. At least 4 fields of ∼50 cells each were counted. Calcofluor Staining and Transmission Electron Microscopy—C. neoformans strains were grown in YNB supplemented with 2% galactose and stained with Calcofluor™ White M2R (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were observed by UV light microscopy. For transmission electron microscopy cells were pelleted and fixed in 2% cacodylate glutaraldehyde for 1 h, rinsed overnight in cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide for 1 h, and rinsed in distilled water. Samples were then dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol: 50% EtOH for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 15 min, 95% EtOH for 15 min, and twice in 100% EtOH for 15 min each. Transition to infiltration was begun using the intermediate fluid, propylene oxide, for 2 changes of 15 min each. Samples were first infiltrated with a 1:1 solution of propylene oxide and EmBed 812 embedding resin for 1 h and continued with a 1:2 solution of propylene oxide and EmBed 812 overnight. Samples were embedded in pure EmBed 812 and cured in a 60 °C oven for 48 h. Thin sections of 70 nm were cut using a Reichert ultra-microtome and collected on copper grids. The heavy metal salts of uranyl acetate and lead citrate were used for staining, and the sections were examined using a JEOL JEM1210 electron microscope. Supplies for electron microscopy were obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Cell Wall Extraction—Crude cell wall preparations were made similar to the method used by Zhu et al. (5.Zhu X. Gibbons J. Garcia-Rivera J. Casadevall A. Williamson P.R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added in a volume equal to ¾ of the cell suspension, and the cells were homogenized in a Mini-Beadbeater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) 3 times for 45 s at 4 °C. Total cell lysate was aspirated from the beads and transferred to a new tube. Beads were washed once with lysis buffer, and the wash liquid was added to the tube containing the cell lysate. Microscopic observation confirmed complete lysis of cells. The lysate was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was designated the cell wall fraction and separated from the supernatant. The cell wall fraction was resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 2% SDS and boiled for 10 min. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation of both cell wall and supernatant fractions, protein pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer by boiling for 10 min. Capsule Induction—C. neoformans strains IPC1/PKC1::V5 and IPC1/ΔC1-PKC1::V5 were grown in YNB media supplemented with 2% glucose for 24 h in a 30 °C shaker. Cells were pelleted, resuspended, and inoculated into induction media (3 g/liter BBL™ Sabouraud liquid broth modified antibiotic medium 13 (BD Biosciences), 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.3) at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cultures were grown for 40 h in a 30 °C shaker, stained with india ink, and observed by light microscopy. To measure capsule size, pictures were taken of five different fields of each sample at 40× magnification, and the areas of the capsules of 20 cells from each field (100 total cells) were measured using LabWorks software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred onto Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Pkc1 and ΔC1-PKC1 proteins tagged with the V5 epitope were detected using anti-V5 antibody at 1:2000 dilution in 5% milk, 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. Laccase was detected using anti-laccase monoclonal antibody clone G3P4D3 (a gift from Dr. Peter Williamson, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine) at 2.6 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin, 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Lipids Modulated by Ipc1 Regulate Activation of C. neoformans Pkc1—Because our previous studies indicated that Ipc1 modulates DAG and phytoceramide levels in C. neoformans cells and that Pkc1 activity is regulated by DAG and phytoceramide in vitro (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether modulation of Ipc1 in C. neoformans cells regulates the activity of Pkc1. Therefore, Ipc1 expression was modulated in the GAL7::IPC1 strain by growing cells in the presence of glucose (repressing conditions) or galactose (inducing conditions). As a control the wild type strain H99 was grown under the same conditions. Next, total lipids were extracted from each of the cultures, and their effect on the activity of recombinant C. neoformans Pkc1 was measured by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1). When Pkc1 was treated with lipids from cells in which Ipc1 was down-regulated (GAL7::IPC1 grown on glucose), kinase activity decreased by 30.7% relative to treatment with lipids from the wild type cells grown in glucose (p < 0.05). Conversely, when Pkc1 was treated with lipids from cells in which Ipc1 was up-regulated (GAL7::IPC1 grown on galactose), kinase activity increased by 21.4% compared with treatment with lipids from wild type cells grown on galactose. No difference in Pkc1 activity was observed between treatment with lipids from the wild type cells grown in glucose or galactose. Therefore, the lipids that are modulated by Ipc1 in vivo regulate the activity of C. neoformans Pkc1. Deletion of C1 Domain from Pkc1 in C. neoformans—To study whether the putative DAG binding domain, or C1 domain, plays a role in the regulation of Pkc1 in C. neoformans, the C1 domain was deleted from the PKC1 locus, and a V5 epitope tag was fused to the C terminus (Fig. 2A) in both the wild type and GAL7::IPC1 strains, yielding the C. neoformans strains IPC1/ΔC1-PKC1::V5 and GAL7::IPC1/ΔC1-PKC1::V5 (Fig. 2B). The wild type PKC1 gene was also tagged with the V5 epitope (Fig. 2C) in the wild type and GAL7::IPC1 strains, yielding Cryptococcus strains IPC1/PKC1::V5 and GAL7::IPC1/PKC1::V5 (Fig. 2D). As illustrated in Fig. 2E, we detected a single band at ∼120 kDa, the predicted size of Pkc1 including the V5 epitope tag, in the IPC1/PKC1::V5 and GAL7::IPC1/PKC1::V5 strains. In the IPC1/ΔC1-PKC1::V5 and GAL7::IPC1/ΔC1-PKC1::V5 strains, a single band at ∼110 kDa is detected, which is the expected size of the ΔC1-PKC1 protein fused to the V5 epitope. The expression of the ΔC1-PKC1::V5 protein was similar to that of the PKC1::V5 protein in the background of both parental strains. We next examined whether deletion of the C1 domain would affect the growth of Cryptococcus and found that there were no significant changes in growth between the wild type, GAL7::IPC1, IPC1/PKC1::V5, and GAL7::IPC1/PKC1::V5 strains in YP-galactose media at 30 °C (data not shown). Deletion of the C1 Domain Abolishes Activation of Pkc1 by DAG—Next, we wanted to determine whether the C1 domain plays a role in the activation of Pkc1 by DAG. The Pkc1 and ΔC1-PKC1 proteins were immunoprecipitated, and their abilities to phosphorylate the substrate histone in the presence and absence of dipalmitoylglycerol (DPG) were measured (Fig. 3A). In the presence of DPG, the activity of wild type Pkc1 significantly increased by more than 2-fold (p < 0.05), whereas there was no significant increase in activity of ΔC1-PKC1 in the presence of DPG. The specific activities of the Pkc1 and ΔC1-PKC1 proteins were similar in the absence of lipids at 14.2 ± 4.1 and 17.1 ± 3.7 pmol of histone phosphorylated/min/mg of lysate protein, respectively. Therefore, the C1 domain of Pkc1 mediates activation by DAG similar to mammalian PKC. Deletion of the C1 Domain Significantly Represses Laccase Activity and Melanin Production in C. neoformans—Because the Ipc1-DAG-Pkc1 pathway regulates melanin production by C. neoformans (15.Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the data above suggest that the C1 domain is required for the activation of Pkc1 by DAG, we investigated the effect of deletion of"
https://openalex.org/W2055983969,"Mice born without CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) develop renal failure and nephrotic syndrome about 4 weeks after birth and die around 6 weeks of age. Although CD2AP is widely expressed, the severity of the renal failure precludes a clear determination of the role of CD2AP in other tissues. Here we generated transgenic mice expressing CD2AP using a podocyte-specific promoter. Podocyte-specific expression of CD2AP prevented the development of proteinuria, demonstrating that the renal failure is solely due to loss of CD2AP in podocytes and not in other renal or in immune cells. CD2AP-deficient mice are long-lived and appear phenotypically normal. Histological analysis demonstrated testicular abnormalities that were age-related. CIN85, a paralog of CD2AP, is poorly expressed in both the podocyte and the basal seminiferous tubule, suggesting that the loss of CD2AP in specific tissues may be compensated for by CIN85. Mice born without CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) develop renal failure and nephrotic syndrome about 4 weeks after birth and die around 6 weeks of age. Although CD2AP is widely expressed, the severity of the renal failure precludes a clear determination of the role of CD2AP in other tissues. Here we generated transgenic mice expressing CD2AP using a podocyte-specific promoter. Podocyte-specific expression of CD2AP prevented the development of proteinuria, demonstrating that the renal failure is solely due to loss of CD2AP in podocytes and not in other renal or in immune cells. CD2AP-deficient mice are long-lived and appear phenotypically normal. Histological analysis demonstrated testicular abnormalities that were age-related. CIN85, a paralog of CD2AP, is poorly expressed in both the podocyte and the basal seminiferous tubule, suggesting that the loss of CD2AP in specific tissues may be compensated for by CIN85. CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) 1The abbreviations used are: CD2AP, CD2-associated protein; KO, knock-out; Erk2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2.1The abbreviations used are: CD2AP, CD2-associated protein; KO, knock-out; Erk2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. was originally cloned as a protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of CD2, a T lymphocyte- and natural killer-specific membrane protein (1Dustin M.L.

Although originally cloned from a lymphocyte library, CD2AP is broadly expressed and found in all tissues except brain. Recently, a gene related to CD2AP was cloned. The protein encoded by this gene, CIN85, is also widely expressed and found in most tissues including brain (2Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Int.

CIN85 was originally cloned as an interactor of c-Cbl (3Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the p85-α subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (4Gout I. Middleton G. Adu J. Ninkina N.N. Drobot L.B. Filonenko V.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The broad expression of CD2AP in most tissues suggested that CD2AP would have functions in cells outside of the immune system. The phenotype of CD2AP-deficient mice, which develop massive proteinuria around 3 weeks of age, develop nephrotic syndrome around 4 weeks of age, and ultimately die from renal failure at 6-10 weeks of age, suggested an important role for CD2AP in the kidney (6Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In the kidney, CD2AP is expressed mainly by the podocytes, proximal tubule, and collecting duct (7Li C. Ruotsalainen V. Tryggvason K. Shaw A.S. Miner J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F785-F792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the first detectable defect was podocyte foot process fusion, we postulated that podocyte dysfunction was the underlying cause of the renal failure, although the major histological feature of the lesion is significant mesangial expansion (6Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In addition, whether CD2AP plays important roles in other organs was potentially masked by the severe renal failure in CD2AP-deficient animals.Here we report that transgenic mice expressing CD2AP in podocytes are completely rescued from the renal phenotype of CD2AP deficiency. No proteinuria was detected, and the mice appeared to have a life span similar to wild-type animals. This demonstrates that the most important functions of CD2AP are in the kidney. Interestingly, transgenic/CD2AP-deficient male animals are infertile, and this is supported by histological studies. This suggests that CD2AP also plays an important role in the development of sperm in the testes.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of Transgenic Mice and Genotyping—A cDNA encoding Myc-tagged CD2AP was ligated into a vector containing the nephrin promoter (kind gift of S. Quaggin) (8Wong M.A. Cui S. Quaggin S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F1027-F1032PubMed Google Scholar). The transgenic construct was purified away from vector backbone and used for microinjection into mouse pro-nuclei in the Department of Pathology Transgenic Core Facility at Washington University Medical School. Founders were identified using a PCR-based strategy and were bred to animals heterozygous for the cd2ap-null allele to establish a colony of breeders positive for the transgene and heterozygous at the cd2ap locus. Transgene genotyping PCR was performed with primers (forward, 5′-GGCACCAAAGAATGTTCCTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CATCCTTGGGTTCTGTCTCTCG-3′) that amplify the region of the transgene joining the mouse nephrin promoter to the CD2AP cDNA and yield a 750-bp product. PCR was performed using standard conditions. Animals selected for experiments were euthanized according to approved protocols.Immunoblotting—Immortalized podocytes were obtained as a generous gift from Peter Mundel (9Mundel P. Reiser J. Zuniga Mejia Borja A. Pavenstadt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Whole kidneys, organs, or isolated podocytes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1% Nonidet P-40; 5 mm aprotonin; and 5 mm leupeptin. Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA method (Pierce), and equivalent amounts were fractionated by denaturing SDS-PAGE. Protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with rabbit anti-CD2AP and rabbit anti-Erk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-CD2AP or mouse anti-synaptopodin (generous gift of Peter Mundel) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch).Histology—After dissection, kidneys and testes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) at 4 °C. Tissues were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and taken to the Histopathology Laboratory at Washington University Medical School for paraffin-embedding, sectioning, and staining with eosin and hematoxylin.Immunohistochemistry—After dissection, kidneys and testes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and immediately frozen in tissue molds containing OCT compound (Tissue Tek). Sections were collected onto fibronectin-coated slides and stained with rabbit anti-CD2AP and rat anti-entactin or goat anti-vimentin (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies or rabbit anti-CIN85 and rat anti-entactin antibodies followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch), or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibodies. Lymphocytes were collected on poly-l-lysine-coated slides and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse T cell receptor-β monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences).RESULTSGeneration of Podocyte-specific CD2AP Transgenic Animals—The CD2AP cDNA was appended with sequences encoding a Myc epitope and ligated into an expressing vector containing the mouse nephrin promoter that directs expression specifically in podocytes (8Wong M.A. Cui S. Quaggin S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F1027-F1032PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated using standard microinjection techniques, and two founder animals (line 21 and line 396) were identified. Both founders were bred to CD2AP heterozygous mice to generate transgenic, CD2AP-deficient mice (6Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These mice were grossly normal and have life spans that are not noticeably different from wild-type animals with survival at least to 15 months.Immunoblot analysis of whole kidney lysates with a rabbit anti-CD2AP serum confirmed transgene expression in both founder lines (Fig. 1, top immunoblot, lanes 3 and 4). Immunoblots of various organs revealed no ectopic expression of the transgene except in muscle (Fig. 1, bottom immunoblot). Transgene expression levels in the kidney appeared to be considerably lower than the levels detected in a CD2AP heterozygous control mouse (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 1), but CD2AP is expressed in tubules and collecting duct in addition to its expression in podocytes (7Li C. Ruotsalainen V. Tryggvason K. Shaw A.S. Miner J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F785-F792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining was therefore used to assess the specificity of transgene expression as well as relative levels of CD2AP as compared with heterozygous controls. In control CD2AP heterozygous animals, CD2AP antibodies stained glomeruli in the typical, ribbon-like pattern consistent with podocyte expression (Fig. 2, A and B). CD2AP expression was also clearly detectable in tubular epithelia. CD2AP knock-out animals were used as negative controls (Fig. 2, C and D). Staining of transgenic KO mice from line 21 (Fig. 2, E and F) and line 396 (Fig. 2, G and H) demonstrated podocyte-specific expression of the CD2AP without detectable transgene expression in tubular epithelium. The staining intensity of CD2AP suggests that podocyte expression levels of the transgene were comparable with levels observed in heterozygous controls. (Fig. 2, compare E and G with A). Transgenic expression of CD2AP was not seen in T cells (Fig. 2, I-L). Immunoblots of lysates from multiple tissues, including brain, intestine, and liver, were negative for Myc-tagged CD2AP (data not shown).Fig. 2Transgene is expressed in mouse glomeruli but not tubules or T lymphocytes. Cortical sections (A, C, E, and G) or medullary sections (B, D, F, and H) of kidney were stained with rabbit anti-CD2AP antibody. A and B, in CD2AP haplo-insufficient animals, the CD2AP staining pattern indicates expression in glomeruli (podocytes) as well as in tubular epithelial cells. In CD2AP-deficient animals, no CD2AP expression is observed. E-H, in both transgenic lines, CD2AP expression is observed in glomeruli but not in tubular regions of the kidney. Peripheral T lymphocytes were collected from wild-type (I and J) and transgene-positive CD2AP KO mice (K and L) and identified with anti-mouse T cell receptor (TCR-β) antibody (J and L). Anti-CD2AP antibody stained wild-type T cells; however, there was no expression on transgene-positive CD2AP KO lymphocytes.

However, its paralog, CIN85, is more strongly expressed in the mesangial cell rather than the podocyte (Fig. 3, D-F). The intraglomerular staining of CIN85 did not change in the CD2AP KO (Fig. 3, G-I). In immunoblots from lysates of immortalized podocyte cell lines, however, there is weak expression of CIN85 (Fig. 3J).Fig. 3CD2AP and CIN85 are enriched in different glomerular regions. Glomeruli of wild-type (A-F) and CD2AP KO mice (G-I) were stained with either rabbit anti-CD2AP (A) or rabbit anti-CIN85 antibody (D and G) and co-stained with mouse anti-synaptopodin antibody (B, E, H, and I), which is specific for podocytes and does not stain mesangium. The merge is shown in C, F, and I. By immunofluorescence, CD2AP is enriched in the podocyte, whereas CIN85 is enriched in the mesangium. J shows an immunoblot of equally loaded lysates of immortalized wild-type podocytes (WT Pod, left lane) and CD2AP knockout podocytes (CD2AP -/- Pod, middle lane). Positive controls (right lane) include 293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged CD2AP or mouse epithelial fibroblasts (MEF). The immortalized podocytes express low levels of CIN85 with no change in expression levels with CD2AP deficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Phenotypic Characterization of Transgenic, CD2AP-deficient Mice—Transgenic CD2AP-deficient animals were tested for proteinuria. Although CD2AP-deficient animals develop proteinuria around 3 weeks of age, transgenic/CD2AP-deficient animals did not exhibit proteinuria at any time, and these studies were followed up to 14 months. In addition, serum chemistries were found to be within normal ranges and comparable with wild-type mice as tested out to 10 months, including blood urea nitrogen (KO, 22 mg/dL, standard deviation 2.0; wild type, 19 mg/dL, standard deviation 3.3), creatinine (KO 0.6 mg/dL, standard deviation 0; wild type, 0.6 3 mg/dL, standard deviation 0.05), and glucose (103 mg/dL, standard deviation 12). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of formalin-fixed kidney sections showed no apparent differences between wild-type and transgenic CD2AP-deficient mice (Fig. 4). Thus, podocyte-specific expression of CD2AP completely ameliorated the renal defects of the CD2AP-deficient animals.Fig. 4Kidneys from transgenic, CD2AP-deficient mice are histologically normal. H + E stains of kidney sections from 11-week-old wild-type mouse (A), 7-week-old CD2AP-deficient mouse (B), a 16-week-old transgenic, CD2AP-deficient mouse from line 21 (C), and an 11-week-old transgenic, CD2AP-deficient mouse from line 396 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since CD2AP and CIN85 are proposed to be involved in the down-regulation of growth factor receptors (10Soubeyran P.

Science. 2003; 302: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we analyzed the propensity of transgenic/CD2AP-deficient mice to develop tumors. Histological analysis of multiple organs from 10.5-month-old transgenic/CD2AP-deficient animals did not reveal any obvious neoplastic processes (data not shown). Furthermore, breeding onto a tumorigenic background (p53 heterozygosity) did not increase the incidence of tumors as compared with p53 single-null animals (data not shown).Since CD2AP has also been implicated in down-regulation of T cell receptor signal transduction, we also looked for evidence of autoimmunity (12Lee K.H. Dinner A.R. Tu C. Campi G. Raychaudhuri S. Varma R. Sims T.N. Burack W.R. Wu H. Wang J. Kanagawa O. Markiewicz M. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Chakraborty A.K. Shaw A.S. Science. 2003; 302: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). There was no histological evidence of any chronic inflammatory process up to 10 months of age. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of splenocytes from wild-type and transgene-positive, CD2AP-deficient mice demonstrated normal ratios of B cells to T cells without elevation of CD44+ T cells in transgenic, KO mice, indicating that the basal state of T lymphocyte activation is normal in these animals.Infertility in Transgenic/CD2AP-deficient Mice—During the course of establishing and expanding both transgenic lines, we found that transgene-positive, CD2AP-deficient male mice were infertile. Histological analysis on testes from KO and wild-type mice showed decreased numbers of mature spermatids in transgenic, CD2AP KO mice as compared with littermate controls (Fig. 5). Although there were some hypocellular seminiferous tubules at 5 weeks of age, the majority of the seminiferous tubules were histologically normal (Fig. 5, A and D). The hypocellularity and sperm loss became more apparent and more widespread as the mice aged (Fig. 5, B, C, E, and F). To confirm that CD2AP is expressed in testes, we stained sections of testes with CD2AP antibodies. We found that CD2AP is specifically expressed in vascular endothelial cells, in Leydig cells, and in the basal portion of the seminiferous tubule (Fig. 6A). Co-staining with anti-vimentin antibody, which in the seminiferous tubule is a marker for Sertoli cells but not for germ cells, revealed partial co-localization of CD2AP with Sertoli cells (Fig. 6, D-F). In Sertoli cells, CD2AP was localized primarily to the basal-lateral surface. Interestingly, when we stained with antibodies to the CD2AP paralog, CIN85, we found a distinct non-overlapping pattern of expression with staining restricted to areas adjacent to and within the lumens of the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 6C). The staining pattern for CIN85 in the wild-type testes was identical in CD2AP KO animals (data not shown). The immunofluorescence findings suggested non-redundant patterns of expression of CD2AP and CIN85 in testis and suggested that CD2AP plays an important role in the supporting cells of the seminiferous tubule and also potentially in immature spermatocytes and spermatogonia.Fig. 5Decreased mature spermatid production in transgenic, CD2AP-deficient mouse seminiferous tubules. H+E stains of wild-type (A-C) and CD2AP-deficient (D-F) testes. Testes were harvested from 5-week-old (A and D), 16-week-old (B and E), or 10.5-month-old (C and F) mice. Note the relative hypocellularity and the reduction in mature (tail bearing) spermatids in the lumen of seminiferous tubules from older CD2AP-deficient mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6CD2AP and CIN85 are differentially expressed in wild-type mouse testis. Sections of mouse testis were stained with rabbit anti-CD2AP on wild-type testes (A, oblique cut) with background staining on CD2AP knock-out testes used as a negative control (B). Anti-CIN85 antibodies (C, red) were co-stained with anti-vimentin, which is used as a marker for Sertoli cells but not germ cells (C, green). Anti-CD2AP (D) was co-stained with anti-vimentin (E). The merge (F) reveals that CD2AP partially co-localizes with vimentin at the basal portion of the seminiferous tubules with apparent staining of both Sertoli cells and spermatogonia. CIN85, in contrast, localizes within and adjacent to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONAlthough CD2AP is widely expressed, CD2AP-deficient animals die of kidney failure at 6-8 weeks of age (6Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Although the pathology of the kidney is most notable for mesangial changes with the deposition of significant amounts of mesangial matrix by 4 weeks of age, the specific expression of CD2AP in podocytes, proximal tubule, and collecting duct led us to propose that the absence of CD2AP in podocytes was responsible for the massive renal failure. Because the mice begin developing proteinuria around 3 weeks of age and die around 6 weeks of age (6Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), it was not clear whether other tissues might be affected by the absence of CD2AP. To answer these questions, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing CD2AP on a podocyte promoter (8Wong M.A. Cui S. Quaggin S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F1027-F1032PubMed Google Scholar). When bred to the CD2AP knock-out, we found that the transgene could completely rescue the kidney phenotype of the CD2AP-deficient mouse.We found some ectopic expression of transgenic CD2AP in muscle; however, this should impact neither the kidney phenotype nor the immune phenotype. Importantly, there has been no report of nephrin expression in skeletal muscle in mouse (13Putaala H. Sainio K. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or human (14Kuusniemi A.M. Kestila M. Patrakka J. Lahdenkari A.T. Ruotsalainen V. Holmberg C. Karikoski R. Salonen R. Tryggvason K. Jalanko H. Pediatr. Res. 2004; 55: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, despite expression of nephrin in the mouse hindbrain (13Putaala H. Sainio K. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is no evidence of brain transgene brain expression by immunoblot.Surprisingly, given the wide expression of CD2AP, the CD2AP-deficient, transgenic animals have a normal life span and did not exhibit any obvious abnormalities. This suggests that the place where CD2AP is most important is in the podocyte or that other related molecules can compensate for CD2AP in other tissues. There is one CD2AP paralog, CIN85, which is also broadly expressed in multiple tissues (2Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).We have now identified two areas, the podocyte and the basal seminiferous tubule, where CD2AP is highly expressed, whereas CIN85 is weak or absent. In the seminiferous tubules, antibodies to CD2AP reacted mainly with the seminiferous epithelium, which is composed of Sertoli cells and immature spermatocytes. Antibodies to CIN85, in contrast, only stained the more apical portions of the seminiferous tubule, where mature spermatocytes exist. This suggested that the loss of CD2AP is having a specific effect on the seminiferous epithelium.These two tissues with a mutually exclusive pattern of expression of CD2AP and CIN85, the glomerulus and testes, also developed the most severe phenotype in the setting of CD2AP deficiency, suggesting that these two proteins may be somewhat redundant and that loss of one protein may be compensated for by the presence of the paralog. It will be interesting to evaluate the phenotype of a true CIN85 knock-out animal, and eventually, an animal deficient in both of these proteins.The Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier and provide an environment that supports the development of spermatocytes. Junctional complexes between Sertoli cells prevent the egress of large proteins from the serum into the luminal space of the tubule. This is proposed to function to protect immature spermatocytes from the immune system as they develop as well as to optimize the microenvironment for proper sperm maturation (reviewed in Ref. 16Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 747-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The stem cells, the spermatogonia, sit in a position at the base of the epithelium and are outside of the blood-testis barrier. As spermatocytes develop (and begin to express new antigens), the spermatocytes move toward the lumen by traversing the space between the Sertoli cells. To do this, they must break and reform junctional complexes to reach the lumen of the tubule (16Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 747-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Similar to its postulated role in the kidney, CD2AP may play an important role in the biogenesis or stability of junctional complexes in the testis.Since the testes look histologically normal in young animals, CD2AP is not required to form a normal testis architecture. We suspected that the absence of CD2AP leads either to Sertoli cell loss or to dysfunction with a concomitant breakdown of the blood-testis barrier as the mice age. In this way, the phenotype of the testis is similar to the kidney phenotype of CD2AP-deficient mice. The kidneys of CD2AP-deficient animals appear histologically normal until around 2-3 weeks of age when proteinuria is first detected (6Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). We have postulated a role for CD2AP in the function of the slit diaphragm and suggested a breakdown in this specialized junctional complex as blood begins to flow through the glomerular capillaries at high pressure soon after the mice are born. Breakdown of the junctional complexes could result in both podocyte and Sertoli cell loss as well as access of the luminal contents to self-reactive antibodies.Because CD2AP-deficient T cells show hyper-reactive responses (12Lee K.H. Dinner A.R. Tu C. Campi G. Raychaudhuri S. Varma R. Sims T.N. Burack W.R. Wu H. Wang J. Kanagawa O. Markiewicz M. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Chakraborty A.K. Shaw A.S. Science. 2003; 302: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we were interested to see whether CD2AP-deficient animals might have an increased incidence of autoimmunity or cancer. Work from several laboratories has suggested that CD2AP and CIN85 are involved in down-regulation of tyrosine kinase-based receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and the T cell receptor (10Soubeyran P.

Our own work suggests that the defect is not on internalization but rather is related to multivesicular body formation (18Kim J.M. Wu H. Green G. Winkler C.A. Kopp J.B. Miner J.H. Unanue E.R. Shaw A.S. Science. 2003; 300: 1298-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found no evidence of autoimmunity or cancer in animals examined up to 1 year of age. This could be related to increased levels of apoptosis (19Huber T.B. Hartleben B. Kim J. Schmidts M. Schermer B. Keil A. Egger L. Lecha R.L. Borner C. Pavenstadt H. Shaw A.S. Walz G. Benzing T. Mol.

Nevertheless, we are currently testing to see whether these transgenic, CD2AP-deficient animals are more susceptible to the induction of autoimmune diseases.Lastly, given the hyperproliferative phenotype of CD2AP-deficient T cells and the deposition of immunoglobulin into the basement membranes of CD2AP heterozygous mice, it was possible that the kidney disease was related to immunologic damage rather than primary podocyte dysfunction. The successful rescue of the kidney phenotype of CD2AP-deficient animals with podocyte-specific expression of CD2AP convincingly demonstrates that the kidney dysfunction is primar"

Individual features exhibit apparent motions of 10 to 20 arc seconds per year, independently confirmed by near-infrared observations. The observed tangential velocities are at roughly the speed of light. It is likely that the moving structures are infrared echoes, in which interstellar dust is heated by the explosion and by flares from the compact object near the center of the remnant."
https://openalex.org/W2118127018,"MT1-MMP is a type I transmembrane proteinase that promotes cell migration and invasion. Here, we report that MT1-MMP is palmitoylated at Cys574 in the cytoplasmic domain, and this lipid modification is critical for its promotion of cell migration and clathrin-mediated internalization. The palmitoylation-defective mutant (C574A) failed to promote cell migration and was not internalized through clathrin pathway like wild-type, but it was internalized through the caveolae pathway. Reintroducing a cysteine at different positions in the cytoplasmic tail of the C574A mutant revealed that the position of the palmitoylated cysteine relative to LLY573, a motif that interacts with mu2 subunit of adaptor protein 2, is critical for the cell motility-promoting activity of MT1-MMP and its clathrin-mediated internalization. Taken together, palmitoylation of MT1-MMP is one of the key posttranslational modifications that determines MT1-MMP-dependent cell migration."

The enzyme is a dimer of heterodimers, (αβ)2. The (αβ) heterodimer, which arises by autoproteolytic cleavage of the immature protein, exhibits an αββα-sandwich fold, typical for Ntn-hydrolases.

Proteins undergo several age-dependent spontaneous modifications that can limit their useful lifetime. In particular, deamidated, racemized, or isomerized derivatives can be formed in an intramolecular succinimide-mediated rearrangement involving l-asparaginyl or, in a 13–36-fold slower reaction (1.Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), l-aspartyl residues (2.Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol.

The major product is an l-isoaspartyl (iAsp) 1The abbreviations used are: iAsp, isoaspartyl residue; AGA, N4-(β-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-l-asparaginase (aspartylglucosaminidase, EC 3.5.1.26); EcAIII, E. coli iaaA gene product; O-MT, l-isoaspartyl(d-aspartyl)-O-methyltransferase (EC 3.4.11.18); Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 1The abbreviations used are: iAsp, isoaspartyl residue; AGA, N4-(β-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-l-asparaginase (aspartylglucosaminidase, EC 3.5.1.26); EcAIII, E. coli iaaA gene product; O-MT, l-isoaspartyl(d-aspartyl)-O-methyltransferase (EC 3.4.11.18); Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.-containing protein, in which the peptide backbone has been transferred to the side chain forming a β-peptide. Such a serious structural rearrangement usually leads to protein dysfunction. Two mechanisms have been proposed by which organisms may handle the useless proteins and prevent accumulation of the harmful iAsp (3.Mudgett M.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4.Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

One well defined mechanism involves the repair of some products of spontaneous damage to intracellular proteins. It is based on the enzyme l-isoaspartyl(d-aspartyl)-O-methyltransferase (O-MT), which is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals and plants and initiates the repair pathway by methylation of l-isoaspartyl residues (and d-aspartyl residues in racemized derivatives) (6.O'Connor C.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5985-5995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the quite wide range of recognized substrates, the repair activity of O-MT is limited (8.Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J.

The damaged proteins that are not identified and repaired by the enzyme are degraded by cellular proteases to free amino acids and to the relatively stable iAsp-containing di- and tripeptides. To prevent accumulation of those harmful isoaspartyl peptides, specialized enzymes with peptidase activity are required (10.Dorer F.E. Haley E.E. Buchan D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 127: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Enzymes with isoaspartyl peptidase activity (EC 3.4.19.5) were initially isolated from mammals (10.Dorer F.E. Haley E.E. Buchan D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 127: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and bacteria (11.Haley E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5748-5752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies have revealed the existence of two classes of isoaspartyl peptidases. The first class includes metallopeptidases represented by the Escherichia coli (12.Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4076-4087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Salmonella enterica (5.Larsen R.A. Knox T.M. Miller C.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3089-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) proteins, both encoded by the iadA gene. Sequence analysis of the E. coli IadA protein suggested its similarity to bacterial dihydroorotases and imidases, which are involved in the metabolism of pyrimidines (12.Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4076-4087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of E. coli IadA confirmed its structural homology to these enzymes, as well as the presence of zinc cations (13.Thoden J.B. Marti-Arbona R. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4874-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14.Jozic D. Kaise J.T. Huber R. Bode W. Maskos K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The second class of isoaspartyl peptidases is represented by the E. coli iaaA gene product and its S. enterica homolog (5.Larsen R.A. Knox T.M. Miller C.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3089-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These enzymes belong to the family of Ntn (N-terminal nucleophile) hydrolases, first classified by Brannigan et al. (15.Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), which, according to a recent study by Elkins et al. (16.Elkins J.M. Kershaw N.J. Schofield C.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), may actually form a subclass of Ntn-enzymes with more general (not necessarily hydrolytic) activities. Ntn-hydrolases are expressed as enzymatically inactive precursors that become activated upon autoproteolytic cleavage, which generates two subunits, α (N-terminal) and β (C-terminal). The N-terminal residue of subunit β, a threonine, serine, or cysteine, acts as the active nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism. The crystal structures reported for several members of this family, including ornithine acetyltransferase (16.Elkins J.M. Kershaw N.J. Schofield C.J. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), have revealed that, although the amino acid sequences of these proteins vary considerably, they all have the same fold. The polypeptide chains of these proteins are organized into a sandwich of two extended parallel β-sheets, flanked on both sides by α-helices. This topology is usually described as the αββα-fold (26.Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2329-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), a term that illustrates the spatial organization of the secondary structure elements. Each of the two active sites (at the N-terminal nucleophiles of subunits β) of an Ntn heterotetramer is located between the β-sheets. The iaaA gene product from E. coli was originally classified as a new, plant-type asparaginase, and named EcAIII (27.Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. ColladoVides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y.

Jaskolski M. Acta Biochim. Polon. 2001; 48: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), because of high sequence homology to enzymes believed to function as plant l-asparaginases. It also shows sequence similarity to aspartylglucosaminidases (AGAs) (30.Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which are involved in the breakdown of glycosylated proteins. However, the recently reported kinetic data indicate that the dominant activity of both EcAIII and genuine plant asparaginases is connected with the hydrolysis of isoaspartyl dipeptides, whereas their affinity for l-asparagine is relatively weak, particularly when compared with the affinity of classic bacterial asparaginases (30.Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is also no detectable activity toward N-acetylglucosaminyl-l-asparagine, a typical substrate of aspartylglucosaminidases (5.Larsen R.A. Knox T.M. Miller C.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3089-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30.Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the homologous enzyme from S. enterica is not a rigorous dipeptidase, because it is also capable of hydrolyzing tripeptides with an N-terminal isoaspartyl residue (5.Larsen R.A. Knox T.M. Miller C.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3089-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Among dipeptides, iAsp-Leu is recognized with the highest affinity. The structure of free EcAIII has been determined and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) independently by two groups. Borek et al. (31.Borek, D. (2001) Structural and Biochemical Studies of Asparaginases, Ph.D. Thesis, A. Mickiewicz University, PoznanGoogle Scholar) determined the structure of EcAIII at low and high calcium concentration (PDB accession codes 1K2X and 1JN9, respectively), and later Prahl et al. (32.Prahl A. Pazgier M. Hejazi M. Lockau W. Lubkowski J. Acta Cryst. D. 2004; 60: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported a structure that is essentially identical to the former (1T3M). Here, we describe the crystal structure of EcAIII in complex with l-aspartate (PDB accession code 1SEO), which is a product of the two reactions catalyzed by the enzyme (Fig. 1), as well as a mimic of the substrate of the l-asparaginase reaction. We report the ligand binding mode and investigate the conformational changes in the active site and in the overall architecture of the protein that occur upon ligand binding. Finally, the structure of the EcAIII·Asp complex provides insights into the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of the enzyme. Crystallization—EcAIII was produced and purified as previously described (30.Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Single crystals of a complex between EcAIII and l-aspartate were obtained using a modification of the protocol developed for the free enzyme (33.Borek D. Jaskolski M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1505-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The crystals were grown by the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The precipitant solution contained 17% polyethylene glycol 4000, 13% polyethylene glycol 400, 80 mm CaCl2, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, and 100 mm sodium l-aspartate. The molar excess of l-aspartate was about 200-fold. The protein solution at a concentration of 15 mg/ml was mixed with equal volumes of the precipitant solution (2 plus 2 μl). The crystals reached their maximum size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm in 12 days. They belong to the orthorhombic system, space group P212121. Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data extending to 1.9-Å resolution were collected for a single crystal flash-frozen at 100 K in a gas nitrogen stream using the mother liquor as cryoprotectant. Synchrotron radiation generated at the MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden) beam-line I711 was used. The data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL suite (34.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar). The search model, consisting of the complete (αβ)2 heterotetramer, was generated from the coordinates of the free enzyme deposited in the PDB under the accession code 1K2X (31.Borek, D. (2001) Structural and Biochemical Studies of Asparaginases, Ph.D. Thesis, A. Mickiewicz University, PoznanGoogle Scholar). The molecular replacement approach gave a clear solution characterized by an R factor of 36% and a correlation coefficient of 67%. The presence of the ligand molecules in the two active sites was clearly visible in the preliminary Fo - Fc electron density maps generated with phases calculated from the protein model only. Residues 1 and 162–178 from chain A (subunit α), 1 and 158–178 from chain C (subunit α), and 314–321 from chains B and D (subunits β) were not visible in the electron density maps even at the conclusion of the refinement. Cysteine 63 in both subunits α (chains A and C) carries a clear covalent modification at the Sγ atom, which according to the appearance of the electron density maps has been modeled as a β-mercaptoethanol residue. As in the free enzyme, the α subunits coordinate a structurally important sodium cation. At the initial stage of the refinement, the CNS program (36.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The final R and Rfree factors converged at, respectively, 16.4% and 18.9%, and the model is characterized by very good geometry (r.m.s.d. from ideal bond lengths 0.014 Å, from ideal bond angles 1.39°).

Structure Solution and Crystal Packing—EcAIII in complex with l-aspartate crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 49.9, b = 77.3, c = 147.5 Å. The asymmetric unit contains the (αβ)2 assembly, i.e. a dimer of heterodimers (Fig. 2a), corresponding to a Matthews volume of 2.3 Å3/Da and solvent content of 46.4% (41.Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar). Because one of the polymorphs of the free enzyme (1K2X) crystallizes in the same space group with nearly identical cell parameters (a = 50.3, b = 77.6, c = 148.2 Å) and the same cell contents (31.Borek, D. (2001) Structural and Biochemical Studies of Asparaginases, Ph.D. Thesis, A. Mickiewicz University, PoznanGoogle Scholar), it seemed natural that an electron density map calculated with the “complex” amplitudes and “free” phases should provide the structure solution. However, such a map was not interpretable. For that reason the structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the free enzyme as the probe. The solution revealed that, despite apparent crystallographic similarities, these two crystals have quite different molecular packing. Description of the Structure—The molecular structure is created from four polypeptide chains, which have arisen from the breakdown, into subunits α and β, of two original precursors, 321 residues each. The biological assembly is, therefore, a heterotetramer, or a dimer of heterodimers, (αβ)2. The maturation process consists of the proteolytic splitting of the Gly178-Thr179 peptide and of additional degradation of all the termini, except of the N terminus of subunit β with the catalytic Thr179. The removal of the Met1 residue at the N terminus of subunit α is carried out by an E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase (42.Hirel P.H. Schmitter J.M. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The C termini of both subunits are degraded in a slower process, which after prolonged incubation produces the following products: Gly2–Ala161 (subunit α, 160 residues) and Thr179–Gly315 (subunit β, 137 residues) (30.Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the maturation process leaves the two disjointed chain ends spatially separated, the α and β subunits originating from the same precursor are intertwined into a single protein core, particularly with regard to the extended β-sheet, which is created from strands contributed by both subunits. In particular, the N-terminal β-chains of both subunits are placed as adjacent antiparallel strands within the β-sheet structure (Fig. 2). In the final model built into electron density maps, chain A corresponds to the full mature subunit α, residues 2–161, whereas four residues are missing from the C terminus of chain C (2–157), presumably as a result of disorder. Both β subunits, chains B and D, are composed of residues 179–313, i.e. they have two residues missing at their C termini. In both α subunits, the Sγ atom of Cys63 is chemically modified by a covalent S–S attachment of β-mercaptoethanol (used in the protein preparation protocol), resulting in a modified residue annotated as Cme63. The modification does not seem to have any structural or functional consequences. The topology of the EcAIII (αβ) heterodimer is similar to that of other Ntn-hydrolases, with a typical αββα-layer structure (26.Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2329-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The protein core is composed of two open β-sheets, positioned to face each other, with their strands following the same general direction. The smaller one consists of four antiparallel β-strands belonging to subunit β. The larger β-sheet is composed of eight β-strands contributed by both subunits and an additional (ninth) strand (S3β′) contributed by the other heterodimer. The overall antiparallel character of this β-sheet is violated by strand S4α, which is parallel to S3α. The layer of helices that pack on the outside of the nine-stranded β-sheet consists of five α-helices and of two 310 helices. The four-stranded β-sheet is flanked by four α-helices forming a broad crossover loop between the antiparallel strands S5β and S6β. Although EcAIII has a general fold similar to aspartylglucosaminidases, structural alignments reveal several important differences visible especially in the organization of the secondary structure elements of subunit α (Fig. 2c). In particular, the N-terminal elements S1α and H2α of EcAIII are much longer, placing the loop connecting them ∼17 Å away from the corresponding AGA loop. Metal Coordination—The loop between H3α and S2α comprises 19 residues and has a complicated conformation supported by a metal cation with a coordination geometry that is close to octahedral. The metal is chelated exclusively by main-chain C=O groups provided by residues Leu60, Glu61, Cme63, Phe66, Ala68, and Ile70 in this loop (Fig. 3a). By analogy to the structure of the free enzyme (31.Borek, D. (2001) Structural and Biochemical Studies of Asparaginases, Ph.D. Thesis, A. Mickiewicz University, PoznanGoogle Scholar), the metal cation has been identified as Na+. This interpretation has been confirmed by (i) unacceptable B factors refined for species with significantly different numbers of electrons and by (ii) the coordination geometry, in particular when interpreted by the bond valence method (43.Muller P. Kopke S. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The coordination spheres of both Na+ centers are very similar, with the Na+...O distances ranging from 2.2 to 2.7 Å, and the O...Na+...O angles distributed within the intervals 81–107 and 159–173°. Quaternary Structure of EcAIII—In analogy to aspartylglucosaminidases, EcAIII forms a dimer of heterodimers (αβ)2. The interface between the two (αβ) heterodimers involves a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. The main interactions are found between helices H2β and between strand S4α from one (αβ) unit and strand S3β′ from the other. This antiparallel interaction (which occurs twice in the heterotetramer) extends the eight-stranded β-sheet formed within one (αβ) heterodimer into a nine-stranded structure, within which three out of the four polypeptide chains of the (αβ)2 heterotetramer meet. Additional hydrogen bonds responsible for oligomerization are formed between helix H1β and two loops from the complementary (αβ) unit. The first loop connects helix H4α with strand S4α, whereas the second loop is a hairpin connecting strands S2α and S3α. Similar regions determine the quaternary structure of AGAs, but the fragment classified here as S3β (44.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar) was interpreted as a loop in the aspartylglucosaminidase fold (17.Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18.Guo H.C. Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The S3β element belongs to the most conserved region of the amino acid sequences of the compared enzymes (Gly206–Pro212 in EcAIII numbering). The main difference between the interfaces found in the present isoaspartyl peptidase and in aspartylglucosaminidases is the presence in EcAIII of a pair of interacting Tyr251 residues at the C termini of the H2β helices, which bring these helices closer together. The tetrameric structure of EcAIII is found both in crystal and in solution (30.Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This is also true for human AGA (17.Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas for the bacterial enzyme no (αβ)2 tetramers have been observed by size exclusion chromatography (19.Xuan J. Tarentino A.L. Grimwood B.G. Plummer Jr., T.H. Cui T. Guan C. Van Roey P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The lower stability of F. meningosepticum AGA tetramers cannot be attributed to the absence of a random coil domain at the C terminus of subunit α (19.Xuan J. Tarentino A.L. Grimwood B.G. Plummer Jr., T.H. Cui T. Guan C. Van Roey P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), because no such domain is present in EcAIII. The non-crystallographic symmetry of the molecule corresponds to a nearly ideal 2-fold rotation (179.7°), as in the free enzyme, but the r.m.s.d. between the superposed Cα atoms is relatively high (0.45 Å). The source of this discrepancy lies in some small but significant deviations between the α-subunits (0.50 Å), whereas the β-subunits are practically identical (0.28 Å). The differences between the α-subunits seem to be d"

They are assembled by the oligomerization of triple-helical protomers, composed of three α-chains. The trimeric noncollagenous domains (NC1) of each protomer interact forming a hexamer structure. Upon exposure to acidic pH or denaturants, the hexamer dissociates into monomer and dimer subunits, the latter reflect distinct interactions that reinforce/cross-link the quaternary structure of hexamer. Recently, the cross-link site of the α1α1α2 network was identified, on the basis of x-ray crystal structures at 1.9-Å resolution, in which the side chains of Met93 and Lys211 were proposed to be connected by a novel thioether bond (Than, M. E., Henrich, S., Huber, R., Ries, A., Mann, K., Kuhn, K., Timpl, R., Bourenkov, G. P., Bartunik, H. D., and Bode, W. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 6607-6612); however, at the higher resolution of 1.5 Å, we found no evidence for this cross-link (Vanacore, R. M., Shanmugasundararaj, S., Friedman, D. B., Bondar, O., Hudson, B. G., and Sundaramoorthy, M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 44723-44730). Given this discrepancy in crystallographic findings, we sought chemical evidence for the location and nature of the reinforcement/cross-link site. Trypsin digestion of monomer and dimer subunits excised a ∼5,000-Da complex that distinguished dimers from monomers; the complex was characterized by mass spectrometry, Edman degradation, and amino acid composition analyses. The tryptic complex, composed of two peptides of 44 residues derived from two α1 NC1 monomers, contained Met93 and Lys211 post-translationally modified to hydroxylysine (Hyl211). Truncation of the tryptic complex with post-proline endopeptidase reduced its size to 14 residues to facilitate characterization by tandem mass spectrometry, which revealed a covalent linkage between Met93 and Hyl211. The novel cross-link, termed S-hydroxylysyl-methionine, reflects at least two post-translational events in its formation: the hydroxylation of Lys211 to Hyl211 within the NC1 domain during the biosynthesis of α-chains and the connection of Hyl211 to Met93 between the trimeric NC1 domains of two adjoining triple-helical protomers, reinforcing the stability of collagen IV networks.

Collagen IV networks are components of basement membranes that underlie epithelia, compartmentalize tissue, and influence cell behavior. The networks are assembled from a family of six polypeptide chains (α1-α6) that associate forming three subtypes of triple-helical protomers with distinct chain compositions: α1α1α2, α3α4α5, and α5α5α6 (1Hudson B.G.

At the interface of the head-to-head connection, the trimeric NC1 domains exist as a hexamer, a stable complex that can be excised by cleavage with collagenase for in vitro studies. The NC1 domain plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the distinct collagen IV networks. In protomer assembly, the NC1 domains (monomers) of three chains interact, forming a NC1 trimer, to select and register chains for triple-helix formation. In the network assembly, the NC1 trimers of two protomers interact, forming a NC1 hexamer structure, to select and connect protomers. Upon exposure to acidic pH or denaturants, isolated NC1 hexamer dissociates into monomers and dimers, the latter reflecting the presence of cross-links that stabilize the trimer-trimer interface. The cross-links connect α1-like monomers (α1-α1, α1-α5, and α3-α5) and α2-like monomers (α2-α2, α2-α6, and α4-α4) (3Borza D.B. Bondar O. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Naito I. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

For two decades, the reducible dimers were thought to consist of monomers bound by disulfide cross-links (5Siebold B. Deutzmann R. Kuhn K. Eur. J.

However, the recent x-ray crystal structures of the NC1 hexamers of bovine lens capsule basement membrane and human placenta basement membrane, determined independently by us (7Sundaramoorthy M.

However, in a subsequent study at the higher resolution of 1.5 Å, we found no evidence for this cross-link (9Vanacore R.M. Shanmugasundararaj S. Friedman D.B. Bondar O. Hudson B.G. Sundaramoorthy M.

Given this discrepancy in crystallographic findings, we sought chemical evidence in the present study for the location and nature of the reinforcement/cross-link site. We used tryptic digestion in combination with mass spectrometry as a strategy to search for post-translational modifications that may go undetected by crystallography. The results revealed that the site is located at the trimer-trimer interface of the NC1 hexamer, characterized by a novel covalent cross-link: S-hydroxylysyl-methionine. The cross-link is uniquely labile to conditions typically used for characterization, rendering it a challenge for detection. The findings are the first report of chemical evidence for the location and nature of the reinforcement/cross-link site, and the presence of Hyl within the NC1 domain. Materials—Bovine placenta was purchased from Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rodgers, AR). PBM NC1 hexamer was prepared by collagenase digestion as previously described (10Langeveld J.P. Wieslander J. Timoneda J. McKinney P. Butkowski R.J. Wisdom Jr., B.J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10481-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial collagenase (CLSPA) was purchased from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). Separation of Monomers and Dimers—Monomers and dimers of the NC1 domain were isolated as described elsewhere with minor modifications (10Langeveld J.P. Wieslander J. Timoneda J. McKinney P. Butkowski R.J. Wisdom Jr., B.J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10481-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PBM hexamers (5 mg) were denatured in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, buffer containing 4 m GdnHCl and 25 mm DTT and incubated in a boiling water bath for 20 min. Subsequently, the reduced proteins were alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. To fractionate dimer and monomer subunits, the denatured hexamer sample was run through a Sephacryl S-300 column (120 × 2.5 cm) that had been equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 4 m GdnHCl. The fractions with higher absorbance at 280 nm were analyzed by 4-20% linear gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). The fractions containing monomer or dimers were pooled, concentrated, and washed with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, buffer in Amicon Ultra filters 10,000 MWCO (Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA). In addition, to investigate the effect of DTT and denaturant as a function of temperature and time of incubation on hexamer dissociation, the chromatography analyses were performed on a TSK SWxl3000 ToSo-Hass HPLC column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4 m GdnHCl, and connected to an ÄKTA Purifier HPLC chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were stained with Bio-Safe colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad) for MS compatibility. Separation of Tryptic Peptides by Size-exclusion Chromatography—NC1 dimers and monomers (reduced and alkylated) were separately incubated with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ∼1:25 enzyme to protein ratio at room temperature for 16 h. Tryptic peptides were then separated in a Superdex™ peptide column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, and calibrated with small peptides. The elution of peptides was monitored by absorbance at 230 nm. The approximate molecular weight of the T5k-complex was estimated by comparing its elution time to elution time of peptide standards. Truncation of the T5k-complex with Post-proline Endopeptidase—The T5k-complex, isolated by gel filtration peptide column, was further truncated with post-proline endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningsepticum (Seikagaku America, East Falmouth, MA) in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH ∼ 7.8, for 3 h at 37 °C. The products of the digestion were immediately analyzed by LC-ESI/MS (see below). MALDI-TOF MS—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis was performed on a Voyager 4700 mass spectrometer or on a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager Elite (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Tryptic peptides derived from the T5k-complex were prepared by the dried-droplet method using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was dissolved in water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (50:49.9:0.1) at a concentration of 10 mg ml-1. The peptides were initially identified by comparing the experimental masses of each peak with computer-predicted masses of tryptic peptides from the bovine NC1 domain (IV) sequences (7Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Identity of some peptide sequences was confirmed by inducing ion fragmentation using the instrument in the tandem mode (MS/MS). LC-ESI/MS/MS and LC-ESI/MS3—The LC-ESI/MS/MS and LC-ESI/MS3 analyses were performed on a ThermoFinnigan LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a ThermoFinnigan Surveyor LC pump, microelectrospray source, and Xcalibur 1.4 instrument control and data analysis software. HPLC separation of the NC1 tryptic peptides was achieved with a C18 capillary column at 0.7 ml min-1 flow rate. Solvent A was H2O with 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. The gradient program was: 0-3 min, linear gradient 0-5% B; 3-5 min, 5% B, 5-50 min, linear gradient to 50% B; 50-52 min, linear gradient to 80% B; 52-55 min, linear gradient to 90% B; 55-56 min, 90% B in solvent A. A blank sample (0.1% formic acid) was run between the two analyses. Each sample was subjected to two LC-ESI/MS/MS analyses. In the first analysis, MS/MS spectra of the peptides were obtained using data-dependent scanning in which one full MS spectrum (mass range 400-2000 atomic mass units) was followed by three MS/MS spectra. In the second run, several specific precursor masses were selected for MS/MS analysis in a targeted fashion. For the LC-ESI/MS3 analyses, the MS3 spectra were obtained using data-dependent scanning in which one full MS spectrum is followed by one MS/MS spectrum. The three most intense ions in the MS/MS spectrum were selected for a third fragmentation (MS3). Software for Sequence and Post-translational Modification Analysis—Samples of trypsin-digested monomers and dimers were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The data base search algorithm SEQUEST was used to identify peptides from the fragment ions recorded in the tandem mass spectrum. P-Mod (11Hansen B.T. Davey S.W. Ham A.J. Liebler D.C. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a statistics based algorithm, allowed for the successful identification of hydroxylation sites. Analytical RP-HPLC of the T5k-complex—The T5k-complex peak was analyzed on an ÄKTA Purifier liquid chromatography system run by UNICORN 4.11 software (Amersham Biosciences). Runs were performed on a Supelcosil LC-318 reversed-phase analytical HPLC column (Sigma). The samples were loaded into the column that had been equilibrated with buffer A (95% water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% acetonitrile) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient up to 40% buffer B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% acetonitrile and water) over 60 min. Peptide elution was monitored by absorbance at 215 nm. Amino Acid Composition Analyses—Amino acid analysis was carried out on the T-5014 complex at the W.M. Keck Facility at Yale University (New Haven, CT) on a Beckman model 7300 ion-exchange instrument following a 16-h hydrolysis at 115 °C in 100 μl of 6 n HCl, containing 0.2% phenol. After hydrolysis, the HCl was dried in a SpeedVac, and the resulting amino acids dissolved in 100 μl of Beckman sample buffer. The instrument was calibrated with a 2-nmol mixture of amino acids and was operated via the manufacturer's programs and with the use of their buffers. Data analysis was carried out on an external computer using PerkinElmer/Nelson data acquisition software. Edman Degradation Sequencing—NH2-terminal peptide sequencing of the T-5014 complex was carried out at the W.M. Keck Facility at Yale University on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 cLC instrument equipped with on-line HPLC for the identification of the resulting phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. Identification of a Structural Difference between Dimers and Monomers of the NC1 Domain: Isolation of the Reinforcement Site by Trypsin Digestion—Trypsin digestion was used to identify structural differences between monomer and dimer subunits of the NC1 hexamer domain of collagen IV from bovine placenta basement membrane. To isolate monomers and dimers, the NC1 hexamers were reduced and alkylated in 4 m GdnHCl, then fractionated on a gel filtration column equilibrated with 4 m GdnHCl (Fig. 6, Ref. 9Vanacore R.M. Shanmugasundararaj S. Friedman D.B. Bondar O. Hudson B.G. Sundaramoorthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44723-44730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The dimers and monomers were separately digested with trypsin under conditions for maximal cleavage. The peptide products were then fractionated over a size-exclusion chromatography column (Fig. 1). A comparison of the profiles for monomer (dotted) and dimer (solid) reveals that dimers yield an extra peak (Mr = ∼5000), and therefore are designated as T5k-complex, indicative of a structural distinction between dimer and monomer subunits.Fig. 1Trypsin digestion reveals a structural difference between dimer and monomer subunits α1 NC1 domains. NC1 dimers and monomers were dissociated from bovine PBM NC1 hexamer in 4 m GdnHCl, reduced, and alkylated, and then fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 6, panel b). The dimer and monomer subunits were separately digested with trypsin, and the tryptic products were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex peptide column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractionation was monitored by measurement of absorbance at 220 nm for monomers (dashed line) and dimers (solid line). The asterisk indicates the retention time of a tryptic (T) complex(s) of ∼5000 molecular weight that distinguishes dimers from monomers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The chemical nature of the T5k-complex was characterized by mass spectrometry. Because of the large size of the T5k-complex, the MALDI-TOF MS instrument was optimized to detect ions in the m/z range 500-8000. Surprisingly, the most intense ion in the spectrum was m/z 1413.8 and the highest mass observed was m/z 3601.6 (Fig. 2). The mass spectra were identical in linear or reflectron mode, which rules out a possible in-source fragmentation. Although the T5k-complex was not observed, the combined mass of T-1414 plus T-3600 peptides is ∼5014, a value close to that observed by size-exclusion chromatography. To identify the sequence of T-1414 and T-3600 peptides, they were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-TOF tandem MS. Fig. 2B shows the fragmentation spectrum for the T-3600 peptide, which is consistent with the peptide sequence, 77NDYSYWLSTPEPMPMSMAPITGENIRPFISR107, derived from the α1 NC1 domain. The mass of the T-1414 peptide was not predicted from the α1 NC1 domain sequence, therefore, it was considered to be a modified peptide. As shown in Fig. 2C, the fragmentation pattern of the T-1414 peptide is consistent with the sequence, 204KPTPSTLKAGELR216, but with 16 extra mass units attached to Lys211. It is well known that lysine residues within the collagenous domain of collagen IV are post-translationally modified by a lysyl hydroxylase catalyzed addition of a hydroxyl group (12Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar), converting lysine to 5-hydroxylysine (Hyl). Thus, the extra 16 mass units observed in the T-1414 peptide in comparison to the known primary sequence, suggests the presence of Hyl211 (confirmed below). Therefore, the results are consistent with a stable complex (T-5014), composed of T-1414 and T-3600 peptides, which dissociate before or during sample preparation for MALDI-TOF MS analyses. To test the hypothesis that T-1414 and T-3600 peptides form a stable complex, we analyzed the T5k-complex, isolated by gel-filtration (Fig. 1), using LC-ESI/MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 3, the sample displayed two major peaks (Fig. 3A) each giving rise to a charge envelope containing +3, +4, +5, +6, and +7 ions in the mass analyzer (Fig. 3B). The ions had an experimental average peptide mass of 5014.0 and 5030.1 and were named T-5014 and T-5030 complexes, respectively. The mass of the T-5014 complex is equal to the sum of the masses of the ions detected by MALDI-TOF MS, T-1414 and T-3600 peptides (Fig. 5). Similarly, the T-5030 complex is equal to the mass of T-1414 and T-3600 peptides plus 16 mass units.Fig. 5Primary structure and location of the T-5014 and P-1525 complexes in the α1 NC1 domain dimer. The T-3600 peptide corresponds to sequence 77-107 of the α1 NC1 domain, and the T-1414 peptide corresponds to the sequence 204-216 of the α1 NC1 domain with the exception that Lys211 is modified to Hyl211. The T-5014 complex, composed of T-3600 and T-1414 peptides, distinguishes dimers from monomers as shown in Fig. 1. The peptide sequences obtained by 20 cycles of automated Edman degradation sequencing of the T-5014 complex are shown in bold. Hyl211-Ala212 is a potential cleavage site for trypsin; however, in the T-5014 complex, this peptide bond is resistant to cleavage (see below). Digestion of the T-5014 complex with post-proline endopeptidase (PPE) generates the P-1525 complex, which is composed of a peptide containing Met93, derived from T-3600 peptide, and a peptide containing Hyl211, derived from the T-1414 peptide. The arrows indicate the cleavage sites that generate the P-1525 complex. The mass P-1525 complex is the theoretical value for the two unmodified peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The T-5014 and T-5030 complexes were further characterized by MALDI-TOF MS analyses. The T5k-complex (Fig. 1) was fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC yielding two major components that corresponded to T-5014 and T-5030 complexes (Fig. 4A). MALDI-TOF MS analyses (Fig. 4B) showed that the T-5014 complex is composed of T-1414 and T-3600 peptides, and that the T-5030 complex is composed of T-1414 and T-3616 peptides. The only difference between T-5014 and T-5030 complexes is the oxidation of methionine in the latter, which may have occurred during chromatography. Thus, the apparent masses of the complexes equal the sum of the masses of the constituent peptides, indicating that interaction of the peptides occurs without a change in mass (non-covalent), or a change in mass (covalent linkage) that is within the experimental error of the measurement for the 5,000 mass range. Moreover, the results establish that the T-5014 and T-5030 complexes dissociate under the conditions of MALDI-TOF MS analyses, a finding that explains why they were not observed in the earlier report (9Vanacore R.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44723-44730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that used this method. The presence of fragments T-1460 and T-3554, which are the result of an alternative fragmentation of the tryptic complexes, are indicated in each spectrum (Figs. 1 and 4) and will be addressed below. The T-5014 complex, isolated by HPLC (Fig. 4A), was also characterized by conventional amino acid analysis and Edman degradation. The amino acid composition (Table I) revealed a very close correlation between the experimental and theoretical values based on the sequences of the composite T-1414 and T-3600 peptides, identified by mass spectrometry, including one residue of Hyl in the T-1414 peptide. Amino acid analyses of monomer and dimer subunits also revealed the presence of one Hyl residue in monomer and two residues in the dimer (data not shown). Twenty cycles of Edman degradation revealed the presence of two peptides with sequences of 77NDYSYWLSTPEPMPMSMAPITGENIRPFISR107 and 204KPTPSTLKOHAGELR216, which correspond to T-3600 and T-1414 peptides (Fig. 5). The latter peptide contained Hyl at the eighth position, corresponding to Hyl211, as suggested by the above mass spectrometry studies. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and Edman degradation analyses indicate that this Hyl is not glycosylated. Moreover, that the T-5014 complex sequenced through 20 cycles without interruption at Met93 or Hyl211 indicates that the interaction between T-1414 and T-3600 peptides is labile under the conditions of Edman degradation.Table IAmino acid composition of T-5014 complexAmino acidNumber of residuesTheoreticalExperimentalAla22.1Arg32.9Asn + Asp33.4Asn2Asp1Cys00Gln + Glu33.6Gln0Glu3Gly23.1His00Ile33Leu33.2Lys21.1Hyl00.9Met32Phe10.7Pro77.3Ser54.7Thr43.7Trp1Tyr22Val00 Open table in a new tab Evidence for a Covalent Cross-link in the Tryptic Complex (T-5014)—The chemical nature of the interactions between T-1414 and T-3600 peptides in the T-5014 complex was explored by LC-ESI/MS3 mass spectrometry, using collision-induced dissociation for fragmentation. The fragmentation generated two modified peptides: T-1460 and T-3554 that differed in mass from the T-1414 and T-3600 peptides observed by MALDI-TOF (see above). Although the modified peptides (T-1460 and T-3554) were much less intense than T-1414 and T-3600 peptides, they were also observed in the MALDI-TOF MS spectra (Figs. 1 and 4). These results suggested that a chemical group of ∼46 was transferred from the T-3600 to T-1414 peptide, possibly indicating a covalent cross-link between the two peptides. However, the location of mass changes within the two peptides could not be interpreted with confidence because of the complexity of MS3 spectra because of the large masses of the peptides. To circumvent this problem, the T5k-complex isolated in Fig. 1 was digested with a second protease to reduce its size for characterization by LC-ESI/MS3 mass spectrometry. The large number of prolyl residues in the T5K-complex suggested the use of post-proline endopeptidase for truncation. This enzyme cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of prolyl residues (13Yoshimoto T. Walter R. Tsuru D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4786-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it would reduce the T-5014 complex of 44 residues down to 14 residues, as depicted in Fig. 5. The truncated product would be composed of MSMAP (535.2) and STLKOHAGELR (989.6) peptides, which together exist as a complex with a theoretical mass of 1524.8 (designated as the P-1525 complex). The post-proline endopeptidase digestion product was analyzed by LC-ESI/MS3. Fig. 6a (left panel) presents a full MS spectrum showing two major ions at m/z 509.1 and 762.7 corresponding to the triply and doubly charged forms of the P-1525 complex, respectively. The experimental average mass of the P-1525 complex is 1523.9, approximately 1 mass unit less than the theoretical mass of 1524.8 (Fig. 5), indicating that interaction of the two constituent peptides of the P-1525 complex results in the loss of a single hydrogen. Further MS/MS analyses of the doubly charged ion of m/z 762.6 revealed ions of m/z 488.3 and 1036.6 (Fig. 6a, right panel). These ions differ from the theoretical ones of 536.2 (535.2 + H+) and 990.6 (989.6 + H+), calculated for the two constituent peptides of the P-1525 complex (Fig. 5), by values of -48 and +46 mass units, respectively. To obtain structural information about each of these ions and the nature of the 48 and 46 masses, each ion was submitted to a third collision-induced dissociation fragmentation (MS3) in the instrument. In Fig. 6b, the MS3 spectrum at the m/z 488.3 fragment is shown; the fragmentation profile is consistent with the MSMAP peptide sequence, except that the b and y ion series demonstrate the loss of 48 atomic mass units of Met93. In contrast, in Fig. 6c, the fragmentation profile of the ion at m/z 1036.6 is consistent with the SKLKOHAGELR, but the y and b ion series demonstrate that Hyl211 gained 46 atomic mass units of fragmentation of the P-1525 complex. These fragmentation profiles indicate a loss of a CH3S- group along with a proton (totaling 48 atomic mass units) from Met93 and a"

Moreover, γ-GCSh mRNA expression is elevated in colorectal cancer, but how γ-GCSh expression is regulated is not completely understood. By using actinomycin D, which inhibits new RNA synthesis, we showed that treatment of human colorectal cancer cells with the prooxidant sulindac increased the half-life of γ-GCSh mRNA. By using a tetracycline-regulated γ-GCSh mRNA assay system, we systematically dissected the cis-acting sequence and trans-acting factors that regulate the stability of γ-GCSh by cytotoxic prooxidants. We demonstrated that a HuR recognition sequence, AUUUA, in the 3′-untranslated region is responsible for the decay of γ-GCSh mRNA. Oxidative stress enhanced cytoplasmic content of HuR. Overexpression of HuR by transfection stabilized γ-GCSh mRNA, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative HuR mutant suppressed the induced stability. Furthermore, prooxidant-induced γ-GCSh mRNA stabilization and HuR binding were blocked by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors. We provide the first evidence that reduction-oxidation regulation of γ-GCSh expression, itself a reduction-oxidation sensor and regulator, is mediated at least in part by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling through the HuR RNA-binding protein.

Reactive oxygen species play important roles in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, aging, and other physiological functions. Under normal physiological conditions, there is a balance between oxidants and antioxidants that constitutes reduction-oxidation (redox) 1The abbreviations used are: redox, reduction-oxidation; γ-GCS, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase; γ-GCSh, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit, UTR, untranslated region; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; MAP-KAPK2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2; MKK3, MAPK kinase 3; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; tBHQ, tert-butylhydroquinone; 2-AAF, 2-acetyl aminofluorene; nt, nucleotide; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; ORE, oxidative stress-response elements; WT, wild type. homeostasis. Elevated production of reactive oxygen species exerts oxidative stress, leading to a host of pathologic consequences. One of the ways a cell regulates redox homeostasis is through the glutathione system that exists in both the reduced form (GSH) and the oxidized form (GSSG) (1.Smith C.V. Jones D.P. Guenthner T.M. Lash L.H. Lauterburg B.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Under oxidative stress, GSH is oxidized by GSH peroxidase to GSSG that is eliminated by the MRP1 (multidrug resistance associated protein) efflux pump or is catalytically reduced back to GSH by the NADPH-dependent GSH reductase. GSH also regulates the activities and biosynthesis of other redox-regulating enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and DT-diphorases (NADPH quinine oxidoreductases 1 and 2). Because of the intracellular abundance of glutathione (1–10 mm) (2.Gipp J.J. Chang C. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3.Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), the GSH/GSSG system is the main redox regulator of cells. The biosynthesis of GSH is regulated mainly by the ratelimiting enzyme γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS). The mammalian γ-GCS is a heterodimer consisting of one 73-kDa heavy (or catalytic) subunit (γ-GCSh) (4.Hamilton D. Wu J.H. Alaoui-Jamali M. Batist G. Blood. 2003; 102: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5.Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol.

Hereditary γ-GCSh deficiency is associated with anemia, jaundice, and neurologic abnormalities (8.Ristoff E. Augustson C. Geissler J. de Rijk T. Carlsson K. Luo J.L. Andersson K. Weening R.S. van Zwieten R. Larsson A. Roos D. Blood. 2000; 95: 2193-2196PubMed Google Scholar), and total γ-GCSh deficiency is embryonic lethal in knock-out mice (9.Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y.

We demonstrated previously that expression of γ-GCSh could be induced by many cytotoxic agents, including antitumor agents (10.Gomi A. Shinoda S. Masuzawa T. Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All of these treatments, to various extents, induce intracellular reactive oxygen species imbalance. Moreover, γ-GCSh mRNA is frequently overexpressed in human colon cancers (17.Kuo M.T. Bao J.J. Curley S.A. Ikeguchi M. Johnston D.A. Ishikawa T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3642-3644PubMed Google Scholar), which are associated with redox imbalance (18.Cerutti P.A. Lancet. 1994; 344: 862-863Abstract PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), suggesting that the GSH/γ-GCS system is a molecular sensor of intracellular redox homeostasis. Although elevated expression of γ-GCSh catalyzes enhanced expression of GSH, we observed that increased GSH expression provides feedback for the down-regulation of steady-state γ-GCSh mRNA expression (16.Yamane Y.

In addition, high GSH expression has been reported previously to suppress γ-GCSh enzymatic activities (19.Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This feedback mechanism underscores the importance of γ-GCSh as a redox regulator. Studies of γ-GCSh gene regulation have focused on transcriptional levels. Transcriptional up-regulation of γ-GCSh is mediated by oxidative stress-response elements (ORE) located within –3802 bp (20.Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol.

Honma K. Kondo T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) at the 5′ side of the γ-GCSh gene. The oxidative stress-response element contains the consensus sequence 5′-TGAGTCA, which is a target of the leucine zipper transcription factor Nrf2 (22.Rahman I. Smith C.A. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is normally bound to keap1, which contains a cysteine-rich domain and is anchored to the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton (25.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarash K. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar, 26.Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc. Natl.

Nrf2 then associates with the small Maf proteins (MafK or MafG) (27.Jeyapaul J. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28.Moran J.A.

This mechanism has been shown to regulate many other so-called phase II detoxifying enzymes (NADPH quinine oxidoreductase 1, γ-GCS light chain, glutathione S-transferase α1, and heme oxygenase-1) (33.Buckley B.J. Marshall Z.M. Whorton A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34.Wild A.C. Mulcahy R.T. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 32: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We reported previously that steady-state expression of γ-GCSh mRNA increases by severalfold in human glioma cells treated with the alkylating antitumor agent 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl) methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (10.Gomi A. Shinoda S. Masuzawa T. Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5292-5299PubMed Google Scholar). However, nuclear run-on assays revealed less than a 0.5-fold increase in the transcriptional rate. These results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is also involved in the increased steady-state expression, perhaps depending upon prooxidants and cell sources. The mechanism involved in this post-transcriptional regulation has yet to be elucidated. The objective of the current study was to gain insight into the post-transcriptional mechanism of redox-induced γ-GCSh upregulation in a cultured cell system. We found that oxidative stress-induced γ-GCSh expression is mediated by the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR, which interacts with an AU-rich sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of γ-GCSh mRNA through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway.

A series of progressively deleted flanking sequences was created by PCR by using –3802/GCSh5′-luc DNA as a template and appropriate primer sets. The PCR products were cloned into the pGL3 basic vector, generating –814/GCSh5′-luc, –202/GCSh5′-luc, –149/GCSh5′-luc, and –22/GCSh5′-luc recombinants. Wild-type and antisense HuR (35.Wang W.

To construct pTRE-γ-GCSh (2983), we amplified the γ-GCSh cDNA sequence from 400 to 2983 bp (using GenBank™ accession number M90656 as the reference) by PCR with primer pairs containing sequences 5′-CGACGCGTCTGAGTGTCCGTCTCGCGCC (sense; underscore sequence contains the MluI site) and 5′-CCATCGATCAGAGGGGAAAGCTTGGGGCA (antisense; underscore sequence contains ClaI site) using full pCMV-γ-GCSh cDNA (20.Mulcahy R.T.

The PCR product was digested with MluI and ClaI and inserted into the MluI/-ClaI sites of the pTRE vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which contains the tetracycline transactivator element-regulated promoter.

These PCR products were digested with MluI/SalI and inserted into the pTRE vector to generate pTRE-γ-GCSh(2781), pTRE-γ-GCSh(2677), pTRE-γ-GCSh(2571), and pTRE-γ-GCSh(2431), respectively. To generate site-directed mutations in the AU-rich sites, we used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, pTRE-γ-GCSh(2983) DNA was used as the template in PCRs using primers containing +2785AGGGA and +2595AGGGGA to replace +2785AUUUA (site II) and +2595AUUUUA (site I), respectively. The methylated, wild-type DNA (template) was digested by DpnI, and the nonmethylated, mutated DNA (PCR product) was transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). All the plasmid DNAs were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Treatments with Prooxidants—HT-29 and HCT-15 human colorectal cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells at exponential growth conditions were treated with prooxidants at the following concentrations: 100 μm 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF; Sigma), 50 μm menadione (Sigma), 100 μm pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; Sigma), 100 μm tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ; Sigma), and 800 μm sulindac (Sigma). In experiments where inhibitors were used, cells were treated with 25 mm N-acetylcysteine (Sigma) 2 h before the addition of sulindac, whereas 20 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem) and 20 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem) were added simultaneously with sulindac. Total RNA was extracted from the cells, and levels of γ-GCSh mRNA were determined by the RNase protection assay. Transient Transfection—Transient transfection was performed by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HEK293T cells (1 × 106 cells) were seeded into 60-mm Petri dishes; 24 h later, recombinant pTRE-γ-GCSh plasmid DNA and EC1214A plasmid, which expresses tTA regulation factor, were introduced into cells by using 8 μg of Lipofectamine (the amount of DNA was kept constant at 4.5 μg within experiments by adding empty vector as required). After 5 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To shut off mRNA synthesis, tetracycline (2 μg/ml, Sigma) was added 24 h after transfection, and cells were harvested 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 h later in guanidine thiocyanate lysis buffer (STAT-60; Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). RNA was extracted through phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Luciferase Assay—HEK293T cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded in 24-well plates, and 24 h later, 0.2 μg of γ-GCSh reporter recombinant constructs and 10 ng of pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase vector were cotranfected into cells using 4 μg of Lipofectamine. After 5 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with 100 μm tBHQ for 12 h, and the cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in aliquots (10 μl) of cell lysates were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNase Protection Assay—RNase protection was carried out as described previously (10.Gomi A. Shinoda S. Masuzawa T. Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5292-5299PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the template DNA was linearized by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Antisense riboprobes were synthesized using T7 or Sp6 polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 500 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The hybridization mixtures contained 20 μg of RNA and 2 × 105 cpm of riboprobe. Unhybridized RNA was degraded by incubation with RNase A (12 μg; Roche Applied Science) and RNase T (4 μg; Roche Applied Science). Protected RNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing 8% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels and were visualized by autoradiography. To determine the endogenous γ-GCSh mRNA, we used a probe that generated a protected fragment of 268 nt. To determine exogenous γ-GCSh transcripts from the transfected DNA, we constructed a plasmid that contains γ-GCSh cDNA (+220 to 470 bp) and used it as a template. The riboprobe synthesized from this template annealed to the transfected (exogenous) γ-GCSh mRNA and gave rise to a protected fragment of 70 nt. Under these conditions, this probe did not detect endogenous γ-GCSh mRNA (data not shown). In all cases, the autoradiographic signals were quantified with an image analyzer (ImageQuant 5.0). The half-life (t½) of the γ-GCSh mRNA was calculated from the exponential phase of the plot of remaining mRNA versus time. In all experiments, hybridization of 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control for sample loading. The intensities of the 18 S rRNA and γ-GCSh mRNA bands were adjusted independently within the linear range of the signals. Western Blot Analysis—HEK293T cells (2 × 106 cells) were seeded onto a 100-mm Petri dish. Twelve h later, cells were treated with sulindac (800 μm), PDTC (100 μm), or tBHQ (100 μm) alone or with SB203580 (20 μm) or PD98059 (20 μm) for 12 h. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. Cell were suspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Aliquots (40 μg) of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by using standard procedures. The membranes were then subjected to Western blotting, and the blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182, 1:1,000 dilution), phospho-MKK3/6 (Ser-189/207, 1:1,000), phospho-MAPKAPK2 (Thr-334, 1:1,000), and those against nonphosphorylated p38 (1:500), MKK3/6 (1:500), and MAPKAPK2 (1:500 dilution) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MS). A mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as a loading control. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated p38 MAPK control cell extracts from C6 glioma cells prepared with or without anisomycin treatment (Cell Signaling Technology) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. To investigate the effect of prooxidant on intracellular distribution of HuR between the cytoplasm and nucleus, we treated the cells with 800 μm sulindac or 100 μm tBHQ in the presence or absence of the inhibitors SB203580 or PD98059 for 12 h. Cytoplasmic and nucleic fractions were prepared from the treated cells using the NE-PER extraction kit (Pierce) and were processed by a standard Western blot using mouse monoclonal antibodies against HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000), α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000), and lamin B (Calbiochem, 1:200). RNA Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The sequences for the gene-specific oligonucleotides are site I WT (5′-UUAACAAUGUAUUUUAAUAACAUAU, underscore refers to site I), site I MT (5′-UUAACAAUGUAGGGGAAUAACAUAU), site II WT (5′-CUGGGACCUGAUUUAUUGAAAUUUU), and site II MT (5′-CUGGGACCUGAGGGAUUGAAAUUUU). 32P-Labeled RNA probes were prepared by kinase reaction using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 100 fmol of the radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotides (105 cpm/reaction) were incubated with 10 μg of cytoplasmic extract for 20 min at 22 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 μg/μl heparin, and 0.2 μg/μl yeast total RNA. RNA-protein complexes were separated in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (60:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE (Tris borate/EDTA) buffer at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. To deplete HuR from the cell extracts, 10 μg of extract was incubated with 200 ng of anti-HuR antibody followed by an addition of 5 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with radiolabeled site II wild-type RNA oligonucleotide and assayed by gel mobility shift assay. As a control, the cytoplasmic fraction was incubated with protein A/G plus-agarose without anti-HuR antibody. In Vivo Cross-linking—RNA and protein were cross-linked by the method of Cook et al. (66.Cook H.L. Mischo H.E. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4522-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. HEK293T cells (2 × 106 cells) were seeded onto a 100-mm Petri dish. Twelve h later, cells were treated with sulindac (800 μm) alone or with SB203580 (20 μm) or PD98059 (20 μm) for 12 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in a 100-mm Petri dish. Cells were irradiated on ice with 254-nm UV light using a transilluminator (UVP, San Gabriel, CA) without filter at a distance of 4 cm for 15 min. The cell pellets were resuspended by vortexing in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. After dilution with 800 μl of correction buffer (1.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.625% sodium deoxycholate, 62.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1.75 mm EDTA, 187.5 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 150 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), the sample was gently sonicated two or three times and centrifuged for 90 min. The supernatants (1 ml total) were incubated with anti-HuR antibody (2 μg) followed by 50 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were divided into 2 aliquots; 1 aliquot of 800 μl was centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Pellets were washed four times with NET-2 and digested with proteinase K with tumbling at 37 °C for 1 h. Following guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and ethanol precipitation, mRNA was analyzed by the RNase protection assay with probes for γ-GCSh described above. The other aliquot of 200 μl was washed four times with NET-2, suspended in electrophoresis loading buffer (15 μl), boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatants were subjected to Western blotting using anti-HuR antibody as described above. Post-transcriptional Regulation of γ-GCSh mRNA Expression Is Induced by Prooxidants—Fig. 1A shows the time course induction of γ-GCSh expression by various prooxidants, including sulindac, 2-AAF, tBHQ, and PDTC. Increased steady-state levels of γ-GCSh mRNA were observed 4–6 h and continued throughout the 10–24-h treatment time. Levels of induction ranged from 3- to 8.5-fold, depending upon the prooxidants. These results are consistent with our previous reports (14.Lin-Lee Y.C. Tatebe S. Savaraj N. Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15.Tatebe S. Sinicrope F.A. Kuo M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To investigate whether the induced up-regulation of γ-GCSh by prooxidants is related to the transcriptional control, we analyzed the promoter activity of γ-GCSh using a –3802/GCSh5′-luc reporter construct in response to the prooxidant tBHQ. –3802/GCSh5′-luc plasmid contains ORE (20.Mulcahy R.T.

Fig. 1B shows that treatment of 100 μm tBHQ failed to increase an appreciable amount of luciferase activities.

https://openalex.org/W2037599411,"Golgin-160 belongs to the golgin family of Golgi-localized proteins, which have been implicated in Golgi structure and function. Golgin-160 possesses an N-terminal non-coiled-coil “head” domain followed by an extensive coiled-coil region. Using the N-terminal head domain of golgin-160 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, the postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domain protein interacting specifically with TC10 (PIST) was identified to interact with golgin-160. PIST (also known as GOPC, CAL, and FIG) has been implicated in the trafficking of a subset of plasma membrane proteins, supporting a role of golgin-160 in vesicular trafficking. Golgin-160 and PIST colocalize to Golgi membranes and interact in vivo. Glutathione S-transferase binding experiments identified an internal region of PIST that includes a coiled-coil domain, which interacts directly with golgin-160. Similar binding experiments identified a leucine-rich repeat within golgin-160 necessary for interaction with PIST. Therefore, our data suggest that golgin-160 may participate in PIST-dependent trafficking of cargo. Interestingly, we also discovered a widely expressed isoform of golgin-160, golgin-160B, which lacks the exon encoding the leucine repeat that mediates binding to PIST. As predicted, golgin-160B was unable to bind PIST. Full-length golgin-160 and golgin-160B may link distinct subsets of proteins to effect specific membrane trafficking pathways.

The mammalian Golgi complex is composed of polarized stacks of cisternal membranes connected by tubules to form a reticular network of membranes located in a juxtanuclear position (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 2-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Transport through the Golgi apparatus allows for posttranslational modification of proteins and lipids as cargo sequentially encounters modifying enzymes before being sorted to its final destination. Although the importance of Golgi structure in the proper and efficient transport of secretory cargo is well documented, understanding how Golgi structure and function are coupled remains an active area of research. The golgin family of Golgi-localized proteins has been implicated in both Golgi structure and function. Members of the golgin family were first identified as autoantigens in patients with autoimmune diseases, but the family has been expanded to include any Golgi-localized protein that contains an extensive coiled-coil region. The golgin family of proteins includes peripheral membrane proteins such as GM130 (2Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J.

Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). GM130 and giantin are the best-studied golgins. GM130 associates with Golgi membranes by binding to GRASP65, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive cis-Golgi membrane protein important for cisternal stacking (12Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Giantin in transport vesicles is thought to interact via p115 with GM130-GRASP65 in a Rab1-dependent manner (13Moyer B.D. Allan B.B. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The tethering of giantin-containing vesicles with cisternal membranes containing GM130-GRASP65 is proposed to increase the specificity and/or efficiency of soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated recognition and fusion of transport vesicles (14Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A number of other golgins have also been implicated in the maintenance of Golgi structure and function. A medial-Golgi complex containing GRASP55 and golgin-45 was identified (3Short B. Preisinger C. Korner R. Kopajtich R. Byron O. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Depletion of golgin-45 by RNA interference results in Golgi disassembly and inhibition of secretory protein transport. Depletion of golgin-84 leads to Golgi fragmentation and to reduced cell surface expression of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (15Diao A. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Lucocq J. Lowe M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Similarly, depletion of another golgin, golgin-97, results in Golgi fragmentation and inhibition of cholera toxin B fragment retrograde trafficking from the endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (16Lu L. Tai G. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4426-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that golgins and the proteins with which they interact link Golgi structure and membrane trafficking. Golgin-160 is a peripheral membrane protein localized to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi complex. Golgin-160 possesses an N-terminal non-coiled-coil (head) domain, which contains Golgi targeting information (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, comprising two-thirds of the protein. Previous work showed that caspase cleavage of the head of golgin-160 is required for the efficient disassembly of the Golgi during programmed cell death and the propagation of specific apoptotic signals (18Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 19Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, caspase cleavage of the N-terminal head of golgin-160 may allow for nuclear translocation of golgin-160 fragments from the Golgi to the nucleus during apoptosis (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). If caspase-derived fragments of golgin-160 are translocated to the nucleus, they may function to regulate apoptotic progression. In this study we used the N-terminal head domain of golgin-160 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify protein interactors. Here we identify and characterize the binding of golgin-160 with PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with TC10 (PIST). We also show that a novel isoform of golgin-160, golgin-160B, which is widely expressed in human tissues, is unable to bind PIST. Our results suggest that different golgin-160 isoforms may play non-overlapping roles in the regulation of certain membrane trafficking pathways. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the Matchmaker Gal4 Two-Hybrid System 3 and a Matchmaker pretransformed HeLa cDNA library following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The bait plasmid, human golgin-160 N terminus (amino acid residues 1–393), was amplified by PCR from a previously described full-length clone of human golgin-160 (18Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was cloned into the bait vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) using SalI and NdeI restriction sites and transformed into yeast strain AH109 (Clontech). The yeast strain Y187 (pretransformed with a cDNA library from HeLa cells cloned into the vector pGAD-GH) was mated with the AH109 strain that contained the bait construct according to the manufacturer's protocol. About 1 × 107 HeLa clones were screened on both high stringency (lacking adenine, leucine, tryptophan, and histidine) and medium stringency (lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine) plates. Surviving clones that tested positive for β-galactosidase expression were isolated and sequenced. A cDNA encoding residues 74–454 of human PIST (BC009553) was identified. Expression Constructs—Myc-tagged golgin-160 and truncation mutants have been described (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA clone of GFP 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription. -tagged human PIST was kindly provided by William B. Guggino (Johns Hopkins University). Mutant proteins were named with both the tag type and the amino acids represented. The sequences of mutant proteins were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. PIST truncation mutants were cloned into the BglII and EcoRI restriction sites of a modified pEGFP-C1 vector (T7-EGFP-C1) in which we inserted the T7 promoter sequence, TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG, upstream of the GFP start codon as previously described (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Individual PIST truncation mutants were generated by PCR amplification to introduce a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ EcoRI site followed by ligation into the T7-EGFP-C1 vector. To create the leucine repeat mutant in golgin-160 (g160-(1–393)3LA/Myc), the sequence LQSLRLSLPMQETQLCSTDSPL beginning at amino acid 121 was changed to AQSLRLSAPMQETQACSTDSPL using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The Δ exon 3 isoform mutants of golgin-160 (g160B-(1–1459)/Myc and g160B-(1–353)/Myc) were generated by PCR mutagenesis using a primer overlapping the alternative splice junction. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the non-coiled-coil head domain of golgin-160, GST/g160-(1–393), and the full-length PIST fusion protein, GST/PIST-(1–454), were cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Cells and Antibodies—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1 mg/ml normocin-O (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Thirty-five-mm dishes of HeLa cells (70–80% confluent) were transfected with 6 μl LT-1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) and 2 μg of T7-EGFP and/or pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+), (Invitrogen) encoding the appropriate cDNA. Steady state expression was analyzed 16 h after transfection. Rabbit anti-golgin-160 has been described (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Polyclonal goat antibodies to PIST were from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Mouse anti-p115 was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II was a gift from Kelly Moremen (University of Georgia) and Marilyn Farquhar (University of California, San Diego). Rabbit anti-GFP was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon), and mouse anti-c-Myc was from Sigma. Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and antimouse IgG and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For localization studies, HeLa cells were stained as previously described (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. Coverslips were incubated in primary antibody diluted in Gly/phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% bovine serum albumin (or 1% fish skin gelatin for goat anti-PIST) for 20 min. Coverslips were washed 3 times with Gly/phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with fluorescein- or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies, and washed as above. Coverslips were then mounted in glycerol containing 0.1 m N-propyl gallate. Images were collected on an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence and a Sensys CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using IP Lab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The method used for immunoprecipitation has been described previously (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.1), 125 mm potassium acetate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of anti-GFP or anti-Myc antiserum. Immune complexes were collected with either 25 μl of fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) or 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblot analysis as described below. For immunoblotting analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 1 h and then incubated with the indicated primary antibody blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed and analyzed using enzyme-linked chemiluminescence with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescent signal was measured by the VersaDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and quantitated using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). GST Pull-down Assays—For GST pull-down assays, the head domain of golgin-160 and full-length PIST were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21-codon plus (Stratagene) using standard methods. Bacterially expressed GST or GST fusion proteins were purified and rebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). [35S]Methionine-labeled golgin-160, PIST, and truncation mutants were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT® T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) as instructed by the manufacturer. The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with GST or GST fusion protein-coupled beads in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.1), 125 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times with binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted, electrophoresed, and visualized on a Molecular Imager FX PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad) and quantitated using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA from human tissues was obtained from Clontech. Total RNA from HeLa cells was isolated using TRIzol® total RNA isolation reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total HeLa RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer, and purity was assessed by the 260/280 absorbance ratio. cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA reverse-transcribed with 200 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 primer, 500 μm concentrations of each dNTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. To identify golgin-160 transcripts in HeLa cells, a region within the N-terminal head domain was amplified by PCR. The primers used to visualize golgin-160 isoform expression in HeLa cells were as follows: golgin-160 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005895) forward, 5′-TGGTGCCACCTGACCAGCAGGACAAA-3′ (sense, 101–126 nucleotides), and reverse, 5′-CTTACCAAGGGCCAGTACCCTG-3′ (antisense, 612–591 nucleotides). PCR reactions were carried out with Taq polymerase buffer (Invitrogen) with 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm concentrations of each dNTP, and 10 pmol of each primer. Amplification (denaturation 94 °C, 30 s; annealing 55 °C, 30 s; extension 72 °C, 60 s) was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, model 2400). PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel, excised, and purified. PCR products were sequenced as described. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to quantitate mRNA encoding golgin-160 isoforms. The isoform-specific primers used were as follows: golgin-160A (GenBank™ NM_005895) forward, 5′-GCAGTCTCTCAGACTCAGTCTTCC-3′ (sense, 363–386 nucleotides), and golgin-160B forward, 5′-TGATGCCTCTCCAGGCTCTACA-3′ (sense, 271–294 nucleotides), and the reverse primer, 5′-CTTACCAAGGGCCAGTACCCTG-3′ (g160A: 612–591 nucleotides) was used for both isoform A and B of golgin-160. mRNA expression levels of each golgin-160 isoform was quantified by real-time PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and a MyCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Myi software (Bio-Rad) was used to auto-calculate threshold cycles. mRNA levels were normalized to the threshold cycles of 1 ng of the corresponding isoform plasmid cDNA. Expression levels were expressed as the mRNA level relative to golgin-160 isoform A in HeLa cells, which was given a relative mRNA quantity of 1.0. PCR amplification was performed two independent times. PIST Interacts with Golgin-160 in Vivo—We previously identified an 85-amino acid stretch in the N-terminal head domain of golgin-160 containing Golgi targeting information (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the head domain of golgin-160 shows no significant homology to other proteins, it contains several interesting motifs, including a cryptic nuclear localization signal (residues, 232–239) and three caspase cleavage sites (Asp-59, Asp-139, and Asp-311) (Fig. 1A). To identify candidate proteins that interact with golgin-160, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the N-terminal non-coiled coil head domain of golgin-160 as bait. We screened ∼1 × 107 clones of a pretransformed HeLa cell cDNA library and isolated a clone encoding the PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with TC10 (PIST) (Fig. 1B). The interaction between golgin-160 and PIST was further confirmed by β-galactosidase activity after co-transformation of the individual cDNAs into yeast (data not shown). PIST was first identified due to its interaction with TC10, a Rho GTPase (20Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PIST, also known as GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing) (21Yao R. Maeda T. Takada S. Noda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), CAL (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor-associated ligand) (22Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29456-29465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), contains two N-terminal coiled-coil domains and a PDZ domain within its C-terminal half (Fig. 1C). PIST is suggested to have a role in the trafficking of a subset of plasma membrane proteins through interactions with its PDZ domain (22Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E.

Immunofluorescence microscopy verified that endogenous PIST is localized to the Golgi complex in HeLa cells, closely overlapping the localization of golgin-160 (Fig. 2A). To confirm the interaction between PIST and golgin-160 detected by the yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitations were carried out. We co-transfected HeLa cells with plasmids encoding GFP/PIST-(1–454) and g160-(1–1498)/Myc. Lysates from co-transfected HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody followed by immunoblotting for Myc-tagged golgin-160 or the endogenous Golgi protein, p115 (as a negative control). Golgin-160 was strongly and specifically co-immunoprecipitated with PIST (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that PIST and golgin-160 can interact in cells. Endogenous golgin-160 could also be co-immunoprecipitated from non-transfected HeLa cells with anti-PIST antibodies (data not shown). Identification of a 127-Amino Acid Sequence within PIST That Directly Interacts with Golgin-160—To determine which region of PIST bound golgin-160, we performed in vitro binding experiments. We created a GST-tagged fusion protein of the head of golgin-160 (GST/g160-(1–393)), the same region used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Full-length and truncated versions of [35S]methionine-labeled PIST (Fig. 3A) were generated by coupled in vitro transcription and translation and then incubated with GST alone or GST/g160-(1–393). Full-length PIST bound efficiently and specifically to the head of golgin-160 (Fig. 3B). PIST truncations consisting of either the first 145 amino acids (GFP/PIST-(1–145)) or the last 180 amino acids (GFP/PIST-(274–454)) of PIST were unable to bind to the head of golgin-160, indicating that these regions do not directly interact with golgin-160. By contrast, GFP/PIST-(146–273) specifically bound to golgin-160. However, neither the second coiled-coil region of PIST (GFP/PIST-(146–202)) nor the linker region preceding the PDZ domain (GST/PIST-(203–274)) alone was able to bind golgin-160. Therefore, a 127-amino acid segment of PIST consisting of the second coiled-coil domain and the region preceding the PDZ domain is sufficient to mediate direct binding of PIST to golgin-160. A Leucine Repeat within the Head Domain of Golgin-160 Is Necessary for Interaction with PIST—To narrow down the sequence within the head of golgin-160 responsible for binding to PIST, we performed similar in vitro binding experiments using GST-tagged full-length PIST (GST/PIST-(1–454) instead of GST/golgin-160. [35S]Methionine-labeled Myc-tagged golgin-160 proteins (Fig. 4A) were produced by coupled in vitro transcription and translation and then incubated with GST alone or GST/PIST-(1–454). As expected, the full-length and N-terminal head domain of golgin-160 were able to bind to PIST, whereas the C-terminal coiled-coil domain was unable to bind (Fig. 4A). To further map the interaction domain within the head of golgin-160, progressively smaller truncations of the head, as illustrated in Fig. 4B, were tested for their ability to bind PIST. g160-(60–311)/Myc was able to interact with PIST as efficiently as the full head domain (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, neither g160-(1–139)/Myc nor g160-(140–311)/Myc bound to PIST, suggesting that the sequences flanking residue 139 may mediate golgin-160 binding to PIST. A closer look at the sequence surrounding residue 139 in golgin-160 revealed a leucine repeat (LX6LX6LX6L) located between amino acids 121 and 141 (Fig. 5A). To test the contribution of the leucine repeat to golgin-160-PIST interaction, we introduced three leucine-to-alanine substitutions, L121A, L128A, and L135A, into g160-(1–393)/Myc to create g160-(1–393)3LA/Myc (Fig. 5A). Mutation of three of four leucines has been shown to disrupt dimerization via leucine repeats (26Moitra J. Szilak L. Krylov D. Vinson C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12567-12573Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Simmerman H.K. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We chose alanines to disrupt potential hydrophobic interactions with PIST while minimizing structural changes to the head of golgin-160. Whereas the wild-type head of golgin-160 binds to PIST, mutation of the leucine repeat (g160-(1–393)3LA/Myc) significantly inhibited in vitro binding to PIST (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the leucine repeat in the head of golgin-160 is critical for the direct interaction of golgin-160 with PIST. Identification and Quantitation of a Splice Isoform of Human Golgin-160 Lacking Exon 3—Interestingly, the reference sequence for the murine golgin-160 protein (Mea-2; NP_032172) encodes a 1447-amino acid protein that lacks the exon encoding the leucine repeat (designated exon 3 in humans). Mea-2 apparently represents an alternative splice variant of golgin-160 in which exon 3 is absent. However, a mouse cDNA clone (BAA86889) containing exon 3 is present in the National Center of Biotechnology Information nucleotide data base. This suggests that mice express at least two isoforms of golgin-160 that differ by the presence or absence of exon 3. A data base search of human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) indicates that humans also express an isoform of golgin-160 lacking exon 3, similar to Mea-2 (Fig. 6A). At least five human ESTs of significant E value containing this alternative splice isoform exist. To confirm that human cells express an isoform of golgin-160 missing exon 3, RT-PCR was carried out on HeLa cells and human tissues. cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA using an oligo(dT) primer followed by PCR amplification. Primers used in the PCR reaction were complementary to sequences in exon 2 (sense) and exon 4 (antisense). HeLa cells and all the tissues analyzed showed two PCR products (Fig. 6B). The difference in PCR product size corresponds to the size of exon 3. The bands were extracted and sequenced, confirming that the observed RT-PCR products represent amplification of golgin-160A (full-length, upper band) and golgin-160B (missing exon 3, lower band). Although golgin-160 runs as a doublet on SDS-PAGE gels, this is a result of phosphorylation (28Cha H. Smith B.L. Gallo K. Machamer C.E. Shapiro P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We were unable to distinguish between the golgin-160 isoforms after phosphatase treatment by SDS-PAGE using our existing antibodies (data not shown). To determine the ratio of golgin-160 isoforms, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed. Primers were engineered to specifically amplify either the golgin-160A isoform or the golgin-160B isoform. Both golgin-160A and golgin-160B were expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression of both isoforms in testis (Fig. 6C). Although golgin-160A was the predominant transcript in most tissues, a significant amount of golgin-160B mRNA transcript was also observed in each. The ratio of golgin-160A to golgin-160B varied from a 1:1 ratio in lung to a 2:1 ratio in testis. The Golgin-160B Isoform Localizes to the Golgi but Is Unable to Bind PIST—Previous work has demonstrated that the minimal Golgi targeting information in golgin-160A does not overlap with exon 3 (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, both isoforms share the region shown to contain Golgi targeting information. To confirm that the Golgi targeting information is functional and golgin-160B is localized to the Golgi, we expressed an Myc-tagged version of golgin-160 lacking exon 3, g160B-(1–1458)/Myc, in HeLa cells (Fig. 7A). Co-localization of g160B-(1–1458)/Myc and mannosidase II, a Golgi resident enzyme, by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy verified that golgin-160B is specifically targeted to the Golgi complex. Because golgin-160B lacks the leucine repeat, we predicted that golgin-160B would be unable to bind PIST. To test this, we performed in vitro binding assays with GST/PIST-(1–454), as described above. We expressed a Myc-tagged protein corresponding to the head domain of golgin-160B (g160B-(1–353)/Myc). The [35S]methionine-labeled head domains of both isoform A, g160-(1–393)/Myc, and isoform B, g160B-(1–353)/Myc, were examined for their ability to bind GST/PIST-(1–454). Unlike golgin-160A, golgin-160B was unable to bind PIST (Fig. 7B). Golgin-160 is a peripheral membrane protein that belongs to the golgin family of Golgi-localized proteins. A number of recent studies have implicated golgins in the maintenance of Golgi structure and the integrity of membrane-trafficking pathways. We previously showed that the N-terminal non-coiled-coil domain head domain of golgin-160 possesses Golgi targeting information (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The head domain of golgin-160 is also cleaved by caspases during apoptosis, and this cleavage is required for apoptotic progression induced by specific stimuli and efficient disassembly of the Golgi complex (18Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 19Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the N-terminal head domain of golgin-160 mediates protein-protein interactions important for golgin-160 function. To gain further insight into the role of golgin-160 in Golgi structure and function, we sought to identify proteins that interact with golgin-160. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N-terminal non-coiled-coil domain of golgin-160 as bait. We found that the PDZ domain-containing protein, PIST, interacts with the head of golgin-160. In addition to a PDZ domain in the C-terminal half of the protein, PIST also contains two N-terminal coiled-coil domains. PIST colocalized with golgin-160 at the Golgi complex in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A), and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that golgin-160 and PIST can interact in vivo (Fig. 2B). We performed in vitro binding assays and identified a 127-amino acid region within PIST that directly interacts with golgin-160 (Fig. 3B). The C termini of several plasma membrane proteins, including the β1-adrenergic receptor (29He J. Bellini M. Xu J. Castleberry A.M. Hall R.A. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), interact with the PDZ domain of PIST. By contrast, the second coiled-coil domain and the linker sequence preceding the PDZ domain of PIST is necessary and sufficient to bind to golgin-160. This same region of PIST has been reported to mediate interactions with TC10, a Rho GTPase, (20Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and syntaxin-6, a Q-SNARE (23Charest A. Lane K. McMahon K. Housman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29456-29465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, exogenous expression of TC10 has been proposed to regulate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor trafficking and expression through its interaction with PIST (34Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3731-3739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of golgin-160, TC10, and syntaxin-6 to PIST may coordinate membrane trafficking of some plasma membrane proteins in cell types where these proteins are expressed. Because TC10 is not widely expressed (35Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it will be important to analyze its effect on PIST function in cells that normally express TC10. Using in vitro binding experiments, we identified a leucine repeat motif within the head of golgin-160 necessary for the direct interaction of golgin-160 with PIST (Fig. 5). Although this repeat is characteristic of leucine zipper motifs, the leucine repeat in golgin-160 does not possess the predicted coiled-coil structure required for leucine zipper-regulated dimerization. Furthermore, we previously showed that the head of golgin-160 does not homodimerize (17Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that the leucine repeat found within the head of golgin-160 is a classical leucine zipper. Although unable to mediate homodimerization, these leucines are required for golgin-160-PIST interaction. Within the segment of PIST that binds golgin-160, there is also a leucine zipper motif located in the second coiled-coil domain. Even though we were unable to detect an interaction between the second coiled-coil domain of PIST and golgin-160, we propose that a heterodimeric interaction between the leucine repeat of golgin-160 and the leucine zipper of PIST is likely necessary but not sufficient for golgin-160-PIST interaction. The head domain of golgin-160 is cleaved during programmed cell death by caspases (18Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Protein cleavage by caspases has been proposed to disrupt protein-protein interactions that are critical for protein function, contributing to apoptosis. Caspase-3 has been shown to cleave golgin-160 at Asp-139, which is located within the region required for the interaction of golgin-160 and PIST. Fusion proteins that mimic cleavage products of golgin-160 generated by caspase-3 cleavage at Asp-139 (g160-(1–139)/Myc and g160-(140–311)/Myc) were unable to bind PIST (Fig. 4B). Therefore, caspase cleavage of golgin-160 during apoptosis is likely to disrupt golgin-160-PIST interaction, which may contribute to Golgi disassembly and/or progression of apoptosis. Interestingly, the annotated mouse homolog of golgin-160, Mea-2, lacks exon 3. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed that an alternative transcript of human golgin-160 lacking exon 3 is widely expressed in human tissues (Fig. 6) and localizes to the Golgi complex (Fig. 7A). Surprisingly, golgin-160B mRNA levels ranged from 50 to 100% of the level of golgin-160A mRNA. With our current antibodies we are unable to resolve golgin-160 isoforms by SDS-PAGE. An antibody specific for exon 3 will allow us to specifically analyze golgin-160A. The alternative splicing that occurs in golgin-160B may prevent caspase-3 cleavage at Asp-99 (corresponding to Asp-139 in golgin-160A). Aside from the requirement for Asp at position 1 (P1), the amino acid present three residues upstream of the Asp (P4) is the most critical determinant of specificity (36Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Due to the alternative splicing in golgin-160B, the cysteine at P4 of golgin-160A is replaced by a glycine at P4 in golgin-160B. Use of a combinatorial peptide library demonstrated that a glycine at P4 severely inhibits caspase-3 cleavage (36Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M.

In addition, Mea-2, the mouse homolog of human golgin-160B, encodes an Ala in place of the required Asp (residue 99). Therefore, it is likely that caspase-3 is unable to cleave human golgin-160B at Asp-99 or the mouse homolog, Mea-2. Studies are currently under way to characterize the caspase cleavage of golgin-160B and its consequences. Because golgin-160B lacks three of the leucines necessary for interaction with PIST, we predicted that golgin-160B would be unable to interact with PIST. In vitro binding experiments confirmed that golgin-160B was unable to bind PIST (Fig. 7B). Therefore, it is possible that golgin-160B functions independently of PIST or that heterodimers of golgin-160A and golgin-160B may organize different binding partners into complexes. Our findings raise the possibility that golgin-160 may play a role in the transport of proteins bound to the PDZ domain of PIST. It also suggests that caspase cleavage of golgin-160 may disrupt this transport step and aid in Golgi disassembly and/or apoptotic progression. Furthermore, the ratio of golgin-160 isoforms in a given cell may allow for the regulation of PIST-dependent trafficking of cargo. Studies to address the role of golgin-160 in the trafficking of plasma membrane proteins that bind PIST are currently under way. We thank Bill Guggino for the full-length cDNA clone encoding PIST and the Puigsever laboratory for help with real-time PCR. We also thank the members of the Machamer lab for discussions and comments on the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2094211893,"The photoactivation mechanism of the sensory rho-dopsin II (SRII)-HtrII receptor-transducer complex of Natronomonas pharaonis was investigated by time-resolved Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy to identify structural changes associated with early events in the signal relay mechanism from the receptor to the transducer. Several prominent bands in the wild-type SRII-HtrII spectra are affected by amino acid substitutions at the receptor Tyr199 and transducer Asn74 residues, which form a hydrogen bond between the two proteins near the middle of the bilayer. Our results indicate disappearance of this hydrogen bond in the M and O photointermediates, the likely signaling states of the complex. This event represents one of the largest light-induced alterations in the binding contacts between the receptor and transducer. The vibrational frequency changes suggest that Asn74 and Tyr199 form other stronger hydrogen bonds in the M state. The light-induced disruption of the Tyr199-Asn74 bond also occurs when the Schiff base counterion Asp75 is replaced with a neutral asparagine. We compared the decrease in intensity of difference bands assigned to the Tyr199-Asn74 pair and to chromophore and protein groups of the receptor at various time points during the recovery of the initial state. All difference bands exhibit similar decay kinetics indicating that reformation of the Tyr199-Asn74 hydrogen bond occurs concomitantly with the decay of the M and O photointermediates. This work demonstrates that the signal relay from SRII to HtrII involves early structural alterations in the deeply membrane-embedded domain of the complex and provides a spectroscopic signal useful for correlation with the downstream events in signal transduction.

The transducer, like its homologous methyl-accepting chemotaxis transducers, possesses two transmembrane helices and a large cytoplasmic domain that binds at its distal end a His-kinase that phosphorylates a flagellar motor switch regulator (1.Hoff W.D.

Biol. 2003; 13: R47-R49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions of HtrII with the SRII receptor are localized to the transducer transmembrane and membrane-proximal domains (10.Zhang X.N. Zhu J. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A crystal structure of SRII bound to an N-terminal HtrII fragment containing the transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) shows tight van der Waals interaction and three hydrogen bonds between TM2 and SRII helices F and G (12.Gordeliy V.I.

An atomic structure of the membrane-proximal domain of the transducer is not available; however, fluorescent probe accessibility and Förster resonance energy transfer measurements show interaction of this domain with the cytoplasmic E-F loop of the receptor (13.Yang C.S.

The signal relay mechanism from SRII to HtrII in the complex has become a focus of interest in the past several years, in part because of its importance to the general understanding of interaction between integral membrane proteins. In accord with the unified model for transport and signaling by microbial rhodopsins (14.Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15.Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the key event in the transducer activation is an outward tilt of the receptor helix F during the lifetime of its M intermediate, which has been directly detected by EPR of paramagnetic probes in the free receptor (16.Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and in its complex with transducer (17.Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In a response to the helix F movements, the TM2 of HtrII is displaced from its initial position (17.Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).

This technique measures changes in the infrared absorption of protein groups and enables studies of light-induced conformational changes without the necessity of introducing potentially structure-perturbing probes. Because of its sensitivity to small changes in hydrogen bonding, it is especially well suited for the study of interactions of polar protein groups. Here we have applied time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopy to examine the changes in interaction between SRII Tyr199 and HtrII Asn74 during the light-activated photocycle. These residues form a hydrogen bond in the dark state that functions as an interhelical bridge between helix G of SRII and TM2 of HtrII embedded near the middle of the membrane interior (12.Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Assessing the environment of this hydrogen bond would answer whether the movements of helix F and TM2 previously detected near the cytoplasmic region extend more deeply into the membrane interior domain of the complex. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The wild-type construct FP120 encoded a fusion protein in which full-length SRII and the 120 N-terminal residues of HtrII containing an additional His6 tag at the C terminus are joined by the flexible linker ASASNGASA. The fusion gene was placed in plasmid pET21d (Novagen) under control of the T7 promoter. The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Single amino acid substitutions were performed using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenesis primer sequences were 5′-GGCGCTTATCGTCTTCCTTGACCTCGTCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGACGAGGTCAAGGAAGACGATAAGCGCC-3′ for the Tyr199 → Phe mutation, 5′-CCTGCTCGGGATCGACCTCGGGCTCGTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAACGAGCCCGAGGTCGATCCCGAGCAGG-3′ for Asn74 → Asp mutation, and 5′-GTCCCCCGGTACATCAACTGGATTCTCACAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTGTGAGAATCCAGTTGATGTACCGGGGGAC-3′ for the Asp75 → Asn mutation. The double mutant D75N/Y199F was constructed by two-step mutagenesis. Protein Expression and Purification—The cells were grown in LB medium + ampicillin, 50 μg/ml, to an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼0.4, and the protein synthesis was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5 μm all-trans-retinal. After the induction period, the cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer and disrupted by a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp., Newton, MA), and the membranes were then harvested by ultracentrifugation. The membranes were solubilized in 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1.5% octyl glucoside. After centrifugation of the solubilized membranes, the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and the His-tagged protein was eluted with a gradient of imidazole in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 0.8% octyl glucoside in a Biologic Duoflow system (Bio-Rad). Proteoliposome Reconstitution—Purified proteins were reconstituted in phospholipids by the dialysis procedure previously described (28.Krebs M.P. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the work reported here the protein-to-lipid ratio was 1:6.5 (w/w). Extraction of halobacterial phospholipids used in the reconstitution procedures was performed as described previously (22.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2823-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). FTIR Difference Spectroscopy—The sample preparation and FTIR measurement procedures have been described previously (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rapid-scan time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy was performed using a BRUKER IFS 66 v/s FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Billerica, MA) operating at 4 cm-1 spectral resolution and 240 kHz scanner velocity corresponding to a data acquisition window of 18 ms. Spectral Changes in the SRII-HtrII Complex Due to Tyr199 → Phe and Asn74 → Asp Substitutions—Difference spectra of the receptor-transducer complex were recorded using rapid scan FTIR difference spectroscopy and averaged over a 30–85-ms period after photoexcitation (Fig. 1). This time range is associated predominantly with accumulation of the M intermediate (24.Hein M. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1208-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is a signaling state for the transducer activation (29.Yan B. Takahashi T. Johnson R. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10686-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Several prominent bands appear at 1163 (-), 1200 (-), 1240 (-), 1544 (-), and 1567 (+) cm-1 in the spectra of wild-type SRII-HtrII complex (top trace), which have been previously assigned to the major vibrations of the retinylidene chromophore in the all-trans (negative bands) and 13-cis (positive bands) states as the receptor undergoes a transition from the dark state to the M intermediate (24.Hein M. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1208-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30.Bergo V. Mamaev S. Olejnik J. Rothschild K.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 960-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of M is also evident from the strong positive band near 1764 cm-1 due to protonation of the Schiff base counterion Asp75 and prominent bands in the amide I region at 1644 (+) and 1664 (-) cm-1 (24.Hein M. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1208-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25.Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The higher intensity of amide I peaks compared with previously reported spectra (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) may result from a shorter length (120 residues compared with 157) of the transducer segment used in this study. The Tyr199 → Phe and Asn74 → Asp substitutions (Fig. 1, middle and bottom traces, respectively) do not affect the major chromophore or protein difference bands. These results indicate that the structural changes that the chromophore and receptor undergo during the transition from the dark to the M photointermediate states are very similar for the wild-type and the mutants. On the other hand, changes are observed in spectral regions associated with tyrosine and asparagine side chain vibrations. (i) A negative shoulder near 1265 cm-1 is present in wild-type SRII-HtrII but not in the mutants (Fig. 2). This effect is similar to the difference observed previously between the spectra of wild-type SRII-HtrII complex and free receptor (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the spectra of tyrosine model compounds, a characteristic band appears between 1255 and 1275 cm-1 due to the C–O stretching mode ν7′a (CO) of a tyrosine side chain (31.Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), whose frequency is sensitive to the hydrogen-bonding environment (32.Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On this basis we assign the 1265 cm-1 (-) negative feature to Tyr199 in the dark state. A careful examination of this region also reveals a decrease in intensity at higher frequency near 1275 cm-1 induced by the Y199F substitution. This indicates that a positive band near this frequency also arises from vibrations of Tyr199 in the M intermediate of wild-type pigment. The inferred 1265/1275 (-/+) cm-1 bands are clearly seen in the double difference spectra obtained by subtraction of the Y199F mutant from the wild-type spectra. The apparent frequency upshift of the Tyr199 vibration upon photoactivation indicates that a change in the hydrogen bonding strength of Tyr199 occurs during formation of M (see “Discussion”). (ii) A prominent negative band near 1518 cm-1 has reduced intensity in N74D and disappears in the Y199F spectrum. A very strong ring mode vibration, which is sensitive to the protonation state of tyrosine, appears at 1518 cm-1 in the spectra of tyrosine recorded in HCl and near 1480 cm-1 in the spectra of tyrosinate recorded in NaOH (32.Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). From the frequency of this vibration, we conclude that Tyr199 is protonated in the receptor dark state. Note that the position of this band in the difference spectra may be affected by spectral overlap with other peaks in this region. (iii) A negative peak seen in the double difference spectrum (Fig. 2) near 1694 cm-1 was previously identified in the SRII-HtrII complex but not in the receptor alone (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is also absent in both mutant spectra. As noted previously (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), its frequency is typical for the C=O stretching mode of an asparagine side chain. This vibration is found near 1678 cm-1 in the model compound spectra and depending on the hydrogen bonding environment can shift significantly, with the lower frequency corresponding to a stronger hydrogen bond (33.Barth A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). We therefore assign the 1694 cm-1 peak to the transducer Asn74. The frequency indicates that this group is in a moderately hydrophilic environment in the SRII-HtrII resting state. A search for a positive counterpart of the 1694 cm-1 peak revealed a band near 1670 cm-1 in the double difference spectrum, thereby indicating formation of a stronger hydrogen bond. (iv) A negative peak appears at 1732 cm-1 in the N74D spectrum but is not present in WT or Y199F spectra. The C=O vibrations of protonated aspartic acid side chains appear in the 1730–1765 cm-1 range and exhibit strong dependence on the hydrogen-bonding environment (33.Barth A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). We assign the 1732 cm-1 peak to the C=O stretching vibration of the carboxylate group introduced in the Asn74 → Asp mutant. No positive bands due to Asp74 are found in this region, which would be indicative of a change in hydrogen bonding of this group during the formation of M. However we observed spectral changes near 1380 (+) and 1595 (+)cm-1 in the double difference spectra between the wild-type and N74D but not Y199F (data not shown), which are typical for deprotonated carboxylate groups (31.Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Asp74 undergoes at least a partial deprotonation during the light activation. In contrast to the SRII-HtrII complex, the spectrum of the transducer-free receptor does not exhibit peaks near 1265, 1518, and 1694 cm-1 (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The absence of tyrosine difference bands indicates that Tyr199 in the transducer-free receptor exists in a very similar environment in the dark and photointermediate states. The lack of the 1694 cm-1 peak is also in agreement with its assignment to the transducer. Furthermore, no significant changes were detected between the wild-type and Y199F SRII spectra (data not shown). We also note that in contrast to the recently reported low temperature FTIR measurements of the SRII-HtrII complex (34.Furutani Y. Kamada K. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2909-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the time-resolved measurements at 25 °C reported here reveal significant alterations in the environment of both Tyr199 and Asn74 most likely indicative of a disruption of the Tyr199-Asn74 hydrogen bond which is reestablished upon decay of the signaling state. Interaction between Tyr199 and Asn74 in the D75N Mutant of the SRII-HtrII Complex—We studied the effect of replacing the Schiff base counterion Asp75 with Asn on light-induced conformational changes in the SRII-HtrII transmembrane domain. The neutralization of the negative charge near the Schiff base strongly perturbs the photocycle (35.Schmies G. Luttenberg B. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Becker A. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 967-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36.Hein M. Radu I. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the D75N mutant is still capable of activating the transducer (13.Yang C.S. Sineshchekov O. Spudich E.N.

The spectrum of the D75N SRII-HtrII complex (Fig. 3, top trace) recorded within the first 50 ms shows predominant formation of the red-shifted O-like state instead of M as indicated by a strong positive band at 1192 cm-1 (36.Hein M. Radu I. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite the photocycle differences, a comparison of the D75N and D75N/Y199F samples (Fig. 3, bottom traces) reveals that the spectral changes, which we have assigned to disruption of the interaction between Tyr199 and Asn74 in the wild-type complex (see above), also appear in the D75N/Y199F mutant. Note, however, that the negative band assigned to Asn74 at 1694 cm-1 in the wild-type complex is at a lower frequency near 1688 cm-1 indicating an altered hydrogen bonding environment due to the D75N mutation. This peak is superimposed on a pair of intense positive/negative bands at 1700/1685 cm-1 assigned to Asn75 in the D75N mutant receptor (36.Hein M. Radu I. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Kinetics of Difference Bands Arising from the Tyr199/Asn74 Interaction and the Receptor during the Recovery of the Initial State—To test whether the return of HtrII to the initial position occurs with different kinetics than the decay of the SRII signaling state, we compared changes in the amplitude of individual difference bands measured between 50 and 250 ms (Fig. 4). In this time window all peaks exhibit a gradual decrease in intensity reflecting the return of complex to the unphotolyzed state. The majority of peaks including the negative retinal vibrational modes at 1200, 1240, and 1545 cm-1 and the carboxylic stretching mode at 1764 cm-1 exhibit an exponential decay (data not shown) with a time decay constant similar to that previously reported (38.Chizhov I. Schmies G. Seidel R. Sydor J.R. Luttenberg B. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 999-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because there is no noticeable delay between the decay of these receptor vibrations and the 1694 cm-1 band assigned to Asn74 from the transducer, we conclude that the recovery of the Tyr199-Asn74 hydrogen bonding occurs at a similar rate as SRII returns to the unphotolyzed state. In an earlier study, we compared the structural changes occurring in the transducer-free receptor SRII and a SRII-HtrII fusion complex using time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopy (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Several spectral differences were found between the two systems including bands characteristic of asparagine and tyrosine vibrations. In the present study, we focused on the interaction between Tyr199 and Asn74 that is observed in the crystal structure of SRII-HtrII in its dark state (12.Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These two residues form a hydrogen bond that functions as an interhelical pin between helix G of SRII (Tyr199) and TM2 of HtrII (Asn74) embedded near the middle of the membrane interior (12.Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). As such, changes in the vibrational spectra of Tyr199 and Asn74 represent a native probe of possible movements that involve these two helices in the middle of the membrane. To study the structural changes that specifically involve these two residues we utilized site-directed mutagenesis in combination with time-resolved FTIR. The SRII-HtrII fusion construct used here included the full-length receptor and the first 120 amino acids of the transducer, which constitute the transmembrane and membrane-proximal domains of HtrII. The use of a truncated transducer allowed us to focus on the mechanism of signal transduction from SRII to HtrII while excluding downstream events associated with signal propagation within the transducer. The results of this work show that the major spectral differences observed between the truncated SRII-HtrII complex and free receptor (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) can be ascribed to structural changes of the receptor Tyr199 and transducer Asn74 groups. Considering the sensitivity of infrared spectroscopy to detect very small alterations in the hydrogen bonding of polar groups (39.Bellamy L.J. The Infrared Spectra of Complex Molecules. 2nd Ed. Chapman and Hall, London1968Google Scholar, 40.Pimentel G.C. Sederholm C.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1956; 24: 639-641Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 41.Parker F.S. Applications of Infrared, Raman and Resonance Raman Spectroscopy in Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1983Google Scholar), it is likely that perturbations of these residues represent one of the most significant changes in the hydrogen-bonding structure of the receptor-transducer complex. These results, however, do not exclude the possibility of additional structural changes in the complex. One example is the displacements of transducer helices TM1 and TM2 in response to the receptor conformational changes. These movements are expected to give rise to difference bands in the amide I and amide II spectral regions. In fact, several amide I bands in the receptor spectra are altered in the presence of transducer (27.Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The detailed analysis of vibrations in this region is a subject of a future study. Our finding that the replacement of either Tyr199 or Asn74 alters light-induced negative bands arising from both of these groups establishes that they interact in proteoliposomes in the SRII-HtrII dark state, in agreement with the crystallographic structure (Fig. 5) (12.Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The frequencies of negative bands arising from the side chain vibrations of Tyr199 and Asn74 are also consistent with the presence of a hydrogen bond between them. The x-ray diffraction data does not resolve unambiguously whether the hydroxyl group of Tyr199 is hydrogen-bonded to the oxygen or amide nitrogen of Asn74 side chain (12.Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 34.Furutani Y. Kamada K. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2909-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The frequency of the Asn74 peak (1694 cm-1) detected in this study is considerably higher compared with the asparagine model compounds (1677 cm-1) indicating that the side chain carbonyl group is only weakly hydrogen-bonded and therefore the interaction with the Tyr199 hydroxyl group is more likely through the amide nitrogen. The FTIR results provide insight regarding the environment of Tyr199 and Asn74 in the light-activated state. The frequency downshift from 1694 to 1670 cm-1 for Asn74 points to the formation of a considerably stronger hydrogen bond in the photointermediate. This shift is larger than normally associated with environmental changes of hydrogen-bonded asparagine groups. For example, relatively small differences of 6 and 8 cm-1 were observed between the initial and M states for Asn105 in SRII (25.Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Asn230 in proteorhodopsin (26.Bergo V. Amsden J.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9075-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), respectively. On the other hand, the data for HtrII are consistent with formation of a strong hydrogen bond involving the C=O group of Asn. A large upshift of the Tyr199 vibrational mode initially near 1265 cm-1 to above 1270 cm-1 also indicates significant changes in the hydrogen bonding interaction. In particular, a shift of similar amplitude was observed for this mode in the case of Tyrosine D in photosystem II upon the replacement of nearby His189 with a Gln (32.Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, both Tyr199 and Asn74 undergo large structural alterations during the photoactivation as a result of the movements of helices F and TM2 (17.Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The observed FTIR signals in the dark and intermediate states most likely reflect disruption of the Tyr199-Asn74 interaction and formation of new stronger hydrogen bonds. However, we do not exclude the possibility that these residues still interact in the M intermediate. Such interaction may be indirect, for example through a network of hydrogen-bonded groups. Such a weak interaction is in agreement with the observation that the replacement of Tyr199 with Phe has smaller effect on the transducer affinity for the receptor in the M intermediate compared with the dark state (42.Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 427-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we demonstrated that FTIR difference spectroscopy in combination with site-directed mutagenesis can be successfully used to probe specific conformational changes that arise from interaction between two membrane proteins. In the case of the SRII-HtrII complex reported here, changes in the transmembrane domain occur during the early steps in transducer activation. The extension of this work including mutations in the cytoplasmic and extracellular protein domains should be able to provide a more comprehensive picture of the SRII-HtrII interaction and ultimately lead to the identification of the specific protein residues responsible for the transfer of the phototaxis signal from the receptor to the transducer. In addition to the peak assignment, the site-directed mutagenesis can be also used to correlate protein structural changes with the cell phototaxis response assessed from functional studies. An example of such an approach is demonstrated in the case of the receptor D75N mutant. The difference spectra of the mutant complex revealed the presence of a Tyr199-Asn74 interaction in the dark state and its perturbation upon photoactivation despite the absence of the Schiff base counterion. The similar conformational changes between the wild-type and mutant complex in the transmembrane region suggested by these results are in agreement with the ability of D75N SRII to activate the transducer. Comparison of the kinetic spectra recorded during the last photocycle transition reveals that the transducer return to the initial state, measured by disappearance of the Asn74 signal, occurs concomitantly with the decay of the photoactivated receptor. This result differs from the observation of Wegener et al. (17.Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) of slower kinetics for the recovery of paramagnetic label attached to the transducer residue Val78. The difference may be due to several factors including different measurement conditions, probing different positions in the transducer and possible additional structural changes resulting from the introduced label in the case of EPR."

The stimulation of translation is due to an increase in the rate of initiation caused by the regulation of initiation factor activities. Here, we focus on eIF3, a large multiprotein complex that plays a central role in the formation of the 40 S initiation complex. Using sucrose density gradient centrifugation to analyze ribosome complexes, we find that most eIF3 is not bound to 40 S ribosomal subunits in unactivated T lymphocytes but becomes ribosome-bound following activation. Immunoblot analyses of sucrose gradient fractions for individual eIF3 subunits show that the small eIF3j subunit is unassociated with the eIF3 complex in quiescent T lymphocytes, but upon activation joins the other eIF3 subunits and binds 40 S ribosomal subunits. Because eIF3j has been shown to be required for eIF3 binding to 40 S ribosomes in vitro, the results suggest that mitogenic stimulation of T lymphocytes leads to an activation of eIF3j, thereby enabling eIF3 to bind to the larger ribosome-free eIF3 subunit complex, and then to the 40 S ribosomes. The association of eIF3j with the other eIF3 subunits appears to be inhibited by rapamycin, suggesting a mechanism that lies downstream from the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase. This association requires ionomycin together with a phorbol ester, which also suggests that calcium signaling is involved. We conclude that the complex formation of eIF3 and its association with the ribosomes might contribute to increased translation rates during T lymphocyte activation.

We conclude that the complex formation of eIF3 and its association with the ribosomes might contribute to increased translation rates during T lymphocyte activation. Primary, mature peripheral blood T lymphocytes are in a natural, quiescent (G0) resting state until challenged by an appropriate mitogenic stimulus that prompts a growth and proliferative immune response. This growth and proliferative response is highly dependent on increased synthesis of proteins from pre-existing and newly generated mRNAs and occurs before new ribosomal RNA synthesis (1.Kay J.E. Ahern T. Atkins M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 247: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2.Kay J.E. Ahern T. Lindsay V.J. Sampson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 378: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resting T lymphocyte in culture maintains its quiescent state, exhibiting a low protein synthesis rate even in the presence of nutrients and serum growth factors in the culture media. When primary T lymphocytes are treated in culture with mitogenic stimulants, proteins synthesis rates dramatically increase. This overall increase in protein synthesis is due to an increase in the rate of translation (1.Kay J.E. Ahern T. Atkins M. Biochim. Biophys.

Also examined as potential regulatory mechanisms in lymphocytes are eIF4E and 4E-BP phosphorylation (6.Morley S.J. Rau M. Kay J.E. Pain V.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 397SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 8.Boal T.R. Chiorini J.A. Cohen R.B. Miyamoto S. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys.

Phosphorylation of eIF4E was not found to be regulatory, but phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the release of eIF4E appear to play a regulatory role in increased initiation of protein synthesis in lymphocytes. However, as suggested above, regulation at several initiation steps likely is involved. We now examine eIF3, the large multisubunit complex involved in the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, as a possible regulatory target during the activation of lymphocytes. eIF3 is the largest of the mammalian initiation factors and is implicated in a number of steps in the initiation pathway. It affects ribosome dissociation/re-association, promotes or stabilizes ternary complex binding to 40 S subunits, helps position mRNA on the 40 S ribosome through its interaction with eIF4G, and may contribute to AUG recognition by affecting eIF5 stimulation of eIF2 GTPase activity (reviewed in Refs. 12.Hershey J.W.B.

Characterization of eIF3 in mammalian cells has been hampered by its large size and complexity, and only recently have the cDNAs been cloned and sequenced for all of the subunits (16.Asano K.

The functions of the individual subunits are not yet well established. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF3 appears to consist of a core complex of only five subunits (eIF3a, -b, -c, -g, and -i), plus a non-stoichiometric subunit, eIF3j. In mammalian cells, the corresponding homologs also may constitute a “core” complex to which the other mammalian subunits bind and regulate eIF3 activity. Yeast eIF3 interacts with eIF1, eIF2β, and eIF5 to form a multifactor complex (17.Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valasek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G.

Together with its RNA-binding activity and its ability to bind stably to the 40 S ribosome, mammalian eIF3 may play an organizing role on the surface of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Several lines of evidence suggest that eIF3 activity is regulated during formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex. A small subunit, eIF3j, is cleaved by caspases in apoptosis (24.Bushell M. Wood W. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25.Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), reducing its ability to promote eIF3 binding to the 40 S subunit (26.Fraser C.S. Lee J.Y. Mayeur G.L. Bushell M. Doudna J.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Apoptosis also leads to eIF3f phosphorylation by an activated, truncated form of cyclin-dependent kinase 11, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (27.Shi J. Feng Y. Goulet A.C. Vaillancourt R.R. Sachs N.A. Hershey J.W. Nelson M.A. J. Biol.

The interferon-induced protein P56 binds to eIF3e and inhibits translation in vitro by blocking the interaction of eIF3 with the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAMeti ternary complex (30.Hui D.J. Bhasker C.R. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39477-39482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cellular level of eIF3a is reported to vary, with low levels negatively affecting the translation of ribonucleotide reductase M2 mRNA (31.Dong Z. Liu L.H. Han B. Pincheira R. Zhang J.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3790-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, numerous eIF3 subunits are implicated in cancer (32.Hershey J.W.B. Miyamoto S. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 637-654Google Scholar), suggesting that regulation of eIF3 activity may be important in cell growth control. Because peripheral blood lymphocytes are in a natural quiescent state, with low protein synthesis (translation) rates, they are an excellent system to study the regulation of translation. It is sometimes difficult to perform growth and proliferation studies in already proliferating, often transformed cell lines because: 1) the normal regulatory pathways may be mutated; 2) the cells need to be synchronized with drugs; and/or 3) the cells need to be serum-starved to reduce translation rates and then re-stimulated with serum or growth factors, leading to low translation rate (2- to 3-fold) increases. Frequent problems are high basal translation rates of serum-deprived cells and/or failure to recover when re-fed with serum. Two signals are required for optimum activation of T lymphocytes in nature. The interaction of the T cell receptor with a major histocompatibility complex-peptide presented by an accessory cell such as the macrophage provides the specific antigen-restricted signal. The second signal is provided through interaction of the CD28 molecule with its cognate ligand, the B7 family of proteins. This second antigen-unrestricted signal provides a co-stimulatory signal necessary for full T cell activation. TCR engagement with the major histocompatibility complex-peptide without B7 co-stimulation results in T cell clonal anergy (33.Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). Optimal activation of T lymphocytes can be mimicked in cell culture with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and results in a sustained increase in protein synthesis rate (34.Mao X. Green J.M. Safer B. Lindsten T. Frederickson R.M. Miyamoto S. Sonenberg N. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20444-20450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The combination of ionomycin (I) and the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA or P), also causes a rapid rise in protein synthesis rates and the onset of cell proliferation (4.Ahern T. Sampson J. Kay J.E. Nature. 1974; 248: 519-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35.Jagus R. Kay J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), comparable to anti-CD3/28. In contrast, PMA by itself (PMA alone) results in less induction of protein synthesis and no proliferation (9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that in ionomycin plus PMA (I+P)-activated T lymphocytes the second signal, provided by ionomycin, likely replaces the need for the anti-CD28 co-stimulation. Prior studies in lymphocytes identified signaling pathways that promote the overall increase in global translation rates after activation of T lymphocytes with I+P (9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Translation rates induced by I+P are greater than those induced by PMA alone, suggesting that, additional signals, likely Ca2+-activated, are responsible for the continued rate increase. Translation rates are more sensitive to treatment with PI3K and mTOR inhibitors than to MAPK inhibitors, suggesting that the PI3K and mTOR pathways are more crucial for the translation rate increase (9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Currently, the only translation initiation factors affected by the PI3K or mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and wortmannin are eIF4B (36.Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A.C. Livingstone M. Shahbazian D. Mayeur G.L. Polakiewicz R.D. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and eIF4E, the latter through the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (6.Morley S.J. Rau M. Kay J.E. Pain V.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 397SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13.Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, translation rates are sensitive to the combination of rapamycin and wortmannin, suggesting that these agents not only inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but also might independently target other translation initiation events. We already know that eIF4E phosphorylation and eIF2B exchange activity are not inhibited by these agents (9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and we cannot rule out a currently “undescribed” activity downstream of mTOR that might affect translation in T lymphocytes. The objectives of this study are to investigate if eIF3 subunit expression and eIF3 activity change in I+P- or PMA-activated T lymphocytes, elucidate how eIF3 interacts with other translational components to form the 40 S preinitiation complex, and determine if eIF3-associated translation initiation events are affected by rapamycin or wortmannin. We report the novel observation that most eIF3 in the unactivated lymphocyte is not associated with 40 S ribosomal subunits, but becomes almost completely associated after 24 h with activation conditions that promote proliferation (I+P) and not with conditions that do not (PMA alone). We also find that eIF3j is not associated with the eIF3 complex but joins the complex following activation. Because eIF3j is required for eIF3 binding to 40 S ribosomes in vitro (26.Fraser C.S. Lee J.Y. Mayeur G.L. Bushell M. Doudna J.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the results suggest that eIF3j association with eIF3 is regulated early in the activation response. Thus generation of a complete eIF3 complex, after activation, leads to eIF3–40 S ribosome binding and 40 S preinitiation complex formation, which are events inhibited by rapamycin and wortmannin. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Fisher; fetal bovine serum from Gemini; ionomycin and PMA from Sigma; nylon wool was from Robbins Scientific; goat anti-human eIF3 antibodies and cDNAs to eIF3 subunits have been described previously (16.Asano K.

Preparation and Activation of T Lymphocytes—Human T lymphocytes were obtained from normal human peripheral blood from whole blood buffy coats, discarded tonsils, or leukocyte filters and further enriched for T lymphocytes by nylon wool purification (44.Miyamoto S. Chiorini J.A. Urcelay E. Safer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pig T lymphocytes were isolated from pig whole blood, obtained from the UC Davis Meat Laboratory. Pig blood was mixed with 10% (final concentration) citrate-acetate to prevent coagulation and 1% dextran to help settle red blood cell. The upper layer above the settled red blood cells, containing the white blood cells, was removed and subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque separation (lymphocyte separation media from Cellgro). The buffy coat layer, containing a mixture of T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes, was removed, and the cell mixture was passed through sterile nylon-wool columns to enrich for the T lymphocyte population as previously described (9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml glutamine, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. T lymphocytes were activated with either 0.25 μm ionomycin plus 10 ng/ml PMA (I+P), or 10 ng/ml PMA (PMA alone). For some experiments, T lymphocytes were isolated from human tonsils using these same methods and were found to respond in a similar manner as peripheral blood lymphocytes to I+P or PMA (45.Carini C. Pini C. DiFelice G. Fattorossi A. Fratazzi C. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 101: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunoblot or Immunoprecipitation of eIF3 and eIF3 Subunits— Whole cell extracts were prepared from T lymphocytes, activated with I+P or PMA (see above), and lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer or lysed in 0.4% Nonidet P-40 in Tris buffer containing protease inhibitors. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon (Millipore) membrane. The blots were blocked with 1% gelatin (fish, Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl with 0.05% Tween 20, probed with anti-human eIF3 goat antibodies and rabbit anti-goat antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and developed with chemiluminescent substrate (Lumiglo, Cell Signaling or Western Lightening, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR or BioMax film. Immunoprecipitations were performed by first absorbing the whole cell extracts with Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), then the lymphocyte whole cell extracts were incubated with 0.5 μl of eIF3 polyclonal antibody (goat) or 1 μl of eIF3a monoclonal antibody, incubated for 1 h, 4 °C in lysis buffer (see above), then 20 μl of washed Protein G-Sepharose was added, incubated 1 h, 4 °C with rotation. The immunoprecipitates were washed (wash, 0.05 m Tris, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.14 m NaCl), analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with affinity-purified eIF3j (goat) or eIF3 polyclonal antibody (goat), with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant FLAG-tagged eIF3j was prepared and purified from Escherichia coli. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from pig lymphocytes (1.54 × 108 cells), unactivated or activated with I+P or PMA alone (0–24 h, TriReagent, Molecular Research Center). RNA concentration was quantitated (A260/280 nm, Beckman DU640), and 10 μg of RNA of each time point was sample separated on a 0.8% formaldehyde agarose gel in MOPS buffer (44.Miyamoto S. Chiorini J.A. Urcelay E. Safer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), transferred to Nytran membrane (S&S), and cross-linked using UV irradiation (Stratagene). Labeled cDNA probes were prepared from each eIF3 subunit cDNA (provided by the Hershey laboratory) by random prime labeling (Invitrogen) and [32P]dUTP (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized to the blots (44.Miyamoto S. Chiorini J.A. Urcelay E. Safer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After washing, the blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film and developed or quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Sucrose Gradient Fractionation of T Lymphocyte Cell Extracts—T lymphocytes were activated with 0.25 μm ionomycin plus 10 ng/ml PMA or 10 ng/ml PMA alone. After activation, cells were harvested, washed, and lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100) by incubation on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation for 10 min (14,000 × g) to pellet nuclei, microsomes, and unlysed cells. Supernatants were layered on top of sucrose gradients (5–45% sucrose in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 10 units/ml RNasin, Promega) and centrifuged for 4 h at 38,000 rpm, 4 °C (Beckman Ti-41 rotor). Gradients were analyzed by using an ISCO fractionator with UV254 nm detector, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were centrifuged (30 min, 4 °C, 14,000 rpm, Eppendorf centrifuge), washed twice with acetone, and dissolved in SDS loading buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) membranes, and subjected to Western blot analysis. The rate of protein synthesis begins to increase in primary peripheral blood lymphocytes grown in culture about 2–3 h after the addition of a combination of ionomycin and PMA (I+P) (9.Miyamoto S.

Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20444-20450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, T lymphocytes in the presence of PMA alone (PMA) increase the protein synthesis rate for only the first 8 h, but cannot sustain this rate increase without the presence of the calcium ionophore ionomycin (9.Miyamoto S. Kimball S.R. Safer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The combination of I+P promotes proliferation in T lymphocytes, whereas the addition of PMA alone does not (49.Kumagai N. Benedict S.H. Mills G.B. Gelfand E.W. J. Cell Physiol. 1988; 137: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 50.Kumagai N. Benedict S.H. Mills G.B. Gelfand E.W. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1393-1399PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis generally does not occur until 24 h after stimulation of lymphocytes, and cell division takes place after 48 h of stimulation (51.Ahern T. Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 73P-74PCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar); therefore increased protein synthesis occurs before DNA synthesis and is necessary for lymphocyte proliferation activation (1.Kay J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2051645990,"Although photosystem I (PSI) cyclic electron transport is essential for plants, our knowledge of the route taken by electrons is very limited. To assess whether ferredoxin (Fd) donates electrons directly to plastoquinone (PQ) or via a Q-cycle in the cytochrome (cyt) b6f complex in PSI cyclic electron transport, we characterized the activity of PSI cyclic electron transport in an Arabidopsis mutant, pgr1 (proton gradient regulation). In pgr1, Q-cycle activity was hypersensitive to acidification of the thylakoid lumen because of an amino acid alteration in the Rieske subunit of the cyt b6f complex, resulting in a conditional defect in Q-cycle activity. In vitro assays using ruptured chloroplasts did not show any difference in the activity of PGR5-dependent PQ reduction by Fd, which functions in PSI cyclic electron transport in vivo. In contrast to the pgr5 defect, the pgr1 defect did not show any synergistic effect on the quantum yield of photosystem II in crr2-2, a mutant in which NDH (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase) activity was impaired. Furthermore, the simultaneous determination of the quantum yields of both photosystems indicated that the ratio of linear and PSI cyclic electron transport was not significantly affected in pgr1. All the results indicated that the pgr1 mutation did not affect PGR5-dependent PQ reduction by Fd.

In linear flow, electrons excised from water at PSII are ultimately transferred to NADP+. Electron transport between PSII and PSI is mediated by the cyt b6f complex and coupled to translocation of protons across the thylakoid membranes from the stroma to the lumen. The resulting ΔpH is utilized in ATP synthesis. In PSI cyclic electron transport, however, electrons are recycled from either NAD(P)H or Fd to PQ, generating ΔpH without accumulation of NADPH. Both linear electron transport and PSI cyclic electron transport have been shown to be essential for photoprotection and photosynthesis in higher plants (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 2.Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In higher plants, PSI cyclic electron transport consists of two pathways, both of which partly share the route with linear electron transport. The NDH-dependent pathway was originally discovered in cyanobacteria (3.Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4.Mi H. Endo T. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 661-668Google Scholar) and was also shown to operate in PSI cyclic electron transport in the chloroplast (5.Shikanai T. Endo T. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Asada K. Yokota A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9705-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 6.Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Although the NDH complex is a major player in PSI cyclic electron transport in cyanobacteria, its contribution is minor in higher plants. Instead, the Fd-dependent route of PSI cyclic electron transport, which was discovered in the 1950s (7.Arnon D.I. Whatley F.R. Allen M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 16: 607-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), contributes significantly to ΔpH generation in higher plants. Despite this long history of interest (8.Bendall D.S. Manasse R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 23-38Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and documented physiological significance (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T.

Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), our knowledge of the machinery of Fd-dependent electron transport is limited. Recently, we showed that a small thylakoid protein, PGR5, is essential for Fd-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), although the function of the PGR5 protein is still unclear. The cyt b6f complex plays a key role in ΔpH generation in both linear and PSI cyclic electron transport (9.Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10.Cramer W.A. Zhang H. Yan J. Kurisu G. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The complex comprises four major subunits, the Rieske subunit, cyt f, cyt b6, and subunit IV, as well as four small subunits, PetL, PetG, PetM, and PetN. Fig. 1 outlines a scheme for electron transport through the cyt b6f complex, called the Q-cycle. Although the Rieske subunit binds an Fe2S2 cluster, cyt b6 binds high and low potential hemes, bH and bL. The Rieske subunit catalyzes the oxidation of plastoquinol (PQH2) at the Qo site, which is associated with the reduction of both cyt f via the Fe2S2 cluster and bL, resulting in the release of two protons to the thylakoid lumen. Bifurcated electron transport consists of a high potential chain to plastocyanin via the Fe2S2 cluster and cyt f and a low potential chain via cyt b6, allowing electron transfer across thylakoid membranes to PQ at the Qi site near the stroma side. Following discovery of Fd-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport (7.Arnon D.I. Whatley F.R. Allen M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 16: 607-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), there has been continuing debate as to whether reduced Fd donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex and then to PQ via the Q-cycle (Fig. 1, route 1) or directly to PQ (Fig. 1, route 2). In the latter case a putative Fd-PQ reductase (FQR) is required (8.Bendall D.S. Manasse R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 23-38Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar), whereas for the former the cyt b6f complex would be involved. Recently, serious consideration of the idea that Fd donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex (route 1) was revisited based on the findings that the Fd-NADP+ reductase associates with the cyt b6f complex (11.Zhang H. Whitelegge J.P. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38159-38165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also that the cyt b6f complex contains an unexpected heme, heme x, also referred to as heme ci, which is not conserved in the cyt bc1 complex in mitochondria (12.Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 13.Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To assess the possibility that Fd donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex, we characterized electron transport in an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, pgr1, in which Q-cycle activity is conditionally impaired because of an amino acid alteration in the Rieske subunit of the cyt b6f complex (14.Munekage Y.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—A. thaliana wild type (ecotype Columbia gl1) and mutants pgr1, pgr5, crr2-2, crr2-2 pgr1, and crr2-2 pgr5 were grown on soil under growth chamber conditions (20–50 μmol of photons m-2 s-1, 16-h light/8-h dark cycles at 23 °C) for 3–4 weeks. For the simultaneous determination of quantum yields of both photosystems, seedlings were cultured under short day conditions (10-h light/14-h dark) for 8 weeks. Isolation of Chloroplasts—Chloroplasts were isolated as described previously (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In Vitro Assay of Linear Electron Transport—Intact chloroplasts were osmotically ruptured in the assay media used for PSI cyclic electron transport activity (see below). Linear electron transport activity was measured using 25 μm methyl viologen as an electron acceptor in the presence of 5 mm NH4Cl. Activity was determined by the quantum yields of PSII (ΦPSII)at144 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 using a MINI-PAM (pulse amplitude modulation) portable chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ, Effeltrich, Germany). In Vitro Assay of PSI Cyclic Electron Transport Activity—Fd-dependent PQ reduction activity was measured in ruptured chloroplasts as described previously (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T.

Media were buffered using 50 mm HEPES/NaOH for pH 7.6, 5 mm MOPS/NaOH for pH 7.0 and 6.5, and 5 mm MES/NaOH for pH 6.0 and 5.5. In Vivo Analysis of Chlorophyll Fluorescence—Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured using a MINI-PAM system. The minimum chlorophyll fluorescence at the open PSII center (Fo) was determined by measuring light at a light intensity of 0.05–0.15 μmol of photons m-2 s-1. A saturating pulse of white light (800 ms) was applied to determine the maximum chlorophyll fluorescence at the closed PSII center in the dark (Fm) and during actinic light illumination (Fm′). The steady state of chlorophyll fluorescence level was recorded during actinic light illumination (20–1000 μmol of photons m-2 s-1). Efficiency of the PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII) was calculated by an equation, (Fm′ - Fs)/Fm′. Relative electron transport rate (ETR) was calculated as ΦPSII × light intensity (μmol of photons m-2 s-1). Simultaneous Determination of Quantum Yields of Both Photosystems—Changes in chlorophyll fluorescence and P700 absorbance at 830 nm were simultaneously monitored using a PAM chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ) equipped with emitter detector units ED101 for chlorophyll fluorescence and ED800T for P700. The quantum yields of PSI (ΦPSI) were calculated as (ΔAmax′-ΔA)/ΔAmax, where ΔAmax and ΔAmax′ are maximum P700+ levels induced by a flash of xenon lamp (50 ms) under far-red light illumination and actinic light illumination, respectively, and ΔA is a steady-state P700+ level during actinic light illumination. Q-cycle Activity Is Hypersensitive to Low pH in pgr1—The Arabidopsis mutant, pgr1, has a single amino acid alteration (P194L) in the Rieske subunit of the cyt b6f complex, which causes hypersensitivity of the Q-cycle to acidification of the thylakoid lumen (14.Munekage Y. Takeda S. Endo T. Jahns P. Hashimoto T. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2001; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15.Jahns P. Graf M. Munekage Y. Shikanai T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To assess the possibility that Fd donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex and then to PQ via the Q-cycle (Fig. 1, route 1), we utilized pgr1 in which Q-cycle activity is conditionally impaired. First, the pH dependence of Q-cycle activity was compared between pgr1 and the wild type in the same reaction media used for the assay of PSI cyclic electron transport (Fig. 2). Under uncoupled conditions containing 5 mm NH4Cl, no ΔpH was formed under illumination so that the lumen pH was expected to be identical to the pH of the reaction medium. Because methyl viologen efficiently accepts electrons from PSI, the Q-cycle operates preferentially in linear electron transport, and thus the activity of the Q-cycle can be evaluated as the quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII). In the wild type, ΦPSII gradually decreased from 0.55 at pH 7.6 to 0.4 at pH 5.5. Although ΦPSII was not affected in pgr1 at pH 7.6, it was markedly reduced at pH 7.0 and dropped to 0.2 at pH 6.5. This pH dependence of Q-cycle activity was consistent with a previous report using flash-induced reduction of P700 and O2 evolution as an evaluation (15.Jahns P. Graf M. Munekage Y. Shikanai T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We conclude that Q-cycle activity is hypersensitive to the lower pH of the reaction media that were used in the PSI cyclic assay. In Vitro Assay of PSI Cyclic Electron Transport Activity in pgr1—To study a possible defect in PSI cyclic electron transport activity in pgr1, electron donation to PQ from Fd was compared using ruptured chloroplasts isolated from the wild type and pgr1. Whether Fd donates electrons directly to PQ or indirectly via the cyt b6f complex (Fig. 1, routes 2 and 1, respectively), PQ reduction can be monitored as an increase in chlorophyll fluorescence emitted from PSII. In this assay system, NADPH is essential for electron donation to Fd through the reverse reaction of Fd-NADP+ reductase (17.Miyake C. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 539-549Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although addition of NADPH did not reduce PQ, it was rapidly reduced by subsequent addition of Fd. Both PGR5- and NDH-dependent pathways contribute in this electron donation to PQ (2.Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Because the NDH-dependent pathway also requires Fd in our assay system, we refer to the Fd-dependent, antimycin A-sensitive pathway as the PGR5-dependent pathway hereafter to avoid confusion. To monitor the effect of impaired Q-cycle activity in pgr1 on the PGR5-dependent PQ reduction, the reaction medium was acidified from pH 7.6 to 5.5 in a stepwise manner. Unexpectedly, the activity of PQ reduction was drastically affected even at pH 7.0 and completely inhibited at pH 5.5 in the wild type (Fig. 3), implying that electron transfer from NADPH to PQ requires slightly alkaline pH (pH 7.6). This pH sensitivity of PQ reduction was observed both in pgr5 (data not shown) and crr2-2 (chlororespiratory reduction) (Fig. 4). NDH activity is specifically affected in crr2-2, in which the expression of the chloroplast ndhB gene encoding a subunit of the NDH complex is impaired (18.Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These results indicate that both PGR5- and NDH-dependent pathways are active at the slightly alkaline pH (pH 7.6) of our in vitro assay system. It is possible that the common reaction required for both pathways, which is probably the reverse reaction of Fd-NADP+ reductase (19.Carrillo N. Lucero H.A. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1058-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is sensitive to pH lower than 7.0.Fig. 4The pH dependence of PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport activity in vitro. The same experimental procedure was used as for Fig. 3 except that crr2-2 and crr2-2 pgr1mutants were used. To inhibit the PGR5-dependent PQ reduction pathway, 10 μm antimycin A was added prior to analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the possible effect of the pgr1 mutation on PSI cyclic electron transport, the pH dependence of PQ reduction activity was compared between pgr1 and wild type. In pgr1, the activity of PQ reduction was severely affected at pH 7.0 and reduced to almost undetectable levels at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3). However, this pH dependence was similar to that in the wild type, suggesting that the hypersensitivity of the Q-cycle did not affect the activity of PQ reduction in pgr1. Because PQ reduction activity consists of two redundant pathways, the PGR5- and NDH-dependent pathways (2.Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), evaluation of the pH dependence of the PGR5-dependent pathway may be influenced by NDH activity. Based on analogy with the mitochondrial and bacterial NADH dehydrogenase, it is highly possible that the chloroplast NDH will donate electrons directly to PQ, and thus NDH activity is unlikely to be affected by the pgr1 mutation. To simplify the assay system, we used crr2-2, in which NDH activity was specifically impaired (18.Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of the pgr1 mutation within the crr2 mutant background, a double mutant, crr2-2 pgr1, was compared with a single mutant, crr2-2. The PQ reduction activity remaining under the crr2-2 mutant background was because of PGR5-dependent activity and completely impaired by addition of 10 μm antimycin A (Fig. 4). Even in the absence of antimycin A, the activity of PQ reduction was completely impaired in the double mutant crr2-2 pgr5 (2.Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). As in the wild type, PQ reduction activity was drastically affected even at pH 7.0 in crr2-2 (Fig. 4), indicating that PGR5-dependent activity requires a slightly alkaline pH. In the double mutant crr2-2 pgr1 the activity of PQ reduction was also reduced upon a decrease in pH of the reaction medium. However, we did not find any difference in sensitivity to the medium pH between crr2-2 and crr2-2 pgr1. We conclude that the pgr1 mutation does not affect the activity of PGR5-dependent PQ reduction in the in vitro assay system using ruptured chloroplasts. In Vivo Assay of PSI Cyclic Electron Transport Activity in pgr1—Although the thylakoid lumen is acidified in the light, the stroma is slightly alkaline in vivo. In our in vitro assay system, however, the stromal side was also acidified, which may have introduced an artificial effect on electron transport. In fact, the activity of PQ reduction by Fd in ruptured chloroplasts was sensitive to a pH of less than 7.0 in both wild type (Fig. 3) and crr2-2 (Fig. 4). To eliminate this as a possible problem, the ETR was compared between crr2-2 pgr1 and crr2-2 in vivo (Fig. 5). ETR was calculated from a chlorophyll fluorescence parameter of ΦPSII and represents the relative rate of electron transport through PSII during steady-state photosynthesis. As reported previously, ETR was specifically impaired at high light intensity in pgr1 (14.Munekage Y. Takeda S. Endo T. Jahns P. Hashimoto T. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2001; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the phenotype being explained by the hypersensitivity of the Q-cycle to lumen acidification (15.Jahns P. Graf M. Munekage Y. Shikanai T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although pgr5 exhibited a similar phenotype in ETR to pgr1, the defect was because of different physiological events (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 2.Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The pgr5 defect in PSI cyclic electron transport leads to a reduction in the ATP/NADPH production ratio during photosynthesis, which causes the over-reduction of the stroma. The resulting depletion of NADP+ limits linear electron transport specifically at high light intensity. The contribution of the NDH-dependent pathway for ATP synthesis is much lower compared with the PGR5-dependent pathway. Therefore, crr2-2 did not show a defect in ETR at any light intensity, consistent with results for other mutants lacking NDH activity (5.Shikanai T. Endo T. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Asada K. Yokota A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9705-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 18.Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 20.Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In the double mutant, crr2-2 pgr5, however, ETR was drastically impaired even at a low light intensity of less than 100 μmol of photons m-2 s-1. This result indicates that the NDH-dependent pathway also contributes to ATP synthesis, a function that is essential under the pgr5 mutant background (2.Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Thus, crr2-2 is an enhancer of a defect in the PGR5-dependent pathway. If PGR5-dependent PQ reduction is through the cyt b6f complex (Fig. 1, route 1) and is affected by the pgr1 mutation in the Rieske subunit, the pgr1 phenotype is a mixture of defects in Q-cycle activity and the PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic pathway. Within the crr2-2 mutant background, a possible defect in the PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic pathway in pgr1 may be enhanced, as occurred for the double mutant crr2-2 pgr5. In crr2-2 pgr1, however, light intensity dependence of ETR was identical to that in pgr1 (Fig. 5). In contrast to the synergistic effect of the crr2-2 defect on pgr5, the crr2-2 defect did not enhance the pgr1 phenotype. This result indicates that the activity of PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport was not impaired at any light intensity in vivo in pgr1. Considering this together with the results of in vitro analysis (Figs. 3 and 4), we concluded that the PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport was not affected by the pgr1 mutation in the Rieske subunit. In Vivo Assay of the Ratio between Linear and PSI Cyclic Electron Transport in pgr1—The crr2-2 mutation did not enhance the pgr1 phenotype, indicating that PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport was not affected in pgr1. Even assuming that the cyt b6f complex is not involved in the activity of PGR5-dependent PQ reduction by Fd, PQH2 is reoxidized at the Qo site of the cyt b6f complex, indicating that the entire pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport is inevitably through the cyt b6f complex. Therefore, it is likely that both the PSI cyclic and linear electron pathways are limited at the cyt b6f complex at high light intensity in pgr1. To evaluate the effect of the pgr1 defect on both electron transport pathways quantitatively, the ratio between linear and PSI cyclic electron transport was compared between pgr1 and wild type (Fig. 6). Although PSII photochemistry is preferentially involved in linear electron transport, PSI photochemistry mediates both linear and PSI cyclic electron transport. Recently, we established a method for the simultaneous determination of PSII and PSI photochemical efficiencies, ΦPSII and ΦPSI. 2M. Tsuyama, T. Shikanai, and Y. Kobayashi, manuscript in preparation. Fig. 6, A and B, shows the quantum yields of both photosystems at each light intensity. In pgr1 both quantum yields were decreased, especially at the higher light intensities of 270 and 560 μmol of photons m-2 s-1. Unexpectedly, the efficiency of PSI photochemistry was higher in pgr1 at low light intensity (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6C shows two-dimensional plots of the quantum yields of both photosystems. When the ratio is 1.0, all of the photochemical reactions of PSI are linked to the PSII photochemical reactions, indicating that there is no contribution of PSI cyclic electron transport. At all light intensities used, ΦPSI/ΦPSII was ∼1.3, which was not influenced in pgr1. This result indicates that the ratio of PSI cyclic electron transport was ∼30% of linear electron transport in the wild type. Although the pgr1 defect affected the quantum yields of both photosystems, the ratio of linear and PSI cyclic electron transport was not significantly affected. This result is consistent with our conclusion that the pgr1 defect does not affect PGR5-dependent PQ reduction by Fd. From the first discovery of PSI cyclic electron transport, the idea that Fd directly donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex has been widely discussed. In early publications this idea was partly based on the finding that PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport was sensitive to antimycin A (8.Bendall D.S. Manasse R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 23-38Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 21.Tagawa K. H Tsujimoto Y. Arnon D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 49: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Antimycin A binds to the Qi site of the cyt bc1 complex and inhibits the donation of electrons to quinone (22.von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Because antimycin A inhibits PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport, it was plausible that Fd directly donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex and subsequently to PQ via the Q-cycle at the Qi site in PSI cyclic electron transport. However, it was subsequently revealed that antimycin A did not impair the Q-cycle in the cyt b6f complex (23.Moss D.A. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 767: 389-395Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus antimycin A somehow specifically inhibits PSI cyclic electron transport rather than pleiotropically via inhibition of the Q-cycle (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 24.Joët, T., Cournac, L., Horváth, E. M., Medgyesy, P., and Peltier, G. Plant Physiol. 125, 1919-1929Google Scholar). We are still not sure how antimycin A inhibits PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport, and the route of electron flow from Fd to PQ in the PSI cyclic electron transport must be seriously reconsidered. To assess the possibility that Fd directly donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex, we characterized the activity of PGR5-dependent PQ reduction in pgr1, in which the Q-cycle is conditionally impaired. Neither in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4) nor in vivo assays (Figs. 5 and 6) showed any evidence that the cyt b6f complex is involved in PGR5-dependent PQ reduction. The most straightforward explanation for these results is that Fd directly donates electrons to PQ (Fig. 1, route 2) and not to the cyt b6f complex. For this model, a putative enzyme, FQR, must be hypothesized (8.Bendall D.S. Manasse R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 23-38Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar), but it has not been characterized thus far. PGR5 is a thylakoid membrane protein essential for PQ reduction and may provide a clue as to the identity of FQR. However, PGR5 is unlikely to bind any prosthetic group, suggesting that other proteins are directly involved in electron transport and that PGR5 is an accessory protein of the FQR complex. It is also still possible that the pgr1 mutation did not affect electron transport from Fd to PQ through the cyt b6f complex, even though the Q-cycle was severely impaired. Both hemes, bH and x, may be required for reduction of PQ without electrons passing through the cyt b6f complex in the PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport. This idea would explain why photosynthetic systems contain heme x, as it would be required to gate the two electron transfer reactions. Fd may reduce two hemes at the Qi center, and these may then reduce PQ. Our results on pgr5 (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) are not necessarily inconsistent with this idea. PGR5 may be a factor facilitating the access of Fd to the cyt b6f complex. However, PGR5 is stable even in the mutant background completely lacking the cyt b6f complex, suggesting that PGR5 is not a subunit of the cyt b6f complex (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The classical view that Fd donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex was at least partly based on the idea that antimycin A inhibited the reduction of PQ at the Qi site in the cyt b6f complex, which was found to be incorrect. However, the recent discovery of heme x (heme ci) made us reconsider this possibility. Heme x may provide clarification of the route of PGR5-dependent PQ reduction, especially in light of suggestions that heme x is involved in electron transfer from Fd to PQ (12.Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 13.Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 25.Zhang H. Primak A. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16329-16336Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, site-directed mutagenesis of cytochrome b6, which altered cysteine35 to valine in the covalent link to heme x, generated a mutant in which the cyt b6f complex could not be assembled (26.de Vitry C. Desbois A. Redeker V. Zito F. Wollman F.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3956-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At present, there seems to be no evidence suggesting that heme x is involved in direct electron donation from Fd to the cyt b6f complex. Taken together with the results from pgr1, we prefer the idea that Fd directly donates electrons to PQ as a working model (Fig. 1, route 2). Regardless of whether Fd donates electrons to the cyt b6f complex or PQ in PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport, PQH2 is reoxidized at the Qo site of the cyt b6f complex, the reaction that is shared with linear electron transport. However, we could not find any alteration in ΦPSI/ΦPSII in pgr1 except for the unexpected high ratio at low light intensity (Fig. 6), indicating that the ratio of linear and PSI cyclic electron transport was not significantly disturbed. Although we could not eliminate the possibility that the high level reduction of the PQ pool during photosynthesis would have modified the ratio slightly in pgr1, the effect was rather minor. In contrast, ΦPSI/ΦPSII was significantly reduced in pgr5.2 These results indicate that pgr1 is defective in the route of electron transfer shared by linear and PSI cyclic electron transport, that is, in the Q-cycle. In contrast, the PSI cyclic pathway is specifically impaired in pgr5, resulting in indirect effects on linear electron transport because of over-reduction of the stroma. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that there was no synergistic effect of the crr2 defect on pgr1 (Fig. 5) and also in vitro assays (Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast to pgr5, the balance of PSI cyclic and linear electron transport was not significantly affected in pgr1 (Fig. 6C). We consider that the ATP/NADPH production ratio is not drastically disturbed in pgr1, although the production rate of ATP and NADPH was decreased at high light intensity by the impaired Q-cycle activity. This idea is consistent with the fact that P700 was slightly more oxidized in pgr1 during photosynthesis (14.Munekage Y. Takeda S. Endo T. Jahns P. Hashimoto T. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2001; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the change in oxidation level being explained by the limitation of electron transport at the cyt b6f complex. A similar phenotype was observed in pgr3 (27.Yamazaki H. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2004; 38: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), in which the level of the cyt b6f complex was reduced, and also in paa1 (28.Shikanai T. Müller-Moule P. Munekage Y. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which has dramatically lowered levels of plastocyanin. In contrast, when the ATP production ratio is decreased, depletion of NADP+ causes reduction of P700+ due to charge recombination, as was observed in pgr5 (1.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of PSI to high light intensity in pgr5 can be ascribed to this over-reduction of the stroma. pgr1 and pgr5 have been shown to exhibit similar phenotypes in terms of chlorophyll fluorescence, lack of NPQ induction, and specific reduction in ETR level at high light intensity. However, pgr5 is much more sensitive to excessive light stresses because of the defect in preventing stromal over-reduction, and its phenotype is drastically enhanced under the crr2 mutant background (2.Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). We consider that there is a strong requirement for plants to maintain the balance of linear and PSI cyclic electron transport."
