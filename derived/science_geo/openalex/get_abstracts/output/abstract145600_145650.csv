https://openalex.org/W2154554320,"Caspase-3 initiates apoptotic DNA fragmentation by proteolytically inactivating DFF45 (DNA fragmentation factor-45)/ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase), which releases active DFF40/CAD (caspase-activated DNase), the inhibitor's associated endonuclease. Here, we examined whether other apoptotic proteinases initiated DNA fragmentation via DFF45/ICAD inactivation. In a cell-free assay, caspases-3, -6, -7, -8, and granzyme B initiated benzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) cleaving caspase activity, DFF45/ICAD inactivation, and DNA fragmentation, but calpain and cathepsin D failed to initiate these events. Strikingly, only the DEVD cleaving caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, inactivated DFF45/ICAD and promoted DNA fragmentation in an in vitro DFF40/CAD assay, suggesting that granzyme B, caspase-6, and caspase-8 promote DFF45/ICAD inactivation and DNA fragmentation indirectly by activating caspase-3 and/or caspase-7. In vitro, however, caspase-3 inactivated DFF45/ICAD and promoted DNA fragmentation more effectively than caspase-7 and endogenous levels of caspase-7 failed to inactivate DFF45/ICAD in caspase-3 null MCF7 cells and extracts. Together, these data suggest that caspase-3 is the primary inactivator of DFF45/ICAD and therefore the primary activator of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Caspase-3 initiates apoptotic DNA fragmentation by proteolytically inactivating DFF45 (DNA fragmentation factor-45)/ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase), which releases active DFF40/CAD (caspase-activated DNase), the inhibitor's associated endonuclease.

Strikingly, only the DEVD cleaving caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, inactivated DFF45/ICAD and promoted DNA fragmentation in an in vitro DFF40/CAD assay, suggesting that granzyme B, caspase-6, and caspase-8 promote DFF45/ICAD inactivation and DNA fragmentation indirectly by activating caspase-3 and/or caspase-7.

Caspase proteinases drive apoptotic signaling and execution by cleaving critical cellular proteins solely after aspartate residues (reviewed in Ref. 1Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Caspases exist as latent zymogens, but apoptotic death stimuli activate the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Death receptors such as Fas induce caspase-8 activation via the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain protein. Chemotherapeutic agents and UV irradiation cause release of mitochondrial cytochromec, which then binds the adapter molecule apoptotic proteinase activating factor-1 (APAF-1), 1The abbreviations used are:APAF-1apoptotic proteinase activating factor-1DFF40DNA fragmentation factor-40DFF45DNA fragmentation factor-45CADcaspase-activated DNaseICADinhibitor of caspase-activated DNaseDEVD-AFCbenzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarinLEHD-AFCN-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-AFCZVAD-fmkbenzoyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketoneGSTglutathioneS-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethane sulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1The abbreviations used are:APAF-1apoptotic proteinase activating factor-1DFF40DNA fragmentation factor-40DFF45DNA fragmentation factor-45CADcaspase-activated DNaseICADinhibitor of caspase-activated DNaseDEVD-AFCbenzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarinLEHD-AFCN-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-AFCZVAD-fmkbenzoyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketoneGSTglutathioneS-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethane sulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and this complex along with adenine nucleotides promotes caspase-9 autoactivation. Once activated, initiator caspases in turn activate the executioner caspases, caspases-3, -6, and -7. The active executioners promote apoptosis by cleaving cellular substrates that induce the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis (1Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

DFF45/ICAD exists as a complex with a 40-kDa endonuclease termed DFF40/caspase-activated nuclease/CAD (caspase-activated DNase) that promotes apoptotic DNA fragmentation (3Enari M. Sakahira H.

DFF45/ICAD serves as both a specific inhibitor of DFF40/CAD and as a molecular chaperone to ensure proper folding of the endonuclease (3Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

DFF40/CAD remains inactive while bound to DFF45/ICAD; however, caspase-3 cleaves DFF45/ICAD at two sites, thereby releasing the endonuclease, which then cleaves DNA. DFF45/ICAD cleavage at the N-terminal caspase site (Asp117) is both necessary and sufficient for DFF40/CAD activation; however, DFF45/ICAD cleaved only at the C-terminal caspase site (Asp224), retains DFF40/CAD inhibitory activity (6Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). In contrast to DFF40/CAD, a mitochondrial protein termed apoptosis inducing factor, may induce high molecular weight DNA fragmentation in a caspase-independent manner (8Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K.

Besides caspase-3, caspases-6, -7, -8, -9, the cytotoxic T cell proteinase granzyme B, the calcium-dependent proteinase calpain, and the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin D may function during apoptosis (9Orth K.

These proteinases have all been suggested to participate in apoptotic DNA fragmentation; however, the mechanism(s) by which they promote DNA fragmentation remain unclear. Here, we examined whether these proteinases induced DNA fragmentation by inactivating DFF45/ICAD. We find that caspase-3 and caspase-7 are the only direct inactivators of DFF45/ICAD. However, endogenous levels of caspase-7 failed to inactivate the inhibitor or promote DNA fragmentation in vitro or in intact cells, suggesting that caspase-3 is the primary regulator of apoptotic DNA fragmentation via proteolysis of DFF45/ICAD. Benzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (DEVD-AFC) and N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-AFC (LEHD-AFC) were from Enzyme Systems Products. Benzoyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (ZVAD-fmk) was from Bachem. Antibodies against the following proteins were purchased commercially: caspases-3, -6, -7, -8 (Pharmingen) and actin (ICN Biomedicals). Dr. Xiadong Wang (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) provided anti-DFF45/ICAD antibodies (2Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Antibodies against APAF-1 and caspase-9 have been described previously (13Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C.

Dr. Shigekazu Nagata (Osaka University Medical School, Japan) provided plasmids encoding DFF40/CAD (pBS-mCAD) and DFF45/ICAD (pBS-mICADL) (3Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). The DFF45/ICAD cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGex4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DFF45/ICAD was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Drs. Guy Salvesen (The Burnham Institute) and Vishva Dixit (Genentech) provided plasmids encoding histidine-tagged caspases-3, -6, -7, and -8 (9Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

A construct encoding 6×-histidine tagged caspase-9 was produced using the polymerase chain reaction and a topoisomerase-based cloning system (Invitrogen). Briefly, the coding region of caspase-9 was amplified from the pRSV-LacZ-caspase-9 plasmid (15Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) (Dr. Emad Alnemri, Thomas Jefferson University). The polymerase chain reaction product was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by gel extraction (Qiagen). The gel-purified product was then cloned into the pTrcHis2TOPO vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fidelity of the construct sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Caspases were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on Ni2+-Sepharose, and active site titrated with ZVAD-fmk as described (13Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.

Granzyme B (13 units/μg) was from Enzyme Systems Products. Calpain was purchased from Calbiochem and active site titrated with calpeptin (Calbiochem) (13Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsin D (651 units/mg) was from Calbiochem. Cytosolic extracts from Jurkat cells and MCF7 cells were prepared as described (13Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R.

Cell-free reactions were conducted in the following buffers (as indicated): CAD buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 20% v/v glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), calpain buffer (CAD buffer lacking EGTA and containing 2.5 mmcalcium chloride and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and cathepsin D buffer (10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.7, 50 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Since preliminary experiments demonstrated that calcium present in calpain buffer promoted DNA fragmentation even without calpain addition, we performed cell-free reactions in two steps. First, extracts were treated with proteinases or cytochrome c plus dATP as indicated in the figure legends. Aliquots of each reaction mixture were then withdrawn for caspase assay and Western blot analysis (13Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, 106 rat liver nuclei and 5 mm EGTA were added to the extracts and the reactions then continued for the indicated times. DNA fragmentation was subsequently visualized via agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (17Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Faraschon D.M. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For the kinetic analysis described in the legend to Fig. 4, cell-free reactions were performed by mixing cytosolic extract, nuclei, and cytochromec plus dATP in a single step as described in the figure legend. 35S-DFF45/ICAD was prepared from pBS-ICADL using [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a reticulocyte lysate transcription and translation system (Promega). Since functional DFF40/CAD can only be produced in the presence of DFF45/ICAD (3Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 7Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we included 200 ng of GST-DFF45/ICAD in the transcription/translation reaction to prepare35S-pro-DFF40/CAD. Aliquots (2 μl) of35S-DFF45/ICAD and 35S-pro-DFF40/CAD were incubated with proteinases in caspase buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.2) as indicated in the figure legends and the products subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In vitro DFF40/CAD assays were performed as described (3Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). Briefly, pro-DFF40/CAD was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of 200 ng of GST-DFF45/ICAD. Aliquots (2 μl) of pro-DFF40/CAD were incubated with proteinases for 30 min at 30 °C. 106 nuclei and EGTA (final concentration 5 mm) were added to the reaction mixture and after 2 h DNA fragmentation was analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (17Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Faraschon D.M. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In control experiments, we determined that the reticulocyte lysate used for transcription and translation did not have DNase activity either in the absence or presence of proteinases or cytochrome c plus dATP. Dr. Margret Huflejt (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology) provided the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% w/v), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). For induction of apoptosis, cells were incubated for 24 h with 50 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (Genentech) plus 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) or with 50 μm paclitaxel (Sigma). DNA fragmentation was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining (13Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with propidium iodide staining (17Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Faraschon D.M. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We first assessed whether various apoptotic proteinases could promote DNA fragmentation in a cell-free assay. Proteinases were incubated with cytosolic extracts from Jurkat T cells and subsequently examined for DNase activity using rat liver nuclei as a substrate. We also examined whether the proteinase-treated extracts cleaved DFF45/ICAD and the fluorogenic caspase substrate DEVD-AFC. As shown in Fig. 1, all proteinases examined promoted DFF45/ICAD cleavage as demonstrated by Western blotting. However, not all cleavage events inactivated the inhibitor. Caspases-3, -6, and -7 produced DFF45/ICAD cleavage products of ∼23 and ∼12 kDa. Note that the ∼23-kDa band likely represents intermediate cleavage products resulting from cleavage at one of the two caspase cleavage sites; whereas, the broad band at ∼12 kDa probably represents a composite of the three DFF45/ICAD fragments observed when the inhibitor is cleaved at both caspase sites (2Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). The control lane shows a small amount of the intermediate cleavage products, likely due to background caspase activity. With granzyme B and cytochrome c plus dATP, only the ∼12-kDa fragments were observed, suggesting cleavage had occurred at both caspase cleavage sites. By contrast, calpain prompted loss of DFF45/ICAD immunoreactivity and cathepsin D produced a ∼19-kDa DFF45/ICAD fragment. Strikingly, only the caspases, granzyme B, and cytochromec plus dATP elicited DEVD cleaving caspase activity (Fig.1 A), DFF45/ICAD inactivation, and DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 C). As in apoptotic cells (2Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar), DNA fragmentation correlated with the production of ∼12-kDa DFF45/ICAD fragments. Although calpain and cathepsin D induced DFF45/ICAD cleavage, they failed to inactivate the inhibitor, induce DNA fragmentation, or activate DEVD cleaving caspases. This suggests that DEVD cleaving caspase activity is not necessary for DFF45/ICAD cleavage, but is required for inactivation of the inhibitor and DNA fragmentation. We also examined whether the initiator caspases functioned in the cell-free assay. Caspase-8 (50 nm) induced DEVDase activity, DFF45/ICAD cleavage, and DNA fragmentation (not shown). Caspase-9 failed to promote these events; however, our caspase-9 preparation showed little activity against the fluorogenic caspase-9 substrate LEHD-AFC. This is probably due to lack of cofactors since caspase-9 demonstrates little activity in the absence of cytochromec, dATP, and cyotsolic factors (APAF-1) (18Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). We next asked whether the preceding apoptotic proteinases directly cleaved DFF45/ICAD or DFF40/CAD that was bound to the inhibitor. To accomplish this, we treated 35S-DFF45/ICAD and35S-pro-DFF40/CAD with each proteinase and examined the products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2 A, DFF45/ICAD was susceptible to each proteinase; however, the extent and pattern of DFF45/ICAD cleavage varied with each proteinase. Caspase-3, caspase-7, and cytochrome c plus dATP-treated cytosol produced a similar cleavage pattern with products of ∼24, 22, and 12 kDa. Caspase-6 and granzyme B produced a small amount of ∼24- and ∼12-kDa products. Cathepsin D and calpain produced distinct products of ∼19 and 25 kDa, respectively. By contrast, only granzyme B cleaved DFF40/CAD, producing a small amount of a ∼35-kDa product (Fig. 2 B). Thus, several apoptotic proteinases cleave DFF45/ICAD, however, DFF40/CAD resists proteolysis. To determine whether DFF45/ICAD cleavage inactivated the inhibitor and released active DFF40/CAD, we treated pro-DFF40/CAD (prepared byin vitro transcription and translation in the presence of GST-DFF45/ICAD) with each proteinase and then examined DNase activity against rat liver nuclei. Strikingly, although each proteinase cleaved DFF45/ICAD, only caspases-3, and -7 inactivated the inhibitor, prompting release of active DFF40/CAD and DNA fragmentation (Fig.2 C). The initiator caspase, caspases-8, also failed to inactivate DFF45/ICAD, even at concentrations up to 200 nm(not shown). DFF45/ICAD inactivation and DNA fragmentation correlated with production of 24-, 22-, and 12-kDa DFF45/ICAD fragments that were only observed with caspase-3 and caspase-7 or when35S-DFF45/ICAD was incubated with cytochrome cplus dATP-treated cytosol (Fig. 2 A). Although the other proteinases cleaved DFF45/ICAD, they failed to inactivate the inhibitor. Since granzyme B, caspase-6, and caspase-8 promoted DFF45/ICAD inactivation and DNA fragmentation in the cell-free assay (Fig. 1), they probably function in this system via activation of caspases-3 and/or -7. We next examined the reaction of caspase-3 and caspase-7 with DFF45/ICAD in detail since these proteinases were the only direct inactivators of the inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 3 A, when equal amounts (40 nm) of caspase-3 or caspase-7 were reacted with 35S-DFF45/ICAD, caspase-3 cleaved the inhibitor more rapidly than caspase-7. DFF45/ICAD cleavage was evident within 10 min following caspase-3 treatment and complete by 2 h. By contrast, caspase-7 did not produce detectable DFF45/ICAD cleavage until 2 h and only ∼50% of the DFF45/ICAD was cleaved at 4 h. In concentration dependence experiments (Fig.3 B), caspase-3 also cleaved DFF45/ICAD more efficiently than caspase-7. Following a 30-min incubation, DFF45/ICAD cleavage was detectable with as little as 8.8 nm caspase-3; however, DFF45/ICAD cleavage by caspase-7 was not detectable until the caspase concentration was 88 nm. To determine if DFF45/ICAD cleavage corresponded with release of active DFF40/CAD, we incubated various concentrations of caspase-3 or caspase-7 with pro-DFF40/CAD and rat liver nuclei and then monitored DNA fragmentation. As shown in Fig. 3 C, caspase-3 induced detectable DNA fragmentation at 50 nm, whereas with caspase-7, DNA fragmentation required 150 nm caspase-7. Together, the data indicate that caspase-3 inactivates DFF45/ICAD and induces DNA fragmentation more efficiently than caspase-7. To determine whether endogenous levels of caspase-7 could cleave DFF45/ICAD and promote DNA fragmentation in the absence of caspase-3, we used caspase-3 null MCF7 cell extracts in a cell-free assay. The MCF7 cells lacked caspase-3 as demonstrated by Western blotting, although they contained caspases-6, -7, -8, -9, and APAF-1 at comparable levels to Jurkat cells (not shown). We treated the extracts with cytochrome c plus dATP and then examined DEVDase activity, procaspase-7 processing, DFF45/ICAD cleavage, and DNA fragmentation as a function of time. For comparison, we also analyzed these events in Jurkat cell extracts, which contain caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 4, cytochromec plus dATP initiated procaspase-7 processing and the onset of DEVD cleaving caspase activity in Jurkat and MCF7 extracts. However, procaspase-7 processing occurred earlier and was more extensive in the Jurkat extracts. Procaspase-3 processing occurred with identical kinetics to procaspase-7 processing in the Jurkat extracts (not shown). The Jurkat extracts demonstrated ∼10-fold greater DEVDase activity than the MCF7 cells at 2 h, likely due to the combined activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7. Although DEVDase activity declined with time in the Jurkat extracts, the Jurkat DEVDase activity remained substantially greater than the MCF7 DEVDase activity at all time points. Caspase-7 processing and DEVDase activity correlated with the extent of DFF45/ICAD cleavage and DNA fragmentation in both extracts (Fig. 4, B and C). In the Jurkat extracts, DFF45/ICAD cleavage was complete by 2 h; whereas, even after 6 h, only ∼50% of DFF45/ICAD had been cleaved in the MCF7 extracts. Strikingly, while DNA fragmentation had occurred by 2 h in the Jurkat extracts, little DNA fragmentation had occurred in the MCF7 extracts even after 6 h of incubation, despite caspase-7 activation and partial DFF45/ICAD cleavage. Thus, cytochromec plus dATP initiate caspase-7 activation in the MCF7 extracts, but this does not inactivate DFF45/ICAD or promote significant DNA fragmentation. Similarly, we detected caspase-7-like DEVDase activity in extracts prepared from apoptotic MCF7 cells, but we detected no DNA fragmentation by agarose gel analysis or propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (not shown). We next incubated caspase-3 with MCF7 extracts and nuclei to determine whether this proteinase could initiate DNA fragmentation. Fig.4 D shows that 125 nm caspase-3 induced DNA fragmentation in the extracts. Similarly, addition of exogenous caspase-7 to the extracts initiated DNA fragmentation, although this required a higher concentration than caspase-3 (not shown). Together, these data suggest that in the absence of caspase-3, endogenous levels of caspase-7 do not inactivate DFF45/ICAD. In this paper, we examined whether various apoptotic proteinases could promote internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by inactivating DFF45/ICAD, thereby releasing active DFF40/CAD. Of the eight proteinases examined, we find that only caspase-3 and caspase-7 are direct inactivators of DFF45/ICAD. However, caspase-3 was the more efficient inactivator and endogenous levels of caspase-7 failed to release active DFF40/CAD, suggesting that caspase-3 is the primary activator of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. These findings confirm and extend those of Liu et al. (19Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) who recently demonstrated that caspases-3 and -7, but not caspases-6 and -8, inactivate recombinant DFF45, releasing active DFF40 (19Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Additionally, our work emphasizes the central importance of caspase proteinases, particularly caspase-3, as the principal mediators of apoptosis. Three lines of evidence support our finding that caspase-3 is the primary inactivator of DFF45/ICAD and thus the primary activator of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. First, only proteinases that initiated DEVDase activity in Jurkat extracts, which is due primarily to caspase-3 inactivated DFF45/ICAD and initiated DNA fragmentation (Fig.1). Second, caspase-3 cleaved DFF45/ICAD and promoted DNA fragmentation more effectively than caspase-7, the only other direct DFF45/ICAD inactivator (Figs. 2 and 3). Third, caspase-3 null MCF7 cells failed to fragment DNA during apoptosis and cytochrome c plus dATP-activated MCF7 extracts did not inactivate DFF45/ICAD or promote DNA fragmentation, despite caspase-7 activation (Fig. 4). However, addition of caspase-3 to these extracts restored their caspase-dependent DNase activity. These findings are consistent with the delayed or absent apoptotic DNA fragmentation observed in caspase-3 null cells and mice (20Zheng T.S. Schlosser S.F. Dao T. Hingorani R. Crispe I.N. Boyer J.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28549-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activation is therefore fundamentally important for DFF45/ICAD inactivation. Although caspase-7 initiated DNA fragmentation in a cell-free assay (Fig. 1) and inactivated DFF45/ICAD in an in vitro nuclease assay (Fig. 2), our data suggest that caspase-7 plays a secondary role in inactivating the inhibitor. Like caspase-3, caspase-7 prefers DEVD-based peptide substrates (1Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), however, caspase-3 cleaved DFF45/ICAD more effectively than caspase-7 (Fig. 3) in vitroand the low level of caspase-7 DEVDase activity generated in MCF7 cells and extracts (Fig. 4) did not inactivate DFF45/ICAD. This suggests that the two caspases cleave macromolecular substrates with different efficiencies and that endogenous levels of caspase-7 do not initiate DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, since active caspase-7 localizes to mitochondrial and microsomal membranes (24Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the caspase may be physically sequestered from DFF45/ICAD and therefore unable to react with the inhibitor. Overall, the data suggest that caspase-7 is not a physiologic inactivator of DFF45/ICAD and that critical caspase-7 substrates remain unidentified. Caspase-6 and granzyme B induced DFF45/ICAD inactivation and DNA fragmentation in Jurkat extracts (Fig. 1); however, although they cleaved DFF45/ICAD, they failed to inactivate the inhibitor in anin vitro nuclease assay (Fig. 2). Since these proteinases effectively activate caspase-3 (16Stennicke H.R. Jugensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby M.H. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), these results suggest that they inactivate DFF45/ICAD via caspase-3 activation. Non-activating DFF45/ICAD cleavage was also observed with calpain and cathepsin D (Figs. 1 and 2); however, since these proteinases do not activate caspases (Fig. 1 and Ref. 13Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they were unable to initiate DNA fragmentation in a cell-free assay (Fig. 1). Caspase-6, granzyme B, calpain, and cathepsin D probably cleave DFF45/ICAD at or near the C-terminal caspase cleavage site (Asp224) since DFF45/ICAD mutants that can only be cleaved at this site retain DFF40/CAD inhibitory activity (6Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Non-activating cleavage of DFF45/ICAD by these proteinases could be synergistic with activating cleavage events mediated by caspase-3 or caspase-7 if the partially cleaved inhibitor is more susceptible to cleavage by caspases-3 and -7. Alternatively, non-activating cleavage might alter interaction of DFF40/CAD with cofactors such as histone H1 (19Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or target the endonuclease for destruction. These possibilities are currently under investigation. In summary, our data indicate that caspase-3 is the primary inactivator of DFF45/ICAD and suggest that proteolytic pathways that induce apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation must involve this proteinase. Fig. 5 summarizes our findings and presents a model of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. In this model, the initiator caspases, caspases-8 and -9, promote apoptotic signaling and activate the executioner caspases, which in turn degrade apoptotic substrates. Similarly, granzyme B functions primarily to activate executioner caspases and not to cleave apoptotic substrates. Studies demonstrating that granzyme B activates caspase-3 more efficiently than caspase-8 (16Stennicke H.R. Jugensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby M.H. Ellerby L.M.

Once activated, caspase-3 plays a central role in apoptotic DNA fragmentation by inactivating DFF45/ICAD, thereby releasing active DFF40/CAD. Caspase-3 also activates caspase-6 (26Orth K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), which in turn promotes nuclear apoptosis by degrading lamins (27Liu X. Kim C.N. Pohl J. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13371-13376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Caspase-6 can also activate procaspase-3 (25Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), providing the opportunity for amplification of caspase-3 activity. Caspase-7, which may be localized to mitochondria and microsomes plays a secondary role in DNA fragmentation as a back up DFF45/ICAD inactivator. By contrast, calpain and cathepsin D do not activate caspases and function downstream or independently of caspase cascades. However, calpain, which localizes to mitochondria during apoptosis (28Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), could potentially induce high molecular weight DNA fragmentation via release of mitochondrial apoptosis inducing factor. Although lysosomes release cathepsin D during some forms of apoptosis (29Roberg K. Ollinger K. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1151-1156PubMed Google Scholar), this proteinase does not inactivate DFF45/ICAD and its cellular substrates remain undefined. Thus, many proteinases may function in nuclear apoptosis, but caspase-3 is the key determinant of DFF45/ICAD inactivation and apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. We thank Drs.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar) indicate that entire signaling pathways are pre-organized in caveolae. Rapid signal attenuation coincides with loss of receptors from caveolae (6Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) in response to ligand binding. Depending on the cell type, it takes 3–30 min for EGFR to leave caveolae (6Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Obviously the exit of the receptor from caveolae must be an important control point in EGFR signal transduction. Spending too little or too much time at this location after ligand binding may be deleterious to the cell. Mutagenesis has been used to map the critical amino acids in EGFR cytoplasmic tail responsible for both receptor down-regulation and signal transduction. This region of the receptor contains both a kinase and a regulatory domain (11Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). A mutation in the kinase domain that inactivates kinase activity (M721K) completely abolishes high affinity receptor internalization (12Glenney Jr., J.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Walton G.M. Zokas L.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Cell. 1988; 52: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). At least one of the tyrosine residues in the regulatory domain that normally is a substrate for the kinase appears to be required for down-regulation by EGF (13Chang C.P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a constitutively active and tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor that is unable to bind EGF appears not to be spontaneously internalized (14Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Huang C.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), suggesting separate roles for EGF binding and tyrosine phosphorylation during internalization. Through an analysis of the behavior of truncated receptors, an 18-amino acid sequence between amino acids 973 and 991 was found to be necessary for ligand-stimulated receptor down-regulation and cytosolic calcium increase (3Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This region, which consists of a YXXΦ motif flanked by numerous negatively charged amino acids, contains the binding site for clathrin AP2. Unexpectedly, excision of this region from the tail does not affect ligand-induced down-regulation (15Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8719-8723Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are two tyrosine residues in the kinase domain (Tyr-891 and Tyr-920) that are not autophosphorylated but are consensus sequences for pp60Srckinase phosphorylation (16Stover D.R. Becker M.

Finally, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-654 blocks ligand-induced down-regulation (4Lund K.A. Lazar C.S. Chen W.S. Walsh B.J. Welsh J.B. Herbst J.J. Walton G.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N.

Little is known about the mechanism responsible for targeting EGFR to caveolae membrane or what releases the receptor in response to ligand binding. It is possible that those mutations that disrupt EGF-stimulated internalization prevent migration of the receptor out of caveolae. Mutations that had this effect would provide valuable insight into the mechanism of receptor sequestration by caveolae. For these reasons, we have used previously characterized cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant EGFR to study the plasma membrane distribution of these receptors before and after EGF stimulation. We find that all of the mutant receptors that are internalization impaired also do not exit from caveolae in response to EGF. This suggests that internalization of those growth factor receptors that are concentrated in caveolae is a three-step process that involves exit from caveolae, migration in the bulk plasma membrane, and capture by coated pits.

Stable transfected B82 mouse L cells, which lack endogenous EGFR, expressing either wild-type or mutant human EGFR were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum, 80 nm methotrexate, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown to near confluence (2–4 days) and incubated overnight in the presence of DMEM without serum before each experiment. NR6 cells that lack endogenous EGFR were infected with a retrovirus expressing de 2–7 EGFR, selected in G418 and a clonal line prepared. These cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter) in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown to near confluence (2–4 days) and incubated overnight in the presence of DMEM without serum before each experiment. Human fibroblasts were incubated in DMEM without serum for 24 h before the experiments. To acidify the cytosol, cells were washed twice with medium A (DMEM plus 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and then incubated in medium A for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with medium B (medium A plus 10 mm acetic acid, pH 5.0) and incubated in media B for 10 min at 37 °C. Acidified cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in the absence or presence of EGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times in DMEM. Intracellular potassium depletion (22Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) was carried out by rinsing cells twice with medium A and incubating them in the same medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated in hypotonic buffer A (buffer A diluted 1:1 with water) for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed three times in buffer A and incubated in the same buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before adding EGF (50 ng/ml) and incubating for the indicated times in DMEM. Caveolae were isolated by the detergent-free method of Smart et al. (5Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The cells were washed in ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Tricine pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) and collected by scraping in the same buffer. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in buffer B containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml benzamidine. A postnuclear supernatant fraction was prepared by spinning the lysate at 90 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was layered over 23 ml of ice-cold 30% Percoll in buffer B. After centrifugation at 85,000 × g for 30 min, the cytosol and plasma membrane fractions were collected. The plasma membrane fraction was briefly sonicated (six 50-Joule bursts at 10 watts each), mixed with buffer C (50% w/v iodixanol in buffer B plus 40 mm sucrose) to a final iodixanol concentration of 23% and overlaid with 6 ml of linear (10–20%) gradient of iodixanol in buffer B. Samples were centrifuged at 53,000 × g for 90 min. The bottom 4 ml of the gradient was pooled and designated non-caveolae membrane. The top 5 ml of the gradient was mixed with 4 ml of buffer C, overlaid with 1 ml of 15% w/v iodixanol in buffer B, followed by 0.5 ml of 5% w/v iodixanol in buffer B. The gradients were centrifuged at 53,000 × g for 90 min, and caveolae were collected from the 5%/15% interface (0.5 ml). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5% w/v bromphenol blue), loaded on a 4% stacking gel, and separated using a 5–15% linear gradient gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electrophoretic transfer at 50 V for 2 h on ice. After membranes were incubated with buffer D (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) plus 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in buffer D plus 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with buffer D plus 0.2% milk and 0.2% Tween 20 for 15 min and twice for 5 min at room temperature, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-IgG antibody (0.1 μg/ml) in buffer D plus 1% milk and 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h. The membranes were then washed once for 15 min and four times for 5 min each with buffer D plus 0.2% milk and 0.2% Tween 20. Staining was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Apparent molecular masses were estimated using prestained molecular weight markers (broad range). To measure the relative amounts of EGFR in each fraction, the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-IgG antibody was replaced with125I-protein A. Gels were incubated in the presence of 1 μCi/ml 125I-protein A for 1 h. The membranes were then washed once for 15 min and four times for 5 min each with buffer D plus 0.2% milk and 0.2% Tween 20. The radioactive intensity of the EGF receptor band (180 kDa) was measured using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). The cells were washed in ice-cold buffer B and collected by scraping in the same buffer. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in buffer B containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride). A postnuclear supernatant fraction was prepared by spinning the lysate at 90 × gfor 10 min. The samples were diluted with 2× buffer E (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mmoctylglucoside) to make samples at the protein concentration (300 μg/ml). Ten μl (2 μg) of agarose-conjugated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine IgG was added to the 1-ml sample and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed twice with buffer F (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), twice with buffer G (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), and twice with buffer H (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA). The beads were mixed with SDS sample buffer, separated by gel electrophoresis using a 5–15% gradient gel, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. Each experimental results presented is a representative example from three to five trials using identical conditions. Previously, we reported that EGF receptors are concentrated in caveolae membrane fractions isolated from human fibroblasts (5Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). We used quantitative immunoblotting to estimate the percentage of total surface EGF receptors that were in the caveolae fraction of these cells before and after incubation in the presence of EGF (TableI, HF). Plasma membranes from quiescent fibroblasts were used to prepare caveolae and non-caveolae fractions. Immunoblots of each fraction showed that we recovered most of the plasma membrane EGF receptors in the two fractions and that 60.5% of these receptors were in the caveolae fraction. EGFR was enriched 11.6-fold in the caveolae fraction relative to the whole membrane. After exposure to EGF, there was a marked decline in the total number of receptors in the plasma membrane and a decrease in the percentage of these receptors in the caveolae fraction.Table IRelative amount of EGFR in membrane fractions prepared from either normal human fibroblasts (HF), Rat-1 cells (Rat-1), or B82 cells (B82) transfected with wild-type receptorCellFractionEnrichmentTotal receptorsPM receptors-fold%%HF (−EGF)PM148100NCM0.416.334.6CM11.72960.5HF (+EGF)PM115.3100NCM0.87.755.6CM3.62.817Rat-1 (−EGF)PM155.6100NCM0.424.343.5CM18.326.648.6Rat-1 (+EGF)PM118.2100NCM0.610.859.3CM2.62.614.3B82PM133.5100NCM0.413.941.4CM6.712.141.9Human fibroblasts and Rat-1 cells were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of EGF for 20 min at 37 °C while the B82 cells were analyzed without any treatments. The plasma membrane (PM), non-caveolae membrane (NCM), and caveolae membrane (CM) were isolated, and equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated by gel electrophoresis. Samples were immunoblotted with a pAb EGFR using125I-protein A. The radioactive intensity of the EGF receptor band (180 kDa) was measured as described and expressed as a percentage of the total plasma membrane radioactivity. The results are the average of three trials (HF and Rat-1 (−EGF)), two trials (HF (+EGF) and B82 cells), or one trial (Rat-1 (+EGF)). Open table in a new tab Human fibroblasts and Rat-1 cells were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of EGF for 20 min at 37 °C while the B82 cells were analyzed without any treatments. The plasma membrane (PM), non-caveolae membrane (NCM), and caveolae membrane (CM) were isolated, and equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated by gel electrophoresis. Samples were immunoblotted with a pAb EGFR using125I-protein A.

The results are the average of three trials (HF and Rat-1 (−EGF)), two trials (HF (+EGF) and B82 cells), or one trial (Rat-1 (+EGF)). Previously, we have used Rat-1 cells to study the dynamics of EGFR behavior (6Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Like the human fibroblast, the caveolae fraction of these cells was enriched in EGFR (Table I, Rat-1). In quiescent cells, 48.6% of the receptors were in the caveolae fraction (Rat-1 - EGF) and they were enriched 18-fold. After 20 min in the presence of EGF, the caveolae fraction contained only 14% of the remaining EGFR. To determine if receptor loss was coupled to internalization by clathrin-coated pits, we used immunoblotting to look at the effects of cytosol acidification and potassium depletion, two treatments that inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis (22Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 23Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), on EGFR migration from caveolae (Fig. 1). In untreated human fibroblasts, EGFR was concentrated in the caveolae fraction (A, lane 1). The receptor in this fraction markedly declined after a 20-min incubation in the presence of EGF at 37 °C (compare lanes 1 and2). Caveolin-1, by contrast, did not change during the incubation. Neither cytosol acidification (lanes 3 and 4) nor potassium depletion (lanes 5 and 6) prevented loss of EGFR from the caveolae fraction. Moreover, incubation of cells in the presence of EGF at 4 °C (lanes 7 and8), conditions that block uptake by coated pits (24Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; l: 1-39Crossref Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), had little effect on receptor loss from caveolae. Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells expressing K44A dynamin (Fig. 1 B), a dominant-negative acting mutant dynamin I that blocks internalization of EGFR by coated pits (25Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Caveolae fractions were prepared from cells expressing either wild-type (WT) or K44A (K44A) dynamin at various times after they were incubated in the presence of EGF. Immunoblots showed that the concentration of EGFR (EGFR) declined in these fractions with the same kinetics regardless of the dynamin that was being expressed (compare lanes 1–4 withlanes 5–8). Caveolin-1, by contrast, did not change (Caveolin). Therefore, EGFR loss from the caveolae fraction is not linked to receptor internalization by coated pits. Mutations that block the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR prevent receptor internalization by coated pits (12Glenney Jr., J.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Walton G.M. Zokas L.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Cell. 1988; 52: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We used various tyrosine kinase inhibitors to determine if kinase activity was required for receptor migration out of caveolae (Fig. 1 C). Tyrphostin AG1478 preferentially inhibits EGFR kinase (26Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). The presence of this inhibitor markedly blocked the ability of EGF to stimulate receptor migration out of the caveolae fraction (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 7 and8). We next looked at inhibitors that are more specific for Src kinases (PP2; Ref. 27Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase (tyrphostin A9; Ref. 28Bilder G.E. Krawiec J.A. McVety K. Gazit A. Gilon C. Lyall R. Zilberstein A. Levitzki A. Perrone M.H. Schreiber A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C721-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Src kinase inhibitor PP2 partially blocked EGFR migration compared with AG1478 (comparelanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and 8). By contrast, tyrphostin A9 had no affect on migration (compare lanes 5 and6 with lanes 7 and 8). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulates PKC phosphorylation of EGFR at threonine 654 and blocks EGF-induced, high affinity internalization of the receptor (4Lund K.A. Lazar C.S. Chen W.S. Walsh B.J. Welsh J.B. Herbst J.J. Walton G.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265): 20517-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if PMA has any affect on EGFR loss from caveolae, we preincubated normal human fibroblasts in the presence or absence of 100 nm PMA for 10 min and then added EGF for various times (Fig. 2). Caveolae were isolated and immunoblotted with antibodies to either EGFR or caveolin-1 (A). In the absence of PMA, receptor loss occurred with normal kinetics (EGFR, lanes 1–3). By contrast, the presence of PMA blocked receptor loss from the caveolae fraction (lanes 6 and7). PMA alone had no effect on the concentration of either EGFR (lanes 4 and 5) or caveolin-1 (Caveolin, lanes 1–7) in the cave"

Here, we report the cloning of human and rat cDNAs encoding B166, which has been renamed AOEB166 for antioxidantenzyme B166. Indeed, the deduced amino acid sequence reveals that AOEB166 represents a new mammalian subfamily of AhpC/TSA peroxiredoxin antioxidant enzymes. Human AOEB166 shares 63% similarity with Escherichia coli AhpC22 alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and 66% similarity with a recently identifiedSaccharomyces cerevisiae alkyl hydroperoxide reductase/thioredoxin peroxidase. Moreover, recombinant AOEB166 expressed in E. coli exhibits a peroxidase activity, and an antioxidant activity comparable with that of catalase was demonstrated with the glutamine synthetase protection assay against dithiothreitol/Fe3+/O2 oxidation. The analysis of AOEB166 mRNA distribution in 30 different human tissues and in 10 cell lines shows that the gene is widely expressed in the body. Of interest, the analysis of N- and C-terminal domains of both human and rat AOEB166 reveals amino acid sequences presenting features of mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting sequences. Furthermore, human AOEB166 expressed as a fusion protein with GFP in HepG2 cell line is sorted to these organelles. Finally, acute inflammation induced in rat lung by lipopolysaccharide is associated with an increase of AOEB166 mRNA levels in lung, suggesting a protective role for AOEB166 in oxidative and inflammatory processes.

Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). These include reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 and their toxic by-products, which may react with various cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, leading to cell damage and possibly cell death (2Yu B.P.

In eukaryotes, two major intracellular sources of ROS are the mitochondrion, where electron transport coupled to oxidative phosphorylation takes place (4Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), and the peroxisome in which high amounts of hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anions are generated during β-oxidation of fatty acids and by the activity of various oxidases (5De Duve C.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 1993; 75: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, other oxidative pathways in different subcellular compartments may account for ROS production, and ROS may also be generated extracellularly in the course of inflammatory processes (7Moslen M.T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 366: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells have developed complex mechanisms to protect themselves against oxidative attacks but also to maintain a redox balance in their different subcellular compartments (1Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). These antioxidant defense systems include nonenzymatic antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin A, and uric acid), enzymes with antioxidant properties (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) as well as low molecular weight reducing agents (glutathione and thioredoxin). Recently, a new family of antioxidant enzymes, the AhpC/TSA peroxiredoxin family, has been discovered in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G.

Here, we report the cloning and initial characterization of AOEB166, a novel member of the mammalian peroxiredoxin family with mitochondrial and peroxisomal sorting signals. Although this new peroxiredoxin was first identified in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, AOEB166 presents the features of a highly conserved and widely expressed protein that might play an important antioxidant protective role in various tissues under nonpathological conditions but also during inflammatory processes. A reverse cloning approach was used based on peptide microsequencing informations for cloning human AOEB166 cDNA. First strand cDNA was obtained with Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) from 2 μg of human lung RNA using oligo(dT)25 as primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. A partial cDNA fragment was PCR-amplified by GoldStar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec) during 40 cycles of PCR with 5′-ATCAAGGTGGGNGAYGC-3′ and 3′-TTYCCNTTCTTCCCNCA-5′ degenerate primers. PCR cycles were as follows: denaturing for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 50 °C, extension for 1 min at 72 °C, and, after 40 cycles, a final extension step for 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR product of 98-bp was gel purified with Qiaquick (Qiagen) and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Clones of the PCR product were sequenced on ABI 377 automatic DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Subsequently, the presumed full-length human AOEB166 cDNA was identified by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a Marathon-ready human lung cDNA kit (CLONTECH) and AOEB166-specific primers 3′-CCACTTGGACCGTCTCGACAAGTT-5′ and 5′-GCCATCCCAGCAGTGGAGGTGTTTG-3′ for 5′-amplification and 3′-amplification, respectively. PCR products were cloned and sequenced as described above. Based on the new sequence, a 738-bp sequence of AOEB166 mRNA was amplified using 5′-GGGTATGGGACTAGCTGGCG-3′ and 3′-GACGTTAACCTTACAACCGGTC-5′ primers. The corresponding sequence of the PCR product including the coding sequence was proven to be identical to RACE product sequences. Human AOEB166 cDNA sequence was used to perform a BLAST search at the NCBI web site. Homologies with mouse and rat AOEB166 expressed sequence tag clones were found and used to design primers to amplify the presumed full-length rat AOEB166 cDNA with a Marathon-ready rat liver cDNA kit (CLONTECH). Gene-specific primers 3′-CTTCCGTTCCAAGCCGAGGACCGACT-5′ and 5′-GCATTTACACCTGGCTGTTCCAAGACC-3′ were used in RACE for 5′-amplification and 3′-amplification, respectively. PCR products were cloned and sequenced as described above. Multiple alignments of deduced protein sequences and the phylogenic analysis, according to the neighbor joining method (19Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1988; 4: 406-425Google Scholar), were performed with CLUSTAL W (version 1.7) (20Thomson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibbson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar). AOEB166 gene localization on human chromosomes was performed by PCR using the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid panel according to the protocol of Research Genetics with two different pairs of primers specific for AOEB166 human gene: 5′-ATGTTATGCAACCCTTTGCGACAC-3′ and 3′-CTCGGTCCCTTGTTCCACTTGGAC-5′ primers, and 5′-GTGTTTGAAGGGGAGCCAGGGAAC-3′ and 3′-GGTTCTACCACTTTGGGACAGAGA-5′ primers. Human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) and human master dot blot (CLONTECH) were hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions with a 738-bp 32P-labeled AOEB166 cDNA fragment (Rediprime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) amplified by PCR as described before. After stripping, the membranes were reprobed with 32P-labeled β-actin probe (CLONTECH) for the multiple tissue Northern blot. Northern blotting of RNA isolated from human cell lines was performed as described previously (21Knoops B. Octave J.N. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and 32P-labeled AOEB166 and β-actin probes were hybridized with ExpressHyb hybridization buffer (CLONTECH). The pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO and pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) were used to generate a GFP fusion product under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The construct contained both the complete sequence of hAOEB166 (including the predicted mitochondrial presequence) at the N terminus and the hAOEB166 peroxisomal targeting sequence SQL at the C terminus of GFP (see Fig. 4 A). First, two 22-mers (5′-AGCCAATTGTGATAGAGATCTA-3′ and 5′-AGATCTCTATCACAATTGGCTA-3′) were allowed to hybridize to generate a DNA insert coding for SQL (containing also two stop codons and a BglII site) and ligated into pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector. Second, hAOEB166 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR with 5′-GGGTATGGGACTAGCTGGCG-3′ and 3′-TGGGTTATAGTAGAGTGTCG-5′ primers and ligated into pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vector. Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) were transformed with the plasmids. Third, the 1280-bp BstB1-AvrII restriction product of pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO containing the 3′-coding sequence of the GFP fused to the insert coding for SQL was ligated into the 5653-bpBstB1-AvrII restriction product of pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO containing the insert coding for hAOEB166 and the 5′-coding sequence of GFP. The construct in the resulting plasmid was sequenced. HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cell line cultured on coverslips was transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding the GFP fusion protein by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The fusion protein was expressed at detectable levels 48 h after transfection. For immunostaining, transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min, rinsed three times with Tris-buffered solution (0.05 m, pH 7.6) containing 0.9% NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBS-T), and immersed 30 min in TBS-T containing 10% nonfat milk. Coverslips were incubated sequentially overnight in TBS-T containing 1% nonfat milk and 1:1000 rabbit anti-bovine catalase antiserum (Rockland) or mouse monoclonal anti-human cytochromec oxidase subunit I (5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes), and 1 h with TRITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) or TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) diluted 1/20 in TBS-T. Cells were washed twice 10 min with TBS-T after each incubation. The coverslips were mounted in Mowiol with anti-fading (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 25 mg/ml, Sigma) and examined by fluorescence microscopy with standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filters for GFP and TRITC filters. IMPACT kit (New England Biolabs) was used to express and purify E. coli recombinant AOEB166 without its predicted mitochondrial presequence. The human AOEB166 cDNA was PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-CTGCACATATGGCCCCAATCAAGGTG-3′ (NdeI site underlined) and 3′-GTTATAGTAGAGTGTCGAGACGCCTTCTCGCGGTCT-5′ (SapI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SapI and ligated into vector pTYB1. The insert was sequenced, and the fusion of AOEB166 with the intein tag at its C-terminal end was confirmed. The resulting plasmid was used to transform ER2566 E. coli. Expression of AOEB166-intein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant protein was purified through New England Biolabs affinity chitin column, and intein was cleaved at 4 °C in presence of DTT according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted AOEB166 protein was dialyzed against PBS and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 5 A), and identity was confirmed by N-terminal microsequencing. The protection of glutamine synthetase by recombinant human AOEB166 against dithiothreitol/Fe3+/O2 oxidation was performed essentially as described previously (Ref. 22Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5). Peroxidase activity of recombinant protein was measured as described by Kang et al. (11Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (see Fig. 6). Human cell lines (see Fig. 3) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were grown to 90% confluence, and about 2 × 107 cells were washed twice with PBS before RNA isolation with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 250–300 g were used. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and lung inflammation was induced by intratracheal instillation of LPS (E. coli 055:B5, Sigma) at the dose of 100 μg/100 g of body weight. LPS was dissolved in 200 μl of sterile PBS. Control rats were instillated with 200 μl of PBS. Rat lungs were collected at indicated times, and total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent. Human AOEB166 was initially identified during the two-dimensional electrophoresis mapping of proteins from pooled human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. This unknown protein was shown to have a molecular mass of 17 kDa and a pI of 6.9 (23Wattiez R. Hermans C. Bernard A. Lesur O. Falmagne P. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 1634-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, a partial amino acid sequence of 37 residues at the N terminus (Fig. 1 A) was used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers which allowed the PCR amplification of a human lung cDNA fragment. Based on the sequence of this amplicon, 5′- and 3′-RACE was performed, and the longest PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The composite cDNA sequence contained a poly(A) tract at the 3′-end, 36 bases of a 5′-leader sequence, an open reading frame of 645 bases, and a 116-base-long 3′-trailer sequence containing a AATAAA polyadenylation signal (Fig.1 A). Two Kozak consensus sequences for translation initiation (24Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) were found in the same reading frame. The open reading frame (ORF) of the longest sequence encoded a polypeptide of 214 residues (GenBankTM accession number AF110731). The screening of 5′- and 3′-amplicons obtained by RACE on rat liver cDNA led to the identification of a composite cDNA sequence containing a poly(A) tract at the 3′-end, 39 bases of a 5′-leader sequence, an ORF of 642 bases, and a 135-base-long 3′-trailer sequence containing a AATAAA polyadenylation signal. The ORF encoded a polypeptide of 213 residues (GenBankTM accession numberAF110732). According to the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid panel, the human AOEB166 gene was mapped to chromosome 11q13, about 7 cR from marker D11S913 and between markers D11S1963 and D11S4407. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of human and rat AOEB166 reveals several interesting features (Fig. 1 B). First, the amino acid sequences are well conserved between the two species downstream from the second methionine (Met53 for human AOEB166 and Met52 for rat AOEB166) because they are 90% identical. However, amino acid sequences diverge upstream from Met52–53. A more precise analysis of human and rat amino acid sequences between Met1 and Met52–53 showed that although these sequences are different in amino acid composition, they both display mitochondrial presequence features (25Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 26Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Indeed, this sequence in human and rat is composed of abundant amino acid residues with positive charges, very few negative charges, and frequent hydroxylated residues. The existence of a SQL peroxisomal targeting sequence of the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 family (27Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J.

Also, three cysteines in AOEB166 (Fig. 1 B) were identified, and the functional significance of these residues in AOEB166 for its antioxidant activity will be discussed below. Protein data bases were screened using BLAST 2.0 (gapped BLAST at the NCBI), and a search for identical or homologous polypeptides revealed that AOEB166 is a novel mammalian protein not yet characterized. Interestingly, sequence homology was noted with several proteins of different phyla, but none were from vertebrates. Among proteins with significant homology and known function or subcellular localization, we found that human AOEB166 (without its predicted mitochondrial presequence) had 68–65% similarity (36–35% identity) with, respectively, PMP20A and PMP20B peroxisomal membrane proteins of yeast Candida boidinii(GenBankTM accession numbers J04984 and J04985), 66% similarity (26% identity) with YLR109w ORF of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 1 C; GenBankTM accession number Z73281) recently identified as a thioredoxin peroxidase/alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (12Lee J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and 63% similarity (25% identity) with E. coli alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC22 protein (GenBankTM accession number D13187). To identify homologies between human AOEB166 and the known members of the human peroxiredoxins, we selected one member of the five known subfamilies of human peroxiredoxins, and we performed an amino acid alignment (Fig.2 A). Notably, AOEB166 conserved amino acids especially around Cys100 of human AOEB166, which has been directly implicated in catalysis of peroxides in peroxiredoxins (9Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, as for the so-called one-cysteine peroxiredoxin ORF06 (36Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), many residues in human AOEB166 differ from the consensus found for the other peroxiredoxins. Interestingly, human AOEB166 possesses two other cysteines at positions 125 and 204 (Fig. 1) that could be involved in the catalysis of peroxides and in dimerization because most of peroxiredoxins exist as homodimers or heterodimers (36Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, AOEB166 seems to diverge phylogenetically from known mammalian peroxiredoxins as illustrated by the alignment but also by the phylogenetic tree presented in Fig. 2. For these reasons, we propose that AOEB166 proteins represent a new peroxiredoxin subfamily named peroxiredoxin V. As discussed by Jinet al. (37Jin D.-Y. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30952-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and as illustrated in the phylogenetic tree of Fig. 2 B, the other subfamilies are subfamilies I, II, III, and IV and 1-Cys. Northern blot analysis of AOEB166 mRNA expression in human tissues and cell lines revealed a hybridizing region at approximately 1 kilobase (Fig.3, A and B). AOEB166 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined as well as in the cell lines. Master dot blots (CLONTECH) normalized for eight housekeeping genes were used to estimate the levels of AOEB166 mRNA in 30 different human tissues (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, expression was significantly different among the tissues. The highest levels of expression were detected in thyroid gland, trachea, kidney, lung, adrenal gland, heart, and colon. Lower but still detectable levels were observed in pancreas, peripheral leukocytes, lymph node, and whole brain. To demonstrate that identified mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting sequences of AOEB166 are able to sort the protein into mitochondria and peroxisomes, a vector was made with a GFP fusion construct containing both the complete coding sequence of hAOEB166 (including the sequence encoding the predicted mitochondrial presequence) upstream from GFP and a sequence coding for AOEB166 peroxisomal targeting sequence SQL downstream from GFP (Fig. 4 A). After transfection of HepG2 cells with pcDNA3.1 containing such a construct, GFP was detected in subcellular compartments with reticular or globular patterns that were proven to be mitochondria as demonstrated by co-localization with mitochondrial cytochromec oxidase subunit I (Fig. 4, B and C) or in subcellular compartments with punctate patterns that were demonstrated to be peroxisomes by co-localization with peroxisomal catalase (Fig. 4, D and E). Antioxidant activity of human AOEB166 was measured onE. coli recombinant protein without its predicted mitochondrial presequence (Fig. 5). The protection of glutamine synthetase from inactivation by thiol-dependent metal-catalyzed oxidation has been extensively used previously to determine antioxidant properties of different peroxiredoxins (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 9Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, inactivation of glutamine synthetase in presence of DTT as sulfhydryl reductor is completely prevented in presence of 0.2 mg/ml of AOEB166. However, when DTT is replaced by ascorbate, a reductor lacking thiol, recombinant AOEB166 is unable to protect glutamine synthetase from inactivation as expected for a peroxiredoxin (Fig. 5 C). To compare the potency of catalase to that of AOEB166, we measured protection activity at various concentrations of the proteins (Fig.5 D). Bovine catalase and AOEB166 exhibited 50% of protection at the same concentration of about 0.04 mg/ml. Peroxidase activity of recombinant human AOEB166 was also demonstrated by time-dependent removal of H2O2 ortert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in presence of DTT as reductor of AOEB166 (Fig. 6). The peroxidase activity of recombinant human AOEB166 measured by the consumption of H2O2 was very similar to the previously reported activity of hORF06, the human 1-Cys member of the mammalian peroxiredoxins (36Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). AOEB166 was first identified at high levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of patients suffering from various lung diseases (23Wattiez R. Hermans C. Bernard A. Lesur O. Falmagne P. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 1634-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the possibility that AOEB166 is regulated at the transcriptional level in rat lung during inflammation induced by LPS instillation. As shown in Fig. 7, AOEB166 mRNA levels increased in rat lungs with inflammation. Higher expression was reached after 24 h and was still high 72 h after LPS instillation. We have recently identified the AOEB 166 protein in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a novel protein (23Wattiez R. Hermans C. Bernard A. Lesur O. Falmagne P. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 1634-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, we show that, structurally and functionally, AOEB166 is a new member of the AhpC/TSA peroxiredoxin family, a recently identified group of antioxidant enzymes evolutionarly conserved in all phyla (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Structurally, the antioxidant function of peroxiredoxins is dependent upon conserved cysteine residues responsible for peroxide reduction and dimerization (9Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the peroxiredoxin prototype TSA from S. cerevisiae, two active cysteines are present in positions 47 and 170. These cysteines and their neighboring residues are highly conserved in four peroxiredoxin subfamilies (Prx I, II, III, and IV)37 (see also Fig. 2). By contrast, the 1-Cys subfamily is defined by few peroxiredoxins that have conserved only the corresponding Cys47 and its surrounding residues. AOEB166 does not fit perfectly these subfamilies. Indeed, like Prx I, II, III, IV and 1-Cys, AOEB166 possesses a cysteine corresponding to Cys47 of S. cerevisiae TSA (Cys100for human AOEB166) but has no cysteine residue corresponding to Cys170 of Prx I, II, III, and IV. AOEB166 does not enter either into the 1-Cys subfamily because it contains two other cysteines, Cys125 and Cys204, lacking in 1-Cys subfamily and that may be involved in antioxidant activities and/or dimerization. Also, in AOEB166 the amino acids surrounding Cys100 are much less conserved than in the other peroxiredoxins (Fig. 2 A). For these reasons, AOEB166 represents the prototype for a new mammalian peroxiredoxin subfamily (Prx V in Fig. 2 B). Functionally, the antioxidant activity of AOEB166 has been confirmedin vitro by testing the ability of the recombinant protein to protect glutamine synthetase from the dithiothreitol/Fe3+/O2 oxidation. Like other peroxiredoxins, AOEB166 requires a thiol-containing reductor (DTT) to exert its antioxidant activity and is inactive or less active in presence of other electron donors such as ascorbate. The cellular thiol-containing reductor is still to be identified, but two good candidates as direct electron donors for AOEB166 are thioredoxin and glutathione, which are physiological reductors of several members of the peroxiredoxin family (9Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Jin D.-Y. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21326-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The antioxidant activity of recombinant AOEB166 was quantitatively comparable with that of catalase, which suggested that hydrogen peroxide was indeed a substrate for AOEB166. This was corroborated by the time-dependent removal of hydrogen peroxide by recombinant AOEB166 in the in vitro peroxidase assay. Of interest, tert-butyl hydroperoxide is also consumed by the recombinant protein, which demonstrates that AOEB166 is able to reduce organic peroxides like itsS. cerevisiae orthologue (12Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, these data suggest that AOEB166 might afford a protection not only against hydrogen peroxide but also against alkyl hydroperoxides in mammalian cells. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences of both human and rat AOEB166 reveals the presence of a predicted mitochondrial presequence at the N terminus as well as a SQL peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 at the C terminus in the same protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in fusion with the green fluorescent protein, these targeting sequences are functional and sort the protein to mitochondria and peroxisomes in HepG2 cells. Members of the Prx III subfamily have been also identified in mitochondria (40Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). AOEB166 represents therefore the second peroxiredoxin subfamily to be localized in mitochondria. Interestingly, AOEB166 is the only peroxiredoxin reported so far to be addressed to the peroxisomes. The functional significance of AOEB166 localization in organelles to which other antioxidant proteins with similar enzymatic activities (glutathione peroxidase, catalase) are sorted is still to be investigated. The fact that AOEB166 is well conserved among species and is expressed in all tissues and cell lines examined in this study is consistent with an important physiological function for that protein. In that respect, it is interesting to note that AOEB166 expression is highest precisely in those tissues, such as thyroid gland, lung, or kidney, that are particularly exposed to oxidative stress (41Mano T. Shinohara R. Iwase K. Kotake M. Hamada M. Uchimuro K. Hayakawa N. Hayashi R. Nakai A. Ishizuki Y. Nagasaka A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar). Although at this stage the implication of AOEB166 in physiopathological processes remains speculative, the significant increase of AOEB166 gene expression in rat lung with lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation suggests that the protein may play in vivo a protective role against oxidative damage. Furthermore, several observations indicate that AOEB166 might be implicated in various pathophysiological situations by mechanisms that do not necessarily imply directly its antioxidant activity but rather its high conservation during evolution. In particular, the AOEB166 gene is located to human chromosome 11q13, which is a region of genetic linkage for atopic hypersensitivity (asthma, hay fever, and eczema) (43Daniels S.E. Bhattacharrya S. James A. Leaves N.I. Young A. Hill M.R. Faux J.A. Ryan G.F. Le Souef P.N. Lathrop G.M. Musk A.W. Cookson W.O.C.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and AOEB166 presents a high homology to a major allergen of Aspergillus fumigatus(GenBankTM accession number U58050) (44Hemman S. Blaser K. Crameri R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 1956-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An attractive hypothesis would be that IgE antibodies directed to the allergen would cross-react with AOEB166 and therefore initiate autoimmunity. This mechanism has been postulated for allergen manganese superoxide dismutase of A. fumigatus, which also exhibits a high homology to human manganese superoxide dismutase (45Crameri R. Faith A. Hemman S. Jaussi R. Ismail C. Menz G. Laser K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data show that AOEB166 represents a new subfamily of the peroxiredoxin mammalian antioxidant enzymes with functional mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting signals. The protein, highly conserved throughout species and widely distributed in the body, presents several features, suggesting that it may play an important protective role against oxidative damages caused by peroxides in organelles that are major sources of ROS. Since this article was submitted, a third paper describing S. cerevisiae YLR109w thioredoxin peroxidase function has been published (47Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J.

https://openalex.org/W2076615456,"Polygalacturonases specifically hydrolyze polygalacturonate, a major constituent of plant cell wall pectin. To understand the catalytic mechanism and substrate and product specificity of these enzymes, we have solved the x-ray structure of endopolygalacturonase II of Aspergillus niger and we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies. The enzyme folds into a right-handed parallel β-helix with 10 complete turns. The β-helix is composed of four parallel β-sheets, and has one very small α-helix near the N terminus, which shields the enzyme's hydrophobic core. Loop regions form a cleft on the exterior of the β-helix. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp180, Asp201, Asp202, His223, Arg256, and Lys258, which are located in this cleft, results in a severe reduction of activity, demonstrating that these residues are important for substrate binding and/or catalysis. The juxtaposition of the catalytic residues differs from that normally encountered in inverting glycosyl hydrolases. A comparison of the endopolygalacturonase II active site with that of the P22 tailspike rhamnosidase suggests that Asp180 and Asp202activate the attacking nucleophilic water molecule, while Asp201 protonates the glycosidic oxygen of the scissile bond. Polygalacturonases specifically hydrolyze polygalacturonate, a major constituent of plant cell wall pectin. To understand the catalytic mechanism and substrate and product specificity of these enzymes, we have solved the x-ray structure of endopolygalacturonase II of Aspergillus niger and we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies. The enzyme folds into a right-handed parallel β-helix with 10 complete turns. The β-helix is composed of four parallel β-sheets, and has one very small α-helix near the N terminus, which shields the enzyme's hydrophobic core. Loop regions form a cleft on the exterior of the β-helix. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp180, Asp201, Asp202, His223, Arg256, and Lys258, which are located in this cleft, results in a severe reduction of activity, demonstrating that these residues are important for substrate binding and/or catalysis.

The plant cell wall consists of a network of complex carbohydrates like cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. The latter is the most complex of these carbohydrates. It contains so-called “smooth regions” and “hairy regions.” The smooth regions, also known as homogalacturonan, consist of α(1,4)-linked d-galacturonic acid residues, whereas the hairy regions, or rhamnogalacturonan I, are characterized by stretches of alternating α(1,2)-linkedd-galacturonic acid and l-rhamnose (1de Vries J.A. Rombouts F.M. Voragen A.G.J. Pilnik W. Carbohydr. Polym. 1982; 2: 25-33Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The rhamnose residues can be substituted at their O4 atoms by arabinose or galactose (2O'Neill M.A. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Dey P.M. Methods in Plant Biochemistry:Carbohydrates. Academic Press, London1990: 415-441Google Scholar). Throughout the pectin molecule, the galacturonic acid residues can be methylated at O6 and/or acetylated at O2 and/or O3 (3Schols H. Structural Characterization of Pectic Hairy Regions Isolated from Apple Cell Walls. Ph.D. thesis. Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands1995Google Scholar). Due to its complex structure, modification of pectin by plants or complete breakdown by microorganisms requires many different enzymes.In microorganisms several classes of pectinases have been identified. These classes comprise pectate-, pectin-, and rhamnogalacturonan lyases, rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases, and polygalacturonases, which all depolymerize the main chain; and pectin methylesterases and pectin- and rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterases, which act on the substituents of the main chain. Crystal structures are known of members of several classes of main chain depolymerizing pectinases. These include pectate lyases from Erwinia chrysanthemi and Bacillus subtilis (4Yoder M.D. Keen N.T.

https://openalex.org/W2131207360,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family that interacts with several receptors, including TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R4. TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 can induce apoptosis of cancer cells and activate the transcription factor NF-κB. TRAIL-R4 can activate NF-κB and protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here we show that TRAIL-R1-, TRAIL-R2-, and TRAIL-R4-induced NF-κB activation are mediated by a TRAF2-NIK-IκB kinase α/β signaling cascade but is MEKK1 independent. TRAIL receptors also activate the protein kinase JNK. JNK activation by TRAIL-R1 is mediated by a TRAF2-MEKK1-MKK4 but not the TRAF2-NIK/IκB kinase α/β signaling pathway. We also show that activation of NF-κB or overexpression of TRAIL-R4 does not protect TRAIL-R1-induced apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB by IκBα sensitizes cells to tumor necrosis factor- but not TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that TRAIL receptors induce apoptosis, NF-κB and JNK activation through distinct signaling pathways, and activation of NF-κB is not sufficient for protecting cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

TRAIL-R4 retains a cytoplasmic fragment containing one-third of the consensus death domain motif.

Thus, TRAIL-R4 may protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by either acting as a decoy receptor or transducing an anti-apoptotic signal. In this context, several studies have established that NF-κB activation can protect cells from TNF-induced apoptosis, probably through its ability to induce the expression of anti-apoptosis genes (18Beg A.A.

These observations suggest that activation of NF-κB alone is not sufficient to block apoptosis induced by TRAIL receptors. Currently, the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for TRAIL receptor-mediated NF-κB activation are unclear, and the mechanisms responsible for TRAIL receptor-induced apoptosis are controversial. It has been reported that TRADD and FADD, two death domain-containing cytoplasmic proteins involved in TNF-R1 signaling, interact with TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 and are involved in apoptosis mediated by these receptors (8Schneider P.

However, other studies have reached opposite conclusions (6Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M.

Moreover, studies using FADD knockout embryonic fibroblasts suggest that FADD is not required for apoptosis induced by overexpression of TRAIL-R1 (22Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B.

The signaling pathways mediated by TNF receptor family members have been best illustrated by studies with TNF-R1. TNF-R1 is a death domain-containing receptor that can induce apoptosis and activate NF-κB and JNK kinase (23Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Once TRADD is recruited to TNF-R1, it functions as an adapter protein to recruit several structurally and functionally divergent proteins, including FADD, RIP, TRAF2, and cIAP1 (25Winston B.W.

The interaction of TRADD with TRAF2 and RIP activates NIK, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family (29Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Once NIK is activated, it further activates two downstream kinases, IKKα and IKKβ (29Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V.

Once IκBs are phosphorylated, they are degraded, and consequently the active NF-κB is released (36Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 37Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In addition to NIK, TRAF2 and RIP can also activate MEKK1, another member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family (26Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that overexpression of MEKK1 activates NF-κB (38Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), it is believed that under physiological conditions, MEKK1 mediates TNF-R1-induced JNK but not NF-κB activation (35Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of downstream signaling by TRAIL receptors. The results indicate that TRAIL-R1-, TRAIL-R2-, and TRAIL-R4-induced NF-κB activation are mediated by a TRAF2-NIK-IKKα/β-dependent signaling cascade, whereas TRAIL-R1-induced JNK activation is mediated by a TRAF2-MEKK1-MKK4 dependent signaling cascade. We also show that inhibition of TRAIL-R1-induced NF-κB and JNK activation pathways does not block TRAIL-R1-induced apoptosis. In addition, our data indicate that NF-κB activation is not sufficient for protecting cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Recombinant human TRAIL was provided by Dr. Bryant Darnay (University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The human embryonic kidney 293 cell line was provided by Dr. Zaodan Cao (Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The NF-κB luciferase reporter construct (Dr. Gary Johnson, National Jewish Center, Denver, CO), mammalian expression vectors encoding TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 (Dr. Claudius Vincenz, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), TRADD(296S) (Dr. Vijal Baichwal, Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA), FADD-(80–205), TRAF2-(87–501), NIK(K429A/K430A), IKKα(K44A), IKKβ(K44A), crmA (Dr. Dave Goeddel, Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA), IκB(S32A/S36A) (Dr. T.

TRAIL-R4 expression vector was constructed by replacing the TRAIL-R1 cDNA in the pCMV1-Flag-DR4 (TRAIL-R1) vector (6Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) with a polymerase chain reaction product of TRAIL-R4 cDNA. The parent vector contains a DNA fragment encoding a signal peptide at 5′ of the Flag tag, and therefore the DNA fragment encoding the native N-terminal signal peptide of TRAIL-R4 was omitted by polymerase chain reaction. The human embryonic kidney 293 cell line was maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For reporter gene assays, ∼2 × 105 cells/well were seeded on 6-well (35 mm) dishes. Cells were transfected the following day by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (39Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen) following the manufacture's protocols. Western blots for detection of Flag-tagged TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R4 were performed with a monoclonal anti-Flag following previously described procedure (27Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V.

The cDNA encoding the intracellular domain of TRAIL-R1 was inserted in frame into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The human leukocyte, spleen, and 293 cell two-hybrid cDNA libraries were also from CLONTECH. The isolation of positive clones and subsequent two-hybrid interaction analyses were carried out as described (23Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of blue cells from four viewing fields in one well of a 35-mm dish was determined by counting under a microscope. The average number from one representative experiment in which each transfection was done in duplicate is shown. Cytokine-treated or -transfected cells were lysed with 600 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The lysate was mixed with 15 μl of 1:1 slurry of GST-c-Jun-Sepharose beads, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmNa3VO4). The washed beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μL, 1 Ci = 37 GBq) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were washed in fixing buffer (10% acetic acid, 30% methanol) three times, each for 10 min, and then dried. Autoradiography was performed for 5–30 min. Fold induction of JNK kinase activity was determined by phosphoimaging analysis. -HeLa or MCF7 cells (5 × 105) were treated with 200 ng/ml recombinant TRAIL for 24 h. Treated cells were switched to new medium containing 200 ng/ml TRAIL for additional 24 h. Surviving cells were then amplified and designated as HeLa-TL-R and MCF7-TL-R, respectively. Although several studies indicated that TRAIL could induce NF-κB activation (8Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J.

To determine whether TRAIL could activate NF-κB, we transfected 293 cells with a NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct and performed luciferase reporter gene assays. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with recombinant soluble TRAIL induced NF-κB activity. In this experiment, TRAIL was less potent than TNF in activating NF-κB (Fig. 1). To determine the relative contributions of various TRAIL receptors to TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, we compared the effects of overexpression of individual TRAIL receptors on NF-κB activity in reporter gene assays. As shown in Fig. 2, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R4 all activated NF-κB. TRAIL-R1 was found to be more potent than TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R4 in activating NF-κB in this experiment, at least partially because of its higher expression level than TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R4 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Activation of NF-κB by TRAIL receptors and effects of various dominant negative mutants on TRAIL receptor-induced NF-κB activation.For each transfection, 293 cells (2 × 105) were transfected with 0.5 μg of NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase, and 1 μg of pCMV1-TRAIL-R1 (A), 1 μg of pCMV1-TRAIL-R2 (B), 1 μg of pCVM1-TRAIL-R4 (C), 1 μg of pRK-TNF-R1 (D), or 1 μg of empty control plasmid (E), together with 2 μg of the indicated dominant negative mutant plasmids or empty vector (−). Control transfection (Control) contains equal amounts of NF-κB-luciferase and RSV-β-galactosidase plasmids without TRAIL receptor expression plasmids and any mutant plasmids. For each transfection, 1 μg of crmA expression plasmid was added to protect cells from TRAIL-R1-, TRAIL-R2-, and TNF-R1-induced apoptosis, and where necessary, enough of an amount of empty control plasmid was added to keep each transfection receiving the same amount of total DNA (5 μg). Luciferase activity was measured 16 h after transfection and normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression levels. Values are averages and deviations for a representative experiment in which each transfection was performed in duplicate. Data shown are relative luciferase activity compared with the control transfection. The protein expression levels of Flag-tagged TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R4 in each transfection are shown. −, empty control vector; NIK (KK/AA), NIK(K429A/K430A);IKKα(K/A), IKKα(K44A); IKKβ(K/A), IKKβ(K44A); IκB(SS/AA), IκBα(S32A/S36A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because TRAIL receptors have similar biological effects as TNF receptors, we tested whether the cytoplasmic proteins involved in TNF receptor signaling, including TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, MEKK1, IKKα, and IKKβ, also participate in TRAIL receptor signaling. To do this, we determined whether their dominant negative mutants could block TRAIL receptor-mediated NF-κB activation in reporter gene assays. TRADD(296S), a TRADD dominant negative mutant that inhibits TNF-R1-mediated NF-κB activation (42Park A. Baichwal V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9858-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 D), did not block TRAIL-R1-, TRAIL-R2-, and TRAIL-R4-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2), suggesting that TRADD is not involved in TRAIL receptor-mediated NF-κB activation pathways. Consistent with this observation, we failed to detect an interaction between TRADD and TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, or TRAIL-R4 in co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Interestingly, overexpression of TRADD(296S) potentiated TRAIL receptor-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2). TRAF2-(87–501), a TRAF2 deletion mutant that has been shown to block TNF-R2-induced NF-κB activation (43Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

https://openalex.org/W2073255828,"The transglutaminase (TGase) family of enzymes, of which seven different members are known in the human genome, participate in many biological processes involving cross-linking proteins into large macromolecular assemblies. The TGase 2 enzyme is known to be present in neuronal tissues and may play a role in neuronal degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) by aberrantly cross-linking proteins. In this paper, we demonstrate by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunological methods with specific antibodies that in fact three members, the TGase 1, TGase 2, and TGase 3 enzymes, and are differentially expressed in various regions of normal human brain tissues. Interestingly, the TGase 1 and 3 enzymes and their proteolytically processed forms are involved in terminal differentiation programs of epithelial cell development and barrier function. In addition, we found that the levels of expression and activity of the TGase 1 and 2 enzymes were both increased in the cortex and cerebellum of AD patients. Furthermore, whereas normal brain tissues contain approximately 1 residue of cross-link/10,000 residues, AD patient cortex and cerebellum tissues contain 30-50 residues of cross-link/10,000 residues. Together, these findings suggest that multiple TGase enzymes are involved in normal neuronal structure and function, but their elevated expression and cross-linking activity may also contribute to neuronal degenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2014602198,"Human PICD was identified by homology probing the data base of expressed sequence tags with the protein sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Idp3p, a peroxisomal NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. The human PICD cDNA contains a 1242-base pair open reading frame, and its deduced protein sequence is 59% identical to yeast Idp3p. Expression of PICD partially rescued the fatty acid growth defect of the yeast idp3 deletion mutant suggesting that PICD is functionally homologous to Idp3p. Kinetic studies on bacterially expressed PICD demonstrated that this enzyme catalyzed the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate with a specific activity of 22.5 units/mg and that PICD displayed K(M) values of 76 microM for isocitrate and 112 microM for NADP(+). In subcellular fractionation experiments, we found PICD in both peroxisomes and cytoplasm of human and rat liver cells, with approximately 27% of total PICD protein associated with peroxisomes. The presence of PICD in mammalian peroxisomes suggests roles in the regeneration of NADPH for intraperoxisomal reductions, such as the conversion of 2, 4-dienoyl-CoAs to 3-enoyl-CoAs, as well as in peroxisomal reactions that consume 2-oxoglutarate, namely the alpha-hydroxylation of phytanic acid. As for cytoplasmic PICD, the phenotypes of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Luzzatto, L., and Mehta, A. (1995) in The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (Scriver, C. R., Beaudet, A. L., Sly, W. S., and Valle, D., eds) Vol. 3, 7th Ed., pp. 3367-3398, McGraw-Hill Inc., New York) suggest that PICD serves a significant role in cytoplasmic NADPH production, particularly under conditions that do not favor the use of the hexose monophosphate shunt (Luzzatto et al.)."
https://openalex.org/W2102006131,"The tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) is a membrane-anchored zinc metalloprotease involved in precursor tumor necrosis factor-α secretion. We designed a series of constructs containing full-length human TACE and several truncate forms for overexpression in insect cells. Here, we demonstrate that full-length TACE is expressed in insect cells inefficiently: only minor amounts of this enzyme are converted from an inactive precursor to the mature, functional form. Removal of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains resulted in the efficient secretion of mature, active TACE. Further removal of the cysteine-rich domain located between the catalytic and transmembrane domains resulted in the secretion of mature catalytic domain in association with the precursor (pro) domain. This complex was inactive and function was only restored after dissociation of the complex by dilution or treatment with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Therefore, the pro domain of TACE is an inhibitor of the catalytic domain, and the cysteine-rich domain appears to play a role in the release of the pro domain. Insect cells failed to secrete a deletion mutant encoding the catalytic domain but lacking the inhibitory pro domain. This truncate was inactive and extensively degraded intracellularly, suggesting that the pro domain is required for the secretion of functional TACE.

Further removal of the cysteine-rich domain located between the catalytic and transmembrane domains resulted in the secretion of mature catalytic domain in association with the precursor (pro) domain. This complex was inactive and function was only restored after dissociation of the complex by dilution or treatment with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Therefore, the pro domain of TACE is an inhibitor of the catalytic domain, and the cysteine-rich domain appears to play a role in the release of the pro domain. Insect cells failed to secrete a deletion mutant encoding the catalytic domain but lacking the inhibitory pro domain. This truncate was inactive and extensively degraded intracellularly, suggesting that the pro domain is required for the secretion of functional TACE. tumor necrosis factor-α TNFα-converting enzyme 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate a disintegrin and metalloprotease polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry TNFα1 is a potent cytokine that is secreted by activated monocytes and macrophages in a tightly regulated manner (1Vasalli P.

Upon release, TNFα mediates the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells to injured or infected tissues (2Old L.J. Science. 1985; 230: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of circulating TNFα have been demonstrated in several acute and chronic pathological states, such as lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock, arthritis, pleurisy, Crohn's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (3Beutler B.

TNFα is synthesized as a pro, membrane-anchored form facing the lumenal/extracellular side of the secretory pathway.

Analysis of its amino acid sequence demonstrates a multidomain protein closely resembling members of the disintegrin family of metalloproteases, also commonly referred to as ADAMs or metalloprotease and disintegrin-containing proteins (9Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Starting at the N terminus, TACE exhibits a classical signal peptide followed by a ∼200-residue pro domain that includes a consensus cysteine switch motif (PKVCGY186), which can act as an inhibitor by ligating the zinc ion in the catalytic site (10Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 32Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjumen-Bromage H. Arribas J.

The catalytic domain starts downstream from a consensus furin cleavage site (RVKRR215) and contains a canonical zinc binding site and a MYP loop involved in formation of the P1′ pocket (11Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J. Davis R. Clarke H.R.G. Petersen M. Fitzner J.M. Cerretti D.P. March C.J.

A ∼200-amino acid cysteine-rich domain follows, including a 100-amino acid disintegrin-like region. A single transmembrane domain defines the end of the catalytic domain of TACE and is followed by a ∼150-residue cytosolic tail that contains consensus sequences for binding to proteins containing Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 domains. Little is known at this point about the role these different domains play in regulating catalytic activity and physiological substrate recognition. TACE, ADAM 9, and ADAM 10 are the only members of this family for which proteolytic activity on a specific substrate has been demonstrated. TACE and Kuzbanian (an ADAM metalloprotease involved in processing of the Drosophila protein Notch and neuronal development (12Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar)) are the only two members of this family for which the physiological substrates are known.We report here the construction, overexpression, and characterization of full-length recombinant TACE and a series of truncates nested around the predicted catalytic domain sequence using baculoviral expression vectors. A comparison is presented of the activity of the different truncates against a synthetic peptide substrate containing the cleavage site of this cytokine. Such recombinant forms of TACE will be of use in establishing relationships between the domain architecture of TACE and the function and regulation of this enzyme.DISCUSSIONOur goal is to understand the relationship among the domain architecture, function, and regulation of TACE. The studies reported here show that only certain recombinant forms of TACE can be overexpressed in insect cells in a soluble, secreted form, fully active as compared with native TACE purified from a human monocytic cell line.Insect cells expressed mature, functional full-length TACE at very low levels. Most of the protease remained in its immature form, with the pro domain intact, as judged from Western blots of cell extracts. This result is particularly perplexing because truncates Arg473(catalytic domain) and Arg651 (catalytic and cysteine-rich domains) are maturated at the predicted furin cleavage site in insect cells. Full-length TACE contains a C-terminal extension of Arg651, including a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. We hypothesize that this cytoplasmic domain contains a negative signal that must be reversed to allow transport of TACE to the secretory compartment where activation occurs. It is intriguing that this domain contains a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site in the context of a Src homology 2 domain binding site, KKLDKQYESL705, as well as a potential Src homology 3 domain binding site, PAPQTPGR738. In fact, the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor can convert the recombinant TACE cytoplasmic tail (produced in E. coli) to its phosphotyrosine form.2Pradines-Figueres and Raetz (24Pradines-Figueres A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23261-23268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that TNFα secretion from MonoMac 6 cells occurs only after stimulation of these cells with both bacterial lipopolysaccharide and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Although proTNFα biosynthesis is enhanced after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, release does not occur to significant levels in the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (13Moss M.L. Becherer J.D. Milla M.E. Pahel G. Lambert M. Andrews R. Frye S. Haffner C. Cowan D. Maloney P. Dixon E.P. Jansen M. Mitchell J.L. Leesnitzer T. Warner J. Conway J. Bickett D.M. Bird M. Priest R. Reinhard J. Lin P. Bradshaw D. Nixon J.S. Bottomley K. Metalloproteinases as Targets for Anti-inflammatory Drugs. Birkhauser Publishers, Basel1998: 187-204Google Scholar). Potentially, a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-initiated phosphorylation or dephosphorylation event at the cytosolic tail of TACE precedes TACE activation, either via a conformational change that exposes the cleavage site to the processing protease(s) or by directing transport of TACE to the compartment where activation takes place. Remarkably, it has been shown that mutation of an equivalent tyrosine residue to phenylalanine in the cytoplasmic tail of furin results in failure of this enzyme to localize properly inside the cell (25Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berhöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.-L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28397-28401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that insect cells contain a TACE maturating activity but lack the cellular factors responsible for making TACE available to such protease. Both Arg473 and Arg651, after signal peptide cleavage, likely reach the compartment where maturation occurs via bulk flow secretion.Maturation by proteolytic cleavage is essential in order to generate active TACE. The pro domain strongly inhibits TACE, probably through complexing the catalytic zinc in the active site via an unpaired cysteine residue in the putative cysteine switch box. Our observation that the mercurial compound APMA efficiently mediates dissociation of the pro-catalytic domain complex supports this hypothesis. Additionally, peptides from the putative Cys-switch region do inhibit TACE activity (32Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjumen-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3531-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Interestingly, APMA-mediated dissociation of the pro-catalytic domain complex occurs at concentrations well below the ones used for activating matrix metalloproteinases. At higher concentrations, APMA acts as an inhibitor of TACE. We do not know the mechanism of this inactivation effect. APMA may react with one or more cysteine residues in the catalytic domain that are essential for keeping TACE in its functional form. Release of the cleaved pro domain appears not to be a simple diffusion-driven process, because pro remained tightly associated to the catalytic domain through several purification steps and even in the presence of substantial concentrations of the chemical denaturant urea. This suggests a role for the cysteine-rich domain in freeing the catalytic domain from the pro domain as indicated by the apparent absence of complex when Arg651 was overexpressed and purified. The cysteine-rich domain may have an interacting surface with the catalytic domain that overlaps the one used by the pro domain. Given the remarkable sensitivity of TACE pro domain to proteolysis, it is likely that once it is detached from the catalytic domain, its degradation prevents reassociation with the catalytic domain. It might also be possible that the cysteine-rich domain induces changes in conformation that dramatically reduce the affinity of the pro domain for the catalytic domain. The observed differences in glycosylation sites between Arg473 and Arg651, as well as the observed differences in oligosaccharide processing, may also have a role in stabilizing/destabilizing the pro-catalytic domain complex. It is less likely, however, that the cysteine-rich domain acts as an exchange factor, accepting pro after TACE activation, because of the apparent absence of Arg651-pro complexes.The pro domain is not only an inhibitor of the catalytic domain, but also appears to have at least some of the properties observed in chaperones, as it seems to facilitate either secretion or folding or both. When expressed separately, both domains failed to be secreted and appeared to be extremely sensitive to proteolysis. It seems unlikely that this result is due to inability of the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase to access its cleavage site: about half of the purified R473Δpro protein did have Ala17 as its N terminus, consistent with signal peptidase processing. In addition, the R473Δpro construct contains a signal peptide-catalytic domain fusion starting well downstream (after Pro24) from the signal peptidase cleavage site. Furthermore, a similar fusion of the signal peptide to the cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 1) is efficiently secreted by insect cells, and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for the native form of this domain. 3A. Miller and M. Milla, unpublished work. This dependence is not surprising: it has been previously reported for several proteases, including zinc metalloproteases, that the pro domain is essential for proper secretion (27Wetmore D.R. Hardman K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6549-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Becker J.W. Marcy A.I. Rokosz L.L. Axel M.G. Burbaum J.J. Fitzgerald P.M. Cameron P.M. Esser C.K.

Similar results have been described for other members of the ADAMs family, namely metalloprotease and disintegrin-containing proteins 9 and 15 (32Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E.

For at least two proteases, the α-lytic protease and subtilisin, the pro domain seems to control the kinetics of the folding reaction, supporting an intramolecular chaperone role (29Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 30Wang L. Ruan B. Ruvinov S. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3165-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).How does TACE quaternary structure relate to its function? Both proTNFα and TNFα are homotrimers. As the release of proTNFα from cellular membranes requires cleaving three stems, we investigated the oligomerization state of these recombinant forms by equilibrium sedimentation analysis to address whether TACE itself is a trimer. Both Arg473 and Arg651 were monomeric at concentrations well above the ones used to demonstrate cleavage against the synthetic peptide substrate. Bode and co-workers (11Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C.

They propose a model in which the “right side” of the catalytic domain forms such interactions with the base of the proTNFα trimer. A role for the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains in substrate recognition or oligomerization remains to be investigated.The extreme salt sensitivity of TACE is intriguing. Concentrations of NaCl that completely inhibit its activity (100 mm) do not seem to have an effect on its oligomeric state or solubility. Examination of electrostatic surface potential models of TACE (11Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J.

Therefore, disruption of favorable electrostatic interactions with the substrate peptide by chloride ions is formally possible. The physiological meaning of this effect remains to be established.We believe that some of these truncates will be useful in studies aimed at understanding how TACE interacts with its natural substrate, proTNFα, as well as to dissect the levels of regulation of its biogenesis and activity. In turn, this should allow us to explore new avenues for targeting this key enzyme for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases, cancer, and AIDS.

Given the remarkable sensitivity of TACE pro domain to proteolysis, it is likely that once it is detached from the catalytic domain, its degradation prevents reassociation with the catalytic domain. It might also be possible that the cysteine-rich domain induces changes in conformation that dramatically reduce the affinity of the pro domain for the catalytic domain. The observed differences in glycosylation sites between Arg473 and Arg651, as well as the observed differences in oligosaccharide processing, may also have a role in stabilizing/destabilizing the pro-catalytic domain complex. It is less likely, however, that the cysteine-rich domain acts as an exchange factor, accepting pro after TACE activation, because of the apparent absence of Arg651-pro complexes.The pro domain is not only an inhibitor of the catalytic domain, but also appears to have at least some of the properties observed in chaperones, as it seems to facilitate either secretion or folding or both. When expressed separately, both domains failed to be secreted and appeared to be extremely sensitive to proteolysis. It seems unlikely that this result is due to inability of the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase to access its cleavage site: about half of the purified R473Δpro protein did have Ala17 as its N terminus, consistent with signal peptidase processing. In addition, the R473Δpro construct contains a signal peptide-catalytic domain fusion starting well downstream (after Pro24) from the signal peptidase cleavage site. Furthermore, a similar fusion of the signal peptide to the cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 1) is efficiently secreted by insect cells, and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for the native form of this domain. 3A. Miller and M. Milla, unpublished work. This dependence is not surprising: it has been previously reported for several proteases, including zinc metalloproteases, that the pro domain is essential for proper secretion (27Wetmore D.R.

They propose a model in which the “right side” of the catalytic domain forms such interactions with the base of the proTNFα trimer. A role for the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains in substrate recognition or oligomerization remains to be investigated.The extreme salt sensitivity of TACE is intriguing. Concentrations of NaCl that completely inhibit its activity (100 mm) do not seem to have an effect on its oligomeric state or solubility. Examination of electrostatic surface potential models of TACE (11Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J.

Therefore, disruption of favorable electrostatic interactions with the substrate peptide by chloride ions is formally possible. The physiological meaning of this effect remains to be established.We believe that some of these truncates will be useful in studies aimed at understanding how TACE interacts with its natural substrate, proTNFα, as well as to dissect the levels of regulation of its biogenesis and activity. In turn, this should allow us to explore new avenues for targeting this key enzyme for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases, cancer, and AIDS. Our goal is to understand the relationship among the domain architecture, function, and regulation of TACE. The studies reported here show that only certain recombinant forms of TACE can be overexpressed in insect cells in a soluble, secreted form, fully active as compared with native TACE purified from a human monocytic cell line. Insect cells expressed mature, functional full-length TACE at very low levels. Most of the protease remained in its immature form, with the pro domain intact, as judged from Western blots of cell extracts. This result is particularly perplexing because truncates Arg473(catalytic domain) and Arg651 (catalytic and cysteine-rich domains) are maturated at the predicted furin cleavage site in insect cells. Full-length TACE contains a C-terminal extension of Arg651, including a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. We hypothesize that this cytoplasmic domain contains a negative signal that must be reversed to allow transport of TACE to the secretory compartment where activation occurs. It is intriguing that this domain contains a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site in the context of a Src homology 2 domain binding site, KKLDKQYESL705, as well as a potential Src homology 3 domain binding site, PAPQTPGR738. In fact, the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor can convert the recombinant TACE cytoplasmic tail (produced in E. coli) to its phosphotyrosine form.2 Pradines-Figueres and Raetz (24Pradines-Figueres A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23261-23268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that TNFα secretion from MonoMac 6 cells occurs only after stimulation of these cells with both bacterial lipopolysaccharide and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Although proTNFα biosynthesis is enhanced after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, release does not occur to significant levels in the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (13Moss M.L. Becherer J.D. Milla M.E. Pahel G. Lambert M. Andrews R. Frye S. Haffner C. Cowan D. Maloney P. Dixon E.P. Jansen M. Mitchell J.L. Leesnitzer T. Warner J. Conway J. Bickett D.M. Bird M. Priest R. Reinhard J. Lin P. Bradshaw D. Nixon J.S. Bottomley K. Metalloproteinases as Targets for Anti-inflammatory Drugs. Birkhauser Publishers, Basel1998: 187-204Google Scholar). Potentially, a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-initiated phosphorylation or dephosphorylation event at the cytosolic tail of TACE precedes TACE activation, either via a conformational change that exposes the cleavage site to the processing protease(s) or by directing transport of TACE to the compartment where activation takes place. Remarkably, it has been shown that mutation of an equivalent tyrosine residue to phenylalanine in the cytoplasmic tail of furin results in failure of this enzyme to localize properly inside the cell (25Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berhöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.-L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28397-28401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that insect cells contain a TACE maturating activity but lack the cellular factors responsible for making TACE available to such protease. Both Arg473 and Arg651, after signal peptide cleavage, likely reach the compartment where maturation occurs via bulk flow secretion. Maturation by proteolytic cleavage is essential in order to generate active TACE. The pro domain strongly inhibits TACE, probably through complexing the catalytic zinc in the active site via an unpaired cysteine residue in the putative cysteine switch box. Our observation that the mercurial compound APMA efficiently mediates dissociation of the pro-catalytic domain complex supports this hypothesis. Additionally, peptides from the putative Cys-switch region do inhibit TACE activity (32Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjumen-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3531-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, APMA-mediated dissociation of the pro-catalytic domain complex occurs at concentrations well below the ones used for activating matrix metalloproteinases. At higher concentrations, APMA acts as an inhibitor of TACE. We do not know the mechanism of this inactivation effect. APMA may react with one or more cysteine residues in the catalytic domain that are essential for keeping TACE in its functional form. Release of the cleaved pro domain appears not to be a simple diffusion-driven process, because pro remained tightly associated to the catalytic domain through several purification steps and even in the presence of substantial concentrations of the chemical denaturant urea. This suggests a role for the cysteine-rich domain in freeing the catalytic domain from the pro domain as indicated by the apparent absence of complex when Arg651 was overexpressed and purified. The cysteine-rich domain may have an interacting surface with the catalytic domain that overlaps the one used by the pro domain.

P680+oxidizes tyrosine 161, YZ, located on subunit D1 of PS II (4Debus R.J. Barry B.A. Babcock G.T. McIntosh C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 85: 427-430Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). YZ is the immediate electron donor to P680+ (5Gerken S. Brettel K. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 69-75Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). YZox, in turn, extracts an electron from the water oxidizing complex and catalytic center (CC), respectively (6Blankenship R.E. Babcock G.T. Warden J.T. Sauer K. FEBS Lett. 1975; 51: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For the oxidation of 2H2O, the CC passes four oxidation states, S0 → S4(7Kok B. Forbush B. McGloin M. Photochem.

With regard to the four H+ released from the two H2O in the CC, a pattern of 1:0:1:2 for the S0 → S1 → S2 → S3→ (S4) → S0 transitions has been accepted for many years (9Fowler C.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Photobiol. 1985; 41: 183-190Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown, however, that the stoichiometry of the protons released into the medium is generally noninteger and depends strongly on the pH, the material, and its preparation (12Rappaport F. Lavergne J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10004-10012Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this H+ release is a composition of protons released from the CC and protons dissociated from unknown amino acid residues by pK shifts because of electrostatic interaction with the charges of the CC. Therefore, no direct conclusions regarding the pattern of the H+ release from the CC can be drawn from pH measurements in the medium. Junge and co-workers (13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Bögershausen O. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 177-185Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that in most if not in all S state transitions H+ release into the medium occurs very rapidly from amino acid residues located at the periphery of PS II possibly because of the electrostatic interaction with the charge of the transiently oxidized YZ. 2Oxidized tyrosine is a neutral radical (15Tommos C. Babcock G.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1999; Google Scholar) but acts as a positive charge by the released phenolic proton, which is reversibly bonded to His190 in its vicinity,i.e. YZox stands for YZ· … H+His190. It was supposed that in thylakoids 3–5 unknown bases are thereby created. Water oxidation with the release of 4 H+ from 2H2O should occur in the terminal S4 → S0 transition; the protons should be trapped by the bases produced in the S0 → S4 transitions (13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Haumann M. Junge W. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1996: 165-192Google Scholar). On the basis of an extensive biochemical consideration, Babcock and coworkers proposed a mechanism in which the tyrosyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the bound water in each S state transition (see e.g. Ref. 17Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Science. 1997; 277: 1953-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The preceding oxidation of YZ through P680+ should be accompanied by one H+ release into the medium. This would correspond to a H+stoichiometry of 1:1:1:1. A different model has been developed since 1984 based on an observed period of four oscillation of net charges in the CC (18Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 83-87Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 224-226Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Brettel K. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim.

The latter was concluded from two independent experiments: (i) In the S state cycle of water oxidation, a local stable electric field was observed by electrochromic band shifts (18Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 83-87Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 224-226Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was attributed to a positive net charge of the CC in S2 and S3 relative to S0 and S1. (ii) The net charge was also monitored by the strongly retarded reduction kinetics of the oxidized primary electron donor, P680+, in the S states S2 and S3 (20Brettel K. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 403-415Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It was shown that the net charge oscillation 0:0:1:1 in S0:S1:S2:S3 is pH-independent between pH 5.5 and 7 (21Kretschmann H. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 1-8Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This pH independence was measured also for the oxidation of the CC followed at 365 nm and attributed to manganese oxidation (21Kretschmann H. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 1-8Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as for the O2 evolution (22Meyer B. Schlodder E. Dekker J.P. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 36-43Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the net charge is created as the charge difference between electron abstraction and intrinsic proton release from the CC. From this it follows that the pH-independent H+ release from the CC is 1:0:1:2 coupled with the S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 → (S4) → S0 transitions (18Saygin Ö. Witt H.T.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1996: 165-192Google Scholar, it was reported on thylakoids, PS II-enriched membrane fragments, and PS II core particles from plant material. We used PS II core complexes from cyanobacteria. Our material, provided to Junge's laboratory, was analyzed with the pH-indicating dye technique. The observed pattern of the H+ release in the medium (listed in Ref. 21Kretschmann H. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have explained in Ref. 21Kretschmann H. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 1-8Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar that the H+ pattern of our material would be in moderate agreement with the 1:0:1:2 proton release from the CC and protons from an acid group (pK ≈ 6), which is deprotonated and reprotonated by electrostatic interaction with the oscillating net charge 0:0:1:1 of the CC. In this work, we give evidence for this prediction. (i) The H+ release into the medium was directly followed by pH measurements with a sensitive glass electrode. This technique was used to prevent problems coupled with the use of pH-indicating dyes in biological systems (see Experimental Procedure). (ii) We used improved purified PS II core complexes from cyanobacteriaSynechococcus elongatus which are highly active in O2 evolution and crystallizable (23Zouni A. Lüneberg C. Fromme P. Schubert W.D. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanism and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1998: 925-928Google Scholar). (iii) The discrepancy between the results obtained with the PS II material of cyanobacteria and the results measured in different materials from plants are discussed. (iv) Possible water derivatives that circulate through the S states have been named. Oxygen-evolving PS II core complexes were prepared from the cyanobacterium S. elongatus according to Refs. 23Zouni A. Lüneberg C. Fromme P. Schubert W.D. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Garab G.

The PS II complexes were characterized by about 55 Chl/QAand 66 Chl/¼ O2 estimated from the amount of photo-reducible QA and O2 per flash and chlorophyll. Flash-induced changes in pH because of proton release were measured with a light-insensitive glass electrode of the flat membrane type (SA 9218/2.N from Schott). The reference electrode (B 2830 from Schott) was separated from the reaction medium by an electrolyte bridge filled with the reaction medium. A pH meter (model 645 from Knick) was used to read out the pH-dependent voltage. After compensation of the steady-state level by a constant offset voltage, the output signals were further amplified, filtered by a low pass filter (Dual Hi/Lo Filter model 452 from Wavetek Rockland) and digitized by a storage oscilloscope (Nicolet 1090A). The reaction medium contained 0.5 mm buffer (at pH 5.5 and 6.0, MES and at pH 7.2 and 7.0, MOPS), 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02%n-dodecyl-β,d-maltoside, 100 μm2,5 dichloro-p-benzoquinone, 1 mmK3[Fe(CN)6], and PS II complexes equivalent to 20–30 μm chlorophyll a. For measurements 3 ml of the reaction medium were filled into the reaction vessel (diameter, 3 cm) and stirred at 17 °C. The dark-adapted samples were illuminated through the vessel bottom with saturating xenon flashes (pulse duration, 15 μs) filtered by a colored glass (RG610 from Schott). The dark time between flashes in each series of flashes was 1 s. For each flash series with a different number of flashes we used a fresh sample. The difference between the proton release after i and i + 1 flashes was calculated to obtain the proton release induced by the ith flash. Calibration of the proton release was achieved by addition of 5 μl of 1 mm HCl to the medium. The use of a sensitive pH glass electrode to measure pH changes offers the following advantages compared with pH-indicating dye techniques: (i) Excitation of the sample by measuring light that is necessary to follow pH-indicating absorption changes is excluded by glass electrode measurements performed in the dark. (ii) The interpretation of pH-indicating absorption changes is complicated in a suspension of biological particles. The response may depend on the partition of the dye in the different phases (aqueous and hydrophobic regions and their interfaces). The meaning of a multiphasic response has led to controversial conclusions (25Jahns P. Lavergne J. Rappaport F. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 313-319Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The proton release measured in dependence on the flash number is not correlated directly to the individual S state transitions. Therefore the experimental pattern of proton release was deconvoluted with the Kok parameters (So/S1 ratio of dark-adapted samples, misses and double hits) to obtain the amount of protons released on every S state transition. Fig. 1 shows the time course of pH changes measured with a glass electrode after excitation of dark-adapted PS II core complexes from Synechococcus at pH 6 with one, two, three, and four flashes. The kinetics of the proton release were determined by the instrumental response time of ∼10 s. Dichloro-p-benzoquinone (100 μm) and K3[Fe(CN)6] (1 mm) were used as electron acceptors (see “Experimental Procedures”). Measurements without ferricyanide show the uptake of about 1 proton/flash and PS II in addition to the proton release at the donor side of PS II (not shown). This result gives evidence that ferricyanide oxidizes the reduced dichloro-p-benzoquinone acceptor fast enough to prevent a proton uptake by reduced dichloro-p-benzoquinone at the acceptor side of PS II. Without any electron acceptor the pH change induced by the first flash was below the detection limit, and the signal amplitude induced by 100 flashes was less than 1% of the control. To obtain the proton release induced by the nth flash, the difference between the proton release after n andn − 1 flashes was calculated. Fig.2 shows the extent of the proton release as a function of the flash number for pH 5.5, 6.0, 7.0, and 7.2 normalized to the average proton yield of flashes 1–9. The measured patterns (see data points in Fig. 2) were fitted (seesolid lines in Fig. 2) according to the Kok parameters with 25% S0 and 75% S1 in the dark-adapted state, 10% misses, 7% double hits, as well as, with proton release stoichiometries for the S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 → S0 transitions as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. The proton release evaluated for the four S state transitions (Fig. 2) is depicted in Fig.3 (see data points) as function of pH.Figure 2Proton release per PS II into the medium measured with a glass electrode at pH 5.5, 6.0, 7.0, and 7.2 as a function of the flash number.

Thethree curves are calculated ones assuming the presence of a deprotonable acid group AH with pK ≈ 5.7 and a pH-independent 1:0:1:2 proton release from the CC as predicted from the net charge oscillation 0:0:1:1 (18Saygin Ö.

Acta. 1996; 1274: 1-8Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar and in the introduction it was outlined that the pH-independent H+ release 1:0:1:2 from the CC concluded from the net charge oscillation 0:0:1:1 is modified by protons dissociated from amino acid groups to a pH-dependent H+ release into the medium. The electrostatic interaction between the net charge in S2 and an amino acid residue, AH, might result in a stable base, A−, and a proton release into the medium. If one AH exists per PS II, then m in mAH indicates the fraction of AH that is in the protonated state in S0(Scheme FS1). The base, mA−, is reprotonated when the net charge disappears in S3 → (S4) → S0 through the release of two H+ from the CC. Therefore, the H+ release in S3 → (S4) → S0 is (2 − m), and in the S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 → (S4) → S0 transitions 1:m:1:(2 − m) (for nBH in Scheme FS1; see legend). In cyanobacteria and PS II-enriched membrane fragments from spinach an amino acid residue with a pK between 5.3 and 6.0 has been discussed (22Meyer B. Schlodder E. Dekker J.P. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 36-43Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Vaas I. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For an optimal fit of the data in Fig. 3, we have to assume in the following a reactive acid group, AH, with an apparent pK ≈ 5.7 and a positive net charge in S2 inducing a pK shift that would release all mH+ from mAH in the considered pH 5.5–7.2 range. This is the case if a ΔpK ≥ 2 is induced. Neglecting secondary effects, ΔpK ≥ 2 is consistent with the result of a simple calculation in which the reasonable values of ε ≈ 10 and d ≈ 12 Å are assumed for the unknown dielectric constant ε and distance d between the net charge and the acid. For a weak acid it is log (1 − m)/m = pH − pK. With this relation and a pH-independent 1:0:1:2 proton release from the CC as concluded from the net charge oscillation 0:0:1:1, it results a stoichiometry of the H+ being released into the medium between pH 5 and pH 7 as shown by the three curves in Fig.3. This calculation fairly agrees with the glass electrode measurements in the medium (data points in Fig. 3). This agreement supports the assumption made in the calculation, especially the prediction that the pH-independent H+ release from the CC is 1:0:1:2. The stoichiometry of the proton release into the medium at pH 7.0 and 7.2 is identical to the predicted H+ release from the CC, because at this pH the acid mAH is practically deprotonated and cannot contribute to the proton release into the medium. The possible pathways of the protons released from the CC and mAH are depicted in Scheme FS1. The evaluated stoichiometry of the proton release from the CC may be a basis for obtaining information about the possible water derivatives in the different S states. In this regard, we have to take into account that the light-induced S0 → S4 state cycling can be turned backwards in the dark with reducing agents such as hydroxylamine NH2OH (27Bouges B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 234: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have shown that with NH2OH S0 can be reversibly overreduced by one electron into a state S−1 identified by a corresponding overreduced manganese state (28Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1985; 10: 71-82Google Scholar). In addition, we observed a local electrochromic absorption change and net charge, respectively, in state S−1 (28Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1985; 10: 71-82Google Scholar) (Table I). These results were supported in Ref. 29Kretschmann H. Pauly S. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 208-214Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar and extended in Ref. 30Kretschmann H. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 331-345Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar. In the light-induced forward S−1 → S0 transition, the net charge disappears. This is only possible when in S−1 → S0, together with the electron abstraction, two H+ are released from the CC. Then in toto four H+ are released between S−1 and S3. With the assumption that reversibly bound water within the CC is the source of these protons, this is possible if S−1 contains 2H2O. With this “calibration” the possible water derivatives in the native S states should be those depicted in Table I and Scheme FS1. Because S3 does not contain any more water protons, the S3 → S4transition is not accompanied by a proton release from the CC. Therefore, in this transition a second net charge is created in state S4. From the conclusion that 2OH− is the substrate in state S0 it follows that in the S4→ S0 transition 2H2O (not 2OH−) are taken up with the subsequent release of two protons.Table IPossible derivatives of water in the S−1 to S4states‖S−1⊕‖2H2O‖→−e−2H+‖S0‖2OH−‖→−e−H+‖S1‖OH−/O=‖→−e‖‖S2⊕‖OH−/O=‖→−e−H+S3⊕‖2O=‖→−e|‖S4⊕⊕‖2O=‖→+2H2O−02,−2H+‖S0‖2OH− Open table in a new tab Because manganese oxidation probably takes place in each S state up to state S3 (see below) and YZox is proposed to be the fourth oxidized state in S4 (see below), it follows that water is oxidized only in the S4 → S0 transition. The complete proton depletion from water prior to the S4 → S0 transition (Table I and Scheme FS1) is in line with an energetic consideration, showing that deprotonated water is possibly the most favorable state for oxidation (31Brudvig G.W. de Paula J.C. Progress in Photosynthesis Research. 1987; I (Biggins, J., ed.) I.5.491, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht: 491-498Google Scholar). In Ref. 32Messinger J. Bader M. Wydrzynski T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, a slow and a fast exchanging water derivative was measured in the S3state, a result that may exclude symmetric water ligands in S3, e.g. as predicted in Schemes FS1 and FS2. But, if YZox represents the fourth oxidizing equivalent (see below), YZ is possibly in the vicinity of only one of the two active Mn4+ = O couples. Because the other ligands of the two manganeses may be also different, this could account for different exchange rates. Different limiting water channels between the two manganese sites and the solvent phase could also be responsible for the biphasic behavior (33Hillier W. Mesinger J. Wydrzynski T. Garab G.

Wensink J. Ouwehand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 767: 1-9Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Manganese oxidation states derived from our measurements in the UV are depicted in Scheme FS2. These were obtained inter alia under improved conditions in which the S state sequences from S0 up to S3 were before the opposite reaction S3 → S0 (35Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Only a manganese dimer was considered to be functional. The mixed valence states in S0 and S2 (spin = ½) are in agreement with an EPR multiline signal in S0 (41Messinger J. Robblee J, Yu, W.O.

Res. 1993; 38: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar a manganese oxidation has, however, not been observed in the S2 → S3 transition. With respect to the S3 → S4 transition, a signal indicating the creation of a fourth oxidizing equivalent has not been found by any of the methods. We have proposed in Ref. 35Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 452-469Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar that the immediate electron donor to P680+, i.e. oxidized tyrosine YZox itself, represents the fourth oxidizing equivalent, i.e. S4 ≡ YZox · S3. The oxidation of YZ in S3 → S4 was shown to take place biphasically with 50 and 260 ns (20Brettel K. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 403-415Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). From this follows that the transition S3 → S4 should take place within this time (Schemes FS1 and FS2). We have outlined that in S4 the electrostatic field of YZox is the actual promoter giving rise to a two-electron transfer from the two oxo-atoms O2− to the active Mn4+ ions resulting in a peroxo-intermediate Mn3+-O-O-Mn3+. In a further two-electron oxidation, this may be followed by the O2 evolution within milliseconds, coupled with the formation of YZ and Mn2+-Mn3+, uptake of 2H2O, and the subsequent release of 2 H+ (35Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 452-469Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The function of YZox as electrostatical promoter in S4 has recently also been discussed in Ref. 44Ahlbrink R. Haumann M. Cherepanov D. Bögershausen O. Mulkidjanian A. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar. For the clarification of the mechanism of water cleavage, straightforward measurement of protons released from the CC into the medium is not possible because protons released from amino acid residues are superimposed. H+ release from these residues is induced by electrostatic interaction between the charges in the CC and amino acid groups. In the medium very different proton stoichiometries were observed, depending on the material (thylakoids, PS II-enriched membrane fragments, and PS II core complexes) and its isolation procedure (12Rappaport F. Lavergne J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10004-10012Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Bögershausen O. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 177-185Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Haumann M. Junge W. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1996: 165-192Google Scholar). This indicates that at least part of such proton dissociation cannot have a function in connection with the events leading to water oxidation. The treatments during isolation and purification of the material may induce increased contact of hydrophobic protein domains with water and partial protein unfolding. This may be coupled with a decrease of pK values of otherwise “silent” acids, whereby these become deprotonatable. The H+ release relevant to the water oxidation may be masked by interference with such nonspecific protolytic reactions. These reasons may also account for the nonoscillating proton release observed with PS II core complexes from plants (14Bögershausen O. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 177-185Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), because addition of glycerol, known as an agent inducing refolding and stabilizing the native protein structure (45Timasheff S.N. Arakwa T. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 331-345Google Scholar), can in part restore the oscillation in these core complexes as shown in (46Haumann M. Hundelt M. Jahns P. Chroni S. Bögershausen O. Ghanotakis D. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 143-248Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this work, however, we used PS II core complexes from cyanobacteria that are crystallizable. This feature indicates that unfolded protein domains or other defects of the protein matrix are most likely negligible because otherwise with this material crystallization would not be possible. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that added glycerol has no effect on the H+ pattern of our PS II core complexes between pH 5 and 7 (not shown). Regarding the oscillating H+ release in thylakoids coupled with the S state transition (13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), its pH dependence strongly deviates from that of our PS II core complexes shown in Fig. 3. (Recently, stoichiometries for thylakoids were reported in Ref. 46Haumann M. Hundelt M. Jahns P. Chroni S. Bögershausen O. Ghanotakis D. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 143-248Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar that are different from the results detailed in Ref. 13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar.) From the variable extent and kinetics of the proton release at pH 6.5 and 7.5, it was concluded in (13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that 3–5 bases are created by deprotonation of different amino acid residues in the transitions from So→ S4. The bases have been supposed to trap the 4 H+ suggested to be released upon oxidation of 2H2O in the terminal S4 → S0transition (13Haumann M. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Haumann M. Junge W. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1996: 165-192Google Scholar). This concept is, however, not consistent with the two results discussed in this work: (i) Here, the proton release of PS II complexes from cyanobacteria measured in the medium with a glass electrode can be simulated satisfactorily with the assumption of only one deprotonatable acid group AH (pK ≈ 5.7) and a pH-independent 1:0:1:2 proton release from the CC (Fig. 3). (ii) The result is in agreement with the net charge oscillation of 0:0:1:1 in S0:S1:S2:S3 (18Saygin Ö. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 83-87Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Saygin Ö.

This observation was explained by a H+ release from the CC with a stoichiometry of 1:0:1:2. This consistently supports the conclusion drawn from the proton measurement in the medium.

In mammals, the predominant form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)1 in the central nervous system is an amphiphilic tetramer anchored to the membrane by a hydrophobic, noncatalytic subunit; at the neuromuscular junction, it is an asymmetric form containing 1–3 tetramers associated with the basal lamina by a collagen-like, structural subunit. Collagen-tailed forms are also predominant in the electric organ of the eelElectrophorus electricus. In the form containing three catalytic tetramers, three collagen-like subunits are disulfide-linked together, and each is attached to a tetramer in which two catalytic subunits forming a proximal dimer are disulfide-linked to the tail subunit and are associated with a peripheral dimer by quaternary interactions (3Anglister L. Silman I. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 293-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,4Lee S.L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12292-12301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1). 2Scheme FS1 is not intended to describe the crystal structures reported in this study. Apart from the association as a dimer of disulfide-linked dimers, both amphiphilic and nonamphiphilic tetramers appear to form from a single splice variant. The eel AChET subunits (EeAChE) present the capacity to form heteromeric quaternary associations (5Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests discrete tetrameric arrangements where the amphipathic carboxyl-terminal sequences (T peptides) are either buried or exposed. Tetrameric arrangements of AChE subunits were observed in situ (6Rieger F. Bon S. Massoulié J. Cartaud J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Cartaud J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, little structural information is available about the subunit orientation in the tetramer and the association of tetramers with anchor subunits. The crystal structure of recombinant mouse AChE (mAChE) revealed a compact, pseudo-square planar tetrameric arrangement of subunits (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); mAChE, however, lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic glycophospholipid or the amphipathic helix found on natural forms of AChE and is expressed as a monomer (13Marchot P. Ravelli R.B.G. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a feature that poses the question of whether physiological forms of the enzyme would form a similar tetramer. In fact, crystals of EeAChE and diffraction experiments were reported earlier (14Leuzinger W. Baker A.L. Cauvin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Chothia C. Leuzinger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Schrag J.D. Schmid M.F. Morgan D.G.

Since then, crystal structures ofTorpedo californica AChE (TcAChE) (17Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) and mAChE (18Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) were solved, and the cDNA-derived primary structure of EeAChE was determined (5Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we report two low resolution crystal structures solved from two distinct crystal forms grown in different conditions from the soluble, trypsin-released EeAChE tetramer. These structures reveal discrete but related tetrameric arrangements of catalytic subunits that are consistent overall with that found in the mAChE crystal and with arrangements observed in situ. Moreover, comparison of these arrangements suggests that, in solution, the AChE tetramer has significant conformational flexibility. The prepacked Superdex-200 HiLoad 26/60 column and the gel-filtration calibration markers were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. N-Tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) and the protein molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were from Sigma. Other reagents and the salts used for crystallization were of the highest grade available. EeAChE, as a mixture of asymmetric forms, was isolated from homogenized electric organs by affinity chromatography and subjected to tryptic cleavage as described previously (19Grassi J. Frobert Y. Lamourette P. Lagoutte B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The released tetramer was purified by size-exclusion fast performance liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a Superdex-200 column equilibrated and eluted with 100 mm NaKPO4, pH 7.5, 400 mmNaCl, 0.01% NaN3 (w/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 and at 20 °C. The purified tetramer was dialyzed against 100 mm NaKPO4, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% NaN3 (w/v) and concentrated to 10–15 mg ml−1; it was stored on ice. AChE activity measurements were conducted spectrophotometrically (20Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21510) Google Scholar) with 0.5 mm acetylthiocholine and 0.33 mmdithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin (λ = 412 nm) (13Marchot P.

SDS-PAGE was performed on homogeneous 7.5% gels using a PhastSystem apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were boiled for 5 min in the presence of 2.5% (w/v) SDS with (reducing conditions) or without (nonreducing conditions) 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Staining was by silver nitrate according to the manufacturer's method number 210. Crystallization was achieved by vapor diffusion using hanging drops of 4 μl and a protein-to-well solution ratio of 1:1. Form A crystals were grown at 4 °C using 1.1–1.5 m NaKPO4, pH 8.0–9.5, as the well solution; form B crystals were grown at 20 °C using 1.4m ammonium sulfate, pH 5.5–6.0, as the well solution. Data were collected at 20 °C on mounted crystals and using a 300 mm MarResearch imaging plate detector equipped with a Siemens rotating anode (50 kV × 80 mA). Oscillation images were integrated with DENZO (21Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Issacs N. Burley S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend on Data Collection and Processing. Science and Engineering Research Council/Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1993: 56-62Google Scholar) and scaled and merged with SCALA (22Evans P.R. Sawyer L. Issacs N. Burley S. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend on Data Collection and Processing. Science and Engineering Research Council/Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1993: 114-122Google Scholar) (Table I). Amplitude factors were generated with TRUNCATE (23Matthews B.W. CCP4 Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763PubMed Google Scholar). Form A crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group F222 with unit cell dimensions a = 118 Å, b = 215.9 Å, c = 229.4 Å, giving a V m value of 4.5 Å3/Da (73% solvent) for one EeAChE subunit (∼80 kDa) in the asymmetric unit (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). Form B crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 211 Å, b = 129.7 Å, c = 195.4 Å (β = 103.2°), giving aV m value of 4.1 Å3/Da (69.5% solvent) for one EeAChE tetramer (∼320 kDa) in the asymmetric unit.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsStructure A (F222)Structure B (C2)Data collection Resolution range (Å)10–4.512–4.2 Total observations101, 833158, 367 Unique reflections7, 74224, 590 Multiplicity2.91.9 Completeness (%)7466 Rsym(%)aR sym = Σ‖I − 〈I〉‖/ΣI, where I is an individual reflection measurement and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity for symmetry-related reflections.2018Structure determination AMoReCorrelation5758R-factor (%)bR-factor = Σ∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/Σ‖F o‖, whereF o and F c are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.4936.5 DMR-factor (%)cR-factor calculated with SFALL using structure factor and phase informations from DM (cf. 23).3634Rfree(%)dR free is calculated for 3% of randomly selected reflections excluded from refinement.3836.5Refinement CNS rigid body refinement:R-factor (%)bR-factor = Σ∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/Σ‖F o‖, whereF o and F c are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.36.937.5Rfree (%)dR free is calculated for 3% of randomly selected reflections excluded from refinement.35.138.5 Map correlation0.870.82a R sym = Σ‖I − 〈I〉‖/ΣI, where I is an individual reflection measurement and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity for symmetry-related reflections.b R-factor = Σ∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/Σ‖F o‖, whereF o and F c are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.c R-factor calculated with SFALL using structure factor and phase informations from DM (cf. 23).d R free is calculated for 3% of randomly selected reflections excluded from refinement.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) (Table I). The phases calculated from a positioned catalytic subunit were improved by solvent flattening using program DM (23Matthews B.W. CCP4 Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763PubMed Google Scholar) and a mask built around the subunit. The same procedure with additional averaging was used for structure B. For the two structures, rigid body refinement was applied to the whole subunit using the program CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S.

Accuracy of the structures was further checked by omitting from the starting model and before rigid body calculation the entire 17-residue helix α10 (mAChE residues 526–543), a key structure element for the formation of the dimer four-helix bundle (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); difference electron density maps calculated after rigid body refinement unambiguously revealed the presence of helix α10(cf. Fig. 4). Figs. 2, 3, and 4 were generated with the ALSCRIPT (27Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), RIBBON (28Carson M. J. Appl.

Bottom left, ribbon diagram of tetramer B viewed perpendicular to the four-helix bundle axis of dimerAB (which is oriented as in the top left paneland is masked by dimer CD); bottom right, tetramer B viewed perpendicular to the dimer-dimer interface, 90° from the left view. The italicized labels A and Brefer to the subunits in the left dimer and labels C andD to subunits in the right dimer for the top leftand bottom right orientations. In tetramer A (overall dimensions: 132 × 132 × 55 Å), the main axes of the two dimers are tilted by ∼40° from each other and the axes of the two four-helix bundles, made of helices α37,8 and α10 from two subunits and displayed in black, are aligned antiparallel with convergent helices α10; the four peripheral sites, of which two from diagonally opposed subunits are oriented above the plane of the figure (circled), are accessible to the outside solvent; the apparent free space in the center of tetramer A is 75 Å long × 35 Å wide. In tetramer B (130 × 100 × 55 Å), the main axes of the two dimers are aligned antiparallel and the two four-helix bundle axes are positioned 60° from each other with convergent helices α10; of the four peripheral sites, two are accessible to the outside solvent (circled) and two face the central, internal space (75 × 15 Å). For each of the two structures, the backbone shown is that of mAChE but residue numbering is that of EeAChE (cf. Fig.2); the position of peptide Ile418–Gln446, which is unique to EeAChE and has not been modeled, is indicated by anarrow; the putative N-glycosylation sites are indicated by black spheres; and the labels N and C indicate the amino and carboxyl termini of subunit A, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The trypsin-released tetramer eluted from the gel filtration column as a single, symmetric absorbance peak of apparent mass of ∼360 kDa; analysis of the specific AChE activity throughout the peak suggested functional homogeneity of the tetramer (data not shown). However, electrophoretic analysis suggested structural heterogeneity. Indeed, although SDS-PAGE performed in reducing conditions yielded the three broad bands of ∼80, 50, and 30 kDa, characteristic for reduced EeAChE (30Dudai Y. Silman I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Rosenberry T.L. Chen Y.T. Bock E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3068-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), SDS-PAGE performed in nonreducing conditions yielded a weak, thin band of ∼320 kDa representing residual tetramer and two pairs of closely migrating, intense bands in a ratio of about 1:1 and average apparent masses of ∼160 and 80 kDa, values consistent with dimers and monomers, respectively (Fig.1). The purified tetramer thus appears not only to be composed of two equal populations of dimers differing slightly in their masses (as expected from a dimer of dimers where one set of disulfides links with the residual tail and the other set forms between monomers; cf. Scheme FS1) but also to contain, in the same proportion, two equal populations of slightly different monomers. Trypsin cleaves peptides and proteins at the ester linkages of arginines and lysines, two residues that are found upstream of the linking cysteines not only in the amino-terminal end of the tail (32Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,33Krejci E. Thomine S.

Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the presence of SDS, dimers that lack the disulfide dissociate into monomers. Hence, the EeAChE tetramer subjected to crystallization is composed of two equal populations of covalent and noncovalent dimers, either proximal or distal to the tail. The apparent mass of the EeAChE tetramer estimated from chromatography is ∼12% higher than that estimated from electrophoresis, a difference that suggests either dimensional asymmetry or a high level of hydration of the tetramer (or both). Substantial dimensional asymmetry was reported earlier for the EeAChE tetramer (3Anglister L. Silman I. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 293-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the homologous 11S TcAChE species (34Taylor P. Jones J.W. Jacobs N.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 78-92PubMed Google Scholar), and the fetal bovine serum AChE tetramer (35Ralston J.C. Rush R.S. Doctor B.P. Wolfe A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4312-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, two highly solvated crystal forms were grown from the purified EeAChE tetramer (cf. “Experimental Procedures”). For each of the two EeAChE structures herein reported, the low resolution achieved does not reveal details in the positions of the side chains in the catalytic subunit nor in those located at the subunit interfaces. As well, structure elements that are unique to the eel enzyme, peptide Ile418–Gln446 and the carboxyl-terminal T peptide Glu571–Leu610 (5Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), are not resolved. Yet, each of the structures provides substantial information on the arrangement of the subunits within the tetramer. A single solution was found for the positions and orientations of the subunits in pairs whether molecular replacement used an isolated subunit or a dimer of subunits as a search model. Indeed, dimers of subunits related by four-helix bundles and identical to dimers observed in structures of TcAChE (17Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I.

Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) were observed. The two EeAChE structures, however, differ in the geometry of the two dimers within the tetramer. Because of the current resolutions, the EeAChE backbone was not modeled, and the backbone shown is that of mAChE. Accordingly, the EeAChE residues are referred to relative to the mAChE backbone based on sequence homology (Fig. 2), and the number in parentheses that follows the EeAChE residue number (5Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) denotes the corresponding position in mAChE (13Marchot P. Ravelli R.B.G. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Rachinsky T.L. Camp S. Li Y. Ekström J. Newton M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 317-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In EeAChE structure A, the two dimers arrange as a loose, pseudo-square planar tetramer of a marked dimensional asymmetry (Fig. 3). The two four-helix bundle axes are aligned antiparallel, and the main axes of the two dimers are tilted by ∼40° from each other, a geometry reminiscent of that observed in the mAChE structure (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At the dimer-dimer interface, which extends over 75 Å in a direction roughly perpendicular to the four-helix bundle axis, loop Cys256(257)–Cys267(272), which is located between helices α16,7 and α26,7 and protrudes at the surface of each subunit in a dimer (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is at a near contact distance of 13 Å from the homologous loop in the facing subunit of the second dimer. This loop in EeAChE is shorter by four residues than in mAChE, but the oligosaccharide moieties linked to the facing Asn260(265)residues may interact with each other and lock the arrangement. A similar cross-interaction may occur for the oligosaccharide moieties linked to the facing Asn161(162) residues. The carboxyl-terminal helices α10 in the four-helix bundles converge toward the center of the tetramer, but the facing Thr570(543) residues, terminal to helices α10, are separated by 35 Å. As a result, the surface area buried at the dimer-dimer interface does not exceed a few Å2 on each dimer and there is a large space, apparently empty of electron density, at the center of the tetramer. In tetramer A, the four gorges that lead to the EeAChE active centers are oriented roughly antiparallel in a direction perpendicular to the tetramer plane. All four peripheral sites, of which two, from diagonally opposed subunits, are exposed on one face of the tetramer and two on the other face, are freely accessible to the solvent, a geometry consistent with the binding of four fasciculin or inhibitory antibody molecules/AChE tetramer (38Marchot P. Khélif A. Ji Y-H. Mansuelle P. Bougis P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12458-12467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gentry M.K. Moorad D.R. Hur R.S. Saxena A. Ashani Y. Doctor B.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 40Remy M.H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The EeAChE-specific peptide Ile418–Gln446, which is located between the very long helix α47,8 and the short strand β8 of a subunit, protrudes at the surface of the subunit opposite the entrance of the active center gorge (5Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hence in tetramer A, the four Ile418–Gln446 peptides are freely accessible to the solvent, an exposition that, along with the high flexibility imparted by the high content in Gly residues, likely accounts for the absence of density in these regions. In EeAChE structure B, the two dimers arrange as a compact, square nonplanar tetramer, also of a marked dimensional asymmetry (Fig. 3). Compared with structure A, the tetramer folds as to position the two four-helix bundle axes 60° from each other, and one dimer rotates relative to the second one by ∼40° as to reorient the main axes of the two dimers antiparallel. At the dimer-dimer interface, which now extends in a direction perpendicular to the plane made by the two four-helix bundle axes, the facing loops Cys256(257)–Cys267(272) are still separated by 13 Å, consistent with bridges possibly imparted by the facing oligosaccharide moieties linked to Asn161(162) and Asn260(265), and the four Thr570(543) residues, which are terminal to helices α10, by 32 Å. In tetramer B, the axes of the EeAChE active center gorges are oriented antiparallel within a dimer but are tilted by 120° from a dimer to the second one. Of the four peripheral sites, two, from diagonally opposed subunits, are exposed at the surface of the assembly and are freely accessible to the outside solvent; the two other peripheral sites, from the second pair of diagonally opposed subunits, face the tetramer internal space. A symmetric situation applies to the four peptides Ile418–Gln446, of which two are exposed to the outside solvent and are disordered and two face the internal space. As a result, residue Val447, at the same position as mAChE-Ala420 in subunit A in the first dimer, is separated by 17 Å from peripheral site residues Tyr336(341) and Trp281(286) at the gorge entrance of subunit C in the second dimer. The presence of a weak, loop-shaped electron density in this region between subunitsA and C suggests that, in the internal space, the peptide undergoes stabilizing interactions. The same weak density is observed between the peptide of subunit D and the peripheral site region of subunit B. Hence, in tetramer B, peptides Ile418–Gln446 of two subunits may interact with the peripheral site regions of the facing two subunits, a situation reminiscent of the recently reported intersubunit interaction of mAChE loop Cys257–Cys272, also rich in Gly residues, with the facing peripheral site region (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a result, the surface area buried at the dimer-dimer interface is larger, and the space between the two dimers is 2-fold narrower than in tetramer A. The EeAChE carboxyl-terminal T peptide, Glu571(544)–Leu610, located in the extension of helix α10, has no counterpart in the crystallized mAChE and TcAChE. Indeed, monomeric mAChE was generated as a soluble enzyme truncated after residue 548 (13Marchot P. Ravelli R.B.G. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas dimeric TcAChE was enzymatically solubilized from a dimer of AChEH subunits (41Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Varon L. Toker L. Futerman A.H. Silman I. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The T peptide, containing ∼40 residues, of which nine are hydrophobic residues conserved among cholinesterases, was predicted to be organized as one or several helical regions forming one or two four-helix bundles (9Blong R.M. Bedows E. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Giles K. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amphipathic character of the T peptide precludes its full exposition to the solvent and total disorder. In addition, in contrast to the large surface area buried at the mAChE dimer-dimer interface (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the limited surface areas buried at the dimer-dimer interfaces of the EeAChE tetramers appear insufficient for cohesion of the two dimers (42Janin J. Miller S. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 204: 155-164Crossref Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These constraints, along with the large internal space observed in each of the two tetramers, raise the questions of the positions of the four T peptides in the EeAChE structures and of their contribution to the dimer-dimer interface. In the loose tetramer A, the four carboxyl-terminal T peptides could either be buried at the center of the arrangement, as proposed based on a square planar model for association of nonamphiphilic AChE subunits (10Giles K. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), or pair off and exit on either side of the tetramer plane, as recently suggested from analysis of the compact, pseudo-square planar tetramer of crystalline mAChE (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the folded, compact tetramer B, the four T peptides could be exposed on the same side of the arrangement, roughly similar to a recent model for tetrameric human butyrylcholinesterase (9Blong R.M. Bedows E. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Either option would be expected to stabilize the four T peptides and provide the tetramer with the locking points, internal or external to the arrangement, that are required for dimer-dimer cohesion. Actually, an additional density is apparent in the EeAChE structures, which is made of a loop-shaped portion located in the extension of helix α10 in the internal space and followed by a rod-shaped portion aligning antiparallel to helix α10; the same density is found at the end of each of the four helices α10 and on either sides of each of the two four-helix bundles in tetramer A (Fig. 4). It is also found in the corresponding regions of tetramer B (not shown). The good fit of the mAChE carboxyl-terminal segment Ala544–Ala547 into the loop-shaped portion and of a theoretical 10-residue α-helix into the rod-shaped portion suggests that this density represents the T peptide amino terminus up to (about) residue Phe584. Hence, in a dimer, the amino termini of two T peptides pack against the dimer four-helix bundle, made of helices α37,8 and α10from two subunits, perhaps to form a six-helix bundle. The orientation of the T peptide amino terminus appears to dictate the exit of the rest of the T peptide out of the tetramer in the extention of the bundle, where tiny density is detected. This suggests that the disulfide set that links one dimer with the residual tail and the disulfide that forms between monomers are distal to each other, a geometry consistent with the earliest models for AChE tetramers (cf. Fig. 11 in Ref. 4Lee S.L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12292-12301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystallized EeAChE tetramers, however, some of the T peptides may be truncated carboxyl-terminal to residue Arg586 (cf. above); hence in the crystals, the residual T peptide amino-terminal parts may undergo stabilizing interactions that differ from those occurring in the physiological tetramer. Because of the current resolutions, second solutions of the two structures, alternative to tetramers A and B, might also be considered; however, the higher number of putative contacts at the dimer-dimer interfaces and striking resemblance with the subunit arrangement found in the mAChE structure (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) support tetramers A and B as the more convincing solutions. Overall, each of EeAChE tetramers A and B is consistent not only with the tetrameric arrangement of subunits of crystalline mAChE (12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) but also with tetrameric arrangements observed in situ(cf. Fig. 2c in Ref. 6Rieger F. Bon S. Massoulié J. Cartaud J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Also, a structure similar to structure A but showing a larger tilt (by ∼12°) of the two dimers in the tetramer was recently solved by Raves et al. (43Raves M.L. Giles K. Schrag J.D. Schmid M.F. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chiu W. Howard A.J. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Doctor B.P. Taylor P. Quinn D.M. Rotundo R.L. Gentry M.K. Structure and Function of Cholinesterases and Related Proteins. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 351-356Crossref Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1EEA) from a data set earlier collected on a crystal of the same space group as our form A crystals but different unit cell dimensions and grown from polyethylene glycol (16Schrag J.D. Schmid M.F. Morgan D.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chiu W. Tang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9795-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of two extreme conformational states of the EeAChE tetramer could be pH or/and temperature-dependent because the EeAChE form A crystals (as the form grown by Schrag et al. (16Schrag J.D. Schmid M.F. Morgan D.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chiu W. Tang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9795-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the mAChE crystals) were grown at pH ⩾ 8 and at 4 °C, whereas the EeAChE form B crystals were grown at pH ⩽ 6 and at 20 °C (cf. “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 12Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 16Schrag J.D. Schmid M.F. Morgan D.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chiu W. Tang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9795-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, tetramer B should undergo a significant conformational transition into a state resembling tetramer A (or the 1EEA tetramer) to accomodate four molecules of the large peripheral site ligand, fasciculin (cf. Fig. 5 in Ref. 18Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), a transition expected to reposition residues at the dimer-dimer interface because the noncovalent intersubunit and fasciculin-EeAChE interactions are likely to differ substantially in affinity (cf. 12, 13, 18, 40). In fact, equilibrium analysis of EeAChE inhibition by increasing fasciculin concentrations in pH 5.5 and pH 9.0 buffers reveals complete inhibition curves reaching, at saturating fasciculin concentrations, the residual activity of the complex (cf. 13), consistent with occupancy of the tetramer four peripheral sites by fasciculin in solutions of either pH values. 3P. Marchot, unpublished data. Conformational flexibility of the homologous 11S TcAChE species, evidenced by fluorescence polarization spectroscopy, was proposed to reflect motion of discrete segments of the tetramer molecule (segmental motion) rather than global rotation of the tetramer as a rigid macromolecule (44Berman H.A. Yguerabide J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7140-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hence, structures A and B may correspond to distinct conformational states of an EeAChE tetramer undergoing, in solution, significant flexibility about the four-helix bundle axis and along the dimer-dimer interface axis. Most importantly, the possibility for several conformations of an overall tetrameric but malleable arrangement of AChE subunits would make the tetramer able to fit either of the carboxyl-terminal sequences, differing in length and amphipathic character, which characterize the diverse AChE molecular forms. Whether this flexibility is also related to regulation of catalysis is unknown. Because the high solvent content of the crystal forms used in this study precludes achievement of a higher resolution structure, even if synchrotron radiation were used, efforts to grow crystal forms of a higher diffraction potency are underway. We thank Drs. Stéphanie Simon and Jean Massoulié (Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris) for providing us with the cDNA-encoded sequence of EeAChE prior to publication and Dr. Palmer Taylor (UCSD, La Jolla) for critical review of the manuscript and fruitful discussions."

BCR cross-linking activates three families of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and these are transducers of signaling events including phospholipase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation; however, the relative roles of PTKs in BCR-mediated Akt activation are unknown. We examined Akt activation in Lyn-, Syk- and Btk-deficient DT40 cells and B cells from Lyn−/− mice. BCR-mediated Akt activation required Syk and was partially dependent upon Btk. Increased BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation was observed in Lyn-deficient DT40 cells and Lyn−/− mice compared with wild-type cells suggesting that Lyn may negatively regulate Akt function. BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit was abolished in Syk-deficient cells consistent with a receptor-proximal role for Syk in BCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation; in contrast, it was maintained in Btk-deficient cells, suggesting Btk functions downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Calcium depletion did not influence BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation/activation, showing that neither Syk nor Btk mediates its effects via changes in calcium levels. Thus, BCR-mediated Akt stimulation is regulated by multiple non-receptor PTK families which regulate Akt both proximal and distal to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.

These include Lyn, Fyn, and Blk of the Src family PTKs, Syk of the ZAP-70/Syk family PTKs, and Btk of the Tec family PTKs. BCR ligation subsequently leads to the induction of downstream signaling events including stimulation of phospholipase C-γ2 (PLC-γ2), Ras, and at least three subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphorylation of Vav and HS-1 and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) (1Bolen J.B.

Upon BCR cross-linking, Lyn associates via its Src homology 3 (SH3) domain with PtdIns 3-kinase, albeit a small percentage of total cellular PtdIns 3-kinase. This interaction may augment lipid kinase activity at least in vitro (12Yamanashi Y. Fukui Y. Wongsasant B. Kinoshita Y. Ichimori Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, both Syk and the PtdIns 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit have been shown to associate upon BCR cross-linking with the adaptor c-Cbl (14Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Miyake S.

However, whether Syk is necessary for PtdIns 3-kinase activation remains unclear. Akt is a protein serine/threonine kinase that can be activated by ligand binding to a diverse range of cell-surface receptors including the BCR (15Downward J. Curr. Opin.

According to one model, binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PtdIns(3,4)P2to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt causes a proportion of Akt to translocate to the plasma membrane, whereupon it undergoes conformational changes and is subsequently phosphorylated on Thr308 and Ser473 by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase-1 and integrin-linked kinase/PtdIns(3, 4, 5)P3-dependent kinase-2, respectively, in a PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent manner (24Alessi D.R.

While BCR engagement has also been recently reported to activate Akt in a PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent manner (16Aman M.J. Lamkin T.D. Okada H. Kurosaki T. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol.

Supernatants were aspirated and cell pellets washed once with 1 ml of PBS prior to lysis with 200 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm E-64, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Following incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysed cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were denatured by boiling with an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose in non-SDS-containing transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.5). Western blotting was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions except that the primary anti-phosphoAkt and anti-Akt antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1500–1:2000. 20 × 106 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium for 5 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with 10 μg/ml anti-IgM (M4) mAb for the indicated times at 37 °C. For experiments involving either wortmannin or LY294002, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors prior to the addition of anti-IgM. After stimulation, incubations were terminated on ice by dilution with 10 volumes of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were aspirated and cells lysed by resuspension in 0.5 ml of Akt lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm microcystin). After incubation on ice for 15 min, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. Packed protein G-Sepharose beads (10 μl) were subsequently added to lysates, which had previously been incubated for at least 30 min with 4 μg of sheep anti-rat polyclonal Akt antibody and also washed twice with 0.5 ml of Akt lysis buffer to remove unbound anti-Akt antibody. After constant mixing by inversion overnight at 4 °C, immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of Akt lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5m NaCl and twice each with (i) 1 ml of Akt wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% (w/v) Brij-96, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and (ii) 1 ml of Akt assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Beads were resuspended to a volume of 45 μl in Akt assay buffer supplemented with 2 μg of PKI and 2.5 μg of histone (H2B) exogenous substrate and reactions initiated by the addition of 10 μl of [γ-32P]MgATP solution (75 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Kinase reactions were performed for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 55 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer and subsequent boiling for 5 min. Following brief centrifugation, samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the upper portion of the gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt antibody to detect immunoprecipitated Akt. The lower portion of the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to visualize H2B, destained and dried prior to autoradiography at −70 °C for various times. Alternatively, in vitro kinase assays were performed using 30 μm Akt substrate heptapeptide (RPRAATF). Following incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, reactions were briefly centrifuged and half of the supernatant was spotted onto phosphocellulose paper (2.5 × 2.5 cm; Whatman P81). After washing papers 3–4 times with 0.75% (v/v) phosphoric acid for 10 min per wash, followed by one wash with acetone, papers were dried and 32P incorporation into the peptide was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The remaining portion of the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, in order to assess the recovery of Akt in immunoprecipitates, as described above. 10 × 106cells were resuspended in 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium for 5 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with 10 μg/ml anti-IgM (M4) mAb for the indicated times at 37 °C. Following anti-IgM treatment, incubations were terminated on ice by dilution with 10 volumes of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were aspirated, washed again with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and cells lysed by resuspension in 0.5 ml of PtdIns 3-kinase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1%(w/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Following incubation on ice for 15 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and 3 μg of anti-PtdIns 3-kinase p85 antibody was added. After mixing samples overnight at 4 °C by constant inversion, immune complexes were captured by mixing the samples for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold PtdIns 3-kinase lysis buffer and bound proteins eluted and denatured by boiling for 5 min with 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with TBST containing 5% (w/v) BSA, and subjected to immunoblotting using either 0.25 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) mAb or 0.5 μg/ml anti-PtdIns 3-kinase p85 antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using both murine WEHI-231 and chicken DT40 B cells, we tested whether BCR engagement resulted in Akt activation. Murine WEHI-231 cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-mouse IgM while chicken DT40 cells were treated with mouse anti-chicken IgM or mouse Ig as a control stimulus. BCR engagement rapidly and strongly increased Akt activity in both B cell lines with a maximal 6–7-fold activation observed after 5–10 min (Fig.1, A and B), under conditions where equivalent amounts of Akt were immunoprecipitated in each sample. Treatment of DT40 cells with mouse Ig as a negative control increased Akt activity less than 2-fold (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the increase in Akt activity following BCR stimulation corresponded with Akt phosphorylation on serine 473 in both mouse WEHI-231 (Fig. 1 C) and chicken DT40 B cells (Fig.3 B) as detected by immunoblotting using a phospho-specific serine 473 anti-Akt antibody. However, at extended times of stimulation with anti-IgM, the magnitude of BCR-mediated Akt activation decreased while phosphorylation on serine 473 was maintained.Figure 3BCR-induced Akt activation requires Syk and Btk . A, wild-type or various PTK-deficient DT40 cells (20 × 106/sample) were stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-IgM (M4) mAb for the indicated times. Akt was immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100 cell lysates and its activity determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1 A (upper panel). Theupper portion of the gel was excised, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and the quantity of immunoprecipitated Akt determined by Western blotting using anti-Akt (lower panel).B, wild-type or various PTK-deficient DT40 cells were treated as described in A for 0–90 min. Total cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphoserine 473-specific Akt (upper panel) or anti-Akt (lower panel) Abs.C and D, wild-type or various PTK-deficient DT40 cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-IgM (M4) mAb for 0–30 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) mAb (C) or anti-Btk mAb (D). In panel C,arrows indicate the positions of prominent anti-IgM-inducible tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins which were reduced in Lyn-deficient compared with wild-type cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the activation of Akt in response to growth factors (including platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and nerve growth factor), cytokines (interleukin-3, interleukin-4, stem cell factor, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and insulin depends upon PtdIns 3-kinase activity (15Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 29Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we tested whether BCR-mediated Akt activation was also downstream of PtdIns 3-kinase using two potent pharmacological and structurally different PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002 (30Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 31Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

Preincubation of either DT40 or WEHI-231 cells with wortmannin or LY294002, respectively, prior to treatment with anti-IgM blocked BCR-induced Akt stimulation and serine 473 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2, A and B). These results show that BCR engagement activates Akt in a PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent fashion. BCR cross-linking has been reported to induce association between the Src family PTK member Lyn and a proportion of the cellular PtdIns 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit (12Yamanashi Y. Fukui Y. Wongsasant B. Kinoshita Y. Ichimori Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As BCR-induced Akt stimulation is PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent (Fig. 2), we tested whether Lyn was required for Akt activation in response to BCR engagement. In addition, we also examined whether other BCR signaling effectors such as the ZAP-70/Syk PTK family member Syk and the Tec PTK family member Btk were required for BCR-mediated Akt activation. We compared BCR-induced Akt stimulation in chicken DT40 wild-type and mutant cells deficient in Lyn, Syk, and Btk that expressed comparable levels of surface IgM (5Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 6Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, BCR-mediated Akt activation in Lyn-deficient B cells was similar to anti-IgM-induced stimulation of Akt in wild-type B cells, with maximal activation after 7.5 min (Fig.3 A). In contrast, anti-IgM-mediated Akt activation was completely abolished in Syk-deficient cells and strongly reduced in Btk-deficient chicken B cells (Fig. 3 A), indicating that both Syk and Btk were required for BCR-induced Akt stimulation. No significant differences in endogenous Akt protein expression levels were observed between the parental and various PTK-deficient DT40 B cell lines (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Moreover, similar recoveries of Akt were observed in immunoprecipitates isolated from wild-type and various PTK-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Since stimulus-induced Akt activation requires phosphorylation on both Thr308 and Ser473 (24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), we also measured Akt activation indirectly by analyzing Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 using immunoblotting and a phospho-specific Ser473 anti-Akt antibody. Similar to Akt in vitro kinase assays, anti-IgM treatment induced a strong and rapid increase in Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 in chicken DT40 cells (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). Consistent with our in vitro kinase data, anti-IgM-mediated Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 was completely abolished in Syk-deficient cells and strongly reduced in Btk-deficient cells (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), while comparable amounts of Akt protein were detected in parental and various PTK-deficient cells (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Interestingly, BCR-mediated Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 was moderately but consistently enhanced in Lyn-deficient cells relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), suggesting that Lyn performs a negative role in regulating BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation on Ser473. In contrast, the profiles of anti-IgM-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in parental and Lyn-deficient DT40 cells were markedly different: major inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of approximately 55 and 70–75 kDa were strongly reduced in Lyn-deficient cells (Fig. 3 C), showing that the absence of Lyn expression in these cells has profound effects on BCR-mediated signaling. The reduced ability to activate Akt following anti-IgM treatment in Btk-deficient cells was not due to a general defect in signaling in these cells, since there were no obvious differences in the patterns of inducible protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Btk-deficient compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3 C). The absence of Btk expression in Btk-deficient cells compared with parental cells and other PTK-deficient DT40 cells was also confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3 D). We also compared Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 following BCR engagement in splenic B cells from wild-type and Lyn−/− young mice. Anti-IgM-induced Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 in B cells from Lyn−/− mice was consistently increased relative to wild-type mice (Fig.4 A, upper panel). The protein expression levels of Akt in B cells from Lyn−/− mice did not differ from those in wild-type mice (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). In addition, we also compared BCR-mediated Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 in wild-type and Lyn-deficient chicken DT40 cells using a phospho-specific antibody. Anti-IgM-mediated Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 was"

Using an inducible system we have previously shown that tTG associates with the extracellular matrix deposited by stably transfected 3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the enzyme. We now show by confocal microscopy that tTG colocalizes with pericellular fibronectin in these cells, and by immunogold electron microscopy that the two proteins are found in clusters at the cell surface. Expression vectors encoding the full-length tTG or a N-terminal truncated tTG lacking the proposed fibronectin-binding site (fused to the bacterial reporter enzyme beta-galactosidase) were generated to characterize the role of fibronectin in sequestration of tTG in the pericellular matrix. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay style procedures using extracts of transiently transfected COS-7 cells and immobilized fibronectin showed that the truncation abolished fibronectin binding. Similarly, the association of tTG with the pericellular matrix of cells in suspension or with the extracellular matrix deposited by cell monolayers was prevented by the truncation. These results demonstrate that tTG binds to the pericellular fibronectin coat of cells via its N-terminal beta-sandwich domain and that this interaction is crucial for cell surface association of tTG."

The chaperone activity of Hsp70, with its cochaperone DnaJ (Hsp40 in eukaryotes), involves an ATP-controlled cycle of polypeptide binding and release in which a newly synthesized or translocated polypeptide is promoted to the correct folding by preventing aggregation and misfolding. DnaJ plays a key catalyst role in the chaperone reaction by stimulating the ATPase activity and activating the substrate binding of Hsp70 (3Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M.

Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The kinetics of polypeptide binding and release of Hsp70 are closely coupled to the Hsp70 ATPase cycle by communication between the ATPase domain and the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 (5Schmid D.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16749-16756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding of ATP to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 induces a conformational change in the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 that results in an increase in the on/off rate for a substrate polypeptide and a low binding affinity (5Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Subsequent DnaJ-stimulated ATP-hydrolysis involves a further conformational change and conversion of Hsp70 to an ADP form that has a slow on/off rate and relatively high binding affinity for a substrate polypeptide (5Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, sequential conformational changes of DnaK during the chaperone cycle play an important role in the regulated activity of DnaK. Previous biochemical studies from partial proteolysis, intrinsic fluorescence, and small-angle x-ray scattering provide evidence that the binding of ATP to the ATPase domain of DnaK induces a subtle conformational change in the ATPase domain followed by a marked conformational change in the substrate binding domain (8Buchberger A.

However, it is still unclear how the conformational changes of Hsp70 affect DnaJ action. All DnaJ family members have a J-domain and may also have various combinations of additional conserved and nonconserved regions. E. coli DnaJ consists of two major functional regions. The N-terminal J-domain is primarily responsible for the interaction with DnaK, and the COOH-terminal part containing Gly/Phe-rich, cysteine-rich and less conserved last COOH-terminal regions is involved in the substrate binding (11Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Szabo A. Korzun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The binding of DnaJ to DnaK is dependent on the ATP binding state of DnaK (13Wawrzynów A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, both genetic and biochemical studies have provided evidence that a conserved tripeptide, His-Pro-Asp, located in the loop between helices II and III of a J-domain, binds in the lower cleft of the DnaK ATPase domain, and some other region of DnaJ binds at or near the DnaK substrate binding site (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Gassler C.S. Buchberger A. Valencia A. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15229-15234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). NMR studies using 15N-labeled J-domain also demonstrated that the conserved tripeptide and the residues located in the outer surface of helix II interact with DnaK ATPase domain (16Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, other results indicated that the J-domain alone is not sufficient to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by DnaK (11Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). J-domain stimulation requires the presence of a DnaK substrate as well (18Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that some region of DnaJ interacts with the substrate binding pocket of DnaK, and we have presented evidence that this is the case (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, the region of DnaJ that interacts with the DnaK substrate binding domain and its functional role remains unclear. Because the binding of DnaK to DnaJ is an ATP-dependent process that involves a conformational change of DnaK, this bipartite interaction may control ATP hydrolysis and stabilization of the DnaK-polypeptide complex. To explore the importance of the conformational changes in DnaK and the bipartite interaction for binding to DnaJ, we analyzed the binding of DnaK point mutants and a series of truncated DnaK polypeptides to DnaJ. We also examined the binding of a series of truncated DnaJ polypeptides and point mutants to DnaK. Our data show that the binding of ATP, subsequent conformational changes in DnaK, and DnaJ-stimulated ATP hydrolysis are all required for the formation of a DnaK-DnaJ complex as monitored by Biacore analysis. In addition, our data imply that the interaction of the J-domain with DnaK depends on the substrate binding state of DnaK. Nucleotides, ATP, ADP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Because ADP was contaminated with ATP, ADP was further purified on a HEMA-IEC BIO 1000Q 10U column (Alltech Associates Inc.). DnaJ2–75 protein was generously provided by S. J. Landry (Tulane University). Wild-type or mutant DnaK proteins, T199A and D201N, were expressed and purified as described previously (19Kamath-Loeb A.S. Lu C.Z. Suh W.-C. Lonetto M.A. Gross C.A. J.

Cells carrying a plasmid encoding each recombinant protein were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium with ampicillin, harvested 4 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-D thiogalactopyranoside, and lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a cell disruption bomb. The lysate was centrifuged at 37,000 ×g for 30 min, and the proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography (Qiagen, Inc.) as described in Qiagen protocol. Proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, supplemented with 50–300 mm imidazole by a stepwise gradient, and the eluent was dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and correlated to concentration with bovine serum albumin standard. To generate the fusion protein of DnaJ-Bccp for the Biacore experiment, a polymerase chain reaction-generateddnaJ fragment with 3′- and 5′-primers introducingNcoI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, was cloned into the NcoI/BamHI sites of the pET15b. A polymerase chain reaction-generated bccp gene, encoding the carboxyl-terminal 85 amino acids that is sufficient to allow biotinylation of fusion protein (20Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Plasmids encoding DnaJ76- (pWCS46) or DnaJ108-Bccp (pWCS47) fusion proteins were constructed as described above, except for using a different 3′-primer corresponding to each DNA sequence. The three DnaJ mutations, K62A, R63A, and KR62,63AA were obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (21Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar); fusion proteins of K62A,R63A or K62A,R63A with Bccp were constructed by swapping the polymerase chain reaction-generated NcoI-DraIII mutant fragment for the wild-type fragment of pWCS14 to generate pWCS68, -69, and -70, respectively. The sequences of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing. The plasmid-encoded DnaJ-Bccp fusion protein was biotinylated in E. coli. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed with a Biacore biosensor system (Biacore, Inc.) essentially as described previously (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For study of the DnaK-DnaJ interaction, the biotinylated DnaJ-Bccp fusion protein was coupled to streptavidin immobilized on the sensor surface via standardN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide activation chemistry. A 40 μl-solution of the streptavidin (100 μg/ml) in immobilization buffer (10 mm NaOAc, pH 4.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) was injected on the sensor surface activated byN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide reagents, and then ethanolamine was added to inactivate the unreactedN-hydroxysuccinimide groups. The biotinylated DnaJ-Bccp fusion protein (as crude cell-free extract) was injected to 1,000–1,500 response units, corresponding to approximately 1.0–1.5 ng/mm2, over the streptavidin-immobilized sensor surface. Any nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by 20 μl of 2m NaCl at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After pre-incubating DnaK protein in buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA) with 1 mm ATP at 25 °C for 5 min, 15–20 μl of the DnaK sample solution was injected over immobilized wild-type or mutant DnaJ at a flow rate of 3–4 μl/min, followed by injection of the running buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.003% surfactant P-20). As a control for nonspecific binding, a DnaK sample solution was injected over the flow-cell without the immobilized DnaJ protein, and each control signal was subtracted to correct for a nonspecific binding. To estimate the apparent association (k a) and dissociation (k d) rate constants, we used linear transformation of the biosensor curves. The primary data were analyzed using the BIA evaluation 2.1 software (Biacore, Inc.). The model assumes that the DnaK-DnaJ interaction is pseudo first order. With this assumption the binding rate equation is dR/dt =k a CR max − (k a C +k d)R, where R is the signal response, R max is maximum response level, andC is molar concentration of DnaK. The plot ofdR/dt versus R should be linear with a slope of k s (=k a C + k d). Titration with a series of different concentrations of DnaK (0.25–1 μm) was performed to determine k a(from the slope) and k d (from the intercept) by plotting k s (= slope of the plot ofdR/dt versus R) against DnaK concentration. The k s values were obtained by selecting the region that was linear with respect to the plot ofdR/dt versus R. A Biacore assay, which is based on surface plasmon resonance, was used to monitor the protein-protein interactions between DnaJ and DnaK in real time. Surface plasmon resonance detects molecular interactions, because there is a corresponding change in refractive index when a macromolecule in solution binds to a macromolecule immobilized on the sensor chip. Most of our experiments used a DnaJ derivative fused to Bccp at its COOH terminus. This fusion protein supports cell growth of a strain lacking DnaJ, indicating that DnaJ functions are intact in DnaJ-Bccp (data not shown), and permits DnaJ-Bccp to be immobilized via interactions between the biotin group in Bccp and streptavidin coupled to the sensor chip. This coupling avoids the heterogeneity created by directly covalent coupling of proteins to the matrix. The high affinity (K D = 10−15m) of the biotin-streptavidin interaction means that there is no significant dissociation of DnaJ during the course of repeated binding experiments. Consistent with previous results using other assays (13Wawrzynów A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), only the ATP-bound form of DnaK binds to DnaJ immobilized on the sensor chip; the nucleotide-free, ADP-bound, or nonhydrolyzable ATP-bound form of DnaK exhibited no detectable binding (Fig.1 A). Additional validation for this assay comes from our previous results (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) showing that mutants of DnaJ known to be defective in binding to DnaK in other assays also fail to exhibit binding in this Biacore assay, and a mutant DnaK that restored in vivo function to a binding-defective DnaJ variant exhibits binding in this Biacore assay. The apparent k a and k d values were determined from linear regression analysis (by plottingk s (slope of the plot of dR/dt versus R during the association phase) against DnaK concentration) (see “Experimental Procedures”) are 1.47 × 104m−1 s−1 and 8.0 × 10−3 s−1, respectively (Fig. 1,B and C). This gives an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D =k d/k a) of 544 nm. We previously used a nonlinear least square analysis, which gave a similark a value (= 2.3 × 104m−1 s−1) (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, thek d (= 1.6 × 10−3s−1) obtained from linear regression analysis (ln(R/R 0) =k d t) of the first 60 data points used previously is 5-fold slower than the k d obtained from a secondary plot of k s against [DnaK] (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As we described recently (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the residual plots for fitting the DnaK-DnaJ binding curves indicated that the curves fit better to a double exponential than to a single exponential, but the rate constants determined by fitting to a double exponential were irreproducible. The difference in the apparent k d values determined by the two methods is likely to result from the usage of different data-subsets from association and dissociation phases, respectively. In view of these problems, we consider this assay simply as a semi-quantitative tool to monitor interaction. Both partial proteolysis and intrinsic fluorescence studies have shown that the conformation of DnaK is altered upon ATP binding, raising the possibility that these conformational changes were also required for DnaK to interact with DnaJ. To address this, we examined the binding of DnaJ to the well characterized DnaK mutant, D201N, which is specifically defective in transmitting the normal conformational change from the active center of the ATPase domain to the substrate domain upon binding ATP as judged by partial proteolysis studies (19Kamath-Loeb A.S. Lu C.Z. Suh W.-C. Lonetto M.A. Gross C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30051-30059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This DnaK mutant is proficient at ATP binding and hydrolysis (19Kamath-Loeb A.S. Lu C.Z. Suh W.-C. Lonetto M.A. Gross C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30051-30059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and a comparable mutation in the ATPase fragment of Hsc70 has very little effect on the ADP-bound structure of the N-terminal ATPase domain (22Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biacore experiments revealed that D201N is defective in binding to DnaJ (Fig.2 A), indicating that the conformational changes lacking in the mutant are required for productive binding. The lack of DnaK-DnaJ interaction in the presence of ATP analogs, ATPγS or AMP-PNP (Fig. 1 A), raised the possibility that ATP hydrolysis may be required to form the stable DnaK-DnaJ complex, which is monitored in the Biacore analysis. However, these data could be explained by the alternative hypothesis that the nonhydrolyzable analogs induced the ADP-dependent rather than ATP-dependent conformation of DnaK, which prevented DnaJ binding (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further examine this point, we asked whether the DnaK mutant T199A, which binds ATP and undergoes the same ATP-induced conformation changes as wild-type DnaK but is specifically defective in hydrolyzing ATP (23McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), can bind DnaJ. We found that T199A exhibited essentially no binding to DnaJ in our conditions (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for stable interaction between DnaK and DnaJ with the following caveat. Because the conformational change in DnaK has been monitored only crudely, it remains possible that the binding defect of the mutant results from a slightly altered conformational change. As a second method to examine the hydrolysis requirement, we used results of a recent crystallographic analysis (24Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) of the nucleotide binding site in the ATPase domain of Hsc70, which revealed that two K+ and one Mg2+ are coordinated with ADP and Pi. Functionally, the K+ ions are important for efficient ATP hydrolysis (25O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Feilfel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When K+ is replaced with Na+, the steady-state ATPase rates of Hsc70 and DnaK decrease 10- and 3-fold, respectively. We therefore compared the binding of K+ DnaK and Na+ DnaK with DnaJ in the presence of ATP. As predicted if hydrolysis were important, the Na+-bound form of DnaK is defective in binding to DnaJ relative to the K+-bound form (Fig. 2 B). The peptide-induced stimulation of the DnaK ATPase activity exhibits an even greater dependence on K+ than the basal ATPase, showing an 8-fold preference for K+ over Na+(26Feilfel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the view of this observation, the K+ requirement for DnaJ to bind to DnaK may also result from the necessity for interdomain communication. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that formation of the DnaJ-DnaK complex monitored in the Biacore is dependent on ATP hydrolysis as well as the ATP-induced conformational change and interdomain communication. Therefore, the DnaK-DnaJ binding curve shown in the sensorgram seems to result from the formation of DnaJ-DnaK-ADP complex that is triggered when DnaJ binds to DnaK-ATP. Genetic and biochemical results have provided evidence that DnaJ interacts with at least two distinct sites on DnaK, the lower cleft of the ATPase domain (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Gassler C.S. Buchberger A. Valencia A. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15229-15234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and at or near the DnaK substrate binding site (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These results, in conjunction with the requirement of ATP-induced conformational changes for binding of DnaJ to DnaK, raised the possibility that both the ATPase domain and the substrate binding domain are required for binding to DnaJ. Consistent with this expectation, DnaK variants with only the N-terminal ATPase domain or the COOH-terminal substrate binding domain exhibited no binding to DnaJ even at a high concentration (40 μm) of each protein (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results have been obtained by Gassler et al.(15Gassler C.S. Buchberger A. Valencia A. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15229-15234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition to these two domains, a conserved EEVD motif of the human Hsp70 homolog located in the last 10-kDa COOH-terminal region is important for both the interdomain regulation of Hsp70 function and intermolecular interaction with the DnaJ homolog HDJ-1 (28Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The EEVD motif of the eukaryotic Hsp70s corresponds to a conserved EEV motif in bacteria. The finding that a DnaK variant lacking the COOH-terminal 94 amino acids showed very poor binding of DnaKc94 to DnaJ by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (13Wawrzynów A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) supported this idea. Thus, we further examined whether the last 10-kDa COOH-terminal region, including the EEV motif, is important for interaction with DnaJ. Two deletion mutants, DnaK1–628 (lacking the EEV motif) and DnaK1–538(lacking the last 10 kDa of the protein) were each examined for binding to DnaJ. Both mutant proteins are capable of binding to DnaJ. DnaK1–628 showed a binding affinity similar to the full-length of DnaK; that of DnaK1–538 is slightly less (Fig. 3 B). These in vitro binding results correlate with the in vivo phenotypes of DnaK1–628 and DnaK1–538. Both DnaK(1–628) and DnaK(1–538) support cell growth at 43 °C and growth of bacteriophage λ in cells mutant for dnaK (Fig.3 A). We conclude that the last 10-kDa region including the EEV motif is not required for interaction of DnaK with DnaJ. Previous studies (11Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the minimal unit of DnaJ that stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK includes both the J-domain and some other portion of DnaJ. Because ATP hydrolysis is required for the binding monitored by the Biacore, the DnaJ domain alone should be unable to bind to DnaK. To test this, we constructed two partial DnaJ proteins, one with the first 76 amino acids of DnaJ (DnaJ76) and a second with the first 108 amino acids of DnaJ (DnaJ108), fused each to Bccp, and then examined binding between immobilized DnaJ deletion mutants and DnaK. The binding affinity of DnaJ108-Bccp to DnaK in the presence of ATP is comparable to that of full-length DnaJ, whereas DnaJ76-Bccp binds with somewhat lower affinity (Fig.4 A). The binding of DnaJ76-Bccp is specific, because it does not bind to DnaK R167A, which interferes with the interaction between DnaJ and the N terminus of DnaK (data not shown). One possible explanation for the unexpected binding of DnaJ76-Bccp to DnaK is that the Bccp moiety substitutes for some other portion of DnaJ. We therefore tested the ability of DnaK to bind to immobilized DnaJ76 tagged with six histidines at its COOH terminus (DnaJ76–6His) and to immobilized DnaJ75 without any tag. DnaJ76–6His exhibited weak binding to DnaK, whereas the J75 J-domain fragment without a tag failed to bind DnaK (Fig. 4 A). Together these experiments support the idea that the J-domain alone neither stimulates ATP hydrolysis nor binds to DnaK in the reaction detected in the Biacore. The QKRAA motif is conserved among J-domains. Recently, Auger and Roudier (29Auger I. Roudier J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1818-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that a peptide carrying this motif specifically binds to DnaK and competitively prevents binding of bona fide DnaK substrates or DnaJ protein to DnaK. These results suggest that this motif may interact with the DnaK in the substrate binding domain. We therefore tested the alanine substitution mutants double K62A,R63A and the single alanine substitution mutants K62A and R63A for binding to DnaK. Each single mutant exhibited slightly decreased binding to DnaK, and the double mutant exhibited a greater decrease in DnaK binding (Fig. 4 B). These results support the idea that the QKRAA motif is involved in the interaction with DnaK. However, its effect on binding is relatively minor. This study uses the Biacore to analyze the requirements for interaction between DnaK and DnaJ. We found that interaction required both the ATPase and substrate binding domains of DnaK but not the last 10 kDa of the protein. DnaK must bind ATP, undergo the conformational changes in DnaK that communicate ATP binding to the substrate domain, and finally, hydrolyze ATP before binding to DnaJ is detected. The native J-domain was unable to bind to DnaK, but variants of it with either a hexahistidine tag or a Bccp fusion protein did so to varying extents. Finally, we have identified QKRAA, a conserved region in the J-domain, as important in binding to DnaK. Enhanced ATP hydrolysis is a consequence of interaction of DnaK with DnaJ (3Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The fact that hydrolysis was required to detect the interaction between DnaK and DnaJ in the Biacore indicated that we were monitoring a step subsequent to the initial interaction between the two proteins. Using a genetic approach, we had previously obtained evidence for two different binding interactions between DnaK and DnaJ, one between the lower cleft in the ATPase domain of DnaK and an invariant triad in the DnaJ domain and a second between the substrate binding domain of DnaK and an unidentified portion of DnaJ (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Presumably, these individual interactions are too weak to be detected in our conditions. Indeed, a recent NMR study using 15N-labeled J-domain demonstrated that the J-domain interacts with the N-terminal ATPase fragment of DnaK (16Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, the observed binding was obtained with very high concentrations of the J-domain and would not have been seen in our conditions. It has been unclear which portion of DnaJ binds at or near the substrate binding domain, which is required for DnaJ to promote ATP hydrolysis (11Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Whereas the conserved J-domain in Sec63 can bind to the substrate binding domain and enhance ATP hydrolysis of its partner protein BIP (4Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the native J-domain of DnaJ does not (18Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, addition of the adjacent Gly/Phe region of DnaJ, a COOH-terminal hexa-histidine tag or a fused Bccp protein restores both activities. We consider two possible explanations for this. First, the J-domain of DnaJ may not contain the determinants for binding to the substrate binding domain. In this case, the additional COOH-terminal amino acids may occupy the substrate binding domain of DnaK and stimulate the binding reaction. Although Bccp alone is not a substrate for DnaK, Misselwitz et al. (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the J-domain of Sec63 broadens the substrate range of BIP. This same factor could permit the Gly/Phe region, a hexa-histidine tag, or Bccp itself to act as substrates to complete the binding reaction. Alternatively, the J-domain, similar to Sec63, may contain such binding determinants but not be in native conformation in the J fragment alone. Addition of COOH-terminal capping amino acids may be necessary to restore proper folding and permit interaction. If the latter explanation were true, the conserved QKRAA motif is a strong candidate for being a portion of the interacting segment, because Auger and Roudier (29Auger I. Roudier J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1818-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that a peptide from the J-domain carrying this motif competed well with all substrate peptides tested for binding to DnaK. We have shown here that the double mutant QAAAA is defective in binding to DnaK. Taken together, it is plausible to consider the possibility that this region of the J-domain interacts with the substrate binding site of DnaK. DnaK substrates with a hydrophobic patch of 4–5 residues and flanked by positively charged amino acids such as Arg or Lys bind preferentially to DnaK (30Rüdiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The positively charged residues of a substrate peptide seem to interact electrostatically with the negatively charged residues located at the flanking region of the substrate binding pocket. This role could be fulfilled by the Lys-62 and Arg-63 residues in the QKRAA motif. The finding that DnaJ interacts with the substrate binding domain presents a problem in the actual biological reaction in which substrate is present. There are two issues. First, if DnaJ itself binds to the substrate binding domain, how will authentic substrate binding be facilitated? Second, how are substrates bound to DnaJ targeted to DnaK? Several answers have been proposed, starting with Karzai and McMacken (18Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), who provided the first evidence that activating the DnaK ATPase requires a bipartite signal involving both binding of substrate and binding of the J-domain. Their suggestion was that DnaJ binding to the substrate binding domain was weak and dissociated before that of the J-domain, allowing DnaJ bound substrates to be transferred to DnaK. More recently Misselwitz et al. (14Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) suggested that interaction of J-domain with either the N-terminal ATPase domain or substrate binding domain of BIP creates a transient open state in BIP for the peptide brought in by DnaJ or associated proteins to bind. Finally Bukau and co-workers (27Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that under conditions optimal for folding, a protein substrate in addition to DnaJ is required for ATP hydrolysis and that DnaJ cross-links to the substrate binding domain only in the absence of substrate. Based upon this and other experiments, they argue that the interaction of DnaJ with the substrate binding domain that promotes ATP hydrolysis is an artifact that occurs only at the high DnaJ concentrations used inin vitro binding reactions. Their evidence that the end point interaction monitored in the Biacore is an artifact is compelling. However, we strongly suspect that transient interactions between DnaJ and the substrate binding domain occur during the course of the reaction, based upon the characteristics of the QKRAA motif. Auger and Roudier (29Auger I. Roudier J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1818-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) identified QKRAA, because this motif carries susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis when expressed on HLA-DRB1. Further studies led them to show that this motif was present in DnaJ and that a QKRAA-containing peptide from DnaJ not only competes all peptide binding to DnaK but also prevents DnaJ binding to DnaK. We have shown that mutating the KR residues decreases DnaJ binding to DnaK. Taken together, we believe that this suggests that the QKRAA region of the J-domain plays a role in the binding cycle, most likely by transiently interacting with the substrate binding domain. We suggest that DnaJ has two different modes of interacting with DnaK, depending on the situation (Fig. 5). First, DnaJ can interact with a DnaK-substrate complex. Here, conformational changes resulting from binding substrate would facilitate binding to the cleft in the ATPase domain; consequent ATP hydrolysis strengthens the interaction of DnaK with these pre-bound substrates. Second, DnaJ targets substrates to DnaK. Here, the substrate binding site of DnaK would be empty, permitting initial interaction of DnaJ with the substrate binding site of DnaK. This interaction would facilitate the subsequent interaction between the conserved tripeptide in the J-domain and the lower cleft of the ATPase domain; a subsequent conformational change could promote dissociation of DnaJ from the substrate binding domain, allowing the substrate bound to DnaJ to be transferred to DnaK. Only when no substrate peptide is present would DnaJ rebind at the substrate binding site. We thank Dr. S. Landry for DnaJ2–75, Dr. G. Walker for the T199A clone, Dr. B. Bukau for communicating unpublished information, and Dr. M. P. Mayer and E. A. Craig for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2095721204,"We report the discovery and initial characterization of the T-superfamily of conotoxins. Eight different T-superfamily peptides from five Conusspecies were identified; they share a consensus signal sequence, and a conserved arrangement of cysteine residues (- -CC- -CC-). T-superfamily peptides were found expressed in venom ducts of all major feeding types of Conus; the results suggest that the T-superfamily will be a large and diverse group of peptides, widely distributed in the 500 different Conusspecies. These peptides are likely to be functionally diverse; although the peptides are small (11–17 amino acids), their sequences are strikingly divergent, with different peptides of the superfamily exhibiting varying extents of post-translational modification. Of the three peptides tested for in vivo biological activity, only one was active on mice but all three had effects on fish. The peptides that have been extensively characterized are as follows: p5a, GCCPKQMRCCTL*; tx5a, γCCγDGW+CCT§AAO; and au5a, FCCPFIRYCCW (where γ = γ-carboxyglutamate, W+ = bromotryptophan, O = hydroxyproline, T§ = glycosylated threonine, and * = COOH-terminal amidation). We also demonstrate that the precursor of tx5a contains a functional γ-carboxylation recognition signal in the −1 to −20 propeptide region, consistent with the presence of γ-carboxyglutamate residues in this peptide. We report the discovery and initial characterization of the T-superfamily of conotoxins.

Cone snails (genus Conus) are perhaps the most successful genus of marine invertebrates, with over 500 species, all of which are venomous (1Kohn A.J. Saunders P.R. Wiener S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Verlag Christa Hemmen, Wiesbaden, Germany1995Google Scholar). These predatory marine snails have evolved a highly sophisticated neuropharmacological strategy based on small peptides (10–35 amino acids) in their venoms (3Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Zeikus R.

MostConus peptides potently affect ion channel function; these are widely used pharmacological reagents in neuroscience, and several are being directly developed as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. MostConus peptides are highly disulfide-rich; generically,Conus peptides with multiple disulfide cross-links have been referred to as conotoxins. It has become apparent in recent years that there are tens of thousands of different conotoxins in Conusvenoms. Because of the remarkably rapid interspecific divergence of peptide sequences, each Conus species has its own distinct repertoire of between 50 and 200 different venom peptides (5Olivera B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).A major simplification in understanding this complex array ofConus venom peptides is that most of the ∼50,000 different molecular forms can be grouped into just a few superfamilies. Peptides in the same superfamily share both a conserved pattern of disulfide connectivity and a highly conserved signal sequence (when prepropeptide precursor sequences of the peptides are compared) (5Olivera B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6Olivera B.M. Walker C. Cartier G.E. Hooper D. Santos A.D. Schoenfeld R. Shetty R. Watkins M. Bandyopadhyay P. Hillyard D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 870: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Three large superfamilies of conotoxins are well characterized: the O-superfamily, comprising several distinct pharmacological families including the ω-, κ-, δ-, and μO-conotoxins (7Shon K.-J. Stocker M. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Jacobsen R. Walker C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); the A-superfamily, to which the α-conotoxins belong (8McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); and the M-superfamily, to which the μ-conotoxins belong. In this paper, we describe the T-superfamily, a previously uncharacterized group of Conus peptides that exhibit a novel disulfide pattern and share a conserved signal sequence.The data presented in this report suggest that T-superfamily peptides are a major group of Conus peptides, and that considerable diversity will exist within the superfamily. Eight members of the T-superfamily have been identified in the venom ducts of four different cone snails, including fish-hunting, snail-hunting, and worm-huntingConus. Although the molecular targets of T-superfamily peptides have not yet been identified, this report provides a clear roadmap for a systematic exploration of this diverse, yet coherent, group that may encompass ∼1,000 distinct pharmacologically active peptides.MATERIALS AND METHODSExtraction and Fractionation of Crude VenomThe venom ofConus purpurascens was obtained by milking specimens maintained in aquaria as described previously (9Hopkins C. Grilley M. Miller C. Shon K.-J. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Dykert J. Rivier J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22361-22367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The collection from ∼90 milkings (∼0.5 ml) was diluted with 50 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (buffer A) then fractionated on a Vydac C18 preparative column (22 mm × 25 cm, 15-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, 20 ml/min flow rate). Venom components were eluted by a gradient with limiting buffers consisting of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 60% acetonitrile (CH3CN) in 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B60) or 90% acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B90). The absorbance at 220 nm was monitored, and fractions were collected at 30-s intervals.Lyophilized Conus aulicus venom (550 mg) obtained from the Philippines was extracted with 40 ml of 40% CH3CN in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The suspension was homogenized at low speed with three strokes of a glass/Teflon homogenizer attached to a drill press and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted with 10 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then fractionated on a preparative C18HPLC 1The abbreviations used are:HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarboxylMALDmatrix-assisted laser desorptionESIelectrosprayLSIliquid secondary ionizationMSmass spectroscopyacmS-acetamidomethyl column as described above.Lyophilized Conus textile venom (400 mg) obtained from the Philippines was extracted sequentially with 10 ml each of 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% CH3CN. The mixture was sonicated for three 30-s periods while immersed in ice water, centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 5 min, and the combined supernatant was stored at −20 °C. The extract was fractionated in several runs on a Vydac C18 semi-preparative column (10 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size) and an analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm), both eluted with a 0 to 28% gradient of CH3CN (0.45%/min) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Corresponding fractions were pooled for further purification.Purification of the T-superfamily PeptidesThe peptides ofC. purpurascens (Fig. 1) and C. textile (Fig. 2) were purified from relevant fractions of the venom by analytical reverse phase chromatography (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, Vydac C18 or Microsorb MV). Gradient elution was done using the same buffer systems as for preparative columns. Peptides from C. aulicus (Fig. 5) were purified from preparative fractions using a sulfonic-based strong cation exchange-HPLC column (Vydac 400VHP575, 5 mm, 7.5 × 50 mm), followed by a run on a reverse-phase C18 column. The strong cation exchange column was eluted by a gradient with limiting buffers consisting of 10 mmphosphate, pH 2.5, in 50% acetonitrile and 0.25 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 2.5, in 50% acetonitrile. The active peak from this column was concentrated and desalted before application on the analytical C18 column. Other details of the purification procedures are described in the legends of Figs. 1, 2, and5.Figure 2Purification of tx5a.

For determination of Cys residues in tx5a, au5a, and au5b, the peptides were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine as described below. Approximately 20–80 pmol of the peptides were used. The alkylated peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 492 Sequenator (DNA/Peptide Facility, University of Utah). The 3-phenyl-2-thiohydantoin derivatives were identified by HPLC. Predicted masses for each sequence were verified by mass spectrometry, as described below.Reduction and Alkylation of the Purified PeptideTheC. textile peptide (tx5a) and the C. aulicuspeptides (au5a and au5b) were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine. Prior to reduction, the peptide solution was adjusted to pH 8 with 0.5 m Tris base and 10 mmdithiothreitol was added. The solution was flushed with nitrogen gas, incubated at 65 °C for 15 min, and then cooled to room temperature. After adding 4-vinylpyridine (5 μl/ml of solution), the mixture was left in the dark at room temperature for 25 min. The mixture was diluted with 500 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to purification of the reduced peptide on an analytical reverse-phase HPLC column.Mass SpectrometryMatrix-assisted laser desorption (MALD) (10Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1993; 63: 1193A-1203ACrossref Google Scholar) mass spectra were obtained using a Bruker REFLEX (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) time-of-flight (11Cotter R.J. Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 513-532Google Scholar) mass spectrometer. The sample (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Electrospray (ESI) mass spectra were obtained using an Esquire ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). The HPLC-purified sample, collected in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile, was diluted with 1% acetic acid in methanol, transferred to a fused silica capillary, and infused at approximately 250 nl/min. Liquid secondary ionization (LSI) mass spectra were measured on a Jeol HX110 double focusing magnetic sector mass spectrometer (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). The sample in a glycerol matrix was bombarded with high energy (25 keV) Cs+ ions. The mass accuracy was typically better than 1000 ppm for the time-of-flight instrument, 200 ppm for the ion trap instrument, and 50 ppm for the magnetic sector instrument.Asp-N DigestionThe tx5a peptide was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N as directed in the procedure provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The lyophilized peptide was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Endoproteinase Asp-N (1 or 5 μg of enzyme/20 μg of peptide) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added and the mixture was incubated for 17 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 500 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the digest was fractionated by HPLC with a linear gradient of 0.9% acetonitrile per ml/min. The intact masses of the digestion fragments were analyzed using MALD-MS and ESI-MS prior to chemical sequencing.Chemical SynthesisThe peptides p5a and au5a were synthesized on Rink amide resin using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarboxyl) chemistry and standard side chain protection except on the cysteine residues. For p5a synthesis, the first and third cysteine residues were S-trityl protected, while the second and fourth were protected withS-acetamidomethyl (acm) groups. Two possible disulfide-bonded forms of au5a were synthesized. In one isomer (S1), the first and third cysteine residues wereS-trityl-protected, while the second and fourth were protected with acm groups. In the other isomer (S2), the first and fourth cysteine residues were S-trityl-protected, whereas the second and third cysteine residues were acm-protected.Peptides were removed from resin and precipitated as described previously (12Cartier G.E.

A two-step oxidation protocol was used to selectively fold the peptide as detailed elsewhere (14Monje V.D. Haack J. Naisbitt S. Miljanich G. Ramachandran J. Nasdasdi L. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R.

An Alltech “extract-clean” syringe containing C18 silica (1 g of silica, 100-μm particle size, 60-Å pore size) was wetted by gravity perfusion with buffer B60 for ∼30 min followed by 1–2 min of perfusion with buffer A. The peptide oxidation mixture was diluted at least 2-fold with buffer A and passed through the silica under vacuum (flow rate ∼50 ml/min). The silica was washed with ∼l liter of buffer A under vacuum, and peptide was then eluted by gravity perfusion with 20 ml of buffer B60. Removal of acm protection and closure of the final disulfide was done by oxidation with 5 mm iodine in 5% trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min. Fully oxidized peptide was purified by preparative HPLC using a 20–50% gradient of B60. Synthesis was confirmed by LSI-MS analysis and HPLC co-elution.A second batch of au5a was synthesized on a 357 ACT Peptide Synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY) using standard Fmoc chemistry. The disulfide bonds were formed by a random folding strategy in the presence of 1 mm reduced and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione (pH adjusted to 7.5). The major product (50% of the mixture) that had the desired folding pattern was purified by reverse phase HPLC and then lyophilized.Biological AssayMice were injected intracranially or intraperitoneally with peptides in 15–20 μl of saline or with saline alone, and observed for behavioral changes. Siamese fighting fish were similarly injected with 10 μl of sample in the dorsal muscle and observed for suppression of reactions to self-observation following placement in front of a mirror. In control fish, behaviors typically include a “gill display” (downward extension of the gill flap); extension of dorsal, ventral, and pectoral fins; and, sometimes, agitated swimming and rubbing against the fish's reflection in the mirror. This behavior is similar to that produced by the presence of another fighting fish. The effect of peptide injection on gill display and extension of fins was used as a measure of activity.A second hallmark symptom elicited by higher doses of T-superfamily peptides was an abnormal dorsal fin. These fish have long dorsal fins, which they can greatly extend in display, but on injection of T-superfamily peptides, the fins droop far below their usual resting position. Observing this symptom does not require putting a mirror in front of the fish.Analysis of Tx5.1 and Gm5.1 Clones by the Expressed Sequence Tag MethodFirst-strand synthesis of complementary DNA was primed from oligo(dT) extension at the PstI site of a linearized modified pUC13 plasmid using polyadenylated mRNA isolated fromC. textile and Conus gloriamaris venom ducts. The products were size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis and used to transform Escherichia coli MC1061 to produce cDNA libraries (16Colledge C.J. Hunsperger J.P. Imperial J.S. Hillyard D.R. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expressed sequence tags were identified from single colonies randomly selected from Ampicillin-LB plates plated withConus cDNA libraries (17Adams M.D. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Dubnick M. Polymeropoulos M.H. Xiao H. Merril C.R. Wu A. Olde B. Moreno R.F. Kerlavage A.R. McCombie W.R. Ventner J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Insert sizes of the clones were analyzed by single colony PCR (18Dorfman D.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 568-570PubMed Google Scholar) with vector-specific oligonucleotides flanking the insert region (500 nm amount of each oligonucleotide, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125 μm amount of each dNTP, and 0.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase). Reaction mixtures were amplified (50 cycles of 25 s at 94 °C, 25 s at 54 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) using a 1605 Air Thermo-CyclerTM (Idaho Technology, Idaho Falls, ID). Amplification products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose, 0.5× TBE buffer). Clones containing insert sizes larger than 400 base pairs in length were selected for sequencing. Templates were prepared using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and submitted for fluorescent sequencing primed by oligonucleotides M13R and subsequently M13U (19Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar) at the Health Sciences Center Sequencing Facility, Eccles Institute of Human Genetics, University of Utah. All molecular biology techniques were as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), unless otherwise specified. Sequence analysis was performed with SeqMan (DNASTAR, version 2.55; DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI) and Pileup (21Wisconsin Package, Version 9(1). Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1997Google Scholar).Cloning of Tx5.2, P5.1, and Im5.1The DNA sequence of clone Tx5.1 was analyzed, and the following oligonucleotide primers containing EcoRI endonuclease sites were designed to screen cDNA libraries of other species: first strand primer 1 (5′-GGA ATT CGG AAG CTG ACT ACA AGC AGA-3′) and second strand primer 2 (5′-GGA ATT CCA AAT GAT GTA ATT ACT GAC-3′). The cDNA libraries were then screened using PCR. The reaction mixture contained standard PCR reagents and the following: 500 nm primer 1, 500 nm primer 2, 100 ng/μl cDNA library. Reaction mixtures were then amplified in thin-walled PCR tubes for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 25 s, 52 °C for 35 s, and 72 °C for 2 min using the Air Thermo-Cycler. PCR products were digested withEcoRI, ligated into Bluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene, CA), and used to transform E. coli DH5α.Cloning of Gm5.2The cloning of Gm5.2 was identical to the above procedure except for the following alterations: oligonucleotide primer 3 (5′-AGC TCT AGA GGA AGC TGA CTA CAA GCA-3′) designed from 5′-untranslated region of Tx5.1, and oligonucleotide primer 4 (5′-CAC AAG CTT TAG GTC ATC CAG TTC C-3′) designed from the consensus 3′-untranslated region of several cloned fragments obtained through expressed sequence tag screening of a C. textile cDNA library, were used instead of primer 1 and primer 2. 100 ng/μl cDNA library was amplified as described above, and the amplicon was ligated into Bluescript SK(−) vector using blunt-end ligation.γ-Glutamyl Carboxylase AssaysThe peptide pro(−20 to −1).FLEEL-amide, PLSSLRDNLKRTIRTRLNIR. FLEEL-NH2(which contains the propeptide sequences −20 to −1 of Tx5.2 covalently linked to FLEEL-amide at the amino terminus) was synthesized by Dr. Bob Schackmann of the DNA/Peptide Facility, Huntsman Cancer Center (supported by Grant NCICA 42014), University of Utah. The identity of the peptide was verified by ESI-MS.Partially purified γ-glutamyl carboxylase was prepared by the following procedure. Microsomes of C. textile were prepared as described by Stanley et al. (22Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Microsomes were suspended in buffer containing 2.0 m NaCl, 0.1m MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.8% CHAPS, 0.8% phosphatidyl choline, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, then centrifuged for 1 h at 125,000 × g. The supernatant containing γ-glutamyl carboxylase was adjusted to 66% saturation in ammonium sulfate. The enzyme recovered in the precipitate was dissolved in buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.025 m MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, distributed into aliquots, quick frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Fresh aliquots of enzyme were thawed individually for enzyme assays.Carboxylase assays were performed using 0.5 μg of partially purified enzyme according to methods described by Stanley et al.(22Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FLEEL and Tx5.2 pro(−20 to −1).FLEEL-amide were used as substrates in the carboxylase reaction. Experiments were done in triplicate, and the data were fitted to a single-site binding model and analyzed using Graph Pad Prism from GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA).NomenclatureIn this report, we adopt a nomenclature that is based on conventions used for naming ion channels, the likely molecular targets of these peptides. Putative sequences deduced from clones will be named as follows: 1) letters (one for fish-hunting species, two for non-fish-hunting species) designate theConus species source of the clone, 2) a number represents the disulfide framework, and 3) a second number, separate by a decimal, indicates the order of clone identification. For example, P5.1 is fromC. purpurascens, has disulfide framework “5” (the number assigned to the -CC- -CC- pattern), and is the first clone from the species with this framework. To distinguish clones from peptides that have been isolated from Conus venom, in the latter case all of the species letter(s) are small, the disulfide framework is represented by an arabic numeral and the order of discovery is indicated by a letter, starting with “a”; thus, clone P5.1 may encode peptide p5a isolated from venom. Likewise, the clones fromC. aulicus, Au5.1 and Au5.2, correspond to the venom-purified peptides au5a and au5b.T-superfamily peptide clones will be given the numerical designations 5.1, 5.2, etc., in the order in which they are discovered. The peptides purified from venom will be named as described previously (8McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); hence, au5a and au5b.Finally, when a molecular target is assigned to a toxin, the name will be prefixed by the appropriate pre-existing or newly assigned Greek letter (ω- for calcium channels, α- for acetylcholine receptors, and so forth). Thus, if a member of the T-superfamily from C. textile is determined to have a novel physiological mechanism, it might be called τ-conotoxin TxVA (which might, for example, be encoded by clone Tx5.2; τ-TxVA would then permanently replace tx5a). This nomenclature gives information about physiological mechanism, structure, and the natural source from which the peptide was originally obtained.We note that peptides of the conantokin family were referred to using “V” (conantokin-G was initially described as GV). Since this is not a multiply disulfide-bonded peptide, we now refer to all peptides of the conantokin family by a letter designation for the species: thus, conantokin-G, conantokin-R, etc. We will reserve the provisional designation “5” and the Roman numeral “V” for members of the T-superfamily having the cysteine arrangement - - -CC- - -CC- - -.RESULTSDiscovery of a Novel Class of Conotoxin ClonesWe have carried out a systematic characterization of clones present in cDNA libraries of Conus venom ducts. By analyzing different clones using an expressed sequence tag strategy, we identified different classes of cDNAs encoding Conus peptides. Although most of these fall into previously identified groups (such as the O-superfamily), a number of clones that were frequently encountered in some cDNA libraries do not belong to previously characterized superfamilies of Conus peptides.One class of cDNAs encoded a novel group of Conuspeptides characterized by a long 3′-untranslated region (∼600 base pairs), which exhibited no sequence homology to conserved 3′-untranslated regions of characterized superfamilies. The prepropeptide precursor associated with this 3′-untranslated region predicted a small mature peptide with a unique pattern of four cysteine residues, - - -CC- - - - - -CC-. This novel class of cDNA clones was encountered at a frequency of over 20% in a cDNA library prepared from C. textile venom ducts. The sequence of the first such cDNA clone for which a complete open reading frame was deduced is shown in Table I. Like all Conus peptides, the predicted translation product has a prepropeptide organization, with a disulfide-rich mature conotoxin sequence present in a single copy at the COOH-terminal end; this clone is designated Tx5.1. Since the signal sequence encoded by clone Tx5.1 and the arrangement of Cys residues in the predicted mature tx5a peptide are novel, these define a novel group of Conuspeptides (which we designate the T-superfamily of conotoxins).Table INucleotide sequence and predicted translation product of cDNA Tx5.1A.1/131/11ATG TGC TGT CTC CCA GTG TTC GTC ATT CTT CTG CTG CTG ATT GCA TCT GCA CCT AGC GTTM C C L P V F V I L L L L I A S A P S V61/2191/31GAT GCC CAA CCG AAG ACC AAA GAT GAT GTG CCC CTG GCA CCT TTG CAC GAT AAT GCA AAGD A Q P K T K D D V P L A P L H D N A K121/41 151/51AGT GCA CTA CAA CAT TTG AAC CAA CGC TGC TGC CAA ACA TTC TAT TGG TGC TGT GTT CAAS A L Q H L N Q R C C Q T F Y W C C V Q181/61GGG AAA TGAG K *B. 1020⇓3040↓5060MCCLPVFVILLLLIASAPSVDAQPKTKDDVPLAPLHDNAKSALQHLNQRCCQTFYWCCVQ*Asterisk represents post-translational"
https://openalex.org/W2139127203,"The neuronal and endothelial nitric-oxide synthases (nNOS and eNOS) differ from inducible NOS in their dependence on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Both nNOS and eNOS are activated by the reversible binding of calmodulin (CaM) in the presence of Ca2+, whereas inducible NOS binds CaM irreversibly. One major divergence in the close sequence similarity between the NOS isoforms is a 40–50-amino acid insert in the middle of the FMN-binding domains of nNOS and eNOS. It has previously been proposed that this insert forms an autoinhibitory domain designed to destabilize CaM binding and increase its Ca2+ dependence. To examine the importance of the insert we constructed two deletion mutants designed to remove the bulk of it from nNOS. Both mutants (Δ40 and Δ42) retained maximal NO synthesis activity at lower concentrations of free Ca2+ than the wild type enzyme. They were also found to retain 30% of their activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, indicating that the insert plays an important role in disabling the enzyme when the physiological Ca2+concentration is low. Reduction of nNOS heme by NADPH under rigorous anaerobic conditions was found to occur in the wild type enzyme only in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. However, reduction of heme in the Δ40 mutant occurred spontaneously on addition of NADPH in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. This suggests that the insert regulates activity by inhibiting electron transfer from FMN to heme in the absence of Ca2+/CaM and by destabilizing CaM binding at low Ca2+ concentrations, consistent with its role as an autoinhibitory domain.

The nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) 1The abbreviations used are:NOSnitric-oxide synthasenNOSiNOS and eNOS, neuronal, induced and endothelial NOS respectivelyCaMcalmodulin are a family of dimeric enzymes found in a variety of organisms and cell types. They generate nitric oxide through the five-electron oxidation ofl-arginine, consuming two equivalents of molecular oxygen and three electron equivalents derived from NADPH (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H.

All the NOSs bind heme and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin within a structurally unique N-terminal oxygenase domain (3Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

NOS dimerization occurs largely through contacts between oxygenase domains and is augmented by the binding of (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (7Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O.

Evidence suggests that the reductase domains may supply electrons to the heme domain of the alternate subunit, making dimerization essential for NO synthase activity (8Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B.

The many different NOS sequences currently available for mammalian enzyme variants show all to be closely related. However, they can be broadly grouped into three different isoforms. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) were found to be constitutively expressed in their respective cell types, whereas inducible NOS (iNOS) was first found to be induced by cytokines in macrophages (9Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The three isoforms can be categorized by both amino acid sequence and functionality (10Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because they exhibit different rates of catalysis and sensitivity to regulatory ligands. The constitutive NOSs are regulated by the reversible binding of calmodulin (CaM) through changes in the intracellular Ca2+concentration. iNOS, however, is expressed with CaM bound permanently and is insensitive to changes in Ca2+ concentration (11Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The CaM binding site lies within a linker region between the N-terminal oxygenase and C-terminal reductase domains of the NOSs and consists of 20–25 amino acids. As Fig. 1 shows, the sequence of this region is not well conserved between the three NOS isoforms, and it has been found through the study of chimeric enzymes that it plays a major role in determining the CaM binding affinity (12Ruan J.

Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6435-6440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Regulation of NO synthase activity by CaM has been shown to occur via the control of FMN to heme electron transfer across the domain-domain interface (14Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, CaM has been shown to activate the nNOS reductase domain both within the native dimer and in a mutant consisting of the reductase domain only (15Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The iNOS reductase domain, on the other hand, appears to be influenced little by CaM binding (16Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As well as having different CaM binding sites to iNOS, the constitutive NOSs contain an additional 40–50-amino acid insert in the middle of a conserved region of the FMN-binding subdomain (see Fig. 1). The FMN-binding subdomain is related by amino acid sequence to the large, diverse family of flavodoxins, which generally function as small electron transfer proteins and to the FMN-binding subdomain of cytochrome P-450 reductase, which behaves similarly. However, the presence of such an insert is highly unusual. Furthermore, the insert lies between the two strands of β-sheet that form key binding interactions with the FMN, by analogy with the structure of cytochrome P-450 reductase (17Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the region acts as an autoinhibitory domain, competing with CaM for space on the interdomain linker (18Picciotto M.R. Nastiuk K.L. Nairn A.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L.

However, peptides based on the nNOS insert were less effective. This indicates that in the case of eNOS at least, the insert may make contact with a sequence-specific binding site in the vicinity of the CaM-binding site. To investigate the role of the nNOS insert, we constructed two mutants in which 40 and 42 amino acids have been deleted (Δ40 and Δ42), removing the bulk of the insert region (see Fig. 1). We also constructed a Y889A mutant of nNOS designed to destabilize the binding of FMN to examine the effect of CaM binding on the properties of the FAD-binding subdomain. nitric-oxide synthase iNOS and eNOS, neuronal, induced and endothelial NOS respectively calmodulin (6R)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydro-l-biopterin was purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Rat nNOS cDNA was a kind gift of Dr. S. H. Snyder (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine). The Δ40 nNOS mutant plasmid (pSD1Δ40) was generated by ligating theScaI site at Thr871 in the protein sequence to the BanI site at Arg829 after blunt-ending with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. This was conducted on the plasmid pSD1 consisting of the 622-kilobase Eco0109I fragment of nNOS (Gly721–Arg928) in the plasmid pUC19. The mutation site was transferred within theBglII-SphI fragment of nNOS (Ile776–His897) to the corresponding region of the plasmid pBS-nNOS (21Sagami I. Nakano K. Nomura S. Sato H. Shimizu T. Moncada S. Toda H. Maeda H. Higgs E.A. The Biology of Nitric Oxide 6. Portland Press, London1998: 55Google Scholar). The following mutations were generated using the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber, long and accurate polymerase chain reaction kit for site-directed mutagenesis obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). The Y889A mutation was generated using oligonucleotide 1 (5′-CTCGGGCGGCCCCCCACTT-3′), and the plasmid pSD2 was used as a template. pSD2 was constructed from theBamHI/SphI fragment of pSD1 and the plasmid pKF18k. The mutation site was transferred as described above. The Δ42 mutation was generated using oligonucleotide 2 (5′-TGAGGCACACTGGA-GCCAATGTGAGGTT-3′), and the plasmid pSD3 was used as a template. pSD3 was constructed in the same way as pSD2, using the mutant plasmid pSD1Δ40 as the source of theBamHI/SphI fragment. Therefore, this mutant (Δ42) contains the 120-base pair deletion of Δ40 and a further 6-base pair deletion comprising amino acids Pro873 and Leu874. The mutation site was transferred as described above. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing over the appropriate regions. In each case, the mutant nNOS cDNA was subcloned into theXhoI site of the expression vector pAM82, and the plasmids were amplified in HB101 Escherichia coli cells and used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae spheroplasts. The nNOS enzyme was expressed under the acid phosphotase promoter in yeast as described previously (21Sagami I. Nakano K. Nomura S. Sato H. Shimizu T. Moncada S. Toda H. Maeda H. Higgs E.A. The Biology of Nitric Oxide 6. Portland Press, London1998: 55Google Scholar, 22Shimizu T. Murakami Y. Hatano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13296-13304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). nNOS wild type and mutant enzymes were purified using 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose column chromatographies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (23Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 324-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μm FMN was included in the buffers of the Δ40 and Δ42 mutants throughout preparation to preserve activity, and the procedure was completed within 1 day. Aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80 °C. The purified enzyme was more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For EGTA titration assays, enzyme was used after ADP-Sepharose chromatography to avoid contamination with additional EGTA. Enzyme concentrations were determined from the [co-reduced]-[reduced] difference spectrum using Δε444–467 nm = 55 mm−1cm−1 (24Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries of FMN and FAD relative to heme (the concentration of which was determined as above) were determined as described by Louerat-Oriou et al.(27Louerat-Oriou B. Perret A. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using a modification of the procedure of Faeder and Siegel (28Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NOS samples were analyzed after purification using calmodulin-Sepharose column chromatography, as above. The elution buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl with 5 mm EGTA. Enzyme samples (of approximately 10 μm) were denatured by diluting 10-fold by 6 mguanidinium chloride and incubating for 10 min at 22 °C. Denatured samples (300 ml) were then diluted 10-fold into either 6 mguanidinium chloride or 0.9 mNaH2PO4 containing 1 m guanidinium chloride. The fluorescence response (λex = 450 nm; λem = 525 nm) in these two buffers was compared with the response of FMN and FAD standards and used to calculate the flavin concentrations. The rate of NO formation was determined from the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, monitored at 401 nm using a methemoglobin minus oxyhemoglobin extinction coefficient of 49 mm−1 cm−1 (29Feelisch M. Kubitzek D. Werringloer J. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1996: 455-477Google Scholar), with 10 μm oxyhemoglobin, 0.1 mm NADPH, and 1 mml-arginine. The NADPH oxidation rate was determined spectrophotometrically as an absorbance decrease at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1cm−1, with the concentration of NADPH at 0.1 mm. The ferricyanide reduction rate was determined by monitoring the decrease at 420 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.01 mm−1 cm−1, with concentrations of ferricyanide at 1 mm and NADPH at 0.5 mm unless otherwise indicated. Cytochrome creduction was monitored as an absorbance increase at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1cm−1, with 100 μm cytochrome cand 100 μm NADPH. All assays were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase and 100 units/ml catalase. For assays containing Ca2+ and CaM, the concentrations were 1 mm and 10 μg/ml, respectively. In the above assays for NO synthesis and ferricyanide reduction, the concentration of free Ca2+ was modulated by introducing variable quantities of EGTA into the assay mixture. For these assays, the concentration of Ca2+ was kept at precisely 50 μm, and CaM was kept at 10 μg/ml. The final concentration of enzyme in the assay mixture was 0.10 (± 0.01) μm for both ferricyanide reduction and NO synthesis experiments. Concentrated, purified enzyme (e.g. 2 ml x 20 μm) was passed through an anaerobic Sephadex G25 column (1.5 × 10 cm) contained within a Hirasawa Works (Japan) glove box under an 80% N2/10% H2/10% CO2 atmosphere with O2 at less than 50 ppm. Spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 1201 scanning UV/Vis spectrophotometer contained within the anaerobic environment. Aliquots of anaerobic solutions of NADPH, l-arginine, Ca2+/CaM, and CO-saturated buffer were added as described. The temperature of the glove box was maintained at 15 °C throughout. The alignment shown in Fig.1 compares the amino acid sequences of the FMN-binding subdomains of the three NOS isoforms and that of cytochrome P-450 reductase, the most similar protein outside the NOS family. According to the crystal structure of cytochrome P-450 reductase (17Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), the FMN is bound between two aromatic residues, Tyr139 and Tyr177. In nNOS these align with Phe809 and Tyr889, which likely perform a similar function (structures for NOS isoforms in this region are not available). The sequence similarity in the vicinity of these aromatic residues is striking. However, in both nNOS and eNOS, inserts of 42 and 45 amino acids, respectively, lie between the two homologous regions. To test the functional role of the nNOS insert, the deletion mutants Δ40 and Δ42 were constructed. The Δ40 mutation was constructed by ligating the ends of nNOS DNA generated at two convenient restriction enzyme sites and removes the bulk of the insert (Pro831–Ser870). To adjust the length of the deletion such that the number of amino acids between the FMN-binding regions of nNOS was the same as for iNOS and cytochrome P-450 reductase, a further two residues (Pro873 and Leu874) were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis, thus forming the Δ42 mutant (Fig. 1). A third mutant, Y889A, was constructed to generate an FMN-deficient nNOS form. The change of Tyr889 to Ala, mutates the corresponding residue to that used to generate FMN-deficient cytochrome P-450 reductase (30Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by removing a key binding interaction. All mutants were expressed and purified in the same way as the wild type enzyme. Initially, the Δ40 and Δ42 mutants were found to lose activity during purification; however, this was partially recovered on incubation with excess FMN. Inclusion of FMN in the purification buffer and completion of the procedure within 1 day prevented any loss of activity. The Δ40 mutant was found to be more stable than the Δ42 mutant and is therefore the subject of more detailed analysis. Unlike nNOS, the native form of iNOS is permanently complexed with CaM. However, despite the similarity between the nNOS deletion mutants and iNOS, addition of excess CaM did not stabilize the mutants, which were readily purified on CaM-Sepharose. The Y889A mutant was found to be inactive and lacking the stable blue semiquinone observed during the purification of the other enzymes, consistent with an absence of FMN in this mutant. This was confirmed by measuring the FMN and FAD content relative to heme using the different fluorescence response of the two flavins in different buffers. The Y889A mutant was found to contain 0.06 (± 0.10) FMN and 0.92 (± 0.15) FAD per heme, compared with 0.97 (± 0.10) FMN and 1.01 (± 0.10) FAD per heme in the case of the wild type enzyme. Following purification and removal of free flavin, the FMN content of the Δ40 and Δ42 mutants was found to be 0.60 (± 0.10) and 0.67 (± 0.10), respectively, per heme with 0.96 (± 0.15) and 1.13 (± 0.15) FAD, respectively. Rate constants for the steady-state turnover of wild type and mutant forms of nNOS for NO synthesis, aerobic oxidation of NADPH, reduction of ferricyanide, and reduction of cytochrome c are collated in TableI. For the wild type enzyme, Ca2+/CaM is required for NO synthesis or NADPH consumption to reach significant levels. In the presence of l-arginine the NADPH consumption becomes coupled tightly to NO synthesis, based on a stoichiometry of 1.5 NADPH equivalents/NO molecule generated (31Abou-Soud H.M. Presta A. Meyer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In its absence, however, NADPH is consumed faster, indicating that the supply of electrons to nNOS heme does not limit the rate of catalytic turnover.Table ISteady state activities of wild type nNOS and the Δ40, Δ42, and Y889A mutantsCa2+/CaMaIn the presence (+) or absence (−) of 1 mm Ca2+ and 10 μg/ml CaM.NO synthesisbRate of conversion of oxyhemoglobin (10 μm) to methemoglobin on NO synthesis in the presence of 0.1 mmNADPH and 1 mm l-arginine.NADPH oxidationcRate of NADPH (0.1 mm) oxidation in the presence (+) l-arginine) or absence (− l-arginine) of 1 mm l-arginine.CytochromecRate of NADPH (0.1 mm) oxidation in the presence (+) l-arginine) or absence (− l-arginine) of 1 mm l-arginine.reductiondRate of reduction of cytochrome c (100 μm) in the presence of 0.1 mm NADPH.Ferricyanide reductioneRate of reduction of ferricyanide (1 mm) in the presence of 0.5 mm NADPH.(−l-arginine)(+ l-arginine)min−1min−1min−1min−1Wild type+45 ± 4217 ± 2058 ± 153550 ± 2503270 ± 100−00.74 ± 0.152.2 ± 0.3360 ± 201120 ± 200Δ40+14 ± 3293 ± 1048 ± 13100 ± 1803950 ± 30−4.0 ± 0.94.8 ± 1.015 ± 21340 ± 202980 ± 100Δ42+9.9 ± 2.0252 ± 30NDfND, not determined.2140 ± 203600 ± 100−4.2 ± 0.45.0 ± 1.0ND1420 ± 203600 ± 100Y889A+01.6 ± 2.0ND86 ± 203950 ± 60−02.0 ± 2.0ND56 ± 126450 ± 100All values are given ± standard deviation calculated from at least three separate determinations.a In the presence (+) or absence (−) of 1 mm Ca2+ and 10 μg/ml CaM.b Rate of conversion of oxyhemoglobin (10 μm) to methemoglobin on NO synthesis in the presence of 0.1 mmNADPH and 1 mm l-arginine.c Rate of NADPH (0.1 mm) oxidation in the presence (+) l-arginine) or absence (− l-arginine) of 1 mm l-arginine.d Rate of reduction of cytochrome c (100 μm) in the presence of 0.1 mm NADPH.e Rate of reduction of ferricyanide (1 mm) in the presence of 0.5 mm NADPH.f ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab All values are given ± standard deviation calculated from at least three separate determinations. For the Δ40 mutant, both NO synthesis and NADPH consumption occur at significant rates even in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, the rate of NO synthesis is approximately 30% of the wild type value, but the rates for NADPH consumption are similar. Unlike the wild type enzyme, the Δ40 mutant does not efficiently couple NO synthesis to NADPH consumption, and approximately half the electron equivalents are lost to molecular oxygen during normal turnover, i.e. in the presence ofl-arginine and Ca2+/CaM. In the absence of Ca2+/CaM, Δ40 catalyzes NO synthesis at approximately 30% of the rate in its presence. The rate of NADPH consumption in the presence of l-arginine again indicates partial decoupling from NO synthesis. However, in this case (i.e. in the absence of Ca2+/CaM), NADPH oxidation is faster in the presence of l-arginine, suggesting that the rate of electron transfer to the heme is now a rate-determining factor. The Δ42 mutant behaved in a manner similar to that of the Δ40 mutant, retaining a similar level of NO synthase activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. Both deletion mutants required CaM and Ca2+ to be added for maximal activity and were unaffected by the addition of Ca2+ alone. The Y889A mutant had no NO synthase activity and minimal NADPH oxidase activity, indicating that electron supply to the heme has been cut by this mutation. The cytochrome c reductase activity of the wild type enzyme is highly CaM-dependent, increasing by a factor of 10 on CaM binding. The ferricyanide reductase activity is less so, increasing by 3-fold on CaM binding. Both the cytochrome c and ferricyanide reductase activities of the Δ40 mutant are affected less by CaM binding as the rates observed in the absence of CaM are both higher than for the wild type enzyme. For the Δ42 mutant, the ferricyanide reductase activity is CaM-independent. The Y889A mutation results in a severe loss of cytochrome c reductase activity, indicating that in the wild type enzyme, FMN is the chief electron donor to cytochrome c. The ferricyanide reductase activity of this mutant is retained, but the effect of CaM is reversed, such that CaM binding causes a decrease in the rate of reduction. To clarify the effect of the Y889A mutation on the ferricyanide reductase activity of nNOS, the concentration dependence of the wild type and mutant enzymes were studied in the presence and absence of CaM. Fig.2 plots the steady-state ferricyanide reductase activity of the enzymes against the ferricyanide concentration. For the wild type enzyme two roughly parallel lines are formed, such that the effect of CaM binding is to increase the value of the y axis intercept. This situation suggests the presence of two different binding sites of high and low affinity, probably in the vicinity of FMN and FAD, respectively. In contrast, the plots derived for the Y889A mutant tend toward the origin, suggesting a single, low affinity binding site. Because Y889A lacks FMN, this binding site must be located near the FAD. For the mutant, both lines have a steeper gradient than for the wild type enzyme, indicating that the FAD is more accessible following the mutation. The FAD subdomain is nevertheless catalytically viable. Fig. 3 plots the normalized NO synthase activities of the wild type enzyme and deletion mutants against the concentration of the Ca2+chelator, EGTA. In each of the assays the Ca2+concentration was fixed at 50 μm, so that as the EGTA concentration passes this mark it begins to compete with the enzyme-CaM complex for free Ca2+. At high concentrations of EGTA, no free Ca2+ is available for stimulation of CaM binding, and the enzymes lose activity. For the wild type enzyme, the NO synthase activity rapidly drops to zero after the EGTA concentration reaches 50 μm, indicating that the concentration of Ca2+has dropped below the threshold value necessary to stimulate the enzyme. Both the Δ40 and Δ42 mutants retain maximal activity at higher EGTA concentrations and lose activity more slowly as the EGTA concentration increases. The mutants therefore require lower concentrations of free Ca2+ for stimulation. The mutants also retain 30–40% of their maximal activity even at high EGTA concentrations and turnover at a similar rate as in the absence of CaM (Table I). Fig. 4 plots the normalized ferricyanide reductase activity against the EGTA concentration under similar conditions as those described above. Because the concentrations of Ca2+, CaM, and enzyme are the same, the plots can be compared directly with those in Fig. 3. The wild type enzyme loses activity rapidly as the concentration of free Ca2+ is depleted, reaching a value consistent with the loss of bound CaM. The Δ40 mutant retains maximal activity for longer than the wild type enzyme as with the NO synthase activity. The ferricyanide reductase activity of the Δ42 mutant shows no Ca2+ dependence, which is consistent with its lack of CaM dependence (Table I). For the Y889A mutant, the ferricyanide reductase activity increases as the free Ca2+ is depleted, indicating that the FAD-binding subdomain is itself Ca2+/CaM-dependent. The resultant curve is similar in shape to that of the wild type enzyme, indicating similar Ca2+ sensitivity. Fig. 5 shows the anaerobic reduction of wild type nNOS on addition of NADPH. The first addition of NADPH (Fig. 5 a) causes a broad decrease in absorbance between 400 and 500 nm consistent with the reduction of the two bound flavins of the enzyme. The position of the Soret peak is unchanged at around 398 nm. A further addition of NADPH and incubation for 20 min led to no significant change. Addition of 0.1 mml-arginine caused a decrease in absorbance at 405–425 nm consistent with a shift in peak position to lower wavelength, which is associated with a low to high spin state change (32Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Addition of Ca2+ (50 μm) and CaM (10 μg/ml) causes a shift in the position of the Soret peak to a longer wavelength, indicating heme reduction (Fig. 5 b). Addition of a saturated solution of CO up to 10% causes the formation of the reduced heme-CO complex characterized by the appearance of a peak at 444 nm. Fig. 6 shows the anaerobic reduction of the Δ40 mutant upon addition of NADPH. As with the wild type enzyme, the"

N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18952) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelium exposed to oxidized LDL in vitro and in vivo shows an increased permeability (2Rangaswamy S.

The signal pathways by which mox-LDL and oxidized LDL reduce endothelial barrier function are unknown. Confluent endothelial cells challenged with vasoactive substances, such as thrombin, show a rapid reorganization of their actin cytoskeleton,i.e. stimulation of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and actin stress fiber formation, leading to cell contraction and intercellular gaps (4Wojciak-Stothard B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Such cytoskeletal rearrangements reduce endothelial barrier function (6van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Arteriosler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and are typically found in vivo in endothelium overlying early atherosclerotic lesions (7Colangelo S. Langille B.L. Steiner G. Gotlieb A.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 18: 52-56Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thrombin induces endothelial cell contraction and increased endothelial permeability through binding to a serpentine receptor which is coupled via heterotrimeric G-proteins of the Gq family to phospholipase Cβ to yield inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which mobilizes Ca2+from intracellular stores and thus increases cytosolic Ca2+concentration (8Grand R.J.A. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration leads to activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which phosphorylates Thr-18 and Ser-19 of the MLC of myosin II to enable actin-myosin interaction and cell contraction (9Goeckler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We and others recently found an additional pathway by which thrombin regulates endothelial cell contraction. Thrombin, probably through coupling of the thrombin receptor to heterotrimeric G-proteins of the G12/13 family (10Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 91: 504-508Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar), was shown to activate the Ras-related GTPase Rho and its effector p160 Rho kinase in endothelial cells (5Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H-J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Rho kinase phosphorylates myosin binding subunit of MLC phosphatase which is thereby inactivated (11Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng Y. Nakano T. Okawa K.

Indeed, we observed that thrombin transiently inactivated MLC phosphatase in human endothelial cells and that phosphatase inactivation correlated with peak levels in MLC phosphorylation. Hence, the Rho/Rho kinase pathway seems to regulate endothelial contractility in concert with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK. A similar regulatory system was reported in smooth muscle cells (14Gong M.C. Izuka K. Nixon G. Broene J.P. Hall A. Eccleston J.F. Sugai M. Kobayashi S. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This study was aimed to investigate whether mox-LDL would mimic the action of vasoactive substances on human endothelial cells. We found that (i) mildly oxidized LDL induced a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, the formation of intercellular gaps, and the stimulation of MLC phosphorylation within minutes and (ii) that mox-LDL induced these changes through stimulation of the Rho/Rho kinase pathway with the subsequent inhibition of MLC phosphatase and without increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was kindly provided by Yoshitomi Pharmaceuticals, 3–7-25 Koyata, Iruma-Shi Saitama, Japan. Anti-phospho-MLC antibody was a generous gift from Dr. James Staddon, EISAI Co., London, UK. All other materials not further specified were from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained and cultured as described previously (5Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H-J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Before exposure to mox-LDL or native LDL, cells were serum deprived for 15 min. Medium was then replaced by fresh serum-free medium containing mox-LDL or native LDL as indicated. HUVEC were stained for I-actin as described previously (5Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H-J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For staining of phosphorylated MLC, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were treated with normal goat serum (1/10 in PBS) for 20 min and then incubated for 1 h with anti-phospho-MLC antibody, diluted 1/10 in PBS, followed by 1 h incubation with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), diluted 1/200 in PBS. MLC phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. HUVEC were grown for 10 days in Costar 6-well culture dishes and treated with mox-LDL as indicated. Cells were lysed with boiling Laemmli buffer. Proteins were then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight with anti-phospho-MLC antibody (1/500) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, washed three times, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1/7500 in Tris-buffered saline, washed three times, and then developed with Luminol solution (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat films. The amount of phosphorylated MLC was determined by densitometric analysis of the protein bands that reacted with anti-phospho-MLC antibody, using a Sharp XL-325 densitometer and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Image Master software. Phosphorylated MLC appeared as a single band of 20 kDa. This 20-kDa band was also detected by a mouse monoclonal antibody to total MLC (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). The lower band is because of an unspecific reaction of the secondary anti-rabbit antibody. The range of linearity of the densitometric measurements of phosphorylated myosin was determined by a dilution series of protein samples of mox-LDL-stimulated HUVEC (4–40 μg of protein/lane). For MLC phosphatase measurement, HUVEC were activated and lysed as described (5Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H-J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To determine MLC phosphatase activity, we used smooth muscle [α-32P]MLC as a substrate as described previously with some modifications (17Shirazi A. Lizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly MLC (0.8 mg/ml) was phosphorylated for 1 h at room temperature with MLCK (50 μg/ml) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml calmodulin, 0.35 m NaCl, 50 μm[α-32P]ATP, passed through 2× 1-ml spin columns with Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), equilibrated with assay buffer, and dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C with 2 × 5 liters of assay buffer. Phosphatase activities were then quantified by measuring release of radioactivity from [α-32P]MLC in the presence of HUVEC lysates as described (5Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H-J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). LDL was isolated in the continuous presence of EDTA (18Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). LDL was dialyzed at 4 °C using a N2-saturated buffer (18Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) containing EDTA (1 mm) and then stored at 4 °C in darkness under N2. Mox-LDL was prepared from EDTA-free LDL by Cu2+-triggered oxidation as described (18Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly dialyzed LDL containing 1 mmol/liter EDTA was loaded onto Econo-PacI0 DG columns (Bio-Rad) and recovered in PBS. LDL was then concentrated to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml by centricon-100 concentrators (Amicon) and mildly oxidized by incubation with CuSO4 (final concentration 640 μmol/liter) for 20 h at 37 °C. The endotoxin concentrations in mox-LDL and native LDL were determined by a Limulus assay and were 5 ng/ml of medium for native LDL and 3.7 ng/ml of medium for mox-LDL. These endotoxin concentrations have no effects on MLC phosphorylation or the actin cytoskeleton of HUVEC within minutes (data not shown). Calcium measurements and calculation of cytosolic Ca2+-concentrations of individual cells were carried out with a Quanticell fluorimetric system (Applied Imaging Corp., Sunderland, UK) as described (19van IJzendoorn S.C. van Gool R.G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Heemskerk J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diffusion through HUVEC monolayers was determined as described previously with some modifications (5Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H-J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). HUVEC were cultured for 10 days on collagen-coated cell culture inserts (3-μm pore size, Becton Dickinson) with medium changes every 2 days. For exposure to mox-LDL or native LDL, medium was replaced with 500 μl of culture medium containing mox-LDL or native LDL. For controls mox-LDL was omitted, but otherwise cells were treated identically. After 2 min of stimulation, 500 μl of medium was filled into the lower compartment, and the medium in the upper compartment was replaced with fresh medium containing HRP (0.34 mg/ml, IV-A-type, M r44,000, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). After 1 min, 60 μl of medium was collected from the lower compartment and mixed with 860 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Guaiacol) and 100 μl of freshly made H2O2 solution (0.6 mm in H2O). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature and absorbance was measured at 470 nm. As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of confluent endothelial monolayers to mox-LDL (250 μg/ml) for 2 min changed their cobblestone morphology with a polygonal cell shape and a dense peripheral actin ring to a contracted phenotype with rounded cells, prominent actin stress fibers, and intercellular gaps (Fig.1 b). To test whether mox-LDL induces actin stress fibers and cell contraction via Rho and Rho kinase, we stained control cells or cells stimulated with mox-LDL for F-actin using rhodamine-phalloidin. As indicated by Fig. 1 a, control cells showed a dense peripheral actin ring and almost no stress fibers. Endothelial cells stimulated with mox-LDL (2 min, 250 μg/ml) showed prominent actin stress fibers and a contracted phenotype with intercellular gaps (Fig.1 b). To investigate whether these actin rearrangements are because of activation of Rho/Rho kinase, we pretreated cells with the selective Rho-inhibitor C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum (24 h, 5 μg/ml) or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (30 min, 10 μm) and then stimulated the cells with mox-LDL. C3 transferase (Fig. 1 c) or Y-27632 (Fig.1 e) did not influence the actin distribution in unstimulated HUVEC, but C3 transferase (Fig. 1 d) and Y-27632 (Fig.1 f) completely blocked the mox-LDL-induced actin stress fiber formation and cell contraction, indicating that mox-LDL induced these cytoskeletal rearrangements through activation of Rho and Rho kinase. In contrast to mox-LDL, native LDL had no effect on the actin cytoskeleton in human endothelial cells (Fig. 1 g). Endothelial cell contraction and intercellular gap formation are expected to increase endothelial permeability. Indeed in our experimental setting, mox-LDL (2 min, 250 μg/ml), but not native LDL, markedly increased transendothelial diffusion of horseradish peroxidase (Fig.2). Pretreatment of cells with C3 transferase (24 h, 5 μg/ml) or Y-27632 (30 min, 10 μm) blocked the mox-LDL-induced increase in permeability. These findings suggest that activation of Rho/Rho kinase is critically involved in mox-LDL-induced increase in endothelial permeability. Phosphorylation of the light chain enables myosin to interact with and to slide against F-actin filaments in stress fibers, which are considered the contractile organelles of non-muscle cells such as endothelial cells (9Goeckler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). If in fact mox-LDL stimulates Rho/Rho kinase, this should lead to inhibition of MLC phosphatase followed by MLC phosphorylation (5Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H-J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Indeed, MLC phosphatase activity was found to be rapidly reduced to about 60% of the basal activity between 30 s and 2 min of mox-LDL treatment, which was followed by a return to base-line values after 5 min (Fig. 3 a). To determine the corresponding levels of phosphorylated MLC, we performed Western blots using a phospho-MLC specific antibody. Fig. 3 b shows a time course of MLC phosphorylation in endothelial cells stimulated with mox-LDL. MLC phosphorylation rose to a peak within 2 min of stimulation and then fell to base-line levels within 15 min. In contrast to mox-LDL, native LDL did not induce MLC phosphorylation in HUVEC. To demonstrate that the mox-LDL-induced MLC phosphorylation is because of Rho/Rho kinase activation, we pretreated HUVEC with C3 transferase (24 h, 5 μg/ml) or Y-27632 (30 min, 10 μm). The results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that inhibition of Rho or Rho kinase completely blocked mox-LDL-induced MLC phosphorylation. To investigate the intracellular distribution of phosphorylated MLC in HUVEC after mox-LDL stimulation, cells were stained for phosphorylated MLC. Fig.5 a indicates that in control cells almost no phosphorylated MLC can be detected. In HUVEC treated with mox-LDL (2 min, 250 μg/ml), phosphorylated MLC could be detected that was organized in stress fibers (Fig. 5 b). In cells pretreated with C3 transferase (Fig. 5 c) or with Y-27632 (Fig. 5 d), no incorporation of phosphorylated MLC into stress fibers could be observed. Incubation of cells with native LDL did not induce myosin phosphorylation (Fig. 5 e).Figure 4Mox-LDL-induced MLC phosphorylation is mediated by Rho/Rho kinase. HUVEC were stimulated with mox-LDL (250 μg/ml) as indicated. MLC phosphorylation was then determined by Western blot using an antibody to phosphorylated MLC. The lower molecular weight band is because of an unspecific cross-reaction with the secondary antibody. In cells treated with C3 transferase (24 h, 5 μg/ml) or with Y-27632 (Y) (30 min, 10 μm), mox-LDL-induced (2 min, 250 μg/ml) MLC phosphorylation was completely blocked.

Fig.6 indicates that mox-LDL does not increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in HUVEC indicating that it enhances MLC phosphorylation in HUVEC mainly through the Rho/Rho kinase pathway. Here we describe a novel signal pathway of mox-LDL in human endothelial cells. Mox-LDL induces cell contraction, i.e.formation of actin stress fibers and intercellular gaps, leading to an increase in endothelial permeability, through activation of the Rho/Rho kinase pathway. This mechanism potentially contributes to endothelial dysfunction in early atherosclerotic lesions. Down-regulation of MLC phosphatase could also be a mechanism by which mox-LDL enhances the effects of Ca2+-mobilizing vasoactive substances. Conceivably, continuous stimulation of the vascular endothelium by subendothelial mox-LDL may eventually lead to an enhanced susceptibility of the endothelium to such vasoactive substances. Our data indicate that mox-LDL utilizes physiologic signal mechanisms to activate the endothelium. Although we have not determined in the present study the mox-LDL-stimulated signal pathways upstream of Rho, we suggest that mox-LDL stimulates the Rho/Rho kinase pathway in endothelial cells through activation of heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors such as the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor. We have indeed recently found that LPA is formed during mild oxidation of LDL in the absence of cells and that LPA was the main ingredient in mox-LDL responsible for the induction of platelet shape change and endothelial cell activation (21Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, LPA induces Rho-dependent stress fiber formation through activation of G13 (22Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and enhances contractility by this way (23Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Activation of Rho and Rho kinase by mox-LDL may not be restricted to endothelial cells. It is likely that mox-LDL activates the same pathway in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Indeed, it is well documented that Rho kinase plays a pivotal role for Ca2+ sensitization of vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore mox-LDL was found to induce vascular smooth muscle cell contraction (24Augé N. Fitoussi G. Bascands J-L. Pieraggi M-T. Junquero D. Valet P. Girolami J-P. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hence mox-LDL could contribute to elevated levels of blood pressure by activation of Rho kinase and thereby enhanced contractility of smooth muscle cells. Indeed, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 has previously been found to reduce the blood pressure in hypertensive rats (25Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we propose that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway is critical for the activation of endothelial cells by mox-LDL and could be a new target to prevent atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease.

Presently, in rat adipocytes, we found that insulin-induced activation of ERK was blocked (a) by chemical inhibitors of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ, and, moreover, (b) by transient expression of both dominant-negative Δp85 PI3K subunit and kinase-inactive PKC-ζ. Further, insulin effects on ERK were inhibited by kinase-inactive 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), and by mutation of Thr-410 in the activation loop of PKC-ζ, which is the target of PDK-1 and is essential for PI3K/PDK-1-dependent activation of PKC-ζ. In addition to requirements for PI3K, PDK-1, and PKC-ζ, we found that a tyrosine kinase (presumably the insulin receptor), the SH2 domain of GRB2, SOS, RAS, RAF, and MEK1 were required for insulin effects on ERK in the rat adipocyte. Our findings therefore suggested that PDK-1 and PKC-ζ serve as a downstream effectors of PI3K, and act in conjunction with GRB2, SOS, RAS, and RAF, to activate MEK and ERK during insulin action in rat adipocytes.

The resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min to remove fat, cell debris, and nuclei. Post-nuclear supernatants were then supplemented with 0.154m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet, and equal amounts of lysate protein in each experiment (varying from 200 to 500 μg between experiments) were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which, as shown below, immunoprecipitated ERK1, as well as ERK2, despite the fact that these antibodies reacted only with ERK2 in Western analyses. Precipitates were collected on Protein-AG-agarose beads, washed and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of buffer containing 25 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH, 7.3), 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products; approximate specific activity, 1,500,000 dpm/nmol), and 50 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). After incubation, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted on p81 filter paper, which was washed and counted for 32P-radioactivity (5Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Yang Y. Farese R.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Blank values were obtained by substituting a nonimmune antibody preparation instead of the anti-ERK2 antibodies, or by omitting myelin basic protein substrate (results were similar). Except for greater relative effects of insulin, results obtained with this ERK immune complex assay were similar in most aspects to those obtained in assays of total mitogen-activated protein kinase activity observed in crude cell extracts (5Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Yang Y. Farese R.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Differences in absolute 32P-incorporation values between individual experiments reflect variations in amounts of cell extracts immunoprecipitated and specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP used, but relative effects of insulin and other agonists were comparable. In most cases, the actual data from individual experiments are depicted, but in all cases similar findings were observed in repeat experiments. As depicted in representative blots in Fig. 1, and as quantified in multiple samples in TableI, treatments with insulin and PI3K and PKC-ζ inhibitors, wortmannin and the myristoylated PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate, did not have significant effects on the levels of ERK1 and ERK2, or their ratios, in these ERK2 immunoprecipitates, as determined by blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum that recognizes both ERK1 and ERK2 in Western analyses. It may therefore be surmised that these ERK2 assays actually reflected activities of both ERK1 and ERK2, and our present finding of insulin effects on both ERK1 and ERK2 in these immunoprecipitates is in keeping with our previous findings, which showed that insulin activates both p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 in rat adipocytes, as determined following their electrophoretic resolution and assay in myelin basic protein-containing gels (15Yang Y.

The amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection was kept constant in all samples by varying the amount of insert-free vector. After electroporation, cells were incubated overnight to allow time for expression, and then washed and suspended in glucose-free KRP medium and incubated for 10 min with or without 10 nm insulin. After incubation, cells were sonicated and MYC- or HA-tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-MYC antiserum (Upstate Biotechnologies Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Covance, Richmond, CA), respectively, and assayed for ERK-dependent myelin basic protein phosphorylation, as described above. As shown in the immunoblots depicted in Fig. 1, and, as may be surmised from observing comparable levels of basal enzyme activity of epitope-tagged ERK2 in various co-transfection groups (see Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), the transfection of dominant-negative forms of SOS, RAS, RAF, MEKK1, Δp85 PI3K, and various forms of PKC-ζ and PDK-1 had relatively little or no significant effect on the levels of immunoprecipitable epitope-tagged ERK2. Also note that only ERK2 was recovered in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-HA and anti-MYC antibodies (Fig.1). Initially, we used inhibitors to identify factors required for insulin-induced activation of immunoprecipitable ERK2 in rat adipocytes. As seen in Fig. 2, PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (100 μm) (i.e. in concentrations required to largely inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport in the rat adipocyte), and the MEK1 inhibitor, PD098059 (10 μm, which did not inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport), inhibited insulin-stimulated increases in immunoprecipitable ERK. Of particular interest, the cell-permeable myristoylated PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate inhibited insulin-induced increases in immunoprecipitable ERK activity over a concentration range comparable with that which is effective in inhibiting PKC-ζ (14Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In this regard, diacylglycerol-dependent PKCs are not required for insulin-induced activation of ERK in rat adipocytes (see Ref. 15Yang Y. Farese R.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; presently, we also confirmed that phorbol ester-induced PKC down-regulation inhibited the acute effects of phorbol esters but did not inhibit insulin-induced activation of immunoprecipitable ERK; data not shown), and it is therefore clear that the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate did not exert its effects through inhibition of diacylglycerol-dependent PKCs. These findings with inhibitors suggested that PI3K and PKC-ζ (or PKC-λ, which is 72% homologous to PKC-ζ and has an identical pseudosubstrate sequence), as well as MEK1, are required for insulin-induced activation of ERK in rat adipocytes. Further evidence implicating PI3K in insulin-induced activation of ERK was obtained in experiments in which rat adipocytes were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding MYC-tagged ERK2 and a dominant-negative mutant form of the p85 subunit of PI3K, Δp85 (18Sakaue H. Haras K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Kotani K. Ogawa W. Yonezawa K. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11304-11309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, insulin-induced activation of MYC-ERK2 was inhibited by dominant-negative Δp85, a mutant form of the p85 subunit of PI3K that interacts with phosphotyrosine (pY) residues on activated forms of IRS family members but is unable to transmit activating signals to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K (18Sakaue H. Haras K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Kotani K. Ogawa W. Yonezawa K. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11304-11309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings therefore suggested that the p85 regulatory subunit, as well as the p110 catalytic subunit (which is directly inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002), of PI3K was required for ERK2 activation, presumably reflecting a need for activation of the SH2 domain of the p85 subunit by pYXXM-containing proteins such as IRS (this assumes that Δp85 neither binds nor inhibits the p110 subunit of PI3K). In addition to PI3K, we found that SOS, RAS, and RAF were required for insulin-induced activation of ERK2 in rat adipocytes. As seen in Fig.3, transient transfection of dominant-negative mutant forms of SOS, RAS, and c-RAF-1 inhibited the activation of co-transfected HA- or MYC-tagged ERK2 by insulin; in addition, constitutively active RAS markedly stimulated HA-ERK2 activity. In contrast to the c-RAF-1 mutant, transfection of a dominant-negative kinase-inactive mutant form of MEKK1, which like RAF and PI3K (21Giglione C. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34737-34744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) can interact with RAS (22Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated MYC-ERK2 (Fig. 3). Also, in contrast to inhibitory effects of dominant-negative RAS on insulin-induced activation of HA-ERK2, this RAS mutant did not inhibit the acute activating effects of phorbol esters on HA-ERK2 (data not shown), which may in some cell types occur independently of RAS (23Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effects of both dominant-negative RAS and c-RAF-1 on insulin-induced activation of HA-ERK2 appeared to be specific. The above findings suggested that PI3K along with SOS, RAS, c-RAF-1, and MEK1 was required for insulin-induced activation of ERK2 in the rat adipocyte. Because PKC-ζ (and/or λ) is known to serve as an effector of PI3K during insulin action in rat adipocytes (14Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

As seen in Fig. 4, whereas WT PKC-ζ had no effect on HA-ERK2 activity, both a KI form of PKC-ζ (K271N mutant) and an activation-resistant form of PKC-ζ (T410A mutant that cannot be activated by PDK-1; see Refs. 19Chou M.M.

Moreover, the inhibitory effect of KI-PKC-ζ could be reversed (or prevented) by co-transfecting plasmid encoding WT-PKC-ζ, which alone had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated ERK2. These findings suggested that the point-mutation per se in KI-PKC-ζ was responsible for its inhibitory effects on insulin-induced activation of ERK2 and further implied that the kinase activity of PKC-ζ is specifically required, presumably to phosphorylate a presently undefined substrate that is required for subsequent ERK2 activation in rat adipocytes. Whereas mutant forms of PKC-ζ inhibited insulin-induced activation of HA-ERK2, constitutive PKC-ζ provoked insulin-like increases in HA-ERK2 activity, even in the absence of insulin (Fig. 4). Further stimulatory effects of insulin on ERK2 activity in cells expressing constitutive PKC-ζ (Fig. 4) were also observed, and this may reflect the activation of endogenous PKC-ζ, or the fact that insulin can provoke further increases in activity of “constitutive” PKC-ζ. 2M.

Because PDK-1, in conjunction with PI3K-dependent increases in PI-3,4,5-(PO4)3, has been reported to transmit activating signals from PI3K to PKC-ζ (19Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Grahams L.K.

Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) (note that we have confirmed that PDK-1 and its target in PKC-ζ, threonine-410, are required for PKC-ζ activation by insulin in rat adipocytes; see Ref.29Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Sajan M.P. Karnitz L.M. Cong L. Quon M.J. Farese R.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the role of PDK-1 in insulin-induced activation of ERK2 in transiently transfected rat adipocytes. As seen in Fig.5, WT-PDK-1 enhanced basal HA-ERK2 activity, and KI-PDK-1 inhibited insulin-stimulated HA-ERK2 activity. Further, the inhibitory effect of KI-PDK-1 on insulin-stimulated ERK2 activation was reversed by co-transfection of WT-PDK-1 (Fig. 5), indicating that its kinase activity (presumably to phosphorylate Thr-410 in PKC-ζ), like that of PKC-ζ, is specifically required for insulin-induced activation of ERK2. Our findings suggested that PI3K, PDK-1, and PKC-ζ, along with SOS, RAS, c-RAF-1, and MEK1 were required for ERK2 activation during insulin stimulation of rat adipocytes. In this regard, RAS is known to bind to the p110 subunit of PI3K (10Kodaki T. Woscholski R. Hallberg B. Rodriquez-Viciana P. Downward J. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), and we presently found that both the p110 and p85 subunits of PI3K were recovered in RAS immunoprecipitates prepared from lysates of rat adipocytes (Fig.6). However, we did not observe any effects of insulin on (a) p85 or p110 PI3K subunit levels in RAS immunoprecipitates or (b) PI3K enzyme activity recovered in RAS immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). Moreover, as discussed above, the inhibitory effects of dominant-negative Δp85 on insulin-induced activation of ERK2 suggested that the activation of PI3K that is relevant to ERK activation requires input from a factor that is capable of activating the p85 subunit of PI3K, e.g. an IRS family member. Collectively, these findings suggested that RAS may serve in the localization but not in the activation of PI3K. Finally, we found that inhibitors of tyrosine kinase and the GRB2 SH2 domain, viz., genistein and a Nα-oxalyl-tripeptide-pY mimetic (see above and Ref.16), respectively, also inhibited insulin-induced activation of immunoprecipitable ERK in the rat adipocyte (Fig. 7). These findings therefore suggested that a tyrosine kinase-dependent substrate, i.e. IRS and/or SHC, along with GRB2 and SOS, operate upstream of RAS in insulin-induced activation of ERK2 in rat adipocytes. To summarize, our findings suggested that factors in two signaling pathways that are frequently considered to be functionally separate during insulin action, viz., the GRB2/SOS/RAS/RAF pathway and the PI3K/PDK-1/PKC-ζ pathway, are jointly required for insulin-induced activation of ERK in rat adipocytes. Although there are still gaps in our understanding of how these pathways are activated and interact with each other, it seems likely that one or more activated forms of IRS family members acts upon a specific pool of PI3K that operates in conjunction with GRB2/SOS and RAS. This PI3K apparently activates a subset of PDK-1 and PKC-ζ, which in turn may contribute, along with RAS, to the activation of c-RAF-1. This postulation is in keeping with other findings indicating that RAS-dependent activation of RAF apparently requires the phosphorylation of RAF by serine/threonine kinases and subsequent recruitment of a 14·3·3 protein (30Vojtek A.B.

Alternatively, despite our negative finding, RAS may activate PI3K (see Refs. 10Kodaki T. Woscholski R. Hallberg B. Rodriquez-Viciana P. Downward J. Parker P.J. Curr.

Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) or indirectly via GRB2/SOS, as suggested to occur during Gβγ signaling through PI3K and RAS (33Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Giuseppe Pellici P. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar); however, in the latter case, PI3K is postulated to activate a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase before activating GRB2/SOS (33Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Giuseppe Pellici P. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and in the case of insulin, this would imply an element of redundancy, as it would mean that tyrosine kinase activation is required both before and after PI3K activation.

https://openalex.org/W1997345969,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK) can be regulated by different signaling pathways including those mediated by protein kinase Akt and Wnt proteins. Wnt proteins are believed to activate a transcription factor leukemia enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1) by inhibiting GSK, and Akt was shown to phosphorylate GSK and inhibit its kinase activity. We investigated the effect of an activated Akt on the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin and LEF-1-dependent transcription. Although the activated Akt, mAkt, clearly inhibited the kinase activity of GSK, mAkt alone did not induce accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin or activate LEF-1-dependent transcription. On the contrary, coexpressed Wnt-1 and Frat activated LEF-1 but did not show significant inhibition of GSK-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. However, mAkt could act synergistically with Wnt-1 or Frat to activate LEF-1. In addition, the interaction of GSK for Axin appeared to decrease in the presence of mAkt, whereas the interaction for Frat remained unchanged. Consistently, a GSK mutant with substitution of a Phe residue for residue Tyr-216, which showed one-fifth of kinase activity of the wild-type GSK, exhibited a reduced association for Axin than the wild-type GSK. These results suggest that inhibition of GSK kinase activity is not sufficient for activation of LEF-1 but may facilitate the activation by reducing the interaction of GSK for Axin. The additional mechanism for LEF-1 activation may require dissociation of GSK from Axin as Frat facilitates the dissociation of GSK from Axin.

Zeste-White 3 glycogen synthase kinase adenomatous polyposis coli dishevelled green fluorescence protein GSK-binding protein β-galactosidase leukemia enhancer factor-1 hemagglutinin wingless The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins is one of the major families of developmentally important signaling molecules and plays important roles in embryonic induction, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate. Wnt pathways are also closely linked to tumorigenesis. A large amount of knowledge about Wnt-mediated signal transduction comes from genetic studies in Drosophila. A genetic order of these signal transducers has been established, in which Wg appears to negatively regulate Zeste-White 3 (Zw3)1 through Dishevelled (Dsh), thus relieving the suppression of Armadillo by Zw3 with a net result of up-regulation of Armadillo. Armadillo interacts with Pangolin-regulating gene transcription. Recent evidence suggests that the Frizzled proteins may function as receptors for Wnt (for review, see Refs. 1Dickinson M.E.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Fly zw3 mutants and frog embryos expressing dominant negative mutants of GSK-3β showed phenotypes consistent with constitutive activation of the β-catenin by the Wnt pathway (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). This led to a model suggesting that Wnt inhibits GSK activity. Additionally, soluble Wg was shown to inhibit GSK activity in mouse fibroblasts (12Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Dale T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism by which Wnt inhibits GSK, presumably via Dsh/Dvl, remains to be elucidated, it appears to be better understood how GSK leads to regulation of gene transcription via β-catenin and transcription factors LEF-1/T cell factor (13Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

GSK-3β was initially found to form a complex with β-catenin and the product of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (16Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 17Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence indicated that Axin and its homologs are also part of the complex (18Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 19Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Axin binds directly to GSK-3β, β-catenin, and APC, whereas APC also directly binds to GSK-3β and β-catenin. GSK-3β is shown to phosphorylate β-catenin and APC. The phosphorylation is believed to play a role in promoting the degradation of β-catenin via the ubiquitination pathway (21Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Axin and its homologs were also proposed to be involved in the degradation process (20Behrens J. Jerchow B. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). One of the models suggests that Axin functions as a scaffold protein to bring GSK and β-catenin together, thus facilitating the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK (18Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). APC was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in APC that correlate to human colorectal cancers appear to lose the ability to destabilize β-catenin (16Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is regulated by phosphotidylinositide-3 kinases (22Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Many extracellular stimuli activate phosphotidylinositide-3 kinases via growth factor receptors and G protein-coupled receptors. Akt-mediated signaling has been subjected to intense study and found to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including anti-apoptosis, stimulation of protein synthesis and gene transcription, and regulation of metabolism. GSK is one of well characterized substrates and effectors of Akt. Akt can phosphorylate both GSK-3α and -3β and inhibit their kinase activity (22Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 23Hawkins P.T. Welch H. McGreger A. Gobert S. Krugmann S. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Stephens L. Biochem. Soc.

Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel GSK regulator, GSK-binding protein (GBP), was identified from Xenopus for its ability to bind to GSK and inhibit phosphorylation of tau proteins when GBP and tau were coexpressed in Xenopus embryos (26Yost C. Farr G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog of GBP, named Frat, has previously been cloned independently for its tumor-promoting activity in lymphocytes (27Jonkers J. Korswagen H.C. Acton D. Breuer M. Berns A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Frat can also bind to GSK (26Yost C. Farr G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The precise role of the interaction between GSK and GBP/Frat is not clear. However, ectopic overexpression of GBP or its C-terminal GSK-binding domain could mimic the effects of Wnt in Xenopus(26Yost C. Farr G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), suggesting that GBP/Frat mediate either Wnt-1 signaling or a different pathway that can interact with Wnt-1s. We and others (28Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Carriso A.M. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 29Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) have previously shown that Wnt-1 activates LEF-1 in transfected mammalian cells using a reporter gene assay. In this report, we investigate the effect of Akt and Frat on regulation of LEF-1. Although Akt potently inhibited the kinases activity of GSK, Akt alone showed little effect on activation of LEF-1-dependent transcription. On the other hand, expression of Frat led to LEF-1 activation, but we could not observe any inhibition of GSK kinase activity by Frat. These results suggest that inhibition of GSK is not sufficient for activation of LEF-1 and that additional mechanism is required. Moreover, Akt can act synergistically with Wnt-1 or Frat in LEF-1 activation. This synergistic effect may be explained by the finding that phosphorylation of GSK by Akt attenuates the apparent affinity of GSK for Axin, although not affecting the affinity of GSK for Frat. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For the luciferase assays, cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 24-well plates the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg DNA/well using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.), as suggested by the manufacturer. For kinase and immunoprecipitation assays, transfection was carried out in 12-well plates. The number of cells and amount of DNA were increased in proportions. Transfection was stopped by switching to normal growth medium after 3 h. Cell extracts were collected 24 h later for the luciferase assays, immunoprecipitation, and Western analysis. The constructs used in this study have previously been described (28Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Carriso A.M. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed using Roche Biochemical constant light luciferase assay kit. Cell lysates were first taken for determining fluorescence intensity emitted by coexpressed green fluorescence protein (GFP) proteins in a Wallac multilabel counter, which is capable of measuring fluorescence and luminescence. Then, luciferase substrate was added to the cell lysates, and luciferase activities were determined by measuring luminescence intensity using the same counter. Luminescence intensity was normalized against fluorescence intensity. Cells were lysed with the lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmpyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Biochemical). The cell lysates were precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 0.5 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 1 μl of anti-tag antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) and 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 3.5 h on ice. The immunocomplexes were pelleted and washed 4 times with cold lysis buffer. For Western analysis, proteins were released from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The samples were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Results were visualized using a blot imaging system with a cooled CCD camera (Raytest USA, Inc., New Castle, DE). For the kinase assays, the immunocomplexes were pelleted and washed 3 times with cold lysis buffer and twice with cold kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μmATP, and a GSK peptide substrate (phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The reactions were terminated by addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled and loaded on 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The results were visualized and quantified using a phosphoimager (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). The effect of Akt on activation of LEF-1 was evaluated by determining whether the activated Akt can activate LEF-1-dependent transcription. The Akt mutant, mAkt, carrying a myristylation signal from Src, has been shown to be constitutively active (30Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). LEF-1 activity was determined using a reporter gene assay, in which multiple LEF-1 response elements were placed in front of a minimal promoter and a luciferase gene. We and others (19Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3020-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 28Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Carriso A.M. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) have used this assay system to measure Wnt-1-induced LEF-1 activation in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig.1, mAkt alone, unlike Wnt-1, did not activate LEF-1-dependent transcription, but it could act synergistically with Wnt-1 in activation of LEF-1. The effect of Akt on the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin was also examined. Akt could not elevate the level of cytosolic β-catenin, whereas Wnt-1 could (Fig. 1 C). To confirm that mAkt can indeed inhibit GSK activity in our assay system, we evaluated the GSK kinase activity by measuring the phosphorylation of a GSK substrate peptide derived from glycogen synthase by immunoprecipitated GSK. As previously reported (31Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), mAkt, when coexpressed with GSK, significantly inhibited the kinase activity of GSK. However, coexpression of Wnt-1 did not significantly affect the kinase activity of GSK (Fig.1 A). We also determined the effect of Frat, the mammalian GBP homolog, on LEF-1 activation and GSK kinase activity. Consistent with the Wnt-like effect of GBP/Frat on Xenopus embryo development (26Yost C. Farr G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), expression of Frat-1 elevated the level of cytosolic β-catenin (Fig.1 C) and stimulated LEF-1-dependent transcriptional activity in 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B). In addition, Frat, like Wnt-1, could act synergistically with Akt in LEF-1 activation (Fig. 1 B). However, expression of Frat-1 did not inhibit the kinase activity of GSK as measured by phosphorylation of the GSK peptide substrate. Instead, we consistently observed some increases in the activity. To further confirm the result that Frat does not inhibit the kinase activity of GSK, we compared the ability of GSK pulled down by Frat with that of GSK pulled down directly by antibody or via Axin to phosphorylate the GSK peptide substrate. In this way, it would be more likely to measure the activity of the GSK molecules bound to Frat. After normalization of the amounts of GSK proteins pulled down via different means, we found that Frat still showed no inhibitory effect on the GSK activity (Fig. 2, Aand B). As a control, Axin did not show any effect on the GSK activity (Fig. 2, A and B), which is in agreement with a previous finding (18Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The level and specific activity of endogenous GSK were compared with those of Myc-tagged recombinant GSK proteins (Fig. 2 C). The expression levels and specific activities of endogenous and recombinant GSK proteins are similar. To gain insights into the possible mechanism for the synergistic interaction between the Wnt and Akt pathways in regulation of LEF-1, we investigated the effect of Akt on interactions between Axin and GSK and between Frat and GSK. The interactions were studied using coimmunoprecipitation. Both Frat and Axin contain HA epitope tags, whereas GSK is Myc-tagged. When Akt was coexpressed with GSK and Axin, the presence of Akt decreased the amount of GSK immunoprecipitated by Axin (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that inhibition of GSK activity may lead to reduction in the interaction of GSK for Axin. To corroborate this finding, we used a GSK mutant with a substitution of a Phe residue for residue Tyr-217. This GSK-YF mutant showed reduced kinase activity as shown in Fig.3 A, and it also pulled down less Axin than the wild-type GSK. Thus, these results suggest that the activity of GSK may positively correlate with the affinity for Axin. In contrast, the presence of Akt appeared to have little effect on the amount of GSK coimmunoprecipitated with Frat (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, GSK-YF pulled the same amount of Frat as the wild-type. Therefore, the kinase activity of GSK may have little to do with the interaction for Frat (Fig. 3 B). To further characterize the mechanism for Frat-mediated LEF-1 activation, we investigated the effect of Frat on the interaction between GSK and Axin. Cells were transfected with GSK and Axin in the presence and absence of Frat. GSK was immunoprecipitated, and the levels of Axin in the immunocomplexes were detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, a significantly less amount of Axin was coimmunoprecipitated in the presence of Frat than in its absence. Thus, it appears that Frat facilitates the dissociation of GSK from Axin. In this report, we have demonstrated that the inhibition of GSK kinase activity by Akt is not sufficient for activation of LEF-1 and that Frat does not directly inhibit the catalytic activity of GSK. Similar results were also observed for the Xenopus homolog GBP; GBP did not inhibit phosphorylation of the peptide substrate by immunoprecipitated GSK, 2D. Kimelman, personal communication.although GBP/Frat were found to inhibit GSK-mediated phosphorylation of tau proteins (26Yost C. Farr G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We interpret these results to suggest that Frat/GBP may inhibit GSK-mediated phosphorylation of large substrates probably via steric hindrance, whereas Frat/GBP may not decrease the intrinsic catalytic activity of GSK as measured by phosphorylation of peptide substrates. Inconsistent with a previous observation (12Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Dale T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) that Wg proteins inhibited the phosphorylation of the peptide substrate by GSK in mouse 10T1/2 cells, we did not observe inhibition of GSK by coexpressed Wnt-1. This apparent discrepancy may be the result of the differences in the assay systems; soluble Wg versuscoexpressed Wnt-1 was used. Wg-induced inhibition of GSK appeared to be transient. Such a transient phenomenon would be difficult to be observed in the coexpression assay. The synergistic effect between Wnt and Akt suggests that growth factor-linked and G protein-linked pathways can potentially interact with the Wnt pathway, although the precise physiological relevance of this interaction is not clear. The fact that Akt also showed synergistic effect with Frat suggests that the interaction between Akt and the Wnt pathway may lie near or downstream of GSK if Frat activates LEF-1 by acting directly on GSK. Our current interpretation for the synergistic effect of Akt on Wnt-1-mediated LEF-1 activation is that Akt may weaken the interaction between GSK and Axin by suppression of GSK kinase activity. This idea is based on our observations that the wild-type GSK in the presence of Akt and the GSK-YF mutant with less intrinsic kinase activity showed lower apparent affinities for Axin but retained the same apparent affinity for Frat. Attenuation of the interaction of GSK-YF for Axin has been previously reported (18Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). It is, however, not clear how the kinase activity of GSK correlates with its apparent affinity for Axin. Residue Tyr-216, which is similar to those frequently referred to as activation loop sites found in many protein kinases, may be autophosphorylated (33Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or phosphorylated by unknown tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of activation loop sites usually lead to activation of the kinases. The reduced activity of GSK-YF, which was also observed with GSK-YF produced from insect cells (34Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), agrees with this notion. The current model for activation of LEF-1/T cell factor by Wnt proteins is that Wnt acts through Dvl to inhibit GSK. This model is mainly based on studies with Xenopus using dominant negative mutants of GSK in Xenopus(5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that inhibition of GSK kinase activity may not be sufficient for LEF-1 activation, suggesting that there may be more to the current understanding of the pathway, at least in mammalian cells. The involvement of GSK in Wnt signaling appears to be different between Xenopus and mammalian cells. Although the kinase-deficient mutants of GSK are potent inducers of Wnt-like phenotypes in Xenopus embryos, they showed no effect on LEF-1 activation in mammalian cells (Ref. 35Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholarand data not shown). Because Akt alone was also shown not to affect Wnt pathways in Xenopus (36Torres M.A. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with our finding, it is possible that the kinase-deficient mutants of GSK may exert additional effects in Xenopus embryos. Nevertheless, suppression of GSK kinase activity could have a significant effect on LEF-1 activation if we assume that Akt acts synergistically with Wnt by inhibiting GSK. The finding that GSK molecules with attenuated kinase activity have lower apparent affinities for Axin suggests that dissociation of GSK from Axin might be an important step leading to LEF-1 activation. This hypothesis is consistent with a current model that Axin facilitates the phosphorylation of β-catenin by bringing β-catenin and GSK together (18Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) and is supported by our findings that Frat activates LEF-1 and aids the dissociation of GSK from Axin. It is possible that Wnt-1 acts in a way similar to Frat or via Frat. In fact, we have found that Frat can interact with Dvl and that the Dvl-interacting domain of Frat can inhibit Wnt-1-induced LEF-1 activation (37Li R. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, Dvl may recruit Frat to interact with GSK leading to dissociation of GSK from Axin. Reduction in the association of GSK for Axin led by either phosphorylation by Akt or attenuation in kinase activity by YF mutation would understandably facilitate the dissociation of GSK from Axin. The molecular mechanisms by which Wnt and Dvl regulate the stability of β-catenin and activation of LEF-1 via GSK, Frat, and Axin is now under investigation. We thank A. McMahon, R. Grosschedl, F.

Humans express five granzymes: granzyme B (grB) which cleaves after Asp residues (Asp-ase) (2Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon M. Sigal N.H. Wu J.K. Zweerink H.J. J. Biol.

Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6195-6205PubMed Google Scholar); and grH, whose substrate specificity is unknown (6Klein J.L. Selvakumar A. Trapani J.A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1990; 35: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Hanson R.D. Hohn P.A. Popescu N.C. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to activate pro-apoptotic caspases and mimic the cleavage of their downstream substrates, grB has been strongly implicated in inducing perforin-dependent target cell apoptosis (8Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 9Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

Kam C-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Putative nonapoptotic functions have been described for grA, including B lymphocyte mitogenesis, thrombin activation, induction of cytokine secretion by monocytes, and cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins (proteoglycans, type IV collagens, lamin, and fibronectin), thus potentially facilitating T and NK cell migration through the subendothelial matrix (4Peitsch M.C.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 2585-2590PubMed Google Scholar).Mice express at least nine granzymes, several of which including granzymes D, E, F, G, and possibly grC display chymotrypsin-like (chymase) activity. This type of proteolytic activity has been postulated to be important for enhancing the membranolytic properties of perforin (14Woodard S.L. Fraser S.A. Winkler U. Jackson D.S. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4988-4993PubMed Google Scholar), although this view has remained controversial. Human CTL/NK cell granules have high levels of chymase activity, but the enzyme responsible for this activity has yet to be identified, and to date, no human granzyme with chymase activity has been found (1Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). As grH has no direct rodent counterpart and is the only human granzyme whose enzyme activity remains unknown, it has been postulated to be responsible for the chymase activity seen in human granule extracts. GrH is a close structural relative of grB, and shares 71% amino acid identity with it (6Klein J.L. Selvakumar A. Trapani J.A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1990; 35: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The genes encoding the two molecules map within 30 kilobases on chromosome 14, and form part of the serine protease gene cluster that also contains a number of cathepsin genes expressed in mast cells and myeloid cells (15Caughey G.H. Schaumberg T.H. Zerweck E.H. Butterfield J.H. Hanson R.D. Silverman G.A. Ley T.J. Genomics. 1993; 3: 614-620Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been proposed that interlocus recombination between the ancestral grB and grH genes led to substitution of exon 3, intron 3 and part of exon 4 in grH by grB sequences (16Haddad P. Jenne D. Tschopp J. Clement M.V. Mathieu-Mahul D. Sasportes M. Int. Immunol. 1991; 1: 57-66Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GrB is expressed by both CTL and NK cells, but it has recently been demonstrated that the 5′ noncoding regions of the grH gene can confer NK-specific expression of a reporter gene expressed in mice (17MacIvor D.M. Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 963-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation between grB and grH has made detecting and purifying these two granzymes and production of monospecific reagents problematic, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results obtained with antibody or even nucleic acid probes (18Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it still remains to be determined whether grH is expressed solely in human NK cells or in a broader array of lymphocytes.To clarify the many issues of granzyme structure and biological function raised above, we found it desirable to produce recombinant, enzymatically active grH. Here we report that grH expressed in, and purified following baculovirus expression in Sf21 insect cells has strong chymase but no tryptase or Asp-ase activity. However, like grB, it is capable of uptake into potential target cells in endosome-like vesicles.DISCUSSIONAlthough granzymes were first isolated many years ago (27Masson D. Tschopp J. Cell. 1987; 49: 679-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the inability to express them in large quantities and to assess the effects of site-specific mutations has hindered the study of their complex and varied biological functions. Granzymes are conventionally purified from cultures of cytolytic lymphocytes or NK leukemia cell lines that co-express many proteolytic enzymes with different specificities (2Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon M. Sigal N.H. Wu J.K. Zweerink H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Powers J.C. Kam C.-M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,5Smyth M.J. Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6195-6205PubMed Google Scholar, 18Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given the close physico-chemical similarities between various granzymes (especially grB and grH), it has been difficult to ensure that apparently pure granzyme preparations are not contaminated with minuscule quantities of other proteases. Thus, it has been argued that small amounts of rat RNK-chymase-1 co-purified with perforin or grB might be responsible for amplifying the pro-apoptotic synergy observed with these two molecules, perhaps by modifying the structure of perforin (14Woodard S.L. Fraser S.A. Winkler U. Jackson D.S. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4988-4993PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of large quantities of recombinant granzymes should enable such issues to be resolved and, additionally, should provide sufficient purified enzyme to attempt formal structural analysis by crystallographic or other means. Previous studies based on x-ray crystallographic studies have demonstrated that Gly226 of chymotrypsin A is important for conferring its chymase activity, and this observation has been used to design grM mutants that lose their ability to cleave at Met but acquire chymotrypsin-like activity (28Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Trapani J.A. Kershaw M.H. Brinkworth R.I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4174-4181PubMed Google Scholar). As with the equivalent residue in granzymes, Gly226 is situated at the base of the predicted substrate pocket of chymotrypsin A, and the small size of Gly is postulated to permit bulky hydrophobic side chains to be accommodated and cleaved. In an analogous manner, it has been predicted using computer modeling that Arg208 occupies the corresponding position in grB (29Caputo A. James M.N. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This residue has indeed recently been shown to be important for conferring the substrate specificity of grB, in that it is capable of electrostatically attracting the negatively charged acidic side chains of Asp or Glu (29Caputo A. James M.N. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that position 208 of the structurally related grH is Gly, in keeping with the observed chymotrypsin-like activity of this granzyme, as described in the present study.Like many chymases, grH is capable of cleaving polypeptides at a variety of different P1 amino acids. While our study demonstrated a clear preference for Phe or Tyr but not Trp, a number of smaller, unbranched hydrophobic or even polar residues were cleaved with some efficiency. Interestingly, the rat RNK-chymase-1 has specificity for Phe and Trp, but does not cleave efficiently after Tyr residues (14Woodard S.L. Fraser S.A. Winkler U. Jackson D.S. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4988-4993PubMed Google Scholar). If grH and RNK-chymase-1 have analogous functions and thus cleave common substrates in their respective species, this variation in cleavage preference may be useful in delineating candidate cleavage sites of substrate proteins. By contrast with these two chymases, grB and grA cleave target proteins almost exclusively at acidic (Asp, Glu) or basic (Lys, Arg) residues, respectively (2Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon M. Sigal N.H. Wu J.K. Zweerink H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Powers J.C. Kam C.-M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another possibility consequence of the broad spectrum of cleavage for grH and RNK-chymase-1 is that their physiological substrates might possibly be targeted at a number of different sites, but this prediction awaits verification when cellular substrates of these two granzymes are identified and the cleavage sites defined.Our studies have also demonstrated for the first time that like grB (9Trapani J.A.

Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), grH is potentially capable of uptake into the target cell cytoplasm in vesicles highly reminiscent of those containing grB. This finding raises many issues related to the intracellular trafficking and ultimately the functions of granzymes. First, what is the nature of cell surface granzyme receptors, and do specific receptors exist for granzymes of different proteolytic specificity? Second, is there a requirement for proteolytic activity of a granzyme for its cellular uptake and trafficking between intracellular compartments? Third, can different granzymes be taken up into the same endosome? And finally, what are the physiological function of granzymes other than grB inside target cells? We have recently shown that the cytolytic granules of CTL/NK cells contain multiple different pathways for achieving target cell apoptosis. Some of these pathways rely on the Asp-ase activity of grB and/or the activation of caspases; however, cell death can still proceed with remarkable efficiency independently of the Asp-ase activity of grB, as indicated both by our own work with purified pro-apoptotic molecules and findings in vivo with grB-deficient mice (32Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, apoptosis occurring independently of grB can occur through a non-nuclear pathway, suggesting that cytoplasmic or cell membrane substrates of alternative granzymes might be instrumental in mediating this form of cell death (33Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar, 34Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ability to produce large amounts of granzyme of various specificity by recombinant means should facilitate the study of this and related questions. Granzymes are serine proteases expressed exclusively by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)1 and natural killer (NK) cells, and stored with a pore-forming protein, perforin, in lysosome-like secretory granules (1Smyth M.J.

Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6195-6205PubMed Google Scholar); and grH, whose substrate specificity is unknown (6Klein J.L. Selvakumar A. Trapani J.A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1990; 35: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Hanson R.D. Hohn P.A. Popescu N.C. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to activate pro-apoptotic caspases and mimic the cleavage of their downstream substrates, grB has been strongly implicated in inducing perforin-dependent target cell apoptosis (8Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 9Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4127-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but this function can also be carried out with lesser efficiency by grA and tryptase-2 (10Shi L. Kam C-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Putative nonapoptotic functions have been described for grA, including B lymphocyte mitogenesis, thrombin activation, induction of cytokine secretion by monocytes, and cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins (proteoglycans, type IV collagens, lamin, and fibronectin), thus potentially facilitating T and NK cell migration through the subendothelial matrix (4Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Irmler M. Hertig S. MacDonald H.R. Sadoul R. Becherer D. Proudfoot A. Solari R. Tschopp J. J. Exp.

Mice express at least nine granzymes, several of which including granzymes D, E, F, G, and possibly grC display chymotrypsin-like (chymase) activity. This type of proteolytic activity has been postulated to be important for enhancing the membranolytic properties of perforin (14Woodard S.L. Fraser S.A. Winkler U. Jackson D.S. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4988-4993PubMed Google Scholar), although this view has remained controversial. Human CTL/NK cell granules have high levels of chymase activity, but the enzyme responsible for this activity has yet to be identified, and to date, no human granzyme with chymase activity has been found (1Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). As grH has no direct rodent counterpart and is the only human granzyme whose enzyme activity remains unknown, it has been postulated to be responsible for the chymase activity seen in human granule extracts. GrH is a close structural relative of grB, and shares 71% amino acid identity with it (6Klein J.L. Selvakumar A. Trapani J.A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1990; 35: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The genes encoding the two molecules map within 30 kilobases on chromosome 14, and form part of the serine protease gene cluster that also contains a number of cathepsin genes expressed in mast cells and myeloid cells (15Caughey G.H. Schaumberg T.H. Zerweck E.H. Butterfield J.H. Hanson R.D. Silverman G.A. Ley T.J. Genomics. 1993; 3: 614-620Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been proposed that interlocus recombination between the ancestral grB and grH genes led to substitution of exon 3, intron 3 and part of exon 4 in grH by grB sequences (16Haddad P. Jenne D. Tschopp J. Clement M.V. Mathieu-Mahul D. Sasportes M. Int. Immunol. 1991; 1: 57-66Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GrB is expressed by both CTL and NK cells, but it has recently been demonstrated that the 5′ noncoding regions of the grH gene can confer NK-specific expression of a reporter gene expressed in mice (17MacIvor D.M. Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 963-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation between grB and grH has made detecting and purifying these two granzymes and production of monospecific reagents problematic, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results obtained with antibody or even nucleic acid probes (18Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it still remains to be determined whether grH is expressed solely in human NK cells or in a broader array of lymphocytes. To clarify the many issues of granzyme structure and biological function raised above, we found it desirable to produce recombinant, enzymatically active grH. Here we report that grH expressed in, and purified following baculovirus expression in Sf21 insect cells has strong chymase but no tryptase or Asp-ase activity. However, like grB, it is capable of uptake into potential target cells in endosome-like vesicles. DISCUSSIONAlthough granzymes were first isolated many years ago (27Masson D. Tschopp J. Cell. 1987; 49: 679-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the inability to express them in large quantities and to assess the effects of site-specific mutations has hindered the study of their complex and varied biological functions. Granzymes are conventionally purified from cultures of cytolytic lymphocytes or NK leukemia cell lines that co-express many proteolytic enzymes with different specificities (2Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon M. Sigal N.H. Wu J.K. Zweerink H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Powers J.C. Kam C.-M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,5Smyth M.J. Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6195-6205PubMed Google Scholar, 18Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given the close physico-chemical similarities between various granzymes (especially grB and grH), it has been difficult to ensure that apparently pure granzyme preparations are not contaminated with minuscule quantities of other proteases. Thus, it has been argued that small amounts of rat RNK-chymase-1 co-purified with perforin or grB might be responsible for amplifying the pro-apoptotic synergy observed with these two molecules, perhaps by modifying the structure of perforin (14Woodard S.L. Fraser S.A. Winkler U. Jackson D.S. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4988-4993PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of large quantities of recombinant granzymes should enable such issues to be resolved and, additionally, should provide sufficient purified enzyme to attempt formal structural analysis by crystallographic or other means. Previous studies based on x-ray crystallographic studies have demonstrated that Gly226 of chymotrypsin A is important for conferring its chymase activity, and this observation has been used to design grM mutants that lose their ability to cleave at Met but acquire chymotrypsin-like activity (28Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Trapani J.A. Kershaw M.H. Brinkworth R.I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4174-4181PubMed Google Scholar). As with the equivalent residue in granzymes, Gly226 is situated at the base of the predicted substrate pocket of chymotrypsin A, and the small size of Gly is postulated to permit bulky hydrophobic side chains to be accommodated and cleaved. In an analogous manner, it has been predicted using computer modeling that Arg208 occupies the corresponding position in grB (29Caputo A. James M.N. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This residue has indeed recently been shown to be important for conferring the substrate specificity of grB, in that it is capable of electrostatically attracting the negatively charged acidic side chains of Asp or Glu (29Caputo A. James M.N. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that position 208 of the structurally related grH is Gly, in keeping with the observed chymotrypsin-like activity of this granzyme, as described in the present study.Like many chymases, grH is capable of cleaving polypeptides at a variety of different P1 amino acids. While our study demonstrated a clear preference for Phe or Tyr but not Trp, a number of smaller, unbranched hydrophobic or even polar residues were cleaved with some efficiency. Interestingly, the rat RNK-chymase-1 has specificity for Phe and Trp, but does not cleave efficiently after Tyr residues (14Woodard S.L. Fraser S.A. Winkler U. Jackson D.S. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4988-4993PubMed Google Scholar). If grH and RNK-chymase-1 have analogous functions and thus cleave common substrates in their respective species, this variation in cleavage preference may be useful in delineating candidate cleavage sites of substrate proteins. By contrast with these two chymases, grB and grA cleave target proteins almost exclusively at acidic (Asp, Glu) or basic (Lys, Arg) residues, respectively (2Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon M.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another possibility consequence of the broad spectrum of cleavage for grH and RNK-chymase-1 is that their physiological substrates might possibly be targeted at a number of different sites, but this prediction awaits verification when cellular substrates of these two granzymes are identified and the cleavage sites defined.Our studies have also demonstrated for the first time that like grB (9Trapani J.A.

Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), grH is potentially capable of uptake into the target cell cytoplasm in vesicles highly reminiscent of those containing grB. This finding raises many issues related to the intracellular trafficking and ultimately the functions of granzymes. First, what is the nature of cell surface granzyme receptors, and do specific receptors exist for granzymes of different proteolytic specificity? Second, is there a requirement for proteolytic activity of a granzyme for its cellular uptake and trafficking between intracellular compartments? Third, can different granzymes be taken up into the same endosome? And finally, what are the physiological function of granzymes other than grB inside target cells? We have recently shown that the cytolytic granules of CTL/NK cells contain multiple different pathways for achieving target cell apoptosis. Some of these pathways rely on the Asp-ase activity of grB and/or the activation of caspases; however, cell death can still proceed with remarkable efficiency independently of the Asp-ase activity of grB, as indicated both by our own work with purified pro-apoptotic molecules and findings in vivo with grB-deficient mice (32Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, apoptosis occurring independently of grB can occur through a non-nuclear pathway, suggesting that cytoplasmic or cell membrane substrates of alternative granzymes might be instrumental in mediating this form of cell death (33Sutton V. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar, 34Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Immunol.

https://openalex.org/W2107665469,"The transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) reportedly plays an important role in the induction of neoplastic transformation and multiple genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. To investigate the mechanisms of silica-induced carcinogenesis, AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice were used as an in vivo model, whereas the JB6 mouse epidermal cell line and a rat lung epithelial cell line were employed as in vitro models to study the effects of silica at the molecular level. Freshly fractured silica caused an 8-fold increase in AP-1 activity in JB6 cells and a 2.5-fold increase in rat lung epithelial cells. The induction of AP-1 activity in cultured cell lines was time- and dose-dependent. Intratracheal administration of silica was also able to induce AP-1 transactivation in transgenic mice. AP-1 activation was first observed at 2 days after silica administration and reached its maximum at 3 days post-exposure of the mice to silica. The signal transduction pathways for AP-1 activation were also investigated using these cell lines. The results demonstrate that freshly fractured silica stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, as determined by the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs). Inhibition of ERKs with PD98059 or of p38 with SB203580 significantly inhibited silica-induced AP-1 activation. These findings demonstrate for the first time that freshly fractured silica induces AP-1 activation, which may be mediated through p38 MAPK and ERK pathways.

Unraveling the complex mechanisms associated with these events may provide insights into the initiation and progression of silica-induced carcinogenesis. Epidemiologic and pathologic studies have established that occupational exposure to crystalline silica is associated with the development of acute and chronic pulmonary silicosis (1Reiser K.M. Last J.A. Toxicology. 1979; 13: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Craighead J.E. Vallyathan N.V. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1980; 244: 1939-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Acute silicosis usually occurs in individuals who work in occupations where silica is fractured or ground into fine powder by mechanical processes. Acute silicosis becomes clinically apparent within 2–5 years after exposure and frequently results in death due to hypoxia (3Ziskind M. Jones R.N. Weill H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1976; 113: 643-665PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic silicosis occurs in workers with prolonged exposure to silica-containing dusts, with clinically apparent disease developing after 20 or more years of exposure (3Ziskind M. Jones R.N. Weill H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1976; 113: 643-665PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increasing evidence obtained from epidemiologic and laboratory animal studies in recent years suggests that crystalline silica may be a carcinogen (4IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risk Chem. Hum. 1987; 42 (International Agency for Research on Cancer): 1-239PubMed Google Scholar,5IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risk Hum. 1997; 68 (International Agency for Research on Cancer): 1-475PubMed Google Scholar). For example, inhalation of silica has been shown to be carcinogenic in rats, whereas intratracheal instillation has been shown to be carcinogenic in other animals (6Wehner A.P. Dagle G.E. Clark M.L. Buschbom R.L. Environ. Res. 1986; 40: 499-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Johnson N.F. Smith D.M. Sebring R. Holland L.M. Am. J. Ind.

Intrapleural administration of crystalline silica in rats leads to the induction of localized malignant histiocytic lymphomas. Epidemiologic studies also show that there is an increased lung cancer risk in many, but not all, human subjects with silicosis (4IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risk Chem. Hum. 1987; 42 (International Agency for Research on Cancer): 1-239PubMed Google Scholar, 5IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risk Hum. 1997; 68 (International Agency for Research on Cancer): 1-475PubMed Google Scholar). Based on current evidence obtained from studies on laboratory animals and epidemiologic studies on humans, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified crystalline silica as a human class 1 carcinogen (5IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risk Hum. 1997; 68 (International Agency for Research on Cancer): 1-475PubMed Google Scholar). Although silica is now a documented carcinogen, the molecular mechanisms involved in silica-induced carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that silica causes direct DNA damage and mammalian cell transformation, including binding with deoxyribonucleic acid, which has been used as an in vitroanalog of cancer induction (10Shi X. Mao Y. Daniel L.N. Saffiotti U. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102 Suppl. 10: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar, 11Daniel L.N. Mao Y. Williams A.O. Saffiotti U. Scand. J. Work. Environ. Health. 1995; 21, Suppl, 2: 22-26PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies have demonstrated that freshly fractured silica is capable of generating hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) upon reaction with aqueous media (12Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1988; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir.

Many stimuli, including the tumor promoter TPA and reactive oxygen species, regulate AP-1 binding to the DNA of the promoter region of a number of intermediate genes that govern inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis (21Ryseck R.P.

AP-1 and its regulated gene expression have been reported to play important roles in neoplastic transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis (24Bernstein L.R. Colburn N.H.

On the basis of the importance of AP-1 activity in tumor promotion and progression, we hypothesized that the carcinogenic effect of silica may be mediated through the activation of AP-1 activity. To test this hypothesis, we used JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cells and rat lung epithelial cells as in vitro models and AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice as an in vivo model for these studies. The JB6 family of mouse epidermal clonal genetic variants that are P+ or P− provides a suitable model for studying critical gene regulation events that occur during carcinogenesis (28Colburn N.H.

Carcinog. 1992; 6: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The signal transduction cascades involved in AP-1 activation were also investigated. We demonstrate here that freshly fractured silica induces AP-1 activation in both in vivo and in vitro systems and that this activation appears to occur through the ERK1, ERK2, and p38 kinase signal transduction pathways. activator protein-1 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase minimal essential medium mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK/ERK kinase rat lung epithelial fetal bovine serum c-Jun N-terminal kinase Eagle's MEM was obtained from Whittaker Biosciences (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum, gentamicin, and l-glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Luciferase assay substrate was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). PhosphoPlus MAPK Antibody kits were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The rat lung epithelial cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid (collagenase-luciferase) and the CMV-neo vector plasmid were constructed as reported previously (30Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Mol. Cell.

Crystalline silica was obtained from the Pennsylvania State University Genetic Center (State College, PA). The detailed method for preparation of the freshly fractured silica has been described elsewhere (13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 138: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, crystalline silica (0.2–10 mm in diameter) was ground for 30 min using a ball grinder equipped with agate balls. The ground silica was sieved through a 10-μm mesh filter for 20 min before use. Purity was checked using x-ray analysis and morphometric analysis, which indicated that the ground silica had a mean diameter of 3.7 μm. RLE cells were transfected with the AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid and the G418-selecting plasmid pcDNA3-CMV-neo. Fifteen individual clones were selected by ring isolation and cultured in F12K medium containing 10% FBS and G418 (200 μg/ml) for 30 days. Stable transfectants were screened by assaying for luciferase activity following stimulation with TPA or vanadate. A stable transfectant (RLE/AP02) was established and cultured in G418-free medium for the experiments. The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line, which was stably transfected with the AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid (JB6/AP/κB) (34Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar), was cultured in Eagle's MEM containing 5% FBS2, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The RLE cell line, stably transfected with the AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid (RLE/AP02), was cultured in F12K medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A confluent monolayer of JB6/AP/κB cells was trypsinized, and 5 × 104 viable cells (suspended in 1 ml of Eagle's MEM supplemented with 5% FBS) were added to each well of a 24-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Twelve hours later, cells were cultured in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 12–24 h to minimize basal AP-1 activity and then exposed to silica in the same medium to monitor the effects on AP-1 induction. The cells were extracted with 200 μl of 1× lysis buffer provided in the luciferase assay kit by the manufacturer, and the luciferase activity was measured. The results are expressed as relative AP-1 activity compared with controls. The AP-1 activity assay for RLE/AP02 cells was similar to that described for JB6 cells, except that in RLE cells, F12K medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was used. AP-1-luciferase reporter (2× TPA response element-binding sites) transgenic mice were originally established by Rincon and Flavell (35Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A C57BL/6 male mouse carrying the 2× TPA response element-luciferase transgene was crossed with a DBA2 female (SASCO, Omaha, NE) (36Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The offspring were screened for the presence of the AP-1-luciferase reporter gene by testing the TPA-induced level of luciferase activity. Males and females were housed separately in solid-bottom polycarbonate cages on ventilated animal racks (four to five mice per cage) under temperature-, humidity-, and yellow light-controlled conditions. Food and water were availablead libitum. The AP-1-luciferase reporter-bearing male and female mice (8–12 weeks old) were randomly divided into six groups consisting of eight mice in each group. Freshly fractured silica was suspended in 0.9% sterile NaCl (70 mg/ml) and was administered at 0.07 ml/mouse (5 mg) with an intratracheal cannula after the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Control mice were instilled intratracheally with 0.07 ml of 0.9% sterile NaCl/mouse. One to four days after intratracheal instillation of silica, the mice were sacrificed by exsanguination under deep pentobarbital anesthesia. Lung tissue was removed and minced with scissors. Lysis buffer (100 μl/10 mg of tissue) was added, and the tissues were lysed overnight at 4 °C. The luciferase activity of the tissue supernatant obtained after lysis was measured with a luminometer as described previously (36Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). AP-1 activity is expressed relative to the level of luciferase activity of controls. Immunoblotting for phosphorylation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase was carried out as described by the protocol of New England Biolabs Inc. using phospho-specific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase, respectively. Non-phospho-specific antibodies against ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase proteins provided in each assay kit were used to normalize the phosphorylation assay using the same transferred membrane blot. Gel shift assays were performed to detect AP-1 binding activity after exposure to silica. The nuclear extracts and the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide were prepared as described previously (34Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 binding site (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) was synthesized and labeled with [32P]dCTP. Nuclear proteins (3–5 μg), extracted from cells exposed to silica, were mixed with the labeled probe and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. The data presented are the means ± S.E. of values compared and analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t test for paired data and is considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. To study the AP-1 induction by silica in pulmonary cells, we established a stable AP-1-luciferase reporter transfectant from the RLE cell line. The stable transfectants were generated by ring selection. After transfecting cells with plasmids and selecting by G418, 15 colonies were isolated. The AP-1 activation of each clone was screened by measuring luciferase activity induced by TPA or vanadate. One of the colonies (REL/AP02), with stable luciferase activity, was maintained for the experimental studies. The AP-1 activity of RLE/AP02 cells was elevated 2- and 10-fold after a 24-h exposure of the cells to 20 ng/ml TPA or 40 μm vanadate, respectively (data not shown). The control cell line transfected with the vector only did not show any luciferase activity after a 24-h exposure of cells to TPA or vanadate (data not shown). To explore the effects of silica on the induction of AP-1 activity, 5 × 104 JB6/AP/κB cells were exposed to varying doses (10∼300 μg/ml) of freshly fractured silica for 24 h. Freshly fractured silica caused a significant dose-dependent AP-1 activation in JB6 cells (Fig.1 A). The AP-1 activation attained significance at a low silica concentration of 80 μg/ml (≈40 μg/cm2) and reached its maximum activation at 200 μg/ml (≈100 μg/cm2). Based on this result, 200 μg/ml silica was selected as the concentration to be used for time course studies. At intervals from 12 to 72 h, the relative AP-1 activity was tested using the luciferase assay. Induction of AP-1 activity was first observed after 12 h of incubation; and thereafter, AP-1 activity increased to a maximum of 8-fold activation at 24 h (Fig. 1 B). Further incubations of cells with silica for 48 and 72 h resulted in a decrease in AP-1 activation. Since crystalline silica causes pulmonary epithelial hyperplasia and neoplastic lesions, we next asked whether freshly fractured silica induces AP-1 activation in rat lung epithelial cells. Freshly fractured silica was incubated for 72 h with 5 × 104RLE/AP02 cells stably transfected with the AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid. Freshly fractured silica also caused a dose-dependent induction of AP-1 activation in RLE/AP02 cells (Fig. 2 A). At a silica concentration of 300 μg/ml (≈150 μg/cm2), RLE cells exhibited AP-1 levels 2.5-fold greater than those observed in control cells. Time course studies in which a silica concentration of 200 μg/ml (≈100 μg/cm2) was used indicated that the time required for maximal induction of AP-1 activity was 72 h (Fig.2 B). The AP-1 induction in RLE/AP02 cells was different from that observed in JB6 cells. In RLE cells, the induction of AP-1 activity in response to silica occurred more slowly and persisted for at least 72 h. The level of AP-1 induced by freshly fractured silica was lower in RLE cells than in JB6 cells. Because JB6 cells respond to a greater degree than RLE cells, JB6 cells were chosen for further studies. To investigate whether similar mechanisms exist in vivo, we used AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice for these studies. The transgenic mice were exposed to freshly fractured silica (5 mg/mouse) by intratracheal instillation of a silica suspension (70 mg/ml in 0.9% sterile NaCl). At intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 4 days post-exposure, animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and sacrificed by exsanguination; lungs were removed; and their luciferase activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Elevated AP-1 transactivation was not detected at 1 day post-exposure (data not shown). However, AP-1 activation increased significantly at 2 and 3 days post-exposure and decreased to control levels at 4 days post-exposure (Fig. 3). At day 3 post-exposure, the induction of AP-1 activation in lung tissue by freshly fractured silica was 24 times higher than that in the control group. Since mitogen-activated protein kinases, including p38 kinase, ERKs, and JNKs, are the upstream kinases responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation (37Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested which class of MAPK is involved in the AP-1 activation by silica. We examined the influences of silica on the phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, JNKs, and p38 kinases. Using antibodies specific for the above MAPK family and phospho-specific for the phosphorylated MAPKs, we studied ERK1, ERK2, JNKs, and p38 kinase proteins and the protein phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, JNKs, and p38 kinase in JB6 P+ cells. Exposure to freshly fractured silica significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of p38 kinase and ERKs. The time course of p38 kinase phosphorylation induced by silica (150 μg/ml) is shown in Fig.4 A. Phosphorylation of p38 kinase was first apparent at 15 min after exposure to silica. and its maximal activation was obtained at 2 h. To examine the dose dependence of the p38 kinase response in cells exposed to silica, JB6 cells were treated for 2 h with various concentrations of silica. A dose-related increase in p38 kinase phosphorylation was observed in cells treated with increasing concentrations of silica, i.e.with prominent increases at 100–200 μg/ml (Fig. 4 B). Freshly fractured silica (150 μg/ml) also caused phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.5). In contrast, silica did not affect the phosphorylation levels of JNKs (Fig.6). Similar results were obtained using the RLE cell line (data not shown). These results suggest that ERKs and p38 kinase, but not JNKs, may be involved in silica-induced AP-1 activation in JB6 cells as well as in RLE cells.Figure 5Freshly fractured silica induces activation of ERK1 and ERK2. JB6 P+ cells were cultured in MEM containing 5% FBS in six-well (35-mm diameter) plates until 80% confluent. The cells were cultured in MEM containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h and then exposed to 150 μg/ml silica (47 μg/cm2) suspended in the same medium for different times as indicated. The cells were lysed, and phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 proteins and non-phosphorylated ERK2 proteins were assayed using the PhosphoPlus MAPK kit. The phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins were analyzed using the same transferred membrane blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Effect of freshly fractured silica on JNK activity.

PD98059 has been shown to act as a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 activation, whereas SB203580 has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase. MEK1 is an upstream activator of ERKs. Silica-induced AP-1 activation was significantly inhibited by 20 μm PD98059 or 2 μm SB203580 (Fig.7). To study the molecular basis of the induction of AP-1 activity by silica and to further confirm the above findings, the AP-1 DNA binding activity was analyzed by gel shift assay. As shown in Fig. 8, silica induced AP-1 DNA binding activity, and PD98059 or SB203580 inhibited silica-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity. These data provide further support that ERKs and p38 kinase are involved in silica-induced AP-1 activation. Occupational exposure to silica is associated with the development of silicosis and lung cancer (1Reiser K.M. Last J.A. Toxicology. 1979; 13: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risk Chem.

Risk Hum. 1997; 68 (International Agency for Research on Cancer): 1-475PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in silica-induced carcinogenesis are unclear. We hypothesize that activation of nuclear transcription factors induced by silica is a primary event in the initiation of signal transduction cascades at the cell membrane level leading to the induction of early response genes that are critical in carcinogenesis. In this study, we examined the effect of silica on the activation of AP-1 and the signal transduction pathways involved in AP-1 activation in cell culture models and in transgenic mice. The results show that silica stimulates AP-1 DNA binding activity as well as AP-1 transactivation activity. Silica induced an 8-fold increase in AP-1 activity in JB6 cells and a 2.5-fold increase in RLE cells. Silica also stimulated AP-1 transactivation in pulmonary tissues of transgenic mice. At 3 days after intratracheal instillation of silica, AP-1 activity was elevated 23-fold as compared with the controls. Most important, we found that phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and p38 kinases, which are involved in silica-induced AP-1 activation, was induced by freshly fractured silica. These data demonstrate for the first time that freshly fractured silica induces AP-1 activation through MAPK signal transduction pathways. Previous studies using different model systems have suggested an important role of AP-1 activation in preneoplastic-to-neoplastic transformation in cell culture and animal models (22Angel P. Karin M.

This transcription factor is able to alter gene expression in response to a number of stimuli, including the tumor promoter TPA, epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and UV irradiation (22Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). Some of the genes regulated by AP-1 are involved in immune and inflammatory responses, tumor promotion, and tumor progression. These include cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, collagenase IV, and stromelysin (44Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H.

Inhibition of AP-1 activity by either pharmaceutical agents such as fluocinolone acetonide and retinoic acid or molecular biological inhibitors such as dominant-negative c-jun and dominant-negative phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was found to block tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation (25Barthelman M.

Carcinogenesis ( Lond. ). 1995; 16: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a complex protein composed of homodimers and heterodimers of oncogene proteins of the Jun and Fos families. The genes encoding these proteins, c-jun and c-fos, are inducible in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli and function as intermediary transcriptional regulators in signal transduction processes leading to proliferation and transformation. The activation of AP-1 may trigger downstream signal cascades such as jun,fos, and other target genes. The members of the Jun and Fos protein families may couple cell signaling events at the cell surface to changes in gene expression that modulate cell responses, including proliferation and changes in phenotype. The important element of this study is that freshly fractured silica stimulates AP-1 activation, which may be one of the critical mechanisms in silica-induced carcinogenesis. The level of AP-1 induction by silica was lower in RLE cells than in JB6 cells. This may due to the following differences between these two cell lines: (a) the rate of luciferase gene expression, (b) the half-life of luciferase, (c) the basal MAPK or AP-1 activities, or (d) the anti-stress enzyme activity. The signal transduction pathways leading to transcription factor activation have been extensively studied in the last several years. It is believed that stress-related signals such as UV light or reactive oxygen species induce the activation of MAPK pathways (ERKs, JNKs, and p38). AP-1 is a downstream target of these three MAPK members (48Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). In this study, the possible role of the MAPK family, including p38 kinase, ERKs, and JNKs, in silica-induced AP-1 activation has been investigated. We found that freshly fractured silica phosphorylated ERKs and p38 kinase, but not JNKs. Pretreatment of cells with the p38 and ERK inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 inhibited AP-1 transactivation as well as AP-1 DNA binding activity induced by silica. Thus, these results suggest that silica-induced AP-1 activation might be through p38 MAPK and ERK pathways. The development of AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice makes it possible to study the role of AP-1 activation in tumor promotion in vivo(49Ding M. Dong Z. Chen F. Pack D. Ma W.Y. Ye J. Shi X. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1884-1889PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study show that freshly fractured silica is able to cause AP-1 activation in transgenic mice. Maximal AP-1 activation was increased by 23-fold in pulmonary tissues at 3 days after intratracheal instillation of silica. However, the cell types involved in this AP-1 activation response have not yet been identified. Additional studies are required to answer this question. Our studies present a model for the elucidation of events involved in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis by crystalline silica (Fig.9). By activating the AP-1 transcription factor through MAPK signal transduction pathways, silica may induce chronic cell proliferation, which subsequently contributes to silicosis and carcinogenesis in the lung. It is possible that activation of AP-1 is a crucial event that initiates cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. Biopersistent silica particles may provide prolonged redox signals and growth stimulus during the long latency periods of tumorigenesis and thereby contribute to the eventual fixation of genetic changes caused by silica itself or other agents. Furthermore, the induction of AP-1 activity may affect changes in cell phenotype that contribute to neoplastic transformation. In summary, using the AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mouse and cell culture models, we demonstrated that freshly fractured silica induces AP-1 activation through p38 MAPK and ERK pathways. These studies provide new and important clues regarding molecular mechanisms that may be involved in silica-induced carcinogenesis. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms involved in silica-induced carcinogenesis in parallel with the manipulation of target signaling could provide insights for the understanding and possible prevention of silica-induced carcinogenesis."

Although activation of G protein-coupled receptors may lead to stimulation of cell growth, the mechanisms transducing the GLP-2 signal to mitogenic proliferation remain unknown. We now report studies of GLP-2R signaling in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing a transfected rat GLP-2 receptor (BHK-GLP-2R cells). GLP-2, but not glucagon or GLP-1, increased the levels of cAMP and activated both cAMP-response element- and AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. The activation of AP-1-luciferase activity was protein kinase A (PKA) -dependent and markedly diminished in the presence of a dominant negative inhibitor of PKA. Although GLP-2 stimulated the expression of c-fos, c-jun, junB, and zif268, and transiently increased p70 S6 kinase in quiescent BHK-GLP-2R cells, GLP-2 also inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and reduced serum-stimulated Elk-1 activity. Furthermore, no rise in intracellular calcium was observed following GLP-2 exposure in BHK-GLP-2R cells. Although GLP-2 stimulated both cAMP accumulation and cell proliferation, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP alone did not promote cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the GLP-2R may be coupled to activation of mitogenic signaling in heterologous cell types independent of PKA via as yet unidentified downstream mediators of GLP-2 action in vivo.

Following secretion into circulation, gut-derived hormones may act in an endocrine manner by binding to receptors in tissues such as pancreas and liver, leading to the activation of signal transduction pathways and downstream physiological events. Consistent with their location in the intestinal mucosal epithelium, enteroendocrine peptides may function in part to regulate gastrointestinal motility and nutrient digestion and absorption. For example, gastrin promotes acid secretion, whereas secretin inhibits acid secretion and promotes pancreatic exocrine secretion. Peptide hormones structurally related to secretin, such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),1 stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells, and GLP-1, unlike the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, also inhibits gastric emptying, glucagon secretion, and food intake in vivo (1Drucker D.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 159-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pleiotropic actions of the glucagon/secretin/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide peptide superfamily are mediated via binding to and activation of distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These GPCRs are encoded by unique genes, yet are structurally related, and often share common features with respect to utilization of signaling mechanisms following ligand activation. Glucagon-related peptides regulate metabolic events, hormone secretion, and intestinal growth. For example, glucagon regulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis via activation of a hepatocyte glucagon receptor (2Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S. Bensch P.A. Kuijper J.L. Sheppard P.O. Sprecher C.A. O'Hara P.J. Foster D. Walker K.M. Chen L.H.J. McKernan P.A. Kindsvogel W. Science. 1993; 259: 1614-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), whereas GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion following activation of an islet beta cell GLP-1 receptor (3Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Studies of glucagon and GLP-1 receptor signaling in cells expressing the endogenous receptor or in heterologous cells expressing transfected receptors demonstrate that both these peptides activate downstream signaling mechanisms coupled to the cAMP-dependent pathway (1Drucker D.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 159-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying glucagon and GLP-1 action, much less is known about the biological activity of GLP-2, a 33-amino acid peptide located carboxyl-terminal to GLP-1 in the proglucagon precursor. GLP-2 administration to mice or rats promotes stimulation of crypt cell proliferation and inhibition of enterocyte apoptosis resulting in hyperplasia of the small bowel villous epithelium (4Drucker D.J. Ehrlich P. Asa S.L. Brubaker P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7911-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 5Tsai C.-H. Hill M. Asa S.L. Brubaker P.L. Drucker D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E77-E84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLP-2 also exerts trophic effects in animal models of both small and large bowel injury such as experimental small bowel resection or chemically induced colitis (6Scott R.B. Kirk D. MacNaughton W.K. Meddings J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G911-G921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Drucker D.J. Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Deforest L. Brubaker P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G79-G91PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to stimulation of epithelial proliferation, GLP-2 also acutely regulates gastric emptying (8Wojdemann M. Wettergren A. Hartmann B. Holst J.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 33: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and exerts rapid metabolic effects promoting stimulation of intestinal hexose transport within 30 min following intravenous GLP-2 infusion (9Cheeseman C.I. Tsang R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G477-G482PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1965-R1971PubMed Google Scholar). The actions of GLP-2 are transduced via a recently isolated novel member of the glucagon/secretin GPCR superfamily. The GLP-2 receptor, isolated by expression cloning, exhibits 50% homology to the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors, is expressed in the central nervous system and gut, and has been localized to human chromosome 17 (11Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Consistent with studies of glucagon and GLP-1 receptor signaling, the GLP-2 receptor is coupled to the adenylate cyclase pathway in transfected fibroblasts (11Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although several studies suggest that both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors may be coupled to multiple signal transduction pathways, little is known about the potential for GLP-2 to activate signaling via nonadenylate cyclase-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, unlike glucagon and GLP-1, the major action of GLP-2 involves stimulation of cell growth, and the mechanisms coupling GLP-2 receptor activation, directly or indirectly, to cell proliferation have not been examined. As intestinal cells expressing the endogenous GLP-2R have not yet been identified, we have now analyzed the actions of GLP-2 on downstream signaling pathways and cell proliferation in baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts stably transfected with the rat GLP-2 receptor. Glucagon, GLP-1-(7–36)NH2, and rat GLP-2-(1–33) were from Bachem California Inc. (Torrance, CA). Recombinant human [Gly2]-GLP-2 was a kind gift from Allelix Biopharmaceuticals Inc.

Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) reporter plasmids were gifts from C. A. Hauser (San Diego, CA) and R. D. Cone (Portland, OR), respectively. The expression plasmid MtR(AB) that encodes a dominant negative mutant of the PKA regulatory subunit (14Correll L.A. Woodford T.A. Corbin J.D. Mellon P.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

The PathDetect Elk-1 trans-reporting system was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-Akt1 (C-20) and anti-p70 S6 kinase antibodies, p70 S6 kinase peptide substrate, and PKA and protein kinase C inhibitor peptides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

All electrophoresis and immunoblotting reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. BHK fibroblast were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, 4.5 g/l glucose) supplemented with 5% calf serum. Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the rat GLP-2 receptor (11Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) or the rat GLP-1 receptor (15Wheeler M.B. Lu M. Dillon J.S. Leng X.-H. Chen C. Boyd III, A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) cloned in the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) or with pcDNA3.1 alone by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Stably transfected cell populations were selected by growth in G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 0.8 mg/ml for 2 weeks. Individual cell clones were obtained by limited dilution cloning, expanded for further characterization, and maintained in DMEM with 0.5 mg/ml G418. The BHK-GLP-2R clone utilized for the present studies was representative of several G418-resistant clones that expressed the GLP-2R and gave identical results in signal transduction studies. For transient transfection assays, BHK cells stably expressing the rat GLP-2 receptor (BHK-GLP-2R) or the empty vector pcDNA3.1 (BHK-pcDNA3) were plated in medium without G418. Cells were transfected at 60–70% confluency by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with either 10 μg of pCRE/β-galactosidase or 5 μg of p3AP1-luciferase reporter constructs plus pBluescript II (Stratagene) carrier DNA for a total of 20 μg of DNA. In the transfections involving the PathDetect Elk-1 trans-reporting system, the precipitate contained 9.5 μg of the GAL4-luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of expression vector encoding the GAL4-Elk-1 chimeric trans-activator protein, and 10 μg of carrier DNA or MtR(AB) expression vector. This plasmid was also used in studies of GLP-2 activation of both CRE- and AP-1-dependent activity. Four hours after transfection, cells were glycerol-shocked and incubated for 18–20 h in DMEM + 0.2% calf serum. Indicated drugs or peptides were added for 6 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% calf serum and 10 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine before harvesting cells for analysis of β-galactosidase and luciferase activities as described previously (13Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Kaestner K.H. Katz J. Liu Y. Drucker D.J. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Reporter gene activities were normalized to the protein concentration in each cell extract. Protein content was determined using a Coomassie dye assay (Bio-Rad). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. from a minimum of 3–4 independent transfections, each carried out in triplicate or quadruplicate. RNA was isolated using a modified acid-ethanol guanidinium thiocynate method as described previously (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, RNA was size-fractionated in an agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and immobilized with ultraviolet light, and hybridization and washing were carried out as described previously (19Drucker D.J. Brubaker P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). BHK-GLP-2R cells were grown in 24-well plates at 37° C and treated with 10 nmh[Gly2]-GLP-2 or 20 μm forskolin in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% calf serum and 10 μm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Incubations were terminated at the indicated times by the addition of chilled ethanol (65% final concentration). cAMP was measured in dried aliquots of ethanol extracts using a cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), and cAMP data were normalized to the protein content/well. BHK-GLP-2R and BHK-pcDNA cells grown in 96-well plates were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated for 48 h in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of h[Gly2]-GLP-2 at the indicated concentrations. Control cells were treated identically but were exposed to 5% calf serum for 48 h. Fresh medium and treatments were replaced every 24 h. At the end of the incubation period the number of viable cells in each condition was measured using the CellTiter 96 aqueous nonRadioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Cytosolic-free calcium was measured as described previously (20Coppolino M.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. St-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips were loaded with Fura-2 by incubation with 2 μm of the precursor acetoxymethyl ester for 20 min at 37° C. Fura-2 fluorescence ratio measurements were made on a Nikon Diaphot TMD microscope equipped with a Fluor 4OX, 1.3 N. A. oil immersion objective and a high sensitivity photometer (d-104, Photon Technology Instruments), which was interfaced to a NEC computer with a 12 bit AID board (Labmaster). Illumination was provided by a 100 watt xenon lamp coupled to the microscope via a rotating mirror and fiber optic assembly (Ratiomaster, PTI). The cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm while recording emission at 510 nm. Photometric data were acquired at 10 Hz using the Oscar software (PTI). Ionomycin and EGTA were used to calibrate the fluorescence ratio versus calcium concentration. Prior to all experimental manipulations for analysis of kinase activity, cells were deprived of serum overnight (12 h). MAPK phosphorylation was detected as described (21Somwar R. Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Clin. Ther. 1998; 20: 125-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK-GLP-2R cells were treated with 20 nm GLP-2 or 100 nm insulin for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed in a solution containing 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 115 mmTris/HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bromphenol blue, protease inhibitors (100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm E-64, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors (40 mm sodium fluoride, 7.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.5 mmNa3VO4). Lysates were passed five times through a 25-gauge syringe to sheer the DNA and boiled for 3 min. To detect MAPK phosphorylation, 30 μg of total cellular protein were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and then immunoblotted with phospho-specific MAPK antibody (22Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar) (polyclonal, 1:1000 dilution). Protein was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method using goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution) as the secondary antibody. p70 S6 kinase activity was determined as described previously (23Somwar R. Sumitani S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E618-E625PubMed Google Scholar). BHK-GLP-2R cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated with 20 nm h[Gly2]-GLP-2, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 nm okadaic acid, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm E-64, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min of slow agitation and centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min), the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation. p70 S6 kinase was immunoprecipitated using 250 μg of total protein and 1 μg of a rabbit polyclonal p70 S6 kinase antibody. The p70 S6 kinase immunocomplex was washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 nm okadaic acid, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) including all the protease inhibitors used above and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μm protein kinase A and protein kinase C inhibitor peptides, 0.2 mm S6 peptide, and 0.25 mmMg-[γ-32P]ATP at 30 C for 10 min. Aliquots (30 μl) were transferred onto Whatman p81 filter papers and washed 3 times for 15 min with 175 mm phosphoric acid. 32P incorporated into the S6 peptide was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitation of Akt and kinase assay was performed as described (23Somwar R. Sumitani S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E618-E625PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Anti-Akt antibodies were pre-coupled to a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads by incubating 2 μg of antibody/condition with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (100 mg/ml) and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (100 mg/ml) for a minimum of 2 h. The anti-Akt-bead complexes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with ice-cold lysis buffer. Akt was immunoprecipitated by incubating 200 μg of total cellular protein with the anti-Akt-bead complex for 2–3 h under constant rotation (4° C). The Akt1 immunocomplex was isolated and washed 4 times with 1 ml of wash buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (v/v), 1 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin, 100 nm okadaic acid) and twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmdithiothreitol). This was then incubated under constant agitation for 30 min at 30° C with 30 μl of reaction mixture (kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μm Crosstide). Following the reaction, 30 μl of the supernatant were transferred onto Whatman p81 filter paper and treated as described above for p70 S6 kinase assay. To stain F-actin, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Permeabilization was followed by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at room temperature. The samples were then washed extensively and mounted using Dako mounting medium. Samples were visualized by epifluorescence on a Leica DM-IRB microscope, and images were acquired with a MicroMax 2 cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) using WinView software and a PC compatible computer. The initial characterization of GLP-2R signaling was carried out in COS cells transiently transfected with the GLP-2R (11Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As cell lines that express an endogenous GLP-2R have not yet been identified, we chose to establish in vitro models for reproducible analysis of GLP-2 action by generating BHK fibroblast clones that stably expressed the rat GLP-2 receptor. BHK cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the full-length rat GLP-2R coding sequence under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Following selection with the antibiotic G418, surviving clones were expanded and characterized for GLP-2R expression. Several BHK-GLP-2R cell lines were identified that expressed the GLP-2R and responded identically to GLP-2. A representative clone, hereafter referred to as BHK-GLP-2R, was chosen for more detailed analysis of GLP-2-dependent signal transduction. Studies were carried out with either native rat GLP-2 or h[Gly2]-GLP-2, a protease-resistant GLP-2 analogue recently shown to exhibit greater in vitro and in vivo stability compared with the native peptide (24Drucker D.J. Shi Q. Crivici A. Sumner-Smith M. Tavares W. Hill M. Deforest L. Cooper S. Brubaker P.L. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As analysis of GLP-2R signaling in transiently transfected COS cells suggested GLP-2 activated the adenylate cyclase pathway (11Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we initially analyzed the GLP-2-dependent activation of a cAMP-dependent reporter gene, CRE-β-galactosidase, in transfected BHK-GLP-2R cells. The activity of this reporter gene has been shown to correlate, in a linear manner, with accumulation of intracellular cAMP (13Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Both rGLP-2 and h[Gly2]-GLP-2, from 0.01 to 20 nm, increased β-galactosidase activity in BHK-GLP-2R cells (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the level of β-galactosidase induction following transfection of CRE-β-galactosidase and incubation with GLP-2 was similar in magnitude to that obtained by treating the cells with either forskolin or 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, two well characterized activators of the adenylate cyclase pathway (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the structurally related peptides glucagon and GLP-1 did not stimulate β-galactosidase activity in BHK-GLP-2R cells (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, GLP-2 had no effect on the activity of a cotransfected CRE-β-galactosidase reporter gene in control cells stably expressing the parental expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 1 C). To verify that the activation of CRE-dependent β-galactosidase activity reflected the accumulation of intracellular cAMP following GLP-2 stimulation, we compared the levels of cAMP in BHK-GLP-2R cells at various time points after incubation of cells with either 10 nm h[Gly2]-GLP-2 or 20 μmforskolin. The relative magnitude and kinetics of intracellular cAMP accumulation were comparable from 10 to 360 min following exposure of cells to either reagent (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, the EC50 for stimulation of CRE-dependent β-galactosidase activity was ∼0.06 nm, identical to the value reported for GLP-2-stimulation of cAMP accumulation in 293-EBNA cells expressing the rat GLP-2 receptor (11Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As the structurally related peptides glucagon and GLP-1 stimulate AP-1-dependent signaling pathways (25Susini S. Roche E. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Hansen L.H. Gromada J. Bouchelouche P. Whitmore T. Jelinek L. Kindsvogel W. Nishimura E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1552-C1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next ascertained whether activation of the GLP-2 receptor was also coupled to AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation. BHK-GLP-2R cells were transfected with a reporter gene containing three tandemly linked AP-1 sites adjacent to a luciferase reporter gene. h[Gly2]-GLP-2, at concentrations of 0.01–20 nm, stimulated a 3–4-fold induction of AP-1-dependent luciferase activity in BHK-GLP-2R cells (Fig.2 A) but not in BHK cells stably transfected with the expression vector alone (BHK-pcDNA3.1, Fig. 2 B). Induction of AP-1-directed luciferase activity was also observed with activators of the adenylate cyclase pathway such as forskolin and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (Fig. 2 C); however, the relative magnitude of induction with these PKA activators was less than that observed for h[Gly2]-GLP-2 alone (Fig. 2 C,p < 0.05). Similarly, exposure of BHK-GLP-2R cells to 10% fetal calf serum significantly activated AP-1-directed luciferase activity (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these findings establish the sensitivity and specificity of GLP-2-induction of adenylate cyclase and AP-1-dependent pathways in BHK-GLP-2R cells in vitro. The induction of AP-1-luciferase activity by both forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP suggested that GLP-2 might activate AP-1 activity via PKA-dependent mechanisms. To examine this possibility, the CRE-β-galactosidase and AP1-luciferase reporter genes were transfected into BHK-GLP-2R cells in the presence or absence of a cDNA encoding a dominant negative inhibitor of PKA, MtR(AB) (14Correll L.A. Woodford T.A. Corbin J.D. Mellon P.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16672-16678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GLP-2-dependent induction of β-galactosidase activity was reduced by 80% in the presence of the cotransfected PKA inhibitor (Fig. 3). Similarly, the forskolin induction of CRE-β-galactosidase was reduced by ∼80% in similar experiments, consistent with the results of previous studies (14Correll L.A. Woodford T.A. Corbin J.D. Mellon P.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16672-16678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore both the GLP-2- and forskolin-dependent activation of AP-1-luciferase activity were also significantly reduced in the presence of the PKA inhibitor MtR(AB) (Fig. 3, p< 0.001–0.005). Similar results were also obtained with the PKA inhibitor H89 (data not shown). However, whereas the forskolin induction of AP-1 activity was eliminated in the presence of PKA inhibition, a small but detectable GLP-2-induction of AP-1 luciferase was still observed in the presence of MtR(AB). These findings suggest the existence of alternate pathways independent of PKA for induction of AP-1 activity. Consistent with the existence of these alternate pathways, the serum induction of AP-1-dependent luciferase activity was not diminished by co-transfection with the PKA inhibitor plasmid (Fig. 3). As activation of the AP-1 pathway is frequently associated with stimulation of cell proliferation, the finding that GLP-2 activate"

Recently, viral infection was shown to induce the phosphorylation of IRF3 without any alteration in its protein level (3Juang Y. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl.

Phosphorylation of IRF3 leads to its nuclear translocalization, association with the co-activator cAMP-response element binding protein-binding protein (CBP), and potentiation of its transcriptional activity. Hence, activated IRF3 can induce a specific set of genes in response to viral infection (11Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 12Kim T.K. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 63: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Some further clues to the function of IRF3 may be provided by another IRF family protein, IRF1. The expression level of IRF1 increases in response to viral infection, and also in response to DNA-damaging agents (14Fujita T. Kimura Y. Miyamoto M. Barsoumian E.L. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1989; 337: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 15Fujita T. Reis L.F. Watanabe N. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9936-9940Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). IRF1 regulates specific target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (16Tamura T. Ishihara M. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Oishi I. Aizawa S. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Taki S. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1995; 376: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar,17Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Lampier M.S. Nozawa H. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Aizawa S. Tokino T. Oren M. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1996; 382: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, functional inactivation of IRF1 contributes to aberrant cell growth, consistent with its implicated role as a tumor suppressor gene (18Harada H. Willison K. Sakakibara J. Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1990; 63: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 19Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T.

Cell. 1994; 77: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Because both IRF1 and IRF3 recognize similar regulatory DNA sequences, these observations raised the potential role of IRF3 in the DNA damage response. Despite its demonstrated role in the response to viral infection, little is known about whether IRF3 is involved in responses to other environmental stresses. In the present study, we tested whether DNA-damaging agents could activate IRF3. We found that in response to several DNA-damaging agents, IRF3 is phosphorylated, binds to CBP, moves to the nucleus, and increases transcription from its binding sites. These data suggest that IRF3 is involved in the defensive responses against genotoxic stress. The wild-type and mutated (S385A and S386A) IRF3 expression plasmids were described previously (10Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). For the construction of GAL4-IRF3, GAL4-IRF1, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-IRF3, the IRF3 and IRF1 cDNAs inserts were obtained by polymerase chain reaction, and the resultant products were cloned into the GAL4 plasmid pSG424 (21Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) or the GFP plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The G5E1b-CAT reporter plasmid containing five GAL4 DNA binding sites with an E1b TATA box was described previously (22Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). For construction of the IRF6-CAT reporter plasmid, six copies of the IRF DNA binding site were generated by multimerization of the interferon-β enhancer element (PRDI/III), and cloned into the −40 interferon β-CAT plasmid containing the interferon-β minimal promoter region and the CAT reporter gene (8Wathelet M.G.

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected by plasmids using liposome reagents (FuGene from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; LipofectAMINE from Life Technologies, Inc.). At 24–36 h posttransfection, cells were irradiated with UV (50 J/m2) or incubated with recombinant interferon γ (500 units/ml), Sendai virus (200 hemagglutinating units/ml), doxorubicin (1 μg/ml), mitomycin C (1 μg/ml), cisplatin (0.5 μg/ml), or etoposide (1 μg/ml) as described (8Wathelet M.G.

Mak T.W. Aizawa S. Tokino T. Oren M. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1996; 382: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Expression of the CAT reporter gene was analyzed 12–15 h after treatment. Transfection efficiencies were monitored by transfection of a CMV-lacZ control plasmid on parallel plates. CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized to protein concentrations of cell extracts because the CMV promoter includes elements that are known to be inducible in response to genotoxic stress (24Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar, 25Maniatis T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). All of the transfection experiments were repeated at least twice, and deviations were less than 10% of the mean for each data point. HA-tagged IRF3 was immunoprecipitated as described (28Harlow H. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Mannual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cell pellets were lysed by addition of Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), followed by three freeze/thaw cycles. After centrifugation of cell lysates at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with anti-HA antibody in Buffer A. After 1 h of end-over-end rotation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Buffer A prior to further analysis. Some immunoprecipitates were treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (5 units) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described (29Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with anti-CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-IRF3 antibodies. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify agents that directly induce IRF3, we fused the IRF3 coding region to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and examined the transcriptional activity of the GAL4-IRF3 fusion protein with a reporter plasmid containing GAL4 binding sites (Fig.1 A). Expression of GAL4-IRF3 under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter resulted in a low level of reporter gene expression (lane 2). IRF3-dependent gene expression was specifically stimulated by viral infection (lane 3) but not by interferon γ treatment (lane 4). Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of GAL4-IRF3 was strongly stimulated by UV radiation, which is known to cause genotoxic stress (lane 5). Doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent that induces DNA breaks, also potentiated the transcriptional activity of GAL4-IRF3 (lane 6). In contrast, expression of GAL4-IRF1 under the same conditions resulted in constitutive levels of transcription that were not affected by any of the agents tested (lanes 9–12). To find whether UV and doxorubicin can stimulate the transcriptional activity of IRF3 at its own binding site, we transfected a native IRF3 expression plasmid (containing no GAL4 DNA binding domain) along with a reporter plasmid (IRF6-CAT) containing six IRF3 DNA binding sites. In the absence of the IRF3 expression plasmid, UV and doxorubicin induced some CAT activity, possibly due to the activity of endogenous IRF3 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). With increasing amounts of IRF3 expression, the induction of the reporter gene dramatically increased in a dosage-dependent manner (lanes 5 and 8 and lanes 6 and9). These results suggest that the transcriptional activity of IRF3 can be stimulated by UV and doxorubicin. To determine the specificity of the UV/doxorubicin-induced transcriptional activity, we tested whether mutants of IRF3 (S385A or S386A) affect reporter gene expression from the IRF3 promoter (Fig.2). Mutation of residues Ser-385 and Ser-386 is known to block the activation of IRF3 in response to viral infection (10Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). UV and doxorubicin activated the expression of the reporter gene from the IRF6-CAT plasmid in the absence of transfected IRF3 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). Wild-type IRF3 further stimulated this genotoxic stress-induced gene expression (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, mutant IRF3 (S385A or S386A) did not increase the repoter activity (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 8 and 9 and lanes 11 and 12). In fact, the IRF3 mutants slightly reduced the activity, possibly by inhibition of endogenous wild-type IRF3 activity. Thus, the two serine residues in the IRF3 activation domain are essential for its induced transcriptional activity by UV and doxorubicin. To determine whether the activation of IRF3 is correlated to its phosphorylation, we examined the effect of UV and doxorubicin on the electrophoretic mobility of IRF3 during SDS-PAGE (Fig.3). Treatment with UV or doxorubicin caused a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of IRF3 (lanes 2 and 3). This mobility shift was similar to that caused by viral infection (lane 4). Importantly, no shift in the electrophoretic mobility of IRF3 was detected in the presence of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (lanes 5–7). Thus, the mobility shift was caused by phosphorylation of IRF3 upon treatment with UV, doxorubicin, or virus. It has been reported that viral infection induces the phosphorylation of IRF3, thereby allowing it to bind to the transcriptional co-activator CBP with simultaneous nuclear translocation (3Juang Y.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the subcellular localization of IRF3 in response to UV and doxorubicin. IRF3 linked to the GFP was transfected into HeLa cells. The cells were treated with UV or doxorubicin and examined for changes in the subcellular localization of IRF3 (Fig.4). In uninduced cells, GFP-IRF3 was localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm. UV or doxorubicin treatment resulted in the translocation of GFP-IRF3 into the nucleus (Fig. 4) in concert with the change in the electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3). To examine the possibility that IRF3 associates with the co-activator CBP following UV/doxorubicin induction, IRF3 was immunoprecipitated from uninduced and induced cells (Fig.5). Consistent with the data in Fig. 3, treatment with UV or doxorubicin induced the phosphorylation of IRF3, as demonstrated by its mobility shift (lanes 2 and3). Under these conditions, the immunoblot for CBP revealed that CBP was co-immunoprecipitated with IRF3 from treated cells (lanes 2 and 3) but not from untreated cells (lane 1). Thus, UV and doxorubicin induced the nuclear localization of IRF3 (Fig. 4) and the interaction of IRF3 with the transcriptional co-activator CBP (Fig. 5), both of which would be important for the regulation of IRF3 target genes in the nucleus. We showed that IRF3 can be activated by UV and doxorubicin (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). To investigate whether IRF3 is activated in response to other DNA-damaging agents, we examined the transcriptional activity of GAL4-IRF3 in the presence of mitomycin C, cisplatin, and etoposide. These agents were chosen because of the distinct mechanisms by which they induce genotoxic stress (30Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). UV radiation induces several types of DNA damage, including thymine dimer formation; doxorubicin is a DNA-intercalating agent that binds to topoisomerase II, causing DNA strand cleavage; mitomycin C alkylates DNA; cisplatin generates various DNA adducts through platinum-DNA complex formation; and etoposide (vinca alkaloids) triggers DNA strand cleavage through formation of a ternary complex with DNA and topoisomerase II. The transcriptional activity of GAL4-IRF3 was strongly stimulated by treatment with mitomycin C, cisplatin, and etoposide, as well as doxorubicin (Fig.6). Thus, all the tested inducers of genotoxic stress, despite their different mechanisms, potentiated the transcriptional activity of IRF3. In the present study, we have identified the activation pathway of IRF3 in response to DNA-damaging agents, including UV radiation and doxorubicin. Several other agents (mitomycin C, cisplatin, and etoposide) were also shown to potentiate the transcriptional activity of IRF3, although they are known to induce DNA damage through different mechanisms. These results implicate IRF3 as a general mediator of pathways that respond to genotoxic stress. However, IRF3 is unlikely to be involved in all stress responses, because other types of stress inducers, including proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1, fail to activate IRF3 (4Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents, IRF3 could be activated by DNA damage itself and/or by some signaling pathways resulting from the DNA damage. A variety of genotoxic stresses are known to activate p53 (reviewed in Refs. 31Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 32Hansen R. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 33Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar, 34Weinert T. Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), including DNA-damaging agents such as those that activate IRF3 in this study. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms by which DNA-damaging agents activate p53 are not clearly established. In the case of UV radiation, the initial signal leading to p53 induction appears to be dependent on DNA strand cleavage, which can be caused either by excision repair or replication past thymine dimers (35Nelson W.G. Kastan M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that UV induces p53 through unknown signaling pathways triggered by the blockage of transcription and DNA synthesis (36Chernova O.B. Chernov M.V. Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 431-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Related to this, α-amanitin or aphidicolin, which are the specific inhibitors of RNA polymerase or DNA polymerase, respectively, increase p53 protein levels (reviewed in Ref. 36Chernova O.B. Chernov M.V. Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 431-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These inhibitors failed to significantly induce phosphorylation of IRF3 as compared with its phosphorylation induced by UV. 2T. Kim and T. K. Kim, unpublished data. Thus IRF3 may not be efficiently activated by inhibition of transcription or DNA synthesis. The exact mechanisms by which DNA-damaging agents activate IRF3 (as well as p53) remain to be elucidated. In response to genotoxic stress, cells activate signaling pathways that lead either to damage repair with cell cycle arrest, or to apoptotic cell death. One member of the IRF family, IRF1, was previously demonstrated to be important for genotoxic stress-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (16Tamura T. Ishihara M. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Oishi I. Aizawa S. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Taki S. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1995; 376: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 17Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Lampier M.S. Nozawa H. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Aizawa S. Tokino T. Oren M. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1996; 382: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In response to DNA-damaging agents, the IRF1 gene is induced, and it stimulates transcription of the p21 cell cycle inhibitor and ICE apoptotic genes. Because both IRF1 and IRF3 recognize similar regulatory DNA sequences, it is conceivable that IRF3 may play some role in the regulation of the p21 and ICE genes during genotoxic stress responses. Consistent with this, we observed that cell proliferation was significantly reduced upon IRF3 activation by treatment with UV or doxorubicin and that ectopic expression of IRF3 induced p21 promoter activity. 3T. Y. Kim and T. K. Kim, unpublished data. It is possible that IRF3 is involved in the immediate-early response to genotoxic stress, whereas the delayed induction of genes may be controlled by IRF1. Related to this possibility, IRF3 is directly activated by phosphorylation, and phosphorylated IRF3 is rapidly degraded in the induced cells (4Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Thus, IRF3 protein becomes depleted at the time when IRF1 and other delayed genes are being synthesized. Sequential activation of the IRF proteins may provide very tight control mechanisms for the initial and delayed induction of target genes, amplifying the protective responses to genotoxic stress. In addition to IRF3, genotoxic stress stimulates signaling pathways that activate transcription factors including p53, AP-1, NF-κB, and YB-1. These transcription factors elicit various biological responses through induction of their specific target genes. For instance, p53 activation leads to the induction of the p21 cell cycle inhibitor gene and the bax apoptotic gene for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 31Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 32Hansen R. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 33Ko L.J. Prives C.

Although the role of AP-1 activation in response to genotoxic stress is not clearly established, its induction may help cells exit the G1 checkpoint imposed by p53 (reviewed in Refs.26Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar and 27Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Induction of NF-κB, on the other hand, appears to play an important role in preventing apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 24Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar, 25Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Interestingly, YB-1 translocates into the nucleus in response to DNA-damaging agents. In some of cancer cells with multidrug resistance, its nuclear localization and increased protein levels correlate well with multidrug resistance-1 gene expression (37Bargou R.C. Jurchott K.

Thus, we plan to examine the functional interaction of these transcription factors with IRF3 on the enhancers of target genes to further understand the biological function of IRF3. Various defensive responses, including cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair mechanisms, have evolved to protect cells against the effects of DNA damage. Defects in these defense mechanisms are implicated in various human diseases, including cancer. Consistent with their critical roles in the response to genotoxic stress, mutations in the p53 and IRF1 tumor suppressor genes have been detected in human cancers (31Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 32Hansen R. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 33Ko L.J. Prives C.

So far, no mutation in the IRF3 gene has been associated with human cancer. However, several viral oncoproteins, including human papillomavirus 16 E6 and adenovirus E1A, can inhibit the activation of IRF3 and p53, but not IRF1 (3Juang Y. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W. Lin R.

In view of the results presented here, it will be important to investigate how the inactivation of IRF3 is connected with the loss of defensive functions against genotoxic stress during tumorigenesis. In future studies, we will attempt to identify the specific target genes of IRF3 and to generate mice deficient in the IRF3 gene to analyze their susceptibility to DNA damage-induced tumors. We thank Dr. Fujita for providing the IRF3 reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2054336471,"RhoGTPases are key regulators of eukaryotic cell physiology. The bacterial enteropathogen Salmonella typhimurium modulates host cell physiology by translocating specific toxins into the cytoplasm of host cells that induce responses such as apoptotic cell death in macrophages, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, the rearrangement of the host cell actin cytoskeleton (membrane ruffling), and bacterial entry into host cells. One of the translocated toxins is SopE, which has been shown to bind to RhoGTPases of the host cell and to activate RhoGTPase signaling. SopE is sufficient to induce profuse membrane ruffling in Cos cells and to facilitate efficient bacterial internalization. We show here that SopE belongs to a novel class of bacterial toxins that modulate RhoGTPase function by transient interaction. Surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed that the kinetics of formation and dissociation of the SopE·CDC42 complex are in the same order of magnitude as those described for complex formation of GTPases of the Ras superfamily with their cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). In the presence of excess GDP, dissociation of the SopE·CDC42 complex was accelerated more than 1000-fold. SopE-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange was very efficient (e.g.exchange rates almost 105-fold above the level of the uncatalyzed reaction; substrate affinity), and the kinetic constants were similar to those described for guanine nucleotide exchange mediated by CDC25 or RCC1. Far-UV CD spectroscopy revealed that SopE has a high content of α-helical structure, a feature also found in Dbl homology domains, Sec7-like domains, and the Ras-GEF domain of Sos. Despite the lack of any obvious sequence similarity, our data suggest that SopE may closely mimic eukaryotic GEFs. RhoGTPases are key regulators of eukaryotic cell physiology.

Despite the lack of any obvious sequence similarity, our data suggest that SopE may closely mimic eukaryotic GEFs. guanine nucleotide exchange factor glutathione S-transferase high pressure liquid chromatography O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) mant-GDP GTPases of the Rho subfamily act as molecular switches and are key regulators of cellular functions such as formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, motility, cell shape change, membrane ruffling, cytokinesis, cell aggregation, and cell-to-cell adhesion, as well as smooth muscle contraction (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). They cycle between a biologically inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound conformation (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). As spontaneous guanine nucleotide dissociation and GTP hydrolysis are fairly slow, activation and inactivation are dependent on the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 and GTPase-activating proteins (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). GEFs enhance nucleotide exchange rates by binding to and stabilizing the nucleotide-free GTPase, whereas GTPase-activating proteins accelerate the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis through stabilization of the transition state via a critical arginine residue (4Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Mammalian GEFs are divided into several subfamilies that share sequence or structural similarity. GEFs of one family are generally specific for a certain subfamily of GTPases (5Sprang S.R. Coleman D.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). So far, all GEFs known to act on RhoGTPases have a common sequence motif, the Dbl homology domain. This is the catalytically active part of the molecule responsible for binding to RhoGTPases and catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange (6Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Only in the active, GTP-bound state can the Rho-GTPases interact with their “effectors,” which are the downstream elements of the signal transduction cascades that mediate the cellular responses. A large number of bacterial virulence factors exert their toxic effects by interfering with RhoGTPase signaling of host cells (7Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Some inhibit downstream signaling of RhoGTPases, whereas others mediate their permanent activation by inhibition of the GTP hydrolyzing activity. So far, all of these toxins have been found to modulate RhoGTPase function by introducing covalent chemical modifications. These modifications include ADP-ribosylation, glucosylation, the transfer ofN-acetylglucosamine groups, and the deamidation of glutamine residues (7Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Modulation of RhoGTPase function by bacterial toxins via a noncovalent interaction has not yet been demonstrated. The bacterial enteropathogen Salmonella typhimurium is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in developed countries. S. typhimurium employs a large array of mechanisms to colonize, replicate, and survive within hosts (8Groisman E.A. Ochman H. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 343-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The specialized type III protein secretion system encoded in the Salmonellapathogenicity island 1 is important during the gut associated stages of the infection (9Galán J.E. Curtiss III, R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6383-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 10Watson P.R. Galyov E.E. Paulin S.M. Jones P.W. Wallis T.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It facilitates the secretion and translocation of several bacterial toxins (effector proteins) into the cytosol of host cells (11Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translocated effector proteins induce responses that range from the induction of apoptosis in macrophages to increased chloride secretion, the production of IL-8, and the induction of membrane ruffling, which facilitates bacterial entry into nonphagocytic host cells (12Galán J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The activation of RhoGTPases is thought to be a key step in the signal transduction cascades triggered by S. typhimurium (12Galán J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Chen L.M. Hobbie S. Galán J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). SopE is one of the effector proteins translocated into host cells by the type III protein secretion system of S. typhimurium. In the host cell cytosol, it activates the RhoGTPases Cdc42, and Rac1 and induces nuclear responses and membrane ruffling (14Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 15Chen L.M. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Galán J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1479-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thereby, SopE can promote efficient entry of the bacterium into host cells (16Wood M.W. Rosqvist R. Mullan P.B. Edwards M.H. Galyov E.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 17Hardt W.D. Urlaub H. Galán J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2574-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Purified SopE enhances guanine nucleotide exchange in several RhoGTPases, such as Cdc42 and Rac1, but not in the more distantly related GTPase Ras, as shown in in vitro nucleotide exchange assays (14Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which SopE enhances the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange in RhoGTPases has not yet been investigated, and it has remained unclear whether SopE may activate RhoGTPase signaling by covalently modifying these central regulators of host cell function. In the present study, we have analyzed the catalytic activity of SopE from S. typhimurium in more detail. Analysis of the kinetic properties of Rac1 that had been preincubated with SopE revealed that SopE does not covalently modify RhoGTPases. This was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of Rac1 that had been affinity purified from a complex with SopE. Analysis of the kinetics of formation and dissociation of a Cdc42·SopE complex and the kinetic analysis of the SopE-mediated nucleotide exchange revealed striking parallels to eukaryotic GEFs. In addition, far-UV CD analysis suggested that the catalytic domain of SopE has a high content of α-helical structure, a feature also found in GEFs for ARF, Ras and RhoGTPases (18Cherfils J.

Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of any detectable sequence similarity, our biochemical and biophysical data demonstrate that SopE modulates RhoGTPase function by a noncovalent mechanism and suggest that this bacterial virulence factor may closely mimic GEFs of the host. Preparation of recombinant proteins was performed essentially as described (14Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 25Rudolph M.G. Bayer P. Abo A. Kuhlmann J. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18067-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, all proteins used in this study were overexpressed from derivatives of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression vector pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, recovered from bacterial extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and either eluted with 10 mm glutathione (GST·SopE78–240) or cleaved off the column by digestion with thrombin protease (Cdc42 proteins, SopE78–240) or with factor Xa (Rac1). All steps of the purification were performed in buffers containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, ≥100 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol. The quality of the preparations was assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1). Protein concentrations were estimated from Coomassie-stained gels and by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). Activity of the RhoGTPases was determined by [3H]GDP binding assays (27Self A.J. Hall A Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Proteins were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C. Due to the design of the expression vectors, the proteins carry the following additional amino acids: GST·SopE78–240 carries the 15 additional amino acids PGISGGGGGILEFEM between the thrombin cleavage site and Leu-78 of SopE. SopE78–240 carries 17 additional N-terminal amino acids: GSPGISGGGGGILEFEM. Rac1 carries 7 additional N-terminal amino acids (GIDPGAT), and mass spectrometry analysis of proteolytic fragments of Rac1 revealed that a fraction of the protein was C-terminally truncated after Lys-186, Arg-187, and Lys-188. Wild type Cdc42 carries 14 additional N-terminal amino acids (GSRRASVGSKIISA). Cdc42ΔC (residues 1–178) carries two additional N-terminal residues (GS), and the 13 C-terminal amino acids (PPEPKKSRRCVLL) are absent. The Cdc42G12V carries three additional N-terminal residues (GSP). Preparation of the mant-GDP (mGDP)·Cdc42G12V complex was performed as recently described (25Rudolph M.G. Bayer P. Abo A. Kuhlmann J. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18067-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins were loaded at 30 °C for 15 min with [3H]GDP in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 10 mmEDTA. Loading was stopped by addition of 10 mmMgCl2 and 3 volumes of cold Buffer A. Exchange reactions were started by adding [3H]GDP-loaded GTPase to Buffer A containing the indicated concentrations of GDP and GST, SopE78–240, or EDTA. Alternatively, exchange reactions were started by adding GDP to Buffer A containing the [3H]GDP-loaded GTPase and either GST, SopE78–240, or EDTA. Aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay as described (27Self A.J. Hall A Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Filters were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, dried, and radioactivity bound to the filters was analyzed by scintillation counting in a Wallac 1450 Micro Beta Trilux apparatus. Rac1 purified by GST·SopE78–240 affinity chromatography (see “Results”) was digested with proteinase Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 25 mmNH4HCO3 at a protease:substrate ratio of 1:40 at 25 °C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a Bruker Reflex mass spectrometer (matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry with α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid as matrix). Spectra were recorded either directly from the digest or from HPLC-separated peptides; HPLC separation was performed using a 2.1 × 250 mm 5 μm/300 Å Vydac C18 column (The Separation Group) on a Waters 600 high pressure liquid chromatograph (Millipore) using 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water as aqueous phase and 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as organic phase. After an initial lag phase of 5 min at 2% organic phase, a discontinuous gradient of 2–30% organic phase over 70 min (0.4%/min), followed by 30–90% organic phase over 30 min (2%/min), was developed. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and UV absorption was monitored at 215 nm. Average masses were compared with the masses of proteolytic fragments predicted using the PeptideMass peptide characterization software (28Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.-C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For some peptides, the assignment was confirmed by analysis of fragment ions generated by postsource decay (29Chaurand P. Luetzenkirchen F. Spengler B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), using the FASTTMmethod (Bruker). The N-terminal sequence (40 residues) was obtained by direct Edman degradation of the affinity-purified protein using a model 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C in Buffer Y (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) on a FluoromaxTM spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries). Emission spectra were recorded after excitation at 366 nm (1 nm bandwidth) with a time constant of 1 s and 2 nm bandwidth. The time courses of mGDP release from Cdc42G12V in the presence of 1 mm nonfluorescent GDP were monitored at 435 nm (8 nm bandwidth). For measurement of the single turnover kinetics of SopE78–240-catalyzed nucleotide release, increasing concentrations of SopE78–240 (final concentration, 0.5–32 μm) were mixed with mGDP·Cdc42G12V (final concentration, 0.1 μm) at 25 °C in 40 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2 in a stopped flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics) with the monochromators set to 1.5 nm and a cut-off filter of 408 nm. Single exponentials were fitted to all kinetic data using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). Association and dissociation reactions involving Cdc42ΔC and GST·SopE78–240 were studied by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcoreTM system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Sensor chips were covalently coated with α-GST antibodies according to the protocol of the manufacturer (30O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Peck K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). GST proteins were applied at a concentration of 0.5 μm in binding Buffer X (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma)), and experiments were performed at 20 °C in the same buffer. The flow rate was 5 μl/min in all experiments. At the end of the assay, all noncovalently bound material was removed from the matrix by washing with 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0, 0.05% SDS, leaving the immobilized immunoglobulin at full activity. To eliminate the contribution of nonspecific binding, equivalent control experiments using immobilized GST instead of GST·SopE78–240 were used to calculate specific signal changes. Netto binding and dissociation curves were obtained by subtracting the GST controls from the GST·SopE curves to take into account unspecific binding of Cdc42 to GST. Parameters were fitted using a single exponential with the BIAevaluation software (version 2.1). The far-UV CD spectrum of 5 μm SopE78–240 was recorded at room temperature on a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter in 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with a sensitivity of 20 mdeg, a time constant of 1 s, a scan speed of 20 nm/min and a bandwidth of 1 nm in a 1-mm quartz cuvette. The spectrum was accumulated 10-fold, corrected for buffer contributions, and converted to mean residue ellipticities according to Schmid (31Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 251-285Google Scholar). Data were analyzed for secondary structure content using the manufacturer's Jasco software. Tissue culture cell experiments, as well as in vitro nucleotide exchange assays, have established that SopE is capable of stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange in a number of RhoGTPases, including Cdc42 and Rac1 (14Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, it has remained unclear whether SopE activates guanine nucleotide exchange by stabilizing the nucleotide free state of RhoGTPases. Alternatively, SopE might activate nucleotide exchange by introducing a so far unknown type of chemical modification that may increase the intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange of the RhoGTPase. Most of the types of chemical modifications (namely ADP ribosylation, glucosylation, and the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine), which are introduced by other bacterial toxins (7Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), can be ruled out because SopE-mediated nucleotide exchange activity can be observedin vitro in the absence of cofactors such as UDP-glucose, ATP, or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. In contrast, mechanisms involving the deamidation of glutamine or asparagine residues or other types of chemical modification of RhoGTPases that do not depend on the presence of special cofactors have not been ruled out. To address this hypothesis, we used a filter binding assay and analyzed the interaction of SopE with Rac1 in more detail. In these and all subsequent experiments, SopE78–240 was used, a 162-amino acid fragment of SopE that makes up the catalytic domain of the protein (14Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). To detect putative SopE-mediated covalent modifications via their effect on the intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates of Rac1, we started out by analyzing the effect of SopE on the rates of [3H]GDP release from [3H]GDP-loaded Rac1 in more detail. As long as no additional unlabeled nucleotide was added to the assay, the presence of 1 μm SopE78–240had no effect on the binding of [3H]GDP to Rac1 (Fig.2 a). However, when [3H]GDP-loaded Rac1 was incubated with 1 μmSopE78–240 in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled GDP, release of [3H]GDP from Rac1 was completed within less than 10 s. Therefore, if SopE were mediating nucleotide release by introducing a chemical modification, 10 s would be sufficient for complete modification of Rac1 and for nucleotide release from the “modified” Rac1. In other words, the presence of a putative modification should be detectable by virtue of a greatly increased rate of intrinsic nucleotide exchange of Rac1. In the first approach to detect putative chemical modifications, we have measured the rate of [3H]GDP release from [3H]GDP-loaded Rac1 (0.2 μm) in the presence of low concentrations of SopE78–240 (0.04 μm). Under these conditions, nucleotide exchange was completed to about 90% within 14 min (Fig. 2 b, ♦, control experiment). Therefore, under these conditions 14 min must be sufficient to allow SopE to interact with (and possibly modify) about 90% of the [3H]GDP-loaded Rac1 in the assay. No [3H]GDP release was observed during the first 14 min when GDP was omitted (Fig. 2 b, ○). If modification of Rac1 would have taken place during this time, intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange rates of Rac1 should be strongly increased and nucleotide exchange should be completed to 90% in less than 10 s after addition of excess unlabeled GDP. However, when unlabeled GDP (final concentration, 1 mm) was added at min 14, nucleotide exchange was initiated and proceeded with the same slow kinetics (k obs = 0.24 ± 0.03 min−1; Fig. 2 b, ○) as observed in the control experiment (k obs = 0.28 ± 0.04 min−1; Fig. 2 b, ♦). This indicates that SopE-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange is not due to covalent modification of Rac1. In a second approach to detect putative chemical modifications we have analyzed the properties of Rac1 that had been affinity purified on a GST·SopE78–240 column. For purification of Rac1, we have taken advantage of the high affinity binding of SopE to Rac1 in the absence of guanine nucleotides. In the presence of excess guanine nucleotide binding is much weaker (14Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) (see below), a property also reported for small GTPase·GEF complexes (32Miki T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 33Hart M. Powers S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). GST·SopE78–240 was immobilized on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, Rac1 was loaded onto this column in a buffer containing no free guanine nucleotide, and bound Rac1 was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm GDP (Fig.3 a). Unbound GDP was removed by dialysis, and the intrinsic rate of [3H]GDP release of the affinity purified Rac1 (Rac1GDP-el.) was analyzed in a filter binding assay (Fig. 3 b). For this purpose Rac1GDP-el. was loaded with [3H]GDP and subsequently assayed in the presence (Fig. 3 b, ●) or absence (♦) of 1 mm unlabeled GDP. In both cases, virtually no [3H]GDP release was observed during the entire assay. The 20% reduction in the amount of radioactivity bound to Rac1GDP-el. that was observed upon addition of 1 mm unlabeled GDP was also observed with the “original” Rac1 (Fig. 2 a, ●) and might be attributable to some [3H]GDP binding nonspecifically to Rac1GDP-el. or to proteins misfolded during the loading procedure that can be easily displaced by unlabeled GDP. In the presence of 1 mm unlabeled GDP and 1 μmSopE78–240, however, all [3H]GDP was displaced in less than 10 s, demonstrating that the Rac1GDP-el. preparation was still active and that it was capable of interacting with SopE for a second time (Fig.3 b). We also analyzed Rac1GDP-el. for the presence of possible chemical modifications that may have been introduced by SopE. Rac1GDP-el. was digested with protease Glu-C, a highly specific protease that cleaves proteins at glutamate residues. Therefore, deamidation of any of the glutamine residues in Rac1GDP-el. should yield an additional Glu-C cleavage site. The proteolytic fragments of the Glu-C digest were purified by HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Within the limits of experimental error (± 1 Da), each of the proteolytic fragments detected had the same mass as predicted for unmodified Rac1 (data not shown). No proteolytic fragments attributable to additional glutamate residues were detected. In conclusion, these results establish that SopE belongs to a novel class of bacterial toxins interfering with RhoGTPase function of host cells. In contrast to all other known bacterial toxins addressing these central regulators of host cell function, SopE does not introduce covalent chemical modifications. Instead, SopE enhances nucleotide exchange rates of RhoGTPases by transient interaction. SopE does not share any sequence similarity with the active dbl domain or any other parts of eukaryotic GEFs. Therefore it was of interest to study the SopE-mediated nucleotide exchange reaction in more detail. Several functionally important residues are highly conserved among small GTP-binding proteins. Ras and Cdc42 mutants carrying a valine instead of the universally conserved glycine 12 are constitutively active in tissue culture experiments (34Seeburg P.H. Colby W.W. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 35Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar, 36Qiu R.G.

This is presumably due to strongly reduced rates of GTP hydrolysis in the absence or presence of GTPase-activating protein, as inferred from biochemical analyses of Ras and Cdc42 (4Ahmadian M.R.

In C6 glioma and NRK kidney cells, cat-1 mRNA levels increased 3.8–18-fold following 2 h of amino acid starvation. The transcription rate of the cat-1 gene remained unchanged during amino acid starvation, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation. This mechanism was investigated by expressing a cat-1 mRNA from a tetracycline-regulated promoter. The cat-1 mRNA contained 1.9 kilobase pairs (kb) of coding sequence, 4.5 kb of 3′-untranslated region, and 80 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region. The full-length (7.9 kb) mRNA increased 5-fold in amino acid-depleted cells. However, a 3.4-kb species that results from the usage of an alternative polyadenylation site was not induced, suggesting that the cat-1 mRNA was stabilized bycis-acting RNA sequences within the 3′-UTR. Transcription and protein synthesis were required for the increase in full-lengthcat-1 mRNA level. Because omission of amino acids from the cell culture medium leads to a substantial decrease in protein synthesis, the translation of the increased cat-1 mRNA was assessed in amino acid-depleted cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that cat-1 mRNA and protein levels changed in parallel. The increase in protein level was significantly lower than the increase in mRNA level, supporting the conclusion thatcat-1 mRNA is inefficiently translated when the supply of amino acids is limited, relative to amino acid-fed cells. Finally, y+-mediated transport of arginine in amino acid-fed and -starved cells paralleled Cat-1 protein levels. We conclude that thecat-1 gene is subject to adaptive regulation by amino acid availability. Amino acid depletion initiates molecular events that lead to increased cat-1 mRNA stability.

In mammalian cells, decreased amino acid availability causes substantially decreased protein synthesis (1Pain V.M. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as well as changes in mRNA stability and gene transcription (2Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S.

Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in the sequestration of eIF-2B, with a decrease in the availability of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNA ternary complexes for binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunits (4Price N. Proud C. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells have the ability to compensate for the effects of total or individual amino acid starvation by activating the transcription of the genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, through a general control mechanism (5Laine R.O. Shay N.F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism involves the enhancement of translation of the transcription factor GCN4 (6Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12696-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that mammalian cells, like yeast, have a general control mechanism to respond to amino acid limitations for genes involved in different aspects of amino acid metabolism (5Laine R.O. Shay N.F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific examples of mRNAs or proteins for which synthesis is enhanced in response to amino acid deprivation include serine dehydratase (9Ogawa H. Fujioka M. Su Y. Kanamoto R. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20412-20417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), asparagine synthase (10Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell.

J. 1993; 295: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of regulation of gene expression by amino acid availability has only been studied for the asparagine synthase (AS)1gene (9Ogawa H. Fujioka M. Su Y. Kanamoto R.

The steady state level of AS mRNA has been shown to be increased by amino acid starvation (15Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This increase is caused both by an increase in gene transcription (15Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and an increase in mRNA stability (10Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Changes in mRNA stability influence gene expression in mammalian cells (16Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The steady state level of an mRNA is a reflection both of its rate of synthesis and its rate of degradation. Amino acid depletion has been shown to increase the stability of the AS mRNA (10Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that expression of the cationic amino acid transporter gene, cat-1, is subject to adaptive regulation by amino acid availability in cultured hepatoma cells by a post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation (17Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cat-1mRNA level increased in cells depleted of amino acids and returned to fed levels when starved cells were shifted to amino acid-containing medium (17Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although protein synthesis is decreased during amino acid depletion, some mRNAs are preferentially translated (1Pain V.M. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, increased cat-1 mRNA levels could result in sustained or increased protein levels in depleted cells. Moreover, the increasedcat-1 mRNA will be available for protein synthesis once amino acid levels return to normal. In this paper we investigate the mechanism by which amino acid starvation causes an accumulation of cat-1 mRNA. First, we show that amino acid depletion causes accumulation ofcat-1 mRNA in cultured C6 glioma and NRK kidney cells in addition to the hepatoma cells we studied previously (17Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Second, we show that the mechanism of mRNA accumulation does not involve regulation of transcription. Rather, increased mRNA half-life in amino acid-starved cells is responsible for the accumulation. This stabilization appears to be caused by the interaction oftrans-acting factors with sequences in the 3′-UTR of thecat-1 mRNA in amino acid-depleted cells. Finally, we show that increased cat-1 mRNA stability results in increased Cat-1 protein and increased cationic amino acid transport. The transport of cationic amino acids into most mammalian cells is mediated mainly by system y+ (18White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four related proteins have been identified that differ in their affinity for substrate (19MacLeod C. Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 109-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ito K. Groudine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 26780-26786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Hosokawa H.

The genes of these proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, thus regulating amino acid flux for tissue-specific nutritional needs (19MacLeod C. Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 109-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cat-1transporter is the only member of the y+ transporter family that has been reported to be regulated by amino acid availability (17Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M.

Amino acid-fed cells were cultured in dFBS-supplemented DMEM/F-12 (fed), whereas cells were amino acid-depleted by culture in dFBS-supplemented Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (starved). Polyclonal antiserum was raised against an oligopeptide (LAAGQAKTPDSNLDQ), corresponding to predicted amino acids 605–620 of the murine cat-1 cDNA (22Wu J.-Y. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide has 100% homology with the equivalent sequence of the rat protein. A cysteine was added to the N terminus of the oligopeptide to allow coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The complex contained 0.7 mg of peptide/mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The complex (1.7 mg of protein/ml) was diluted 1:1 with Freund's adjuvant, and 118 μl of the mixture was injected intradermally into rabbits. Rabbits were boosted five times, and were bled 120 days after the first immunization.

However, in the present study, the size of the cat-1 mRNA is described as 7.9 kb, to be consistent with earlier reports that estimated the size based on the electrophoretic mobility of the cat-1 mRNA on agarose gels (22Wu J.-Y.

Probes for Northern blot analysis were generated by random primed labeling with [α-32P]dCTP in the reaction mix using a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The specific activity of the probes was 108 to 109 cpm/μg DNA. Methods described previously were used for RNA analysis (25Aulak K.S. Liu J. Hyatt S.L. Puppi M. Henning S.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol.

Tissue culture cells were placed into 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% sarcosyl, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0. The samples were immediately homogenized. The homogenate was then loaded onto a cushion of 5.7m CsCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and spun at 125,000 × g for 16 h. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5, and precipitated by the addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol and sodium acetate (0.3 m final concentration). The precipitate was then dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and samples were immediately frozen at −80 °C until required. For Northern blots, samples of 25 μg of total RNA were dissolved in denaturing solution (5 mm HEPES, 0.05% SDS, 8% formaldehyde), heated at 65 °C for 5 min and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel containing 6.6% formaldehyde, 0.02 m MOPS, pH 7.2, and 0.002 m sodium citrate. RNA was transferred onto Gene-Screen Plus and hybridized with the appropriate DNA hybridization probes in 1.5 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 0.5 mNaH2PO4, 0.5 mNa2HPO4 pH 7.0, at 65 °C for 24 h. Blots were washed in 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). For the ribonuclease protection assay, the DNA template was generated by cloning the pUHD10–3-derived XhoI/EcoRI 450-bp fragment containing the tet promoter, into theXhoI/EcoRI sites of pBluescript KS−. The template plasmid was digested with XhoI and antisense RNA was synthesized using the Maxiscript™ kit (Ambion), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Ambion). RNase protection was performed using the RPA II™ kit (Ambion). Nuclei were prepared from rat hepatoma cells as described previously (17Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, plates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline. Pelleted cells (600 × g, 4 °C for 5 min) were lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 7 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 600 × g, 4 °C for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and centrifuged again. Nuclei were suspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Nuclear run-off assays were performed by the following method. Frozen nuclei (2 × 107 nuclei, 200 μl) were added to 200 μl of 25% glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, 1.2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm GTP, 0.6 mm CTP. After the addition of 40 units/ml RNase inhibitor and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, this mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min and the reaction was stopped by the addition of RNase-free DNase I and 1/10 volume of 10 mm CaCl2. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, after which 40 μl of 10× SET buffer (5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0), 20 μl of 2 mg/ml proteinase K, and 10 μl of 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA was added. The reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, extracted with 1 ml of RNAzol B mixed with 10% (v/v) chloroform, and then precipitated with isopropanol at −20 °C. Finally, the purified and washed RNA was dissolved in 100 μl of 0.5% SDS. The radiolabeled RNA from each sample was denatured and hybridized to dot blots containing 2 μg of purified cDNA fragments or total rat genomic DNA immobilized onto nitrocellulose filters. Blots were hybridized for 72 h at 45 °C in 1 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, and 7% SDS. The blots were washed with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45 °C for 1 h and exposed to film. Slots containing genomic DNA were used to normalize the efficiency of the nuclear run-off reactions. Signals on Northern blots and nuclear run off experiments were quantified by using either a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or the densitometer CS SCAN 5000 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The efficiency of transcription of the nuclei in amino acid-fed and amino acid-depleted cells was normalized against the signal of total rat genomic DNA. Given that transcription of many genes may be regulated in hepatoma cells, the choice of genomic DNA was more reliable than a particular cellular gene and gave us reproducible data. The relative transcription rate was expressed as the ratio of the individual cDNA autoradiographic signals over the signal of total rat genomic DNA. Different autoradiographic exposure times were used for quantitation, to ensure that the exposures were within the linear range of the x-ray film and the detection instrument. C6 and NRK cells were plated in Costar 24-well plates at a density of 0.2–0.25 × 106cells/well and cultured for 48 h (29Kilberg M.S. Heping H. Barber E.F. Chiles T.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).trans-Stimulation experiments were performed by incubating the cells for 1 h before the assay in dFBS-supplemented DMEM/F-12 or KRB, containing 2 mm lysine. For the transport study, the cells were depleted for 5 min in choline KRP (119 mmcholine chloride, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1.2 mm KHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm choline HCO3) at 37 °C. Transport was measured by incubating the cells in choline KRP containing [3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml, 50 μm) and 2.5 mm leucine for 30 s at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold choline KRP, allowed to air-dry, and dissolved in 0.2% SDS, 0.2 m NaOH. Aliquots were used for scintillation counting and subjected to protein analysis using the Lowry method. Values were corrected for nonspecific uptake, which was measured in the presence of 2.5 mm unlabeled arginine. y+ transport activity was calculated as pmol of Arg/mg of protein/30 s. Cells were plated a day prior to subjecting them to experimental condition. Cells were lysed after washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were stored in aliquots in −70 °C, after removing cellular debris by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. A membrane fraction was obtained by homogenizing cells in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin in an all-glass homogenizer for 45 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was suspended in the same buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration of the samples was assayed by the Bio-Rad DC protein reagent kit. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were prepared in sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 0.125m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% mercaptoethanol) and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane at 65 mA for 2 h at 20 °C using the Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. After transfer, the membranes were blocked overnight in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6) containing 5% nonfat dried milk at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies for 2 h at 25 °C and then washed three times in TBS-T for 5 min each. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in TBS-T containing 5% non fat dried milk. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each in TBS-T. Cat-1 and AS were detected by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR film. The primary antibodies used were WCAT-1 anti-cat-1antiserum and 3G6, a monoclonal antibody against human AS (30Sheng S. Moraga D.A. van Heeke G. Shuster S.M. Protein Exp. Purif. 1992; 3: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). cat-1 gene expression results in accumulation of a major mRNA species of 7.9 kb and a minor one of 3.4 kb (25Aulak K.S. Liu J. Hyatt S.L. Puppi M. Henning S.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29799-29806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two mRNAs result from alternative polyadenylation at two sites within the 3′-UTR (25Aulak K.S. Liu J. Hyatt S.L. Puppi M. Henning S.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29799-29806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the levels of both mRNAs are increased when Fao hepatoma cells are depleted of amino acids (17Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether this regulation is a general phenomenon, the effect of amino acid depletion on the accumulation of the cat-1 mRNAs in C6 glioma and NRK kidney cell lines was studied. The cat-1 gene is expressed in both cell lines grown in amino acid-containing medium, as evident from the presence of the 7.9- and 3.4-kb mRNAs (Fig.2, A and C). In both cell lines, amino acid depletion caused an induction of bothcat-1 mRNA species. In NRK cells, the level of the 7.9-kb mRNA increased 3.8-fold in 2 h, reached a peak (6.5-fold) in 6 h, and declined after 24 h (Fig. 2,A and B). In C6 cells, the 7.9-kbcat-1 mRNA levels peaked at 6 h (18-fold) and remained elevated throughout the 36-h duration of the experiment (Fig.2, C and D). A smaller increase in the level of the 3.4-kb mRNA was observed (Fig. 2, A andC). The increase was 2-fold for C6 and 3-fold for NRK cells. As a positive control for regulation of gene expression by amino acid depletion, we measured the levels of AS mRNA (14Hutson R.G Kilberg M.S Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is known to be induced by amino acid depletion (10Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Hutson R.G Kilberg M.S Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As expected, the AS mRNA was increased similarly to the cat-1 mRNA (Fig.2 C). The levels of the mRNA for GAPDH and 18 S ribosomal RNA were also measured. As expected (17Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the level of the GAPDH mRNA decreased after 24 and 36 h of amino acid starvation (Fig. 2, A and C) and the level of the 18 S ribosomal RNA did not change (Fig. 2 C). The induction of the cat-1 mRNA could be due either to increased mRNA stability or to increased transcription of thecat-1 gene. We have therefore measured the effect of amino acid depletion on the transcription rate of the cat-1 gene using nuclear run-off. The transcription rate of the cat-1gene remained the same during the 6 h of amino acid depletion in both C6 (Fig. 3 A) and NRK cells (data not shown). These data are in agreement with our previous finding that induction of the cat-1 mRNA in amino acid-depleted Fao cells is due to a post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation (17Hyatt S.L.

The transcription rates of two other genes known to be regulated by amino acid availability, AS (14Hutson R.G Kilberg M.S Biochem.

The sequence of the longest cDNA clone of ST6GalNAc V encoded a type II membrane protein with 8 amino acids comprising the cytoplasmic domain, 21 amino acids comprising the transmembrane region, and 306 amino acids comprising the catalytic domain. The predicted amino acid sequence showed homology to the previously cloned ST6GalNAc III and IV, with common amino acid sequences in sialyl motifs L and S among these three enzymes. Eleven CAG repeats were found in the stem region. A fusion protein with protein A and extracts from L cells transfected with ST6GalNAc V in a expression vector showed enzyme activity of α2,6-sialyltransferase almost exclusively for GM1b, but not toward glycoproteins. Sialidase treatment and thin layer chromatography immunostaining revealed that the product was GD1α. Northern blotting revealed that three transcripts of the gene were expressed specifically in brain tissues. It is concluded that this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of GD1α in the nervous tissues, and the CAG repeats may have implications in neurodegenerative diseases."

Several homologous l-DEXs have been found in various Pseudomonas species and inXanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, a bacterium that is able to degrade the xenobiotic compound 1,2-dichloroethane (1Kurihara T.

Because microorganisms that contain dehalogenases can be used in a biotechnological approach to detoxify halogenated aliphatics (4Stucki G. Thüer M. Environ. Sci.

In addition, the stereospecificity of l-DEXs could make them useful for the biosynthesis of chiral 2-hydroxyalkanoic acids. Furthermore,l-2-haloacid dehalogenase is the prototypical member of a large superfamily of hydrolases, the haloaciddehalogenase (HAD) superfamily identified by Koonin and co-workers (5Koonin E.V.

The enzymes share a sequence identity of 40%, and their structures are closely related. Both enzymes have a mixed α/β core domain in a Rossmann fold with a four-helix bundle subdomain insertion. DhlB is somewhat larger, and the 21 extra residues form a two-helix excursion from the α/β core domain on the same side as the four-helix bundle. Together these helical domains provide a tight dimer interface and limit the substrate specificity of the X. autotrophicusenzyme to short substrates such as haloacetates and halopropionates (8Ridder I.S.

For clarity, homologous residues are numbered according to the DhlB sequence. Asp8 was identified as the nucleophile in the first step of the enzymatic reaction, the formation of a covalent enzyme-ester intermediate. Furthermore, these studies revealed eight more charged and polar amino acids (Thr12, Arg39, Ser114, Lys147, Tyr153, Ser171, Asn173, and Asp176) that are involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Most of the catalytically critical residues are conserved in the HAD superfamily and they stand out from the main domain. The only exception is Arg39, which is provided by the four-helix bundle domain. The x-ray structures enabled a detailed discussion of the role of these residues, and in particular useful information could be extracted from a model of a boundl-2-monochloropropionate (MCPA) substrate, which was based on the position of a formate ion in the active site of DhlB (8Ridder I.S.

The conserved serine residue in motif II, Ser114, was proposed to bind the carboxylate moiety of the substrate, and a halide-binding cradle formed by Arg39, Tyr10, and Phe175 was postulated. Conserved residues from motifs I and III, Thr12, Ser171, and Asn173, were found to interact with the nucleophile Asp8 Oδ2 atom possibly making up an oxyanion hole, and the motif III Lys147 Nζ was hydrogen-bonded to the Oδ1 atom of the nucleophile. These proposals were recently corroborated by crystal structures of an inactive S171A l-DEX YL mutant enzyme covalently bound to several chloroalkanoate substrates (12Li Y.-F. Hata Y. Fujii T.

To gain more insight into the abstraction of the halide ion and the reaction of the enzyme with MCPA, one of its best substrates (9van der Ploeg J. van Hall G. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7925-7933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we extended our crystallographic studies on DhlB. One soaking experiment with MCPA was done at pH 8, at which the enzyme is active, to obtain information about the enzyme structure during or after processing of the substrate. Two other experiments were performed at low pH to trap the reaction intermediates of MCAA and l-MCPA in a similar way as was done previously for haloalkane dehalogenase (14Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Here we present the 1.52 Å resolution structure of the unliganded enzyme and the structures of covalent ester intermediates of the native enzyme withl-MCPA and MCAA, including a bound chloride ion. The structures experimentally confirm the substrate binding model proposed earlier (8Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33015-33022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and contribute to the detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. Crystals of l-2-haloacid dehalogenase were grown in the presence of sodium formate by macroseeding as described previously (15Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kingma J. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2619-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The enzyme crystallizes in two orthorhombic space groups, C2221 andP212121. For the soaking experiment the better diffracting primitive crystal form was chosen (a = 56.75 Å, b = 83.83 Å,c = 90.81 Å, 2 mol/asymmetric unit). As formate binds in the active site of the enzyme, crystals were washed two times in fresh synthetic mother liquor (25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0) in an attempt to remove the formate. One crystal was transferred to a solution of slightly higher pH, containing 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mmbis-Tris, pH 8.0, equilibrated for 20 min at room temperature, and finally soaked for 3 h in synthetic mother liquor, pH 8.0, containing 20 mmd,l-2-monochloropropionic acid. A second crystal was transferred to a more acidic solution of 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm citrate, pH 5.0, at 4 °C, equilibrated for 20 min, and soaked for 45 min at 4 °C in synthetic mother liquor containing 20 mmd,l-MCPA. A third, analogous experiment was done at pH 5.0 using 10 mm monochloroacetic acid (MCAA) instead of MCPA. Diffraction data were collected at cryotemperature (100 K) from single crystals at experimental station ID14-3, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble (MCPA, pH 8 experiment) and at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Outstation at Deutches Electronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, beamline X11 (MCPA, pH 5 experiment) and beamline X31 (MCAA, pH 5 experiment). The ID14-3 beamline (λ = 0.9475 Å) was equipped with a MarCCD detector system, and the X11 (λ = 0.9095 Å) and X31 (λ = 1.00 Å) beamlines with a 30-cm and a 18-cm MAR image plate area detector, respectively. Data were integrated and merged with DENZO/SCALEPACK (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 396-399Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) clearly showed density for a formate ion in the active site of both molecules, indicating that the substrate had not bound. Nevertheless, the model was refined because of the improved resolution compared with the 1AQ6 structure. The set of reflections set apart to calculate R free values (21Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) in the refinement of the 1.95 Å native structure was extended to cover 5% of the additional data as well. After an initial round of rigid body refinement, the model was subjected to one refinement cycle of torsion-angle dynamics (22Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and subsequent cycles of positional andB-factor refinement for all atoms and refinement of the occupancy of residues with two conformations, all performed with CNS 0.5 (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Geometry checks pointed out a considerable number of N–Cα–C bond angles that deviated from their ideal value (24Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Hence, the CNS topology and parameter files were adjusted such that the restraint on the main chain ω dihedral angle was relaxed to 20% of its original value without changing the restraints on the otherX-N-C-X dihedral angles (X = any atom). This was done to allow for the large variability of the ω angle observed in atomic resolution structures (25MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1180-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1273-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After the adjustment, no deviating bond angles were flagged anymore. However, the ω angle of the nucleophile Asp8 became 163°, which is far off the normal value for a trans-peptide bond. At all stages ςA-weighted 2F o −F c electron density maps were calculated and inspected with O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) to check the agreement of the model with the data. PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (29Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar) were used to assess the stereochemical quality. Whenever necessary the model was manually adjusted in O. When the refinement gave no further decrease inR free nor any improvement in stereochemistry, it was considered completed. A final round of refinement including all data resulted in an overall crystallographic R-factor of 19.8% for data ranging from 20.0 to 1.52 Å resolution. Refinement and model statistics are given in Table I, and the quality of the electron density can be judged from Fig. 1 A. The asymmetric unit contains two protein molecules of residues 1–245 forming the DhlB dimer, 571 water molecules, and two formate ions. In molecule A, Arg25, Glu79, Thr93, Lys109, Gln122, Ser172, Ser186, Met218, Thr222, and Glu225 have two conformations, and in molecule B, a second side chain position is found for Asp21, Glu79, Thr93, Ser152, Ser172, Met218, and Thr222. In both molecules, the loop formed by residues 204–207 and the C termini have been remodeled, and in molecule B, the cis-peptide bond between Ala106 and Pro107 has been replaced by atrans-peptide bond. Furthermore, in both molecules the helix and loop formed by residues 122–132 have shifted by 0.6 Å on average, although no structural reason is apparent. For the MCPA pH 5 experiment, the 1.52 Å pH 8 structure described above was used as a starting model. Initial ςA-weighted 2F o − F c andF o − F c electron density maps clearly showed density extending from Asp8 Oδ1 for all MCPA atoms except for the chlorine, indicating that the substrate had bound covalently and that the chlorine atom had been cleaved off. The same refinement strategy as described above was employed. Unambiguous difference electron density enabled us to build in the covalently bound substrate (Fig.1 B). Also a chloride ion was identified in the active site on the basis of residual positive difference density around a “water molecule” with aB-factor of 2.0 Å2 and the chemical environment. In addition, a diffraction experiment with a 2-monoiodoacetic acid substrate gave a peak of more than double intensity in the electron density map at this position (data not shown). Topology and parameter files for the covalently modified residue were generated with XPLO2D (30Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). At the end of the refinement, a final round including all data resulted in an overall crystallographic R-factor of 17.0% for data ranging from 20.0 to 1.70 Å resolution. Refinement and model statistics are given in Table I. The DhlB structures with and without bound MCPA are very alike with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.24 Å for all Cα atoms of the dimer, so it can be concluded that the overall structure of the enzyme is not influenced by the binding of its substrate. The disorder observed with the pH 8 experiment in the loop that contains residues 25–27 (see “Results” and “Discussion”) could be resolved in the B molecule in the MCPA experiment as two different conformations of the main chain in this region. In molecule A, Arg25, Thr93, Lys109, Ser152, Ser172, Ser186, Met218, Thr222, and Glu225 have two conformations, and in molecule B, a second side chain position is found for Lys41, Arg54, Glu79, Thr93, Gln100, Lys109, Ser152, Ser172, Ser186, Met218, and Thr222. The region from residues Ala208 to Phe213 is disordered as was observed in the native enzyme, pH 8 (see “Results” and “Discussion”). In the refinement of the MCAA model these characteristics were preserved. For the MCAA pH 5 experiment, the pH 5 DhlB structure with the covalent MCPA intermediate bound was used as a starting model. An initial ςA-weighted 2F o −F c electron density map clearly showed density extending from Asp8 Oδ1, and in theF o − F c map negative electron density was observed at the C3 position of the MCPA, indicating that the smaller MCAA substrate had bound. The chloride ion was also found in an analogous position. A similar refinement strategy as described above for the MCPA structure was employed. Residues with alternative conformations were preserved and their occupancies were not refined. Refinement was completed with a final round including all data, resulting in an overall crystallographic R-factor of 17.1% for data ranging from 20.0 to 2.1 Å resolution. Refinement and model statistics are given in Table I. The enzyme structures complexed with MCPA and MCAA have an r.m.s. deviation of only 0.13 Å for all 490 Cα atoms, and consequently the results discussed below refer to both molecules unless stated otherwise. The structures were analyzed using programs from the CCP4 suite (31Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50 (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4): 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar), LSQMAN (32Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), VOIDOO (33Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), and the BIOMOL package (Protein Crystallography Group, University of Groningen). The atomic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the entry codes 1qq5,1qq7, and 1qq6 for MCPA (pH 8), MCPA (pH 5), and MCAA (pH 5) experiments, respectively. The structure of dimeric l-2-haloacid dehalogenase at pH 8 is very similar to the previously reported 1.95 Å resolution structure (8Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33015-33022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with an r.m.s. difference of 0.47 Å for all 490 Cα atoms. This difference can be attributed to a few regions in the protein where the molecule has been modeled differently (see “Materials and Methods”). The disorder observed before in two loops and the C terminus (residues 25–27, 204–206, and 243–245) is present in this structure as well. The high resolution of the data enabled the identification of alternate conformations for 17 side chains. Moreover, in both molecules residues 208–213 were modeled in two different ways to account for ambiguities in the electron density. This region is part of the two-helix excursion (residues 193–219) that contributes significantly to the dimerization interface. Residues 208–213 in molecule A interact with the same residues in molecule B (Fig.2). It is surprising to see that equally good dimerization contacts can be made by two different conformations. The A and B molecules of the dimer can be superimposed with an r.m.s. difference of 0.29 Å for 245 Cα atoms. The major differences are found around the rebuilt residues (Pro107, the loop from residues 204–207, and the C terminus). None of these differences are considered functionally relevant, and therefore all results discussed below pertain to both molecules, unless stated otherwise. The active site of the enzyme at pH 8 contains a formate ion that originates from the crystallization solution. This ion was observed in the 1.95 Å resolution structure as well, and its position was used to construct a model for the binding of an l-MCPA substrate (8Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33015-33022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To replace the formate ion by MCPA, the crystal was washed several times. Apparently, the washing procedure was not sufficiently adequate to remove the ion. In the experiments with MCPA and MCAA at pH 5, a substrate is covalently bound in the active site of DhlB. In these structures, it has replaced the formate ion and the water molecules that were present in the native structure. Very clearly, continuous electron density extends from the Asp8 Oδ1 atom to the C2 atom of the substrates, whereas no density for a covalently attached chlorine atom is observed (Fig. 1, B and C). This indicates that a covalent bond has formed between the nucleophilic Asp8 residue and the substrate and that the covalent Cl–C bond in the substrate has been cleaved. The Asp8 Oδ2 atom has a carbonyl functionality in the enzyme-ester intermediate structure. It is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of the Thr12 side chain and the side chain amide group of Asn173 (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, in the MCPA covalent intermediate Ser171 Oγ is located within a 3.3-Å distance, but it is not in the plane of the carbonyl oxygen atom lone electron pairs. In the MCAA bound structure, however, the derivatized Asp8 side chain is rotated −30° about the Cβ–Cγ bond, bringing Ser171 Oγ much closer to the Oδ2 atom and at the same time increasing the distance to Thr12 Oγ1 (Fig. 3 B). This suggests a rotational freedom in the enzyme-ester intermediate, which might be used to optimize the interactions of the Oδ2 atom with the enzyme in the hydrolysis step of the reaction, when a negative charge develops on the Asp8 Oδ2 atom. The negative charge of this oxyanion intermediate might be stabilized by Thr12, Ser171, and Asn173, which together would form an oxyanion hole with a tetrahedral coordination of the oxyanion. A chloride ion is present close to the substrate C2 atom, Asn115, and Arg39. It is found in line with the Asp8 Oδ1–C2 bond, at a distance of 3.6 Å from the C2 atom of the substrate, and the ion is close to both Nη atoms of Arg39 and to the side chain amide group of Asn115. Both amino acid residues were shown to be catalytically essential in the l-DEX YL enzyme (1Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the chloride ion was not found in the covalent intermediate structures of this enzyme (12Li Y.-F. Hata Y. Fujii T. Hisano T. Nishihara M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15035-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the chloride is located in the plane of the aromatic ring of Phe175 at a closest distance of 4.7 and 4.2 Å in the MCPA and MCAA experiments, respectively. The difference is because of the interaction of the phenyl ring with the methyl group of the MCPA substrate, which is absent in MCAA. Aromatic ring systems are known to be partially positively charged in the plane of the ring (34Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Adv.

https://openalex.org/W1972148292,"The initial reaction of tetrapyrrole formation in archaea is catalyzed by a NADPH-dependent glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR). The hemA gene encoding GluTR was cloned from the extremely thermophilic archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant GluTR is a tetrameric enzyme with a nativeM r = 190,000 ± 10,000. Using a newly established enzyme assay, a specific activity of 0.75 nmol h−1 mg−1 at 56 °C with E. coliglutamyl-tRNA as substrate was measured. A temperature optimum of 90 °C and a pH optimum of 8.1 were determined. Neither heme cofactor, nor flavin, nor metal ions were required for GluTR catalysis. Heavy metal compounds, Zn2+, and heme inhibited the enzyme. GluTR inhibition by the newly synthesized inhibitor glutamycin, whose structure is similar to the 3′ end of the glutamyl-tRNA substrate, revealed the importance of an intact chemical bond between glutamate and tRNAGlu for substrate recognition. The absolute requirement for NADPH in the reaction of GluTR was demonstrated using four NADPH analogues. Chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that a single cysteinyl residue and a single histidinyl residue were important for catalysis. It was concluded that during GluTR catalysis the highly reactive sulfhydryl group of Cys-48 acts as a nucleophile attacking the α-carbonyl group of tRNA-bound glutamate with the formation of an enzyme-localized thioester intermediate and the concomitant release of tRNAGlu. In the presence of NADPH, direct hydride transfer to enzyme-bound glutamate, possibly facilitated by His-84, leads to glutamate-1-semialdehyde formation. In the absence of NADPH, a newly discovered esterase activity of GluTR hydrolyzes the highly reactive thioester of tRNAGlu to release glutamate."

We defined structures in heparan sulfate from human cerebral cortex that bind Aβ fibrils.

By contrast, binding of Aβ monomers requires, in addition, 6-O-sulfate groups on glucosamine residues. The binding specificity of fibrillar Aβ is shared by FGF-2, and we here show that cerebral heparan sulfate domains selected for binding to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils bind also to FGF-2. These data suggest that neurotoxic and neuroprotective signals may converge by competing for the same binding sites on the heparan sulfate chain.

Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 122: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). FGF-2 and HS also appear to colocalize in other amyloid lesions such as dialysis-related amyloidosis (11Morita H.

The complex structure of HS derives from regioselective modifications of a glucuronic acid-N-acetylglucosamine repeat (GlcA-GlcNAc)n structure during biosynthesis of the polysaccharide. The modification is initiated by partialN-deacetylation and N-sulfation of the GlcNAc residues. The protein binding sites generally reside within regions of consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units (NS-domains) (12Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar,13Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). NS domains are rich in IdoA (formed by C-5-epimerization of GlcA) and O-sulfate groups, that are most frequently found at C-2 of IdoA and C-6 of GlcNSO3. The O-sulfate substitution pattern of NS domains varies between different HS species and determines the protein binding specificity of the polysaccharide (12Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). NS domains are spaced along the polymers by arrays ofN-acetylated disaccharide units largely devoid ofO-sulfate groups (NA-domains) or by sequences of alternatingN-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharide units (NA/NS domains) (13Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Heparin, frequently used as a substitute for HS in experimental work, consists almost exclusively of highly modified NS domains and largely lacks the regioselective modification characteristic of HS. We here define an Aβ binding domain in human cerebral HS and show that it is strikingly similar in composition to the previously characterized domain interacting with FGF-2. Both proteins are recognized by the same NS domains with critical IdoA(2-OSO3) residues, indicating that Aβ and FGF compete for binding to the same HS binding sites. Aβ-(1–40) was synthesized at the departmental peptide synthesis facility. A stock solution of 5 mg/ml was prepared by dissolving the lyophilized peptide in water and stored as aliquots at −20 °C. For experiments with nonfibrillar peptide, aliquots were thawed and used immediately. Fibrillar Aβ-(1–40) was prepared by 1:10 dilution of the peptide with 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2 in 1.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, followed by a 2-day incubation at room temperature on a shaking platform (14Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31617-31624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T binding, as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy (15LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar), was used to monitor fibril formation. HS was prepared from autopsy specimens of human cerebral cortex (from an AD patient and an age-matched control subject) and radiolabeled, by partialN-deacetylation and re-N-[3H]acetylation as described previously (16Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Heparin from pig intestinal mucosa (Inolex Pharmaceutical Division, Park Forest South, IL) was radiolabeled byN-[3H]acetylation ofN-unsubstituted GlcN residues (17Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivities of the labeled preparations were estimated after quantification of the polysaccharides by the carbazole reaction (18Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Even-numbered, 3H-labeled heparin oligosaccharides andN-, 2-O-, and 6-O-desulfated heparin species were prepared as described previously (17Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of cerebral HS (from AD cortex) was N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis as described previously and subjected to deaminative cleavage by treatment with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (19Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). At this pH, the reagent cleaves the polymer at the N-unsubstituted GlcN residues generated byN-deacetylation. The NS domains will thus be recovered as ≥hexasaccharide fragments, whereas NA/NS domains give rise to tetrasaccharides and NA domains to disaccharides. The cleavage products were end-labeled by reduction with 0.5 mCi of NaB3H4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (16Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and passed through a column of Sephadex G-15 (1 × 190 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.2 mNH4HCO3. Fractions corresponding to NS domains were pooled, desalted and used in further studies. NS domains of defined sizes were prepared by chromatography on a column of Bio-Gel P10 (1 × 150 cm; Bio-Rad) in 0.5 mNH4HCO3. The octameric NS domains used in Aβ/FGF-2 affinity chromatography experiments (see below) were further purified by a second gel chromatography step on a Superdex 30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (1.5 × 60 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), run in 0.5 mNH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Filter trapping experiments (17Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with fibrillar Aβ-(1–40) were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.13 m NaCl (TBS) and with nonfibrillar Aβ-(1–40) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.12 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl. For analytical studies, radiolabeled saccharides were incubated with Aβ-(1–40) in a volume of 200 μl at room temperature for 2 h, after which the mixtures were rapidly passed through a nitrocellulose filter (Sartorius, pore size 0.45 μm; diameter 25 mm), followed by washing of the filter with the appropriate buffer (pH 7.4 or 5.5). Proteins and protein-bound saccharides remain on the filter, whereas unbound saccharides pass through. Bound saccharides were released from the filters with 2 m NaCl and quantified by scintillation counting. Preparative incubations were performed in a volume of 2 ml with a larger filter (38 mm in diameter). Bound and unbound saccharides were desalted and subjected to further analysis. Saccharides were also fractionated by Aβ and FGF-2 affinity chromatography. To prepare the Aβ affinity matrix, fibrillar Aβ-(1–40) in 1.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 240 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.7 mmCaCl2, and 0.9 mm MgCl2 was centrifuged (16,000 × g for 90 min), and the pellet was resuspended in TBS. The fibrils (∼1 mg) were mixed with 0.5 ml of Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel in TBS. This Aβ-(1–40) fibril-Sepharose CL4B mixture was applied on top of a 0.5-ml layer of Sepharose CL4B gel (without Aβ) that had been previously poured into a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad). Although no covalent immobilization of Aβ was used, the fibrils were unlikely to migrate in the gel because Aβ-(1–40) fibrils pelleted by centrifugation represent insoluble macrofibrils aggregated to huge meshworks (20Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). To further ensure that fibrils did not leak from the column, the column outlet was covered with a nitrocellulose filter that was placed on the porous gel support of the column. Samples of3H-labeled heparin dodecasaccharides were quantitatively bound to the column, whereas no binding occurred to a control column without Aβ fibrils (data not shown). To isolate Aβ binding HS domains, octameric [3H]NS-domains from cerebral HS (unfractionated or affinity fractionated on the FGF-2 matrix; see below) were applied to the column that was equilibrated with TBS. Saccharides bound to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils were eluted by a gradient of NaCl (0.13–2.0 m) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and measured for radioactivity. In preparative experiments, the bound and unbound saccharide pools were desalted and subjected to FGF-2 chromatography or to compositional disaccharide analysis. Recombinant human FGF-2 (21Zazo M. Lozano R.M. Ortega S. Varela J. Dı́az-Orejas R. Ramı́rez J.M. Giménez-Gallego G. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 113: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was covalently immobilized to 1 ml of a CH-Sepharose matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Prior to immobilization, FGF-2 (200 μg) was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of heparin to protect the heparin binding sites of the protein. The immobilization involves reaction of primary amino groups of the ligand with N-hydroxysuccinimide groups in the matrix. To avoid coupling of heparin to the matrix, potential free amino groups,i.e. N-unsubstituted GlcN units, had been previously destroyed by treatment of heparin with HNO2 at pH 3.9 followed by recovery of high molecular weight species resistant to the cleavage. Unfractionated or Aβ affinity fractionated, octameric [3H]NS-domains were applied to the column in TBS, followed by elution of FGF-2 bound saccharides with a gradient (0.13–2.0 m) of NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Following isolation by preparative filter trapping, the Aβ-(1–40) bound NS domains were subjected to chromatography on a Superdex 30 column as described above. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. The elution positions of the NS domains were compared with those of 3H-labeled heparin oligosaccharide standards. Fractions corresponding to 6–10-mers were pooled, desalted, and subjected to further analysis as described below. For compositional disaccharide analysis, the Aβ bound and unbound NS domains were reacted with HNO2 at pH 1.5, and the resultant disaccharide derivatives were radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4. The products were recovered by chromatography on Sephadex G-15 (1 × 190 cm) in 0.2 mNH4HCO3, and analyzed by chromatography on a Partisil-10 SAX HPLC column (16Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The non-O-sulfated disaccharide species are incompletely resolved from3H-labeled impurities on the SAX HPLC analysis, and were therefore quantified by high voltage paper electrophoresis (at pH 5.3) as described previously (22Kusche M. Lindahl U. Enerbäck L. Rodén L. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We first wanted to determine whether human cerebral HS species express domains capable of interacting with Aβ fibrils. For this purpose we used HS from autopsy specimens of cerebral cortex from an AD patient and an age-matched control subject. Our previously published structural characterization of cerebral HS indicated that, whereas this material was structurally distinct from other human HS species, there was no detectable difference in disaccharide composition between HS samples from AD and control brain (16Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of cerebral [3H]HS were incubated with Aβ-(1–40) fibrils, followed by trapping of the formed protein-HS complexes on nitrocellulose filters and quantification of the filter-bound radioactivity. Parallel incubations were performed with [3H]heparin from pig intestinal mucosa. As shown in Fig. 1, AD and control brain HS species and heparin all bound to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils in a dose-dependent, saturable manner. Scatchard analysis (not shown) of the binding data in Fig. 1 suggested that HS from AD and control brain bound Aβ-(1–40) with similar affinity,K d in the range of 10–100 nm. To define the minimal size of heparin oligosaccharides required for binding to Aβ, 3H-labeled, even-numbered heparin oligomers were incubated with Aβ-(1–40) fibrils, and the binding was assessed with the filter trapping method. The smallest fragments capable of significant binding to Aβ fibrils were hexasaccharides (Fig.2). Maximal binding, at less than twice the level observed for hexasaccharides, was reached with octasaccharides and longer oligosaccharides. To investigate the minimal length of Aβ binding NS domains from cerebral HS, such components were prepared and radiolabeled as described under “Materials and Methods” and incubated together with Aβ-(1–40) fibrils. The Aβ-bound NS domains were recovered using the filter trapping procedure in preparative mode, and further analyzed by gel chromatography on a column of Superdex 30 calibrated with standard heparin oligosaccharides (Fig. 2). The bound domains spanned a fairly narrow range of oligomer species, with a major proportion of octa/deca-saccharides and some hexasaccharides (Fig. 2). To characterize in more detail the structural requirements for HS binding to Aβ, NS domains were separated with regard to affinity for the fibrillar peptide, and the bound and unbound species were subjected to compositional analysis. Aβ bound NS hexamers (i.e. the smallest binding species), ∼10% of the total fraction, were recovered by nitrocellulose filter trapping and were then cleaved with HNO2 at pH 1.5. The resultant disaccharides were radiolabeled and separated by anion-exchange HPLC and paper electrophoresis (see “Materials and Methods”). Similar analysis was applied to the unbound hexamer fraction, and to NS octamers separated by affinity chromatography on immobilized Aβ fibrils. All samples yielded a major IdoA(2-OSO3)-a ManR disaccharide component (representing an IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3 sequence in the intact NS domains), other disaccharides occurring in smaller amounts (TableI; a representative anion-exchange HPLC pattern is shown in Fig. 3). Whereas the IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3 sequence was the only single disaccharide unit that approached or exceeded 1 mol/mol of each NS domain analyzed, total 6-O-sulfation reached comparable levels, such that total O-sulfation ranged from 2.1 to 4.0 residues/oligosaccharide (Table I). No consistent difference in composition between Aβ bound and unbound fractions was found. Whereas 2-O-sulfate groups thus appeared to be enriched in bound NS hexamer, 6-O-sulfation was more abundant in bound NS octamer. Notably, the Aβ unbound octamer used for disaccharide analysis had been subjected to repeated affinity chromatography and thus was depleted of binding species. The final Aβ unbound fraction corresponded to ∼60% of the initial unfractionated NS domain species (data not shown). These findings suggest that Aβ fibril binding should be attributed to the positioning rather than the total abundance of sulfate groups, i.e. to the sequence of differently substituted disaccharide units.Table IDisaccharide composition of Aβ bound and unbound NS domainsSampleDeamination productOverall degree of O-sulfationGlcA(2-OSO3)-aManRGlcA-aManR(6-OSO3)IdoA-aManR(6-OSO3)IdoA(2-OSO3)-aManRIdoA(2-OSO3)-aManR(6-OSO3)2-OSO3 6-OSO3 Total OSO3Disaccharide units/NS domainaThe proportions of the various disaccharide species were determined by separation of the O-sulfated disaccharide units by SAX HPLC chromatography (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 3) after assessing the proportions of the nonsulfated HexA-aManR disaccharide units by high voltage paper electrophoresis (data not shown).

Open table in a new tab To further assess the binding specificity, we tested the ability of selectively desulfated, unlabeled heparin preparations to inhibit binding of native [3H]heparin to fibrillar Aβ. Efficient inhibition was achieved with native heparin and with 6-O-desulfated heparin, 26-O-Desulfation (reaction with dimethyl sulfoxide) is accompanied by loss of ∼30% of the 2-O-sulfate groups in heparin (19Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This partial 2-O-desulfation may account for the somewhat decreased inhibitory effect of 6-O-desulfated as compared with native heparin. whereas the 2-O- and N-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin preparations had little or no inhibitory activity (Fig.4). These data indicate a critical role for 2-O-sulfate substituents in the HS-Aβ interaction and also point to the importance of N-sulfate groups, whereas 6-O-sulfate groups do not seem to be required for the binding. For comparison, we performed similar analysis using nonfibrillar Aβ-(1–40) as the protein ligand. Nonfibrillar Aβ binds heparin only at low pH (≤5.5) (23Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), presumably because the interaction requires protonation of the His14 and His15 residues in the peptide. At pH 5.5, Aβ monomers bound heparin and cerebral HS in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, as measured by the filter trapping procedure (data not shown). None of the selectively desulfated heparin preparations was able to inhibit binding of [3H]heparin to nonfibrillar Aβ, whereas addition of native heparin resulted in complete inhibition of binding (Fig. 4). These data suggest that N-, 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups all participate in the interaction between heparin and Aβ monomers. Collectively, the findings from the inhibition studies indicate that the fibrillar and nonfibrillar forms of Aβ-(1–40) are recognized by distinct saccharide domains. The above results suggest that the minimal NS domain structures recognizing Aβ-(1–40) fibrils are hexa-/octasaccharide sequences containing at least one IdoA(2-OSO3) residue. These features match those previously established for the FGF-2 binding NS domain (24Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the two proteins might share a common binding site in HS. We therefore fractionated 8-mer NS domains according to binding to Aβ or FGF-2 and then tested the bound and unbound saccharides for binding to the converse protein ligand. As shown in Fig.5, the Aβ bound saccharides were quantitatively retained by the FGF-2 affinity column, whereas the unbound saccharides showed partial binding. Further, the majority of FGF-2 bound saccharide species bound also to Aβ whereas the unbound saccharides had no Aβ affinity. These data demonstrate that FGF-2 and Aβ binding NS domains colocalize in HS from human cerebral cortex, such that the Aβ binding NS domains interact quantitatively with FGF-2, whereas, conversely, a major fraction of the FGF-2 binding NS domains also binds Aβ fibrils. The Aβ binding NS structures thus represent a major subpopulation of FGF-2 binding domains. We show that HS from human cerebral cortex binds Aβ-(1–40) fibrils via NS domains with 2-O-sulfated IdoA residues. By contrast, 6-O-sulfate groups, although present in Aβ binding NS domains, appear redundant to the interaction as shown by the ability of 6-O-desulfated heparin to efficiently compete with intact heparin for binding to Aβ-(1–40) fibrils. These binding requirements resemble those described earlier for the neuroprotective factor FGF-2. Biochemical studies of FGF-2 binding NS domains (24Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography of a FGF-2-heparin hexamer complex (25Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) suggest that a single IdoA(2-OSO3) residue in a 5–6-mer NS domain would be sufficient for high affinity binding (although the two approaches point to different locations of that residue). Indeed, cross-fractionation of octameric NS domains from cerebral HS, on immobilized FGF-2 and Aβ fibrils, revealed the occurrence of common binding sites. Further investigation of the Aβ binding domain is clearly needed to clarify its relationship to the FGF-2 binding domain, particularly with regard to the number and localization of IdoA(2-OSO3) residues. In brain HS, the two domains apparently overlap, such that sequences with Aβ affinity bind quantitatively to FGF-2, whereas a majority of the FGF-2 binding regions interact with Aβ. These data suggest that in AD, neuroprotective and neurotoxic pathways may converge by competing for the same HS binding sites and thus raise novel considerations with regard to therapeutic strategies based on modulation of Aβ-proteoglycan interactions. A multimeric (fibrillar) disposition of Aβ seems to be a prerequisite for HS/heparin binding at neutral pH (14Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31617-31624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, Aβ monomers bind HS/heparin at pH 5–6 (23Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C.A. Brunden K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18666-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggesting that HS and Aβ may interact in the acidic milieu of intracellular compartments where newly synthesized or endocytosed amyloid precursor protein/Aβ and HS are both present (27Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Brühl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We now show that the low pH interaction with Aβ-(1–40) monomers is distinguished from the interaction with fibrils by the requirement for 6-O-sulfate groups in the saccharide ligand. These distinct specificities conform to the notion that the interaction of HS with Aβ fibrils involves composite binding sites dependent on fibril formation rather than sites expressed in individual monomers. Heparin/HS presumably enhance Aβ fibrillization by providing a scaffold with multiple Aβ binding sites, thereby promoting the association of early fibrils to more mature ones (14Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31617-31624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Conversely, HS oligosaccharides encompassing a single Aβ fibril binding site could provide means of interfering with further fibrillization. Similar strategies could apply to other amyloidotic conditions where HS is known to enhance fibril formation. For example, fibrillization of amylin, occurring in pancreatic lesions of type 2 diabetes patients, is efficiently promoted by HS/heparin. Both theN- and O-sulfate substituents of heparin appear important for this effect (28Castillo G.M. Cummings J.A. Yang W. Judge M.E. Sheardown M.J. Rimvall K. Hansen J.B. Snow A.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the low pH interaction with Aβ monomer remains unclear. Assuming that the aggregation of Aβ begins intracellularly (as has been suggested because the Aβ concentrations found in extracellular fluids are insufficient to nucleate the fibril formation (29Lee S.-J. Liyanage U. Bickel P. Xia W. Lansbury P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar)), it might be possible to impede the initial aggregation process by appropriate saccharides/mimetics. Indeed, one of the hydrophobic regions of Aβ-(1–40) involved in the oligomerization of the peptide (30Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L.

Further detailed analysis of the various HS-Aβ interactions may promote the development of drugs capable of interfering, at different levels, with Aβ fibril formation, as well as with the Aβ-induced microglia activation (6Giulian D.

Complex formation between rusticyanin and its probable electron transfer partner, cytochrome c 4, induced a decrease of rusticyanin's redox midpoint potential by more than 100 mV together with spectral changes similar to those observed above the pK value of the free form. Complex formation thus substantially modifies the pK value of the surface-exposed histidine ligand to the copper ion and thereby tunes the redox midpoint potential of the copper site.

Complex formation between rusticyanin and its probable electron transfer partner, cytochrome c 4, induced a decrease of rusticyanin's redox midpoint potential by more than 100 mV together with spectral changes similar to those observed above the pK value of the free form. Complex formation thus substantially modifies the pK value of the surface-exposed histidine ligand to the copper ion and thereby tunes the redox midpoint potential of the copper site. Comparisons with reports on other blue copper proteins suggest that the surface-exposed histidine ligand is employed as a redox tuning device by many members of this group of soluble electron carriers. rusticyanin 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine The vast majority of intramolecular biological electron transfer reactions are now well understood on the basis of Marcus' theory of outer shell electron transfer (1Marcus R.A.

In the case ofintermolecular electron transfer the situation is complicated by possible alterations of physico-chemical parameters of the individual redox proteins upon transient formation of an electron transfer complex. Modulations of redox midpoint potentials of either one or both of the involved redox centers upon complex formation have been reported (4Vanderkooi J. Erecinska M. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1418-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), potentially affecting the driving force of the respective oxidoreduction reactions. Such effects are particularly conspicuous in complexes involving blue copper proteins (8Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Drepper F. Dorlet P. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1418-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Zhu Z.

For the case of the complex between plastocyanin and photosystem 1, an involvement of the surface-exposed histidine ligand to the copper ion in the modulation of plastocyanin's redox properties was discussed (8Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The crucial role of the corresponding histidine residue in the amicyanin-methylamine dehydrogenase complex was recently substantiated by site-specific mutagenesis and structural studies (10Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A unique example of blue copper proteins is provided by rusticyanin (RCy)1, a redox carrier isolated from the extremely acidophilic (pH 2), ore-leaching proteobacterium Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. Rusticyanin owes its name to its astonishingly oxidizing electrochemical potential of +680 mV at pH 2, sufficiently high to oxidize reduced iron compounds. In this work we have identified a tight electron transfer complex between RCy and cytochrome c 4, a further soluble redox protein from T. ferrooxidans. A detailed characterization of this complex with respect to spectral (optical and EPR) and redox properties demonstrated substantial alterations of all these properties in RCy upon complex formation. The correlation between these alterations and respective changes induced in free RCy at high pH values provides a rationale for the effects observed in the complex. A comparison with published data on other blue copper proteins strongly suggests that the mechanism of complex-induced tuning of reduction potentials mediated by the surface exposed histidine is wide spread in this class of proteins. T. ferrooxidans was grown as reported previously (11Nunzi F. Guerlesquin F. Shepard W. Guigliarelli B. Bruschi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RCy and cytochrome c 4were purified as described in Nunzi et al. (11Nunzi F. Guerlesquin F. Shepard W. Guigliarelli B. Bruschi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in Cavazza et al. (12Cavazza C. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Nitschke W. Appia C. Bonnefoy V. Bruschi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), respectively. The dissociation constant of the complex between both proteins was determined using the BiaCore technique (13Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Nitschke W. Cavazza C. Bruschi M. Biomine. 1997; 97: PB4.1-PB4.10Google Scholar). Optical redox titrations were performed on a Kontron Uvikon 932 spectrophotometer according to Dutton (14Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) in the presence of ferrocene dicarboxylic acid, ferrocene monocarboxylic acid, and potassium ferricyanide (all at 5 μm). The ambient potential was adjusted with sodium dithionite or potassium hexachloroiridate. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300e X-band spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instruments liquid helium cryostat and temperature control system. Rusticyanin forms a tight electron transfer complex with cytochrome c 4 . Despite several decades of research, the nature and sequence of electron carriers involved in the initial steps of Fe2+ oxidation by T. ferrooxidans are still uncertain. A number of soluble periplasmic redox proteins potentially participating in this electron transport chain have been purified and characterized and three of them have been studied in more detail, i.e. the blue copper protein rusticyanin (RCy; Ref. 15Cox J.C. Boxer D.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 17: 497-502Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a high potential iron sulfur protein (Refs.16Kusano T. Takeshima T. Sugawara K. Inoue C. Shiratori T. Yano T.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Their organization into an electron transport chain bridging the span from Fe2+ to the membrane-bound, energy-conserving electron transport pathways is still a matter of debate (13Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Nitschke W. Cavazza C. Bruschi M. Biomine. 1997; 97: PB4.1-PB4.10Google Scholar, 18Blake R.C. Shute E.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9220-9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Yamanaka T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16760-16765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to obtain information concerning the possible electron transfer partners of RCy, we have studied pairwise affinities within the set of soluble redox proteins using the Biacore technique. A particularly strong association constant (K D = 2.07 × 10−7m) was found for the complex of rusticyanin with cytochrome c 4, indicating that electron transfer between these two redox components may represent a genuine segment of the Fe2+-oxidizing pathway. While examining electron transfer reactions between these two redox proteins, we noticed (a) that partially reduced RCy was almost completely oxidized upon addition of ferricytochromec 4 and (b) that cytochromec 4 was reduced by excess of Fe2+ in the presence of RCy, whereas no reduction of cytochromec 4 could be observed when RCy was absent (13Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Nitschke W. Cavazza C. Bruschi M. Biomine. 1997; 97: PB4.1-PB4.10Google Scholar). Considering the redox midpoint potentials of the free forms of RCy (+590 mV at pH 4.8) and of cytochrome c 4 (+385 mV, +480 mV), these findings strongly indicate significant changes in redox potentials of one or both of these electron transport proteins upon complex formation. Fig.1 shows the redox potential dependence at pH 4.8 of rusticyanin's optical band in the vicinity of 600 nm in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of cytochromec 4. An E m (redox midpoint potential) value of +490 mV was observed, i.e. a value that is by about 100 mV lower than that obtained in free rusticyanin at the same pH value (indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1). The E m values of both cytochrome c 4 hemes remained constant within experimental precision (not shown). In addition to the drop in electrochemical potential, alterations of optical and EPR parameters of the copper site in rusticyanin were observed in the complex. The peak wavelength of the optical band in the vicinity of 600 nm, typical for blue copper proteins in the oxidized state, was found to be shifted in the complex by 14 nm toward shorter wavelengths (Fig.2, continuous versus dashed trace). This spectral band arises from a charge transfer transition between the copper ion and the sulfur atom of the cysteine ligand (22Solomon E.I. Baldwin M.J. Lowery M.D. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 521-542Crossref Scopus (903) Google Scholar), and modifications of this band are therefore indicative of substantial rearrangements of the electron density distribution between the copper site and its ligands. Fig.3, trace b, shows the X-band EPR spectrum recorded on oxidized free RCy at a concentration of 20 μm. The obtained spectrum corresponded to those previously reported for oxidized RCy at low pH values (Ref. 23Cox J.C. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 3, trace c). Addition of a stoichiometric amount of oxidized cytochrome c 4 to the sample used for recording the spectrum shown in Fig. 3, trace b, resulted in dramatically altered EPR spectral properties (Fig. 3, trace a) involving an increase in g∥ as well as modifications in apparent hyperfine parameters on all g values. These EPR spectra thus provided evidence for redistributions of the unpaired electron density at the copper site upon complex formation corroborating the significantly altered electronic structure of the copper-ligand sphere in the complex.Figure 3EPR spectra of oxidized RCy prior to (trace b) and after (trace a) complex formation with cytochrome c 4 at pH 4.8 as well as those of free RCy at pH values of 4.3 (trace c), 8.5 (trace d), and 9.5 (trace e). Complete oxidation of the sample was achieved by addition of iridium chloride followed by removal of the oxidant via passage through a PD-10 column. The sample contained 100 μm rusticyanin in ammonium acetate, pH 4.8; MOPS (pH 7); glycyl-glycyl, pH 8.2; Tricine-NaOH, pH 9; or 20 μmcytochrome c 4 and 20 μmrusticyanin in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.8. For better comparison, EPR spectra of the complex and of free RCy at different pH values were normalized to comparable signal amplitudes. The inner part of the spectrum (in between vertical dotted lines) was divided by 4. Instrument settings: temperature, 20 K; microwave frequency, 9.43 GHz; microwave power, 6.7 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 0.5 millitesla.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The changes in the optical spectrum induced by complex formation was suggestively reminiscent of previously reported data on rusticyanin obtained at pH values above 7,i.e. a blueshift of the charge transfer band from 597 to 577 nm (11Nunzi F. Guerlesquin F. Shepard W. Guigliarelli B. Bruschi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Apart from the blueshift, the charge transfer band was seen to persist up to pH values of about 10, demonstrating that the overall distorted tetrahedral ligand geometry (involving one cysteine-, one methionine, and two histidine residues (24Botuyan M.V. Toy-Palmer A. Chang J. Blake R.C., II Beroza P. Case D.A. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 752-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Walter R.L. Ealick S.E. Friedman A.M. Blake R.C., II Proctor P. Shoham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 730-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), see Fig. 6) was maintained up to this pH value. Above pH 10, an essentially irreversible loss of the Cu-SCys charge transfer transition was observed indicating denaturing of the protein. The copper center in rusticyanin thus retains its ligand scheme up to high pH values, whereas the copper-ligand interactions undergo noticeable alterations in the pH range between 7 and 10 reflected by the blueshift of the charge transfer band. The similarity of the spectral changes observed at high pH and in the complex suggested a possible correlation of both phenomena. To substantiate such a correlation, we examined the pH dependence of rusticyanin's EPR spectral parameters and of its reduction potential in the alkaline region. EPR spectra recorded at several pH values between pH 4 and pH 11 (Fig. 3, traces c–e) indeed showed that new spectral forms with significantly altered g and hyperfine tensors appear above pH 7. It is of note that comparable spectral transitions at high pH values have already been reported previously (23Cox J.C. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); the much lower signal-to-noise ratio, however, precluded an interpretation of the EPR parameters in the alkalinic region. The spectra obtained in the region between pH 7 and pH 10 (Fig. 3,traces c–e) were heterogeneous, i.e. reflected the sequential deprotonations of more than one group. The general spectral features of the high pH paramagnetic species, however, involved a shift of g∥ toward higher values and the loss of the hyperfine structure on g⊥, i.e.intriguingly resembling those observed in the complex. At pH 9.5, the new paramagnetic species have become dominant, whereas the low pH spectrum has essentially vanished (as judged, for instance, from the disappearance of the trough at g = 1.96 in Fig. 3). Fig.4 shows a pH titration of signals characteristic for the low and the high pH spectra, respectively. As can be seen from this figure, the low pH spectrum converted into the high pH spectra in the pH range between 7 and 9. Above pH 9.5, a progressive loss of the signal was found most probably corresponding to the loss of the copper site as discussed above. The redox midpoint potential of rusticyanin has previously been reported to show only a weak pH dependence up to pH 6.2 (26Haladjian J. Nunzi F. Bianco P. Bruschi M. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1993; 352: 329-335Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Stimulated by the above described phenomena observed at high pH values, we extended the determination of rusticyanin's E m values up to pH 9. Fig.5 shows the results of equilibrium redox titrations of free RCy between pH 3 and pH 9. The weak pH dependence seen at low pH values ceased at about pH 7 and was replaced by a strongly pH-dependent curve with a slope of about 60 mV/pH above this pK value. The obtained dependence at high pH values is characteristic of the involvement of a dissociable proton on the oxidized form of the protein in the redox transition. At pH 9, theE m value of free RCy corresponds roughly to that observed at pH 4.8 in the complex with cytochromec 4 (see Fig. 5). Since the slope of theE m versus pH curve was still close to the theoretical value for a single redox-linked proton (−59 mV/pH) at pH 9, the pK of the dissociable proton on the reduced form of the protein must be significantly above this pH value. A strikingly similar pH dependence of redox properties is observed in the [2Fe-2S] protein from cytochrome bc complexes, the so-called Rieske proteins. The [2Fe-2S] cluster in this class of proteins is ligated by two cysteine and two histidine residues. The Rieske clusters are characterized by a pH-dependent redox midpoint potential above a pK value that varies in the range of pH 6 to pH 8 between species (27Schoepp B. Brugna M. Lebrun E. Nitschke W. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 335-360Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Brugna M. Nitschke W. Asso M. Guigliarelli B. Lemesle-Meunier D. Schmidt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16766-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The redox-linked proton is generally believed to correspond to the nitrogen proton of the imidazole moiety of the histidine ligands (27Schoepp B. Brugna M. Lebrun E. Nitschke W. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 335-360Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A similar situation appears to apply to RCy. The only residues that are liable to have pK values in the observed range, and the deprotonation of which will induce significant modifications of the electronic structure at the copper ion, are the two histidine ligands His-85 and His-143 (see Fig.6). The additional negative charges on the histidinates above the respective pK values would be expected to render the copper ion more difficult to reduce and thus to lower its redox midpoint potential. The sequential deprotonation of the two histidine ligands at high pH values also rationalizes the observed heterogeneity of EPR spectra recorded in the alkaline region. The spectra shown in Fig. 3, traces d and e, represent superpositions of spectra arising from RCy molecules with either one or both histidine ligands in the deprotonated state. The ensemble of the similarities between RCy at high pH and in the complex with cytochrome c 4demonstrates that docking of RCy to cytochromec 4 induced changes at the copper site related to the redox-linked deprotonation at high pH values. Since the respective effects in the complex were observed at pH 4.8 and below, complex formation must have decreased the pK value of the redox-linked proton by about 4 pH units (see above). From an inspection of the three-dimensional structure of RCy (24Botuyan M.V. Toy-Palmer A. Chang J. Blake R.C., II Beroza P. Case D.A. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 752-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 6), the Nε proton on the exposed copper-ligand histidine 143 appears predestined to form hydrogen bridges with suitable residues on its partner in complex formation. Such an interaction would weaken the H–Nε (His-143) bond (i.e. decrease the pK value of the protonation site) and thereby induce electronic changes in the imidazole ring resembling deprotonation (Fig. 6). Attempts to co-crystallize RCy and cytochrome c 4 in order to obtain a detailed picture of the interaction surface in the complex are presently under way in our laboratory. The observed complex-induced alterations of RCy's redox properties make sense with regard to the thermodynamic constraints of electron transfer in Thiobacilli. These organisms use the relatively weak reducing power of the iron(II) (E m,2 ≈ 700 mV, Ref. 29Ingledew W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 89-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), abundant in the growth medium, to drive electron transport toward molecular oxygen (E m,2 ≈ 1150 mV, Ref. 29Ingledew W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 89-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) via a membrane-bound cytochrome oxidase (Fig.7). From comparisons to other organisms (30Ng T.C.N. Laheri A.N. Maier R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Pettigrew G.W. Brown K.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and from the operon structure of the cytochromec 4/oxidase genes (32Appia-Ayme C. Bengrine A. Cavazza C. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Bruschi M. Chippaux M. Bonnefoy V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar), it appears likely that cytochrome c 4 serves as the immediate donor to cytochrome oxidase in Thiobacilli. Since the involvement of RCy in the early steps of Fe(II) oxidation has been shown, electron transport would be expected to proceed from the copper protein toward the cytochrome. Such an electron transport, however, would be strongly hampered by the unfavorable redox equilibrium if there were not the above shown complex-induced drop in reduction potential of RCy (see Fig. 7). The extent of the observed drop inE m value, on the other side, is thermodynamically equivalent to a more than 100-fold preferential binding of the oxidized form of RCy to cytochromec 4, i.e. seemingly in contradiction to electron transfer from the copper protein to the cytochrome. RCy, however, is by far the most abundant soluble redox protein in Thiobacilli accounting for up to 5% of the total soluble protein. This large pool of RCy molecules will be held at a very high degree of reduction by the abundant Fe(II) in the medium, assuring saturation of the binding sites on cytochrome c 4 by reduced RCy and thus allowing efficient electron transfer from RCy to cytochrome c 4. As shown in Fig. 6, the likely key residue mediating the interaction-induced changes in electrochemical potential is located in a strikingly strategic position on the surface of the protein. This histidine residue in its privileged position is conserved in the large majority of blue copper proteins (33Nunzi F. Woudstra M. Campèse D. Bonicel J. Morin D. Bruschi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Modifications of redox properties reminiscent of those seen for RCy have furthermore been observed for the electron transfer complexes between amicyanin and methylamine dehydrogenase (7Gray K.A. Davidson V.L. Knaff D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13987-13990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and between plastocyanin and photosystem I (8Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The crucial role of the surface-exposed histidine in complex-induced alterations of redox midpoint potential of the copper site has recently been demonstrated for the electron transfer complex between amicyanin and methylamine dehydrogenase (10Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Chen L. Durley R.C. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Science. 1994; 264: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Free amicyanin shows a pH-dependent redox potential below pH 7.5 and constantE m values above this pK value, indicating a redox-linked protonation on the reduced form of the protein. The presence of such a pK value on the reduced protein is common to the large majority of blue copper proteins (35Lommen A. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2768-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Already more than a decade ago, the protonation of the δ-nitrogen on the exposed histidine ligand has been identified as the molecular basis for the respective redox phenomenon in plastocyanin (36Guss J.M. Harrowell P.R. Murata M. Norris V.A. Freeman H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 361-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This protonation entails breakage of this histidine-copper ligation and subsequent rotation of the histidine side chain (36Guss J.M. Harrowell P.R. Murata M. Norris V.A. Freeman H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 361-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The recent study of the amicyanin-methylamine dehydrogenase complex has shown that a corresponding rotation of the exposed histidine in amicyanin is hampered by the presence of methylamine dehydrogenase at the interaction surface of the complex (10Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The resulting stabilization of the copper-histidine bond is equivalent to a decreased pK value of the protonation site on Nδ and therefore translates into a decrease of amicyanin's redox midpoint potential at pH values below the pK of the free form (10Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rusticyanin, by contrast, is an acid-stable protein and the pK value of the Nδ protonation site therefore needs to be shifted to pH values significantly below pH 2 in order to assure integrity of the copper site at the physiological pH values of the organism (24Botuyan M.V. Toy-Palmer A. Chang J. Blake R.C., II Beroza P. Case D.A. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 752-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Walter R.L. Ealick S.E. Friedman A.M. Blake R.C., II Proctor P. Shoham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 730-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consequently, the above described pK value on the reduced form of the protein was not observed in RCy (26Haladjian J. Nunzi F. Bianco P. Bruschi M. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1993; 352: 329-335Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The drastically decreased pK value on Nδ (His-143) most probably results from the presence of the two aromatic amino acid residues Phe-83 and Phe-51 in the immediate vicinity of the surface-exposed histidine 143 (see Fig.6), rendering the environment of this residue significantly more hydrophobic in RCy than in other blue copper proteins. However, the reduced solvent accessibility of the surface-exposed histidine obviously also affects the pK-value of the proton on Nε. This pK is found slightly above pH 7 in RCy (Fig. 5), whereas it is beyond the experimentally accessible range of pH values in other blue copper proteins. In RCy, it is, therefore, a pK shift of the Nε proton that lends itself for inducing changes in redox midpoint potential upon complex formation rather than a respective shift of NδH, as described for the amicyanin-methylamine dehydrogenase complex (10Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It therefore appears likely to us that the surface-exposed histidine ligand to the copper ion is employed as a redox tuning device in blue copper proteins in general. We thank G.

The interaction of heparin and other glycosaminoglycans with papain may be representative of many mammalian cysteine proteinase-glycosaminoglycan interactions that can regulate the function of this class of proteinases in vivo.

The incubation of papain with heparin promoted a powerful increase in the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. In order to probe the glycosaminoglycan structure requirements for the papain interaction, the effects of two other glycosaminoglycans were tested. Like heparin, heparan sulfate, to a lesser degree, was able to decrease the papain substrate affinity, and it simultaneously induced α-helix structure in papain. On the other hand, dermatan sulfate was not able to decrease the substrate affinity and did not induce α-helix structure in papain.

Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These classes of compounds are heteropolysaccharides composed of several distinct disaccharides containing uronic acid and glucosamine with N- and 6-O-sulfates and N-acetyl substitutions. The interaction of heparan sulfate and heparin with proteins regulates a broad spectrum of biological processes. These proteins fall into quite diverse groups, such as proteins involved in hemostasis, proteins of extracellular matrix, growth factors, proteins of lipid metabolism, and others (5Conrad H.E. Heparin-Binding Proteins. Academic Press Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). It has been shown that heparin can modify the activities of some serine proteinases and its natural inhibitors in vitro (6Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T.

The purified syndecan-1 ectodomain protects cathepsin G from inhibition by α1-antichymotrypsin and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2, and it protects elastase from inhibition by α1-proteinase inhibitor. Moreover, the degradation of endogenous heparan sulfate from wound fluids reduces proteolytic activities in the fluid. These results strongly suggest that syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 maintain the proteolytic balance in acute wound fluid (10Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Syndecans, via their heparan sulfate chain, bind many of the factors that orchestrate the inflammatory response to tissue injury, as well as a variety of extracellular matrix components (9Subramanian S.

The papain-like cysteine proteinases are the most abundant among the cysteine proteinases. This family consists of papain and related plant proteinases, such as chymopapain, caricain, bromelain, actinidin, ficin, and aleurain, and the lysosomal cathepsins B, H, L, S, C, and K (11Turk B. Turk V. Turk D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar). The lysosomal cysteine proteinases cathepsins B and L have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, especially in diseases involving tissue remodeling states, such as tumor metastasis (12Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A.

Binding of cysteine proteinases with basement membranes is of significant interest for understanding the biological role of cysteine proteinases in tumor invasion and other types of tissue remodeling (21Guinec N. Dalet-Fumeron V. Pagano M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 24: 305-308Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy image analysis indicated that cathepsin B was associated with the external basal cell surface in the murine B16 amelanotic melanoma cells (22Moin K. Cao L. Day N.A. Kobliski J.E. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been shown that membrane-bound forms of cathepsin B display modified properties, e.g.resistance to inactivation at alkaline pH (23Sloane B.F. Rozhin J. Lah T.T. Day N.A. Buck M. Ryan R.E. Crissman J.D. Honn K.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 233: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Previous results in the literature have shown that papain and cathepsin B are able to bind to laminin of basement membrane (24Dalet-Fumeron V. Boudjennah L. Pagano M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the proposed role of cysteine proteinases in degradation of extracellular matrix components. Therefore, the interaction of cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily with glycosaminoglycans may be of significant interest for the understanding about the biological role of cysteine proteinases in tissue remodeling states. The bind of papain with glycosaminoglycans may be representative of many mammalian cysteine proteinase-glycosaminoglycan interactions, which can regulate its biological functions. In this study, we have investigated the influence of glycosaminoglycans, mainly heparin and heparan sulfate, upon papain activity. A combination of circular dichroism analysis, heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrate assays was used to characterize the interaction of papain with glycosaminoglycan. The papain was purchased from Calbiochem Co.; the concentration of the active enzyme was determined by titration using the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-641 (25Ménard R. Khouri H.E. Plouffe C. Dupras R. Ripoll D. Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Laliberté F. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Papain was stored at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 10 μm methyl methane-thiosulfonate. The intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide, Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp, an analogue of Abz-AFRSAAQ-EDDnp (30Nagler D.K. Storer A.C. Portaro F.C.V. Carmona E. Juliano L. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12608-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), was synthesized using solid phase chemistry as described previously (26Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M. Juliano L. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar); the fluorogenic amidomethylcoumaryl substrate Cbz-FR-MCA and the papain irreversible inhibitor E-64 were purchased from Sigma. Heparin and heparan sulfate from bovine lung were a generous gift from Dr. P. Bianchini (Opocrin Research Laboratories, Modena, Italy); dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin-Sepharose resin was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The influence of glycosaminoglycans upon papain endopeptidase activity were determined spectrofluorometrically using the fluorogenic substrates Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp and Cbz-FR-MCA. Fluorescence intensity was monitored on a thermostatic Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. The wavelengths were set at 380 nm for excitation and 440 nm for emission in the assays with the Cbz-FR-MCA substrate and 320 and 420 nm with Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp. The enzyme was activated by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.4) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The measurements were done in the same buffer of papain activation, and the kinetic parameters were determined by measuring the initial rate of hydrolysis at various substrate concentrations in presence or absence of different glycosaminoglycan concentrations. The data obtained were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program GraFit 3.01 (Erithacus Software Ltd.). The kinetic model depicted in Equation 1 can describe the effect of heparin on the hydrolysis of Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp by papain,v=Vmax·[S]Ks1+[Hep]KH1+β·[Hep]α·KH+[S]1+[Hep]α·KH1+β·[Hep]α·KHEquation 1 where S is Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp, Hep is heparin,K S is the substrate dissociation constant,K H is the apparent heparin dissociation constant, α is the parameter of K S perturbation, and β is the parameter of V max(k cat) perturbation. In the assays with the substrate Cbz-FR-MCA, the data obtained were also analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraFit 3.01. All progress curves obtained were exponential and could be best fitted according to the first-order relationship shown in Equation 2,P=P∞(1−e−Kobs′·t)Equation 2 where P and P ∞ are the product concentration at a given time and at infinite time, respectively, and K′obs is the observedk cat/K S rate Cbz-FR-MCA hydrolysis constant (27Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The influence of heparin upon the observedk cat/K S rate constant can be described by Equation 3,Kobs′=Kobs(KH′+β·[Hep])KH′+[Hep]Equation 3 where K′obs andK obs are the observed rates in the presence and absence of heparin, respectively; K′H is the apparent heparin-papain dissociation constant at alkaline pH; Hep is heparin; and β is the parameter of limit forK obs in presence of heparin. For the determination of pH activity profiles, the kinetics of Cbz-FR-MCA hydrolysis was performed in absence or in presence of different heparin concentrations at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm citrate, or 50 mm borate containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The substrate concentration was kept well below the K m value. The progress of the reaction was monitored continuously by the fluorescence of the released product. The pH activity profiles were analyzed according to the model of by nonlinear regression as described previously (25Ménard R. Khouri H.E. Plouffe C. Dupras R. Ripoll D. Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Laliberté F. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The kinetics of E-64 induced inactivation of papain were done under pseudo-first-order conditions (i.e. with an excess of inhibitor) at various heparin concentration in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.4) containing 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction between papain and E-64 was monitored continuously in the presence of Cbz-FR-MCA. Progress of the reaction was monitored continuously by the fluorescence of the released product. All progress curves obtained were exponential decay and could be best fitted to the first-order relationship shown above (Equation 2). Enzyme and substrate were incubated under conditions similar to those described for the kinetic assays. The determination of cleaved bond for the peptide Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp was proceeded on a reversed phase C-18 column using the Shimadzu SCL-8A HPLC system, equipped with a UV detector (220 nm) and a fluorescence detector with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 320 and 420 nm, respectively. The solvent system used was a 15 min gradient from 10 to 80% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.7 ml/min. The products were collected, freeze-dried, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Circular dichroism measurements in far ultraviolet regions (260 to 200 nm) of papain-glycosaminoglycan interactions were conducted in a JASCO J-700 spectropolarimeter scanning at rate of 10 nm/min at 25 °C. Cells of 0.05 cm for the far UV were used. The experiments were done in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.4) containing 200 mmNaCl, 0.07 mg/ml papain at various glycosaminoglycan concentrations. The observed ellipticity was normalized to units of degrees cm2/dmol. All dichroic spectra were smoothed and corrected by background subtraction for the spectrum obtained with buffer alone or buffer containing glycosaminoglycan. The spectra were analyzed for percent secondary structural elements by program based on comparison to the spectra obtained for the structures of known protein (28Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 209: 32Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The influence of heparin in the papain helicity can be described by Equation 4,ΔHelix=Helixcontrol[Hep](β−1)KH+[Hep]Equation 4 where ΔHelix is the variation of papain helicity induced by heparin, K H is the apparent heparin-papain dissociation constant, Hep is heparin, and β is the parameter of limit for papain helicity induced by heparin. Papain (2.0 μg) dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) was chromatographed on a heparin-Sepharose column (3 ml) and equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A linear NaCl gradient (0–2 m) was used to elute the bound material. The eluted fractions were monitored by papain enzymatic activity upon substrate Cbz-FR-MCA. The affinity of papain for heparin was evaluated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Papain was eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column at 1.0 m NaCl. This binding could be inhibited specifically by the previous addition of 100 μm of free heparin to papain solution (Fig.1). These data show that papain binding to heparin is mediated mainly by electrostatic interactions. These results led us to investigate the possible effect of heparin as well as other sulfated glycosaminoglycans, namely heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate, upon papain-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrates Cbz-FR-MCA and Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp. The effect of sulfated glycosaminoglycans on the papain endopeptidase activity was studied by monitoring the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrates. As observed, among the several sulfated polysaccharides studied only heparin and heparan sulfate exhibited patterns of interaction with papain, which varied according to the compound and substrate analyzed. The other sulfated glycosaminoglycans had no effect under the same experimental condition. Fig. 2 A shows that the presence of heparin in the papain kinetic assays results in a decrease in k cat values for the hydrolysis of Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp. On the other hand, Fig. 2 B shows that heparin also markedly increases the affinity of the papain for the substrate Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp. The effect of heparin upon papain endopeptidase activity can be described by a hyperbolic mixed type inhibition depicted in Equation 1. The efficiency of the system for the hydrolysis of the substrate can be altered by changing either theK S (parameter α) or V max(parameter β). The data were fitted to Equation 1 by using nonlinear regression, and the values for the constants were determined. The results show that heparin binds free papain (E) with a dissociation constant of K H = 27 ± 3 μm, and the complex enzyme-substrate (ES) with a dissociation constant of αK H = 3.5 ± 0.4 μm. Also, heparin induced a 9-fold increase in the affinity of papain for the substrate Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp; the K S value was decreased from 0.66 ± 0.04 to 0.073 ± 0.006 μm in presence of heparin (α = 0.11 ± 0.01) (Fig. 1 B), whereas the k cat value in the presence of heparin was decreased 4-fold (β = 0.25 ± 0.01). However, the catalytic efficiency for this substrate in the presence of heparin was increased (β/α = 2.3 ± 0.2). Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp is a very good substrate for papain, withk cat/K S = 3.0 107m−1·s−1; this substrate was chosen in order to position Phe and Arg residues inP 2 and P 1 and Ser residue in P′1. In this manner, the substrate covers S2, S1, and S′1, which are the main substrate binding sites in papain-like cysteine proteinases (29Turk D. Guncar G. Podobnik M. Turk B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Nagler D.K. Storer A.C. Portaro F.C.V. Carmona E. Juliano L. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12608-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 31Barret A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis showed that Arg-Ser is the only peptide bond cleaved by papain in this sequence. The presence of heparin did not change the pattern of cleavage of this peptide by papain. Curiously, heparin showed a different kinetic pattern upon papain when the preparation was assayed with the substrate Cbz-FR-MCA. Under these conditions, heparin showed a partial noncompetitive inhibition behavior. Fig. 3 shows the decrease in the observed first-order Cbz-FR-MCA hydrolysis rate by the presence of heparin. The observed k cat/K Srates of papain upon Cbz-FR-MCA in presence or absence of heparin were determined by using the kinetic model depicted in Equation 2. The kinetic model depicted in the Equation 3 can describe the effect of heparin on the observedk cat/K S. The data were fitted to Equation 3 by using nonlinear regression, and the values of the constants were obtained. The results show that heparin binds papain with a K′H of 4.0 ± 0.2 μm, and this interaction prevents the Cbz-FR-MCA hydrolysis. Heparin promoted a decrease of 5.5-fold in observed Cbz-FR-MCA hydrolysis second-order rate; in the absence of heparin, the second-order substrate hydrolysis rate was (4.53 ± 0.21) × 105m−1·s−1, and in the presence of heparin, the observed rate was (0.82 ± 0.08) × 105m−1·s−1(β = 0.19 ± 0.01). Most of this effect is related to the decrease in k cat; heparin-papain interaction did not affect Z-FR-MCA dissociation constant. The interaction of heparin with papain was also studied by verifying the heparin effect on E-64 papain inhibition activity. E-64 has been shown to bind in the S subsites of the papain and nucleophilic attack by Cys25 thiolate of enzyme occurs at the C3 atom of the epoxide. Also, the carboxyl-terminal group of E-64 forms an electrostatic interaction with the protonated His159imidazole ring (32Yamamoto D. Matsumoto K. Ohishi H. Ishida T. Inoue M. Kitamura K. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14771-14777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the decrease in the rate of E-64 inhibition by heparin. It was observed that the presence of 100 μm heparin decreases 5-fold the inhibitory activity of E-64 upon papain. TheK inac observed for E-64 was 0.36 ± 0.03 s−1, and in the presence of 100 μm heparin, the K inac was decreased to 0.073 ± 0.007 s−1, whereas the dissociation constant of E-64 (K i = 2.3 ± 0.2 μm) was not changed by the presence of heparin. Basically the same effect of heparin was obtained when 100 μm heparan sulfate was tested against the inhibitory activity of E-64. The effect of heparin upon papain conformation were examined by CD spectroscopy. Fig. 5 A shows that the addition of heparin to a solution containing 3 μm papain in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, causes a significant change in the spectral envelope. In the presence of heparin, the ellipticity value at [θ]222 nmis decreased, showing that heparin increases the helicity of papain. Table I exhibits the secondary structure content of papain in the presence of different heparin concentrations. The fractions of the different papain structural types, α, β, and remainder (R), were computed from the CD spectra (200–260) shown in Fig. 5 A as described previously (28Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 209: 32Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The data show a dramatic increase in the papain α-helix content induced by heparin, whereas β-structure and remainder content decreased. These changes are likely to be a reflex of the peptideheparin interaction. TableI also shows that the addition of 128 μm heparan sulfate increases papain α-helix content, very similar to the result obtained increasing the heparin concentration.Table ISecondary structure content of papain in the presence of different heparin concentrationsHeparinα-Helixβ-SheetRemainingμm%027.917.953.6 1633.017.050 3237.015.947.1 6439.514.745.8 9641.414.244.412842.214.043.820043.013.743.3128 μmheparan sulfate42.314.243.5 Open table in a new tab As expected, addition of 1 m NaCl to papain-heparin solution causes a spectral change consistent with the dissociation of the heparin-papain complex (Fig. 5 B). The spectrum obtained under high ionic strength conditions is essentially identical to the spectrum obtained for the papain alone in the presence of 1m NaCl. Fig. 6 shows that the increase on papain α-helices content induced by heparin is saturable, as predicted by Equation 4. The data show that the papain α-helices content was increased up to 67% in the presence of heparin, i.e.β = 1.67 ± 0.05. The value of the dissociation constant,K H = 33 ± 3 μm, measured by fitting the papain variation of helix content (ΔHelix) in function of heparin concentration is very similar to that obtained by analysis of substrate hydrolysis, K H = 27 ± 3 μm. In order to probe the polysaccharide sequence requirements for papain interaction, the effects of other polysulfated polysaccharides were tested. Table II shows that, besides heparin, only heparan sulfate was able to decrease the substrateK S value, and it simultaneously induced α-helix content in papain. On the other hand, dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, at same heparin molar concentration, were not able to decrease the K S value and did not induce α-helix structure in papain.Table IIα-Helix content and KS values of papain in the presence of different glycosaminoglycansGAGKSα-Helixμm%Control0.7427.9Heparin (32 μm)0.1237.0Heparan sulfate (32 μm)0.1635.4Dermatan sulfate (32 μm)0.7228.0Chondroitin sulfate (32 μm)0.7327.5 Open table in a new tab In general, the papain activity is related to the presence of a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair between the active site Cys25and His159. The catalytic residue Cys25 is located in the central α-helix at papain L-domain, and His159 is located at the R-domain. The active site (Cys25 and His159) is situated at interdomain interface forming a V-shaped cleft situated on the top of the papain (33Polgar L. Mechanism of Protease Action. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar, 34Kamphuis I.G. Kalk K.H. Swarte M.B.A. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 233-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding and electrostatic and interdomain hydrophobic interactions stabilize the papain active site. The deprotonation of His159, catalyzed by OH−ions, is considered a crucial event for alkaline pH-induced inactivation of cysteine proteinases. This process is thought to be reversible for papain and irreversible for cathepsin B and L (35Dufour E. Dive V. Toma F. Biochim. Biophys.

It is very interesting to note that the pH activity profile for the hydrolysis of Cbz-FR-MCA by papain in the presence of heparin is shifted to the right, the value of the pK 1obs was shifted from 4.54 to 5.03, and the pK 2obs was increased from 8.45 to 8.93. These results suggest that the presence of heparin is decreasing the rate of papain His159 imidazolium deprotonation, increasing the activity of the papain by preserving its thiolate-imidazolium ion pair at alkaline pH.Table IIIKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of Cbz-FR-MCA by papain in the presence of heparinkcatKSpHoptpK1obspK2obss−1μmControlaRef. 40.41.6 ± 6.889 ± 66.54.54 ± 0.298.45 ± 0.05Papain + 100 μmheparin8.2 ± 0.693 ± 57.05.03 ± 0.048.93 ± 0.05a Ref. 40Vernet T.

Open table in a new tab Table IV shows that a drastic decrease in the papain α-helix content was observed when the enzyme was exposed at pH 7.4, whereas the β-sheet content increased. At pH 6.4, the α-helix and β-sheet contents were 28 and 18%, respectively, and at pH 7.4, the α-helix and β-sheet contents were 18.5 and 27.4%, respectively. However, when papain was preincubated with heparin, the amount of α-helix structure disruption, induced by alkaline pH, was decreased. These data corroborate the results shown in Table III, suggesting that the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair, at alkalyne pH, is preserved by the papain-heparin interaction, stabilizing the papain α-helix structures.Table IVFar UV (200–260 nm) CD spectra of papain at different pH levelsConditionsα-Helixβ-SheetRemainingTotal%pH 6.427.917.953.699.4pH 7.418.527.454.1100.0pH 7.4 + 100 μmheparin24.822.253.5100.5R-X analysis (34)28.014.058.0100.0The CD analysis of papain proceeded at pH 6.4 and 7.4 and at pH 7.4 in the presence of 100 μm heparin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Sreerama and Woody analysis (28Sreerama N.

Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 209: 32Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar) of the papain spectra is given below. Several reports in the literature show that papain can be purified using cation-exchange chromatography (20Barret A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 25Ménard R. Khouri H.E. Plouffe C. Dupras R. Ripoll D. Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Laliberté F. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C.

Acta. 1992; 1118: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); these results suggest that papain can bind anionic polysaccharides, such as heparin and heparan sulfate. The affinity of papain for heparin was evaluated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. We observed that papain possessed high affinity binding to heparin, being eluted at 1.0 mNaCl from a heparin-Sepharose column. This interaction is specific, because this binding was disrupted by the previous addition of 100 μm of free heparin to papain solution (Fig. 1). These data show that papain binding to heparin is mediated mainly by electrostatic interactions. The binding of heparin to the papain perturbs its catalytic activity upon fluorogenic substrates. It was observed that heparin inhibits papain endopeptidase activity upon the substrate Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp by a hyperbolic mixed type inhibition fashion (Fig. 2). The presence of heparin results in a decrease in k cat values (β = 0.25 ± 0.01) but also markedly increases the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (α = 0.11 ± 0.01),i.e. α < 1, β < 1, and β > α. Likewise, at high substrate concentration, the affinity of papain for heparin is increased. It was observed that heparin binds free papain (E) with a dissociation constant of K H = 27 ± 3 μm, and heparin binds the complex enzyme substrate (ES) with a dissociation constant of αK H = 3.5 ± 0.4 μm. On the other hand, heparin only perturbed thek cat value for the substrate Cbz-FR-MCA that was decreased 5-fold, β = 0.20 ± 0.01, whereas theK S value for this substrate was not changed in the presence of heparin (Fig. 3). Also, heparin only prevents papain E-64 inhibition by decreasing the rate of inactivation (Fig. 4). TheK inac (inactivation constant) observed for E-64 was 0,36 ± 0.03 s−1, and in presence of 100 μm of heparin, the K inac was decreased to 0.073 ± 0.007 s−1, whereas the dissociation constant of E-64 (K i = 2.3 ± 0.2 μm) was not changed by the presence of heparin. It is well known that E-64 interacts with papain mainly in theS 1 and S 2 subsite (32Yamamoto D. Matsumoto K. Ohishi H. Ishida T. Inoue M. Kitamura K. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14771-14777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the substrate Cbz-FR-MCA covers the papain subsites at theS 1 and S 2 positions, whereas the substrate Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp covers from theS 3 to the S′4 position. Taken together, these results suggest that heparin is modulating the dissociation constant for the substrate Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp by perturbing the papain in S′n positions. The decrease promoted by heparin in k cat values of the papain for the substrates Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp and Cbz-FR-MCA is similar to the effect promoted by heparin in the papain E-64 inactivation rate. These results suggest that heparin binding is perturbing the papain active site in a similar manner. Binding to heparin significantly increases the α-helix content of the papain, and the binding event can be monitored by CD analysis. This binding is marked by significant changes in the shape and position of the CD spectral envelope (Fig. 5 A). As expected, according to the data obtained from the heparin-Sepharose experiments, the interaction between papain and heparin was abolished by the addition of 1 m NaCl (Fig. 5 B). The increase of the papain α-helix content is a reflex of the papain-heparin interaction, because the dissociation constant, K H = 33 ± 3 μm, measured by fitting the papain α-helix content variation in the function of heparin concentration (Fig. 6), is very similar to that obtained by analysis of substrate hydrolysis,K H = 27 ± 3 μm. These results strongly suggest that the conformational change induced by heparin leads to an increase in the affinity of the papain for the substrate Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp. Table I shows that heparin increases the helical content of the papain by increasing the number of residues in the helical conformation; it seems to be related to the decrease of the β-sheet and remaining structures content. The data obtained also show that heparan sulfate is able to cause a spectral change in papain very similar to those obtained by increasing the heparin concentration. Table II shows that the interaction between heparin or heparan sulfate and papain is quite specific, because other sulfated glycosaminoglycans, namely dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, were not able to increase the papain affinity for the substrate or induce α-helix structures in the papain. The alkaline pH-induced inactivation, as well as the unfolding of human cathepsin B (36Turk B. Dolenc I. Zerovnic E. Turk D. Gubensek F. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14800-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and cathepsin L (35Dufour E. Dive V. Toma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 995: 58-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Turk B. Dolenc I. Turk V. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was shown to be a first-order process, indicating that this inactivation of cysteine proteinases correlates with protein stability. The deprotonation of His159, catalyzed by OH− ions, is considered a crucial event for alkaline pH-induced inactivation of cysteine proteinases. The break of the thiolate-imidazoliun ion pair influences ionization and solvent exposure of some charged residues located at the interdomain interface, resulting in conformational changes that promote destabilization of the central α-helix (35Dufour E. Dive V. Toma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 995: 58-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Turk B. Dolenc I. Zerovnic E. Turk D. Gubensek F. Turk V.

Table III shows that heparin shifts the papain pH activity profile to the right, allowing papain to be active at alkaline pH. In addition, according to the data presented in Table IV, the presence of heparin reduces the loss of papain α-helix content induced by alkaline pH. Heparin increases the stability of papain at alkaline pH, which is a reflex of the higher α-helix amount observed for the papain-heparin complex compared with that for the papain alone. Although a heparin-binding domain in papain has not yet been demonstrated, the papain sequence 188–191 (RIKR) is a putative heparin-binding site, as previously suggested (39Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Artheriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cardin and Weintraub (39Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Artheriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the consensus heparin-binding sequences might occur in either helices or β-strand structures. The putative heparin-binding site in the 188–191 stretch of the papain displays β-strand structure (34Kamphuis I.G. Kalk K.H. Swarte M.B.A. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 233-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This cationic sequence is located adjacent to the residues Asn175 and Trp177. In papain, it is known that Asn175 (40Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Chatellier J. Plouffe C. Lee T.S. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Ménard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16645-16652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and Trp177 (41Baker E.N. Drenth J. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar) contribute to the electrostatic field, and the residues influence the formation of the catalytically active thiolate-imidazolium ion pair, whereas residue Trp177 is also involved in enzyme-substrate interactions (41Baker E.N. Drenth J. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Binding of heparin or heparan sulfate to papain may change the relative orientation of the surface structures, forcing a conformational change in the protein. This conformational change could be communicated to the rest of the protein via tertiary structure or disulfide bonds (42Lellouch A., C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2279-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both Arg and Lys residues are found in the established heparin-binding domains of various proteins. Also, the heparin binding may stabilize the papain helices by eliminating detrimental electrostatic interactions, and the negatively charged sulfate and carboxylate groups of heparin may neutralize positive charges that might otherwise contribute to helix destabilization (43Ferran D.S. Sobel M. Harris R.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5010-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present results show that the conformational change induced by heparin binding in papain is specific; this change leads to an increase in the affinity of the papain to the substrate Abz-AFRSSAQ-EDDnp and stabilizes the central α-helix in the active site, preserving its functional structure even at alkaline pH. Recently, we have made similar observations by studying human cathepsin B in the presence of heparin and heparan sulfate, suggesting that the bind of papain with glycosaminoglycans is representative of other mammalian cysteine proteinase-glycosaminoglycan interactions. Heparin and heparan sulfate was also able to binding human cathepsin B, and this interaction protects the human cathepsin B against alkaline pH-induced inactivation. 2P. C. Almeida, I. L. Nantes, C.

Our results show that heparan sulfate may be an important binding site of cysteine proteinases at basement membranes; this binding stabilizes these enzymes at pH 7.4. Moreover, the binding of cysteine proteinases with basement membranes is of significant interest for understanding the biological role of cysteine proteinases in tumor invasion and other types of tissue remodeling states.

However, the precise role of these NH2-terminal sequences and whether additional NH2-terminal sequences are also involved in negative regulation have not been determined. Therefore, we generated additional NH2-terminal deletion mutants of proto-Vav that lack the NH2-terminal 127, 168, or 186 amino acids, and assessed their abilities to cause focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells and to activate different signaling pathways. Since Vav mutants lacking 168 or 186 NH2-terminal residues showed a several 100-fold greater focus forming activity than that seen with deletion of 65 residues, residues spanning 66 to 187 also contribute significantly to negative regulation of Vav transforming activity. The increase in Vav transforming activity correlated with the activation of the c-Jun, Elk-1, and NF-κB transcription factors, as well as increased transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter. Tyrosine 174 is a key site of phosphorylation by Lck in vitro and Lck-mediated phosphorylation has been shown to be essential for proto-Vav GEF function in vitro. However, we found that an NH2-terminal Vav deletion mutant lacking this tyrosine residue (ΔN-186 Vav) retained the ability to be phosphorylated by Lckin vivo and Lck still caused enhancement of ΔN-186 Vav signaling and transforming activity. Thus, Lck can stimulate Vav via a mechanism that does not involve Tyr174 or removal of NH2-terminal regulatory activity. Finally, we found that NH2-terminal deletion enhanced the degree of Vav association with the membrane-containing particulate fraction and that an isolated NH2-terminal fragment (residues 1–186) could impair ΔN-186 Vav signaling. Taken together, these observations suggest that the NH2 terminus may serve as a negative regulator of Vav by intramolecular interaction with COOH-terminal sequences to modulate efficient membrane association.

Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and like a majority of Dbl family proteins was identified initially as transforming protein. All Dbl family proteins possess a tandem Dbl homology (DH)1 domain followed by an invariant COOH-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for specific members of the Rho family of small GTPases. For example, Vav is an activator of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 (3Han J.

Rho family proteins are members of the Ras superfamily of GDP/GTP-regulated proteins that function as binary switches (5Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Dbl family proteins promote GDP/GTP exchange to cause formation of the active GTP-bound protein, whereas Rho GTPase activating proteins stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity to convert these small GTPases to their inactive GDP-bound form. Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors constitute a third class of regulators of GDP/GTP cycling. Rho family proteins are regulators of a wide range of cellular activities that include the control of actin cytoskeletal organization (reviewed in Refs. 6Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar and 7Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Whereas Rac1 promotes membrane ruffling, Cdc42 causes the formation of actin microspikes and the development of filopodia, and RhoA stimulates the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Rho family proteins are also regulators of gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 6Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C.

Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA also stimulate the activities of the serum response factor (SRF) (12Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Rho family proteins are also regulators of cell growth (reviewed in Refs. 6Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar and 7Zohn I.M.

Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 function is required for cell cycle progression and they are stimulators of transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter (10Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A.

Furthermore, the aberrant up-regulation of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 can promote tumorigenic transformation, invasion, and metastasis. Specific Rho family proteins (RhoA, RhoB, RhoG, Rac1, Cdc42, and TC10) are also required for the transforming activity of oncogenic Ras protein and other oncoproteins. The transforming activities of Dbl family proteins are mediated presumably by constitutive activation of their specific Rho family substrates. The invariant association of a PH domain with all DH domains suggests an interdependent relationship. Present evidence supports a dual role for the PH domain in the regulation of DH domain function (1Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). First, mutation of the PH domain abolishes the transforming activity of many Dbl family proteins and addition of a plasma membrane targeting sequence can restore this loss of PH function (16Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Michiels F. Stam J.C.

Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the PH domain may promote the association of Dbl family proteins with membranes, where their small GTPase substrates reside. Second, there is evidence that the PH domain, via an intramolecular interaction, can negatively or positively regulate DH domain function (3Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D.

For example, mutation of the Vav PH domain results in constitutive activation of Vav GEF function, suggesting that the PH domain negatively regulates Vav GEF function (3Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the DH and PH domains, Vav also contains a diverse array of other protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction domains that can potentially serve as negative or positive regulators of Vav function (reviewed in Ref. 22Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of Vav contains a leucine-rich, calponin homology domain (CH) (amino acids 3–115) (reviewed in Ref. 22Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev.

Tyr174 has been shown to be a site of phosphorylation by the Src and Syk protein tyrosine kinases (23Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D.

Since NH2-terminal truncation of the first 65 residues of Vav (to form onco-Vav) unmasks Vav transforming activity, these sequences are believed to serve as negative regulators of Vav function. Finally, COOH-terminal sequences following the tandem DH/PH domains include a cysteine-rich domain, and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (reviewed in Ref. 22Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies showed that intact cysteine-rich domain, SH2, and SH3 domains are required for Vav transforming activity (25Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar, 26Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar, 27Groysman M. Nagano M. Shaanan B.

Recent studies have proposed a mechanism of Vav activation that involves phosphoinositide binding to the PH domain and phosphorylation of the NH2 terminus. Like other PH domains (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 29Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway K.L.

Whereas PIP2 association with proto-Vav does not promote its GEF function, PIP3-mediated dissociation of PIP2 binding enhances its GEF functionin vitro. PIP3 binding also further promotes Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of proto-Vav, which in turn leads to further enhancement of GEF function. Lck-mediated phosphorylation of proto-Vav and onco-Vav, as well as the closely related Vav2, was found to be essential for GEF activity in vitro (3Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y.

Thus, a model has been proposed where phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase-mediated conversion of PIP2 to PIP3promotes Lck-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Vav. How phosphorylation, presumably at residue Tyr174, promotes Vav GEF function, is not known. Since this residue is positioned just upstream of the DH domain, phosphorylation of Tyr174 may serve to overcome the negative regulatory action of the NH2-terminal sequences and promote the interaction of the DH domain with its GTPase substrates. Deletion of the NH2-terminal 65 amino acids of proto-Vav unmasks its transforming activity, suggesting that these sequences serve a negative regulatory role in Vav function. However, the precise role of these NH2-terminal sequences and whether additional NH2-terminal sequences are also involved in negative regulation have not been determined. Therefore, we generated additional NH2-terminal deletion mutants of proto-Vav, that lack the NH2-terminal 127, 168, or 186 amino acids, and assessed their abilities to cause focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells and to activate different signaling pathways. Since Vav mutants lacking 168 or 186 NH2-terminal residues showed a 20–30-fold greater focus forming activity than that seen with deletion of 127 residues, residues spanning 127–187 contribute significantly to negative regulation of Vav transforming activity. Furthermore, we found that an NH2-terminal Vav deletion mutant lacking Tyr174(ΔN-186) retained the ability to be phosphorylated by Lck in vivo and Lck could still enhance the signaling and transforming activity of this mutant. Thus, Lck can stimulate Vav by a mechanism that does not involve removal of NH2-terminal regulatory activity. Finally, we found that NH2-terminal deletion enhanced Vav membrane association and that an isolated NH2-terminal fragment of Vav could impair ΔN-186 Vav function. Taken together, these observations suggest that the NH2 terminus may serve as a negative regulator of Vav by intramolecular interaction with COOH-terminal sequences to modulate efficient membrane association. The pAX142 and pCTV3HA mammalian expression vectors have been described previously (16Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To subclone the mouse proto-Vav and oncogenic Vav cDNA sequences into the pCTV3HA expression vector, the original pMEXneo-vav constructs PJC11 (encoding proto-Vav) and PJC12 (encoding onco-Vav) (provided by Mariano Barbacid) (26Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar) were partially digested by EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of pBS-SK+(pBS-vav). TheClaI/HpaI fragment from pBS-vav was isolated and then fused in-frame with linkers (proto-Vav, ACGAATTCACGCGTAGTACTCCACCATGGAGCTCTGGCGACA; onco-Vav, ACGAATTCGTTAACCTCGCGAAGA) at the NH2 terminus to a sequence encoding an initiating methionine followed by the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag contained in pCTV3. The NH2-terminal truncation mutants of Vav were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated approaches using pCTV3HA-proto-vav plasmid DNA as the template. 5′-Oligonucleotides with EcoRV restriction enzyme sites were generated at the chosen NH2-terminal truncation sites: for ΔN-127 Vav, 5′-CAGATATCCCTTCCCAACAGAGGACAGT; for ΔN-168, 5′-CAGATATCTTTATGACTGCGTGGAAAATGAG; and for ΔN-186 Vav, 5′-CAGATATCCAAGATGACAGAGTATGATAAG. These oligonucleotides were used to amplify 837, 744, or 660 base pair fragments, respectively, using a 3′-oligonucleotide (3′-CAGATATCCCTGGTAGAATGTGCCTCT) containing anEcoRV site corresponding to an EcoRV site withinvav. Each fragment was ligated to the pCR 2.1 vector from the TA-cloning kit (Stratagene) and sequenced. The fragments were then digested with EcoRV and fused to the HpaI site of pCTV3HA. The remaining COOH-terminal sequences of the NH2-terminal truncated versions of Vav were added by digesting the truncation mutants and pCTV3-proto-vav withFseI/BsiWI and ligating theFseI/BsiWI ΔN-Vav fragments to theFseI/BsiWI vector fragment of pCTV3HA proto-vav. cDNA sequences encoding proto-VavΔC were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification using a 5′-oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to a unique FseI restriction enzyme site (5′-CAGTTAACGGCCGGCCCAAGATTGACGGTGAG) and a 3′-oligonucleotide sequence (3′-CAGTTAACCTAGAATTCCTTAGGCAGACCCAATTC) encoding a stop codon just prior to the start of the coding sequences for the NH2-terminal SH3 domain (at residue 616). This fragment was ligated to the HpaI site in pCTV3HA and then digested with FseI/BsiWI. ThisFseI/BsiWI fragment was then ligated to the appropriate FseI/BsiWI pCTV3HA-proto-vav fragment. The plasmid pCTV3HA-proto-vavΔC and the pCTV3HA-ΔN-vavconstructs were digested with MluI/BsiWI, and then subcloned into the corresponding sites within the pAX142 mammalian expression vector, where expression is under the control of the EF-1α promoter. A cDNA sequence encoding proto-Vav that lacks the COOH-terminal 186 to 845 residues and fused to an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope tag was generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification. A 5′-oligonucleotide primer (5′-CACCCGGGACCATGGAGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGAGCTCTGGCGACAGTGC) containing a SmaI site, a FLAG epitope, and sequences corresponding to the ATG start site of proto-vav was used in conjunction with a 3′-oligonucleotide primer (3′-CACCCGGGTCATCATGGCGTAGGCACCGACTC) containing a SmaI site and sequences prior to the DH domain (up to residue 186) to generate an 186-amino acid fragment. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with SmaI and ligated to the SmaI site of pAX142. The fragment was then sequenced to verify the accuracy of the amplified sequences. Mammalian expression vectors encoding constitutively activated human Rac1 (pAX142-rac(61L)) and constitutively activated Lck (pLXSN-lck(Y505F)) have been described previously (30Zohn I.E. Symons M.

NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. 293T human kidney epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (32Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For each assay, cognate empty vector was used as a control. For focus formation analyses, transfected NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in growth medium for 12 to 14 days. The cultures were then stained with crystal violet (0.5%) and the number of foci of transformed cells was then quantitated. To generate cells lines stably expressing each Vav protein, the transfected cultures were selected in growth medium supplemented with hygromycin (400 μg/ml) and maintained under selection for 10 to 12 days. Multiple drug-resistant colonies (>100) were then pooled together to establish mass populations of cells stably expressing wild type or mutant Vav protein and used for the analyses described. Transient expression transcriptional assays were performed as described previously (33Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation in 6-well dishes (5 × 105cells/well). The cells were serum-starved (0.5% calf serum) 14 to 15 h prior to lysing with luciferase lysis buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates were analyzed using Enhanced Chemiluminescent reagents and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence). All the assays were performed at least three times. The reporter plasmid constructs used for these assays have been described previously. To determine c-Jun and Elk-1 activity, we used a plasmid encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to either the c-Jun NH2-terminal transactivation domain (Gal4-Jun) or the transcriptional activation domain of Elk-1 (Gal4-Elk-1), together with a luciferase gene reporter plasmid where expression is under the control of a minimal promoter containing five tandem Gal4 DNA-binding sites (5×Gal4-Luc). To measure SRF and NF-κB activation, we used reporter plasmids where luciferase gene expression was either under the control of a fos minimal promoter that contains tandem copies of a mutated serum response element (from the c-fospromoter), or tandem copies of the NF-κB-binding site from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, respectively. Cyclin D1 activation was done using the CD1-Luc reporter plasmid where the expression of the luciferase gene is under the control of the human cyclin D1 promoter (provided by Richard Pestell) (34Albanese C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). 293T cells (2 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of the pAX142 empty vector, or pAX142 constructs encoding proto-Vav, NH2-Vav, or ΔN-186 Vav. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum for 12–14 h, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in cold TSA buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.14 m NaCl) for 1 h. The lysates were homogenized in TSA buffer supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm NaVO4, and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm to acquire total protein (200 μl of supernatant). The remaining supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g to separate into crude cytosolic (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions. The P100 fraction also contains cytoskeletal proteins. The protein concentration of the total, cytosolic, and membrane fractions was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), with 40 μg of protein for each fraction then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and probed with anti-HA epitope antibody (Babco). Expression of the HA epitope-tagged Vav proteins in stably transfected NIH 3T3 or in transiently transfected 293T cells was determined by standard immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques as described previously (35Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Jordan J.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in PLC-LB (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium fluoride) supplemented with 1 mmvanadate and various protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentration was determined (Pierce) and then 500 μg of the protein lysate was incubated with anti-HA epitope antibody (HA.11; Babco), and followed by the addition of 50 μl of a 50% slurry (v/v in lysis buffer) of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech). Expression of the FLAG epitope-tagged NH2-Vav protein was detected using the anti-FLAG epitope antibody (α-FLAG M2; Sigma). All transfected cultures were serum-starved (0.1% fetal calf serum) for 12–14 h before lysing. For the NH2-terminal binding studies, 1 μg of pAX142 NH2-Vav with cognate empty vector pAX142 (1 μg) or pAX142 ΔN-186 Vav (1 μg) were transiently transfected into 293T cells. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5% for the HA epitope-tagged proteins and 12.5% for FLAG epitope-tagged Vav), then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and probed with the appropriate primary antibodies. Membranes were then incubated with anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies and protein was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Since deletion of the NH2-terminal 65 residues of proto-Vav (designated onco-Vav) causes activation of its transforming potential, a negative regulatory role for these sequences has been proposed (36Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, whether the remaining NH2-terminal sequences that lie upstream of the DH domain (amino acids 66–185) also contribute to the negative regulation of Vav transforming activity has not been determined. These upstream sequences contain a portion of the CH domain (37Stradal T. Kranewitter W. Winder S.J. Gimona M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 431: 134-137Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), an AD, and a phosphorylation site (Tyr174) for Src or Syk family protein tyrosine kinase (4Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A.

To evaluate a possible role for these sequences in the regulation of Vav function, we generated a series of NH2-terminal truncation mutants of Vav, in which we deleted 127, 168, or 186 amino acids from the NH2terminus of proto-Vav (Fig.1 A). cDNA sequences encoding proto-Vav, onco-Vav, and each truncation mutant (designated ΔN-Vav) were introduced into the pCTV3HA mammalian expression vector, which resulted in the addition of an NH2-terminal HA epitope tag to each Vav sequence that we used to monitor expression of the resulting HA epitope:Vav fusion proteins. We first evaluated the expression of each mutant protein to determine if these NH2-terminal truncations altered protein stability. We transfected NIH 3T3 cells with the empty retroviral vector pCTV3HA, and pCTV3HA encoding proto-Vav and the three NH2-terminal ΔN-Vav mutant proteins to determine the levels of protein expression in stably trans"
https://openalex.org/W2035695710,"We recently showed that the antiapoptotic function of insulin requires nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation (Bertrand, F., Atfi, A., Cadoret, A., L'Allemain, G., Robin, H., Lascols, O., Capeau, J., and Cherqui, G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 2931–2938). Here we sought to identify the NF-κB-dependent survival genes that are activated by insulin to mediate this function. Insulin increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) mRNA and protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin receptors (IRs). This effect required (i) IR activation since it was abrogated by IR mutation at tyrosines 1162 and 1163 and (ii) NF-κB activation since it was abolished by overexpression of dominant-negative IκB-α(A32/36) and mimicked by overexpression of the NF-κB c-Rel subunit. TRAF2 contributed to insulin protection against serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis since TRAF2 overexpression mimicked insulin protection, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative TRAF2-(87–501) reduced this process. Along with its protective effect, overexpressed TRAF2 increased basal and insulin-stimulated NF-κB activities. All effects were inhibited by IκB-α(A32/36), suggesting that an amplification loop involving TRAF2 activation of NF-κB is implicated in insulin antiapoptotic signaling. We also show that insulin increased manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) mRNA expression through NF-κB activation and that Mn-SOD contributed to insulin antiapoptotic signaling since expression of antisense Mn-SOD RNA decreased this process. This study provides the first evidence that insulin activates the NF-κB-dependent survival genes encoding TRAF2 and Mn-SOD and thereby clarifies the role of NF-κB in the antiapoptotic function of insulin.

Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).NF-κB is a member of the NF-κB/Rel family. This family is composed of NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB. Prototypical NF-κB is a p50/p65 heterodimer that is usually retained in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells in an inactive form by IκB-α, one of the most important members of the IκB inhibitory protein family. In response to various stimuli, IκB-α is phosphorylated at Ser32 and Ser36 by IκB kinases α and β (6May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, IκB-α is rapidly ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex (7Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The degradation of IκB-α unmasks the nuclear localization signal of the NF-κB heterodimer, which then translocates into the nucleus, where it directly binds to its cognate DNA sequence to regulate gene transcription.The antiapoptotic role played by NF-κB involves the ability of this transcription factor to induce the expression of genes that promote cell survival such as the genes coding for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors 1 and 2 (TRAF1 and TRAF2, respectively) (8Wang C.-Y.

Of interest, TRAF2, the most extensively studied TRAF family member to date, was recently shown to be also localized in the nucleus (16Min W. Bradley J.R. Galbraith J.J. Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 319-324PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF2 is known to activate NF-κB through its interaction with NIK, a serine/threonine-specific NF-κB-inducible kinase that activates the IκB kinase complex, thus leading to IκB phosphorylation and degradation and subsequent NF-κB activation (17Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). TRAF2 has a clear antiapoptotic function, as supported by the findings that thymocytes from TRAF2 null mice (18Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Bilia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L.

Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). As regards Mn-SOD, it is known as an enzyme of the mitochondrial matrix functioning as a scavenger of superoxide radicals. Like TRAF2, Mn-SOD is involved in apoptosis inhibition since its overexpression suppresses TNF-α-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (22Manna S.K. Zang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar).This study was designed to investigate whether the NF-κB-dependent survival genes coding for TRAF2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and Mn-SOD are activated by insulin and, if so, to analyze their role in the antiapoptotic function of insulin. We used CHO cells overexpressing wild-type IRs (CHO-R and CHO-R15) or IRs made kinase-defective by mutation at Tyr1162 and Tyr1163 autophosphorylation sites (CHO-Y2). We show that insulin increased the expression of TRAF2 mRNA and protein at the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels in CHO-R15 and CHO-R cells, but not in CHO-Y2 cells. Insulin induced TRAF2 overexpression through NF-κB activation, and overexpressed TRAF2 contributed to insulin antiapoptotic signaling by exerting positive feedback control on NF-κB. We also show that insulin increased Mn-SOD (but not c-IAP1 or c-IAP2) mRNA expression in CHO-R15 cells and that Mn-SOD, like TRAF2, contributed to insulin antiapoptotic signaling. These results clarify the role of NF-κB in the antiapoptotic function of insulin and provide new insight into the nuclear mechanisms involved in this function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidsThe pCMV5/lacZ, (Igκ)3-conaluc, and conaluc reporter plasmids and the mutated expression plasmid IκB-α(A32/36) were previously described (1Bertrand F.

CHO-R15 cells stably overexpressing IκB-α(A32/36), TRAF2, TRAF2-(87–501), or c-IAP2 were obtained by transfection of the corresponding expression vectors, together with a pcDNA3.1/zeo selection vector (Invitrogen), using the LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA and poly(A)+RNA were isolated from CHO-R and CHO-R15 cells using kits from QIAGEN Inc. according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Insulin stimulated the expression of the 2.2-kilobase TRAF2 transcript at 6 and 24 h in total RNA from CHO-R and CHO-R15 cells (Fig.1 A). Quantification of the results by scanning densitometry of the autoradiograms after normalization to the human EF1 signal indicated that insulin increased TRAF2 mRNA expression by ∼1.5- and 2.2-fold at 6 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Higher increases (3- and 6-fold at 6 and 24 h, respectively) were measured on Northern blots performed with poly(A)+ RNA from CHO-R15 cells (Fig. 1 B). Accordingly, insulin increased the expression of the 50-kDa TRAF2 immunoreactive protein in cytosolic and nuclear fractions from CHO-R15 cells (Fig. 1 C). These findings provide the first evidence that insulin stimulates the expression of TRAF2 mRNA and protein at the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels in CHO cells overexpressing IRs.Figure 1Insulin increases the expression of TRAF2 mRNA and protein at the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels. Total RNA (20 μg; A) or poly (A)+ RNA (2.5 μg;B) from CHO-R and CHO-R15 cells treated with or without 10−7m insulin (Ins) for 6 or 24 h were subjected to Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cytosolic and nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) from control or insulin-treated CHO-R15 cells were immunoblotted with a TRAF2-specific antibody (C).

As shown in Fig.2 A, the insulin-induced increase in TRAF2 protein expression observed in total cell lysates from CHO-R15 cells was lost in CHO-Y2 cells overexpressing kinase-defective IRs mutated at tyrosines 1162 and 1163. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the stable expression of the dominant-negative IκB-α(A32/36) mutant in CHO-R15 cells (IκB-α(A32/36) cells), which almost completely abolished basal and insulin-stimulated NF-κB-mediated luciferase activities (TableI), dramatically decreased insulin stimulation of TRAF2 mRNA expression as compared with CHO-R15 cells stably transfected with an empty vector and a pcDNA3.1/zeo selection vector (pCMV-zeo cells). Reciprocally, the overexpression of the c-Rel subunit of NF-κB in CHO-R cells (Rel-3 cells) (Fig.2 B), which stimulated NF-κB-mediated activity by 2.2-fold (Table I), increased TRAF2 mRNA expression by 2.3-fold (Fig.2 B). Together, these results indicate that insulin stimulates TRAF-2 expression in CHO-R and CHO-R15 cells through IR activation and through an NF-κB-dependent pathway.Figure 2Effect of IR Tyr1162 and Tyr1163 mutation and of NF-κB inhibition or activation on insulin stimulation of TRAF2 mRNA and/or protein expression.

B, total cell lysates (20 μg of protein) from pCMV-zeo, IκB-α(A32/36), CHO-R, or Rel-3 cells were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for IκB-α or c-Rel. Total RNA (20 μg) from control or insulin-treated pCMV-zeo, IκB-α(A32/36), CHO-R, or Rel-3 cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative (Aand B, upper panels) or the means (B,lower panels) of two experiments. kb, kilobases;hEF1, human elongation factor 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TRAF2 Is Involved in Insulin Antiapoptotic SignalingTo examine the role of TRAF2 in insulin antiapoptotic signaling, CHO-R15 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector coding for TRAF2 or its dominant-negative TRAF2-(87–501) mutant lacking the RING finger domain or with an empty vector, together with a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pCMV5/lacZ). Transfected cells were then incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium (SFM) with or without 10−7m insulin. After fixation and staining, the percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by scoring blue β-galactosidase transfectants as healthy or apoptotic, as judged by blebbing of the membranes and shrinkage of the cell bodies. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the percentage of apoptotic cells that amounted to 48 ± 2% in control cells maintained in SFM in the absence of insulin fell to 15 ± 1% in the presence of insulin. In TRAF2-transfected cells maintained for 24 h in SFM in the absence and presence of 10−7m insulin, the percentages of apoptotic cells were 24 ± 2 and 16 ± 1%, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the percentages of apoptotic cells determined in TRAF2-(87–501)-transfected cells rose to 48 ± 3 and 32 ± 3% in the absence and presence of insulin, respectively.To strengthen the above findings supporting a role for TRAF2 in insulin antiapoptotic signaling, CHO-R15 cells were stably transfected with the TRAF2 or TRAF2-(87–501) expression vector. Two clones designated as TRAF2 and TRAF2-(87–501), which exhibited TRAF2 and TRAF2-(87–501) overexpression as compared with control pCMV-zeo cells (Fig.3 B), respectively, were maintained in SFM for 24 h with or without 10−7m insulin and then analyzed for apoptosis by the DNA fragmentation assay (1Bertrand F.

In controls, insulin almost completely abolished the DNA degradation induced by a 24-h serum deprivation (Fig. 3 C). In TRAF2 cells maintained in SFM in the absence of insulin, the extent of DNA degradation was reduced as compared with controls, indicating that TRAF2 overexpression partially protected CHO-R15 cells from apoptosis. Insulin further protected TRAF2 cells from this process (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, TRAF2-(87–501) cells maintained in SFM in the absence of insulin exhibited a ladder of DNA fragmentation similar to that observed in controls. Most important, Fig. 3 C shows that insulin protection against apoptosis was markedly decreased in these cells. Altogether, these findings indicate that the overexpression of TRAF2 partially mimicked the antiapoptotic effect of insulin, whereas the overexpression of TRAF2-(87–501) markedly reduced this effect. They strongly argue for a role of TRAF2 in insulin antiapoptotic signaling in CHO-R15 cells.The Role of TRAF2 in Insulin Antiapoptotic Signaling Involves TRAF2 Activation of NF-κBSince the role played by TRAF2 in insulin antiapoptotic signaling in CHO-R15 cells could involve the well known ability of TRAF2 to activate NF-κB (13Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 20Liu Z.-g. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of the stable overexpression of TRAF2 or TRAF2-(87–501) on basal and insulin-stimulated NF-κB activities. As reported in TableI, insulin stimulated basal NF-κB-mediated luciferase activity by ∼3-fold in pCMV-zeo cells. As compared with controls, TRAF2 cells exhibited 3.4- and 2.3-fold increases in basal and insulin-stimulated NF-κB activities, respectively. In contrast, TRAF2-(87–501) cells displayed 3.6- and 3.8-fold decreases in basal and insulin-stimulated NF-κB activities, respectively, as compared with controls. Noteworthy is the finding that the stimulation of NF-κB activity induced by insulin in control cells persisted in TRAF2-(87–501)-transfected cells despite the marked decrease in basal NF-κB activity exhibited by these cells. This strongly suggests that TRAF2-(87–501) did not affect NF-κB activation by insulin.In view of the above results, we investigated the role of NF-κB in the ability of TRAF2 to mimic the antiapoptotic effect of insulin. To this end, pCMV-zeo and TRAF2 cells were transfected with the IκB-α(A32/36) expression plasmid or an empty vector in the presence of either the (Igκ)3-conaluc or pCMV5/lacZ reporter plasmid. Transfected cells were treated with or without insulin (24 h, 10−7m) and then examined for NF-κB-mediated activity and the extent of apoptosis. In pCMV-zeo cells, the transient expression of IκB-α(A32/36) inhibited both insulin-stimulated NF-κB activity (Table I) and insulin antiapoptotic signaling (Fig.4). Similarly, we found that IκB-α(A32/36) expression in TRAF2 cells reduced both TRAF2 stimulation of NF-κB-mediated luciferase activity (Table I) and TRAF2 antiapoptotic function (Fig. 4). Altogether, the above results are consistent with the notion that TRAF2 is not involved in insulin activation of NF-κB, but contributes to insulin antiapoptotic signaling, at least"

In determining whether the novel regulatory mechanisms for yHac1 are conserved in mammalian cells, we discovered a unique unfolded protein response element-like sequence within the endoplasmic reticulum stress element 163, one of the three ER stress elements recently identified in the ratgrp78 promoter. The unspliced form of yHac1 is stably expressed in nonstressed mammalian cells and is as active as the spliced form in stimulating the promoter activities of grpgenes. Further, the yHac1 mRNA is not processed in response to ER stress in mammalian cells. We identified a CCAGC motif as the yHac1 binding site, which is contained within a YY1 binding site previously shown to be important for mammalian UPR. Dissection of the yHac1 and the YY1 binding sites uncovered specific contact points for an activator protein predicted to be the mammalian homolog of yHac1, the activity of which can be stimulated by YY1.

In addition to serving as a major intracellular store for calcium and the production site for lipids and sterols, ER is the cellular organelle for the synthesis, assembly, and glycosylation of proteins that are destined for secretion or transport to the cell surface. Perturbations of ER result in stress signaling from the ER to the nucleus, leading to the activation of specific sets of genes (1Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).

InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, several key components of the UPR have been identified through genetic analysis and biochemical characterizations. Thus, the yeast UPR is mediated by a novel signaling pathway that requires ER stress-inducible splicing of the primary transcript of Hac1, also referred to as Ern4p (5Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 6Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of the Hac1 gene encodes a protein of 230 amino acids (aa), whereas the active transcription factor is a 238-aa protein. In nonstressed yeast cells, the unspliced Hac1 mRNA is prevented from translation into the 230-aa protein by the presence of a translation attenuator in a 252-bp intron (6Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Chapman R.E. Walter P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 7: 850-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Upon induction of the UPR, unconventional splicing mediated by Ire1p results in the elimination of the intronic sequence, which contains the codons encoding the last 10 aa of the 230-aa Hac1 and part of the 3′-untranslated region. Although the last 10 aa of 230-aa Hac1 is deleted through this process, the newly spliced Hac1 mRNA contains an additional exon of 18 aa, resulting in the translation of the 238-aa Hac1. Finally, in yeast cells, 230-aa Hac1 and 238-aa Hac1 produced from exogenous vectors are stable and can bind UPRE; however, the transactivating activity of the 230-aa Hac1 is lower than that of the 238-aa Hac1 (6Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The recognition sequence for yHac1 is a 22-bp sequence referred to as the unfolded protein response element (UPRE), which is found in the ER stress-inducible promoter of yeast ER resident protein genes such asKAR2 and PDI1. The yeast UPRE contains an imperfect palindrome with a spacer of one nucleotide (CAGcGTG). The steric configuration of the UPRE appears to be critical because insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide within the spacer region results in the complete loss of its ability to mediate the UPR (8Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Gene Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized ER stress-inducible genes isgrp78, the mammalian homolog of KAR2 (1Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Contrary to yeast, the rat grp78 promoter is functionally redundant and contains three ER stress elements termed ERSE (9Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 10Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The consensus ERSE derived from comparison of a variety of ER stress-inducible mammalian promoters consists of a tripartite structure CCAAT(N 9)CCACG, with N 9being a strikingly GC-rich region of 9-bp. The ERSE physically and functionally interacts with multiple mammalian transcription factors including that of YY1, Y-box proteins, YB-1, dbpA, NF-Y/CBF, and a newly discovered ER stress-inducible complex termed ERSF (10Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Roy B. Li W.W. Lee A.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the various ERSEs share similar sequence motifs and can independently confer the mammalian ER stress response to heterologous promoters (10Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol.

Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), there are subtle differences that are evolutionarily conserved and could have functional implications for their regulation. For example, ERSE-163 contained within thegrp78 core (16Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bears the sequence CCAGC instead of the consensus CCACG found in ERSE-98 contained within the C1 element, which is most proximal to the TATA element (10Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The CCAGC sequence within ERSE-163 of the grp78 core is of particular significance because in vivo genomic footprinting revealed that it is the major region on the grp78 promoter where ER stress-induced factor occupancy changes are detected (16Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), correlating with its functional importance based on 5′ deletion analysis (17Liu E.S. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5425-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have previously identified the multifunctional transcription factor YY1 as a major DNA-binding protein to ERSE-163 (12Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Zhou Y. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The unconventional YY1 binding site encompasses the CCAGC motif and its flanking sequence. In co-transfection studies using NIH3T3 cells, YY1 had little effect on the basal expression of the grp78 promoter but specifically enhanced induction of the grp78 promoter in a DNA binding-dependent manner by a variety of ER stress conditions. Consistent with divergent transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for the different ERSEs, YY1 stimulates the grp78core but the same effect was not observed for the C1 element containing ERSE-98 (10Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, YY1 has not been found in yeast, and the mammalian homolog of Hac1 has not yet been identified. Based on the similarity between the mammalian and yeast UPR, we seek to determine whether the unique regulatory mechanisms for Hac1 discovered in S. cerevisiae are conserved in mammalian cells. Our studies revealed several novel observations suggesting both conservation and divergence of the mammalian and yeast UPR. We discovered that among the three ERSEs of the rat grp78promoter, only ERSE-163 contained within the grp78 core shares sequence identity with the partial palindromic sequence of the yeast UPRE. This is the only ERSE that can bind and can be transactivated by yHac1. We further showed that yHac1mRNA is not processed in response to ER stress in mammalian cells. Both the unspliced and spliced form of yHac1 can be stably expressed in nonstressed mammalian cells and exhibit similar stimulatory activity toward the grp78 promoter. The grp94 promoter, which shares sequence identity with the 78core (17Liu E.S. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5425-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), is also strongly activated by yHac1. The binding site of yHac1 is contained within the YY1 binding site, and binding of yHac1 to ERSE-163 is strictly dependent on the sequence integrity of the CCAGC motif. Through base mutations that selectively destroy either the yHac1 or YY1 binding site, we defined critical contact points for an activator protein predicted to be the mammalian homolog of yHac1, the activity of which can be stimulated by YY1. Based on these observations, we propose a model of the conserved and unique features of the yeast and mammalian UPR transcription machinery. To construct the mammalian expression vector for 230-aa Hac1, Hac1 was released from the glutathioneS-transferase-Hac1 construct by BamHI andEcoRI digestion, and the 700-bp fragment was subcloned into the same sites of the mammalian expression vector pMCX-PL1 (gift of R. Buettner, University of Regensburg, Germany) to generate pMCX-Hac1. The HA epitope-tagged, spliced version of Hac1(HAC1 i) was constructed by PCR amplification using pJC835 (5Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) as template DNA and primers N2 and C2. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and subcloned into theXbaI site of pED (18Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Overlap extension PCR was performed to construct HA epitope-tagged, unspliced HAC1(HAC1 u). This was amplified as two fragments with primers N2, C3 and N3, C2 using pJS835 (5Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), and yeast genomic DNA as templates, respectively. The sequences for the new primers are: N2, acatctagaaaccgccaccatggaaatgact; N3, aaatctagaagagtcgacgacgctacctg; C2, aaaaaatctagataccctcttgcgattgtcttc; and C3, caaagggtagactgtttcccgc. The PCR products were mixed and reamplified with primers N1 and C1, digested with XbaI, and subcloned into the XbaI site of pED. The construction of the 78core(M5)CAT is identical to the construction of 78core/CAT [(formerly referred to as (−169/−135)MCAT), which has been described (14Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of a single base mutation from G to T at −146 as shown in Fig. 7. For the construction of −154(M6)CAT, PCR-directed site mutagenesis was used to create the base mutations at −140, −143, and −144 as shown in Fig. 8. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors CMV-YY1 and the DNA-binding deletion mutant CMV-YY1Δ were gifts from Y. Shi (Harvard Medical School), and their construction has been described (19Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S.

The standard deviations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NIH3T3 cells, a murine embryonic fibroblast cell line, was maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 35 °C. The cells were transfected using either the calcium phosphate method as described previously (12Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Zhou Y. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or with SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). The grp78 promoter/CAT fusion genes −154CAT, 78coreCAT (formerly referred to as (−169/−135)MCAT), and 78C1CAT (formerly referred to as (−109/−74)MCAT) have been described (14Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thegrp94 promoter/CAT fusion gene −357CAT has been described (20Chang S.C. Erwin A. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The construction of the 78core(M5)CAT and the −154(M6)CAT was described above. For the calcium phosphate transfections, NIH3T3 cells, seeded in duplicate sets in 10-cm-diameter dishes, were co-transfected with 5 μg of the CAT reporter gene, 5 μg of the expression vector for Hac1, or the vector alone. 5 μg of the pSV40 β-galactosidase plasmid were also co-transfected to monitor efficiency of transfection. Each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times. For transfections using SuperFect, NIH3T3 cells were seeded in duplicate in 10-cm-diameter plates, treated for 2 h with a mixture of DNA/SuperFect 1:5 containing 5 μg of CAT reporter gene, 2 μg of Hac1 and/or YY1 expression plasmid, 1 μg of pSV40 β-galactosidase, and pMCX-L1 in the amount requested to keep the total DNA concentration to 10 μg/plate. For stress induction, 24 h after transfection the cells were treated with 1.5 μg/ml of tunicamycin or 300 nm thapsigargin (Tg) for 16 h prior to harvesting. Preparation of the cell lysates for CAT assays and the quantitation of the CAT assays have been described (12Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Zhou Y. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Each transfection was repeated three to five times. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pED, pED-HA-Haci, pED-HA-HACu, pED-hIRE1 (21Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), and pED-hIRE1 K599A (21Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) using a calcium phosphate procedure (22Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechiques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were treated with tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) for 6 h and harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. In vitrotranslated Hac1 and YY1 were obtained with the TNT coupled reticulocyte system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For this purpose, pCMX-Hac1 was linearized withXbaI, whereas pCMV-YY1 (gift of Y. Shi, Harvard Medical School) was used undigested. For EMSAs with in vitro translated proteins, 2 μl of the TNT in vitrocoupled transcription/translation reaction mixture were used in the binding reactions. In some reactions, 5 μl of cell lysate from transfected cells were used. Hac1 binding conditions were accomplished in 20 μl of 20 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). YY1 binding conditions have been previously described (12Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Zhou Y. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Samples were preincubated for 5–10 min at room temperature in binding buffer, to which competitor oligos were added whenever specified. After addition of 1–5 ng of probe, the reactions were further incubated at room temperature for 15 min and loaded onto a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5% glycerol. Western blotting was performed by standard procedures (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-506Google Scholar). The blot was sequentially probed with anti-influenza HA epitope (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corp.) and anti-Hac1 (raised against the last 10 aa of processed yHac1 and kindly provided by P. Walter (5Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar)) primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The rat grp78 promoter contains three ERSEs (ERSE-98, ERSE-131, and ERSE-163) upstream of the TATA element (Fig.1 A). In slight variation to the consensus ERSE sequence of CCAAT(N9)CCACG, ERSE-163 contains a CGAAT motif separated by 9-bp from a CCAGC motif. Further, in contrast to other ERSEs, ERSE-163 contained within thegrp78 core region spanning −170 to −135 exhibits two distinct features, suggesting its functional importance in the in vivo regulation of the endogenous grp78 promoter. First, in vivo genomic footprinting revealed that stress-inducible footprint changes occurred primarily within the GGCCAGCTTG sequence of ERSE-163 (Fig. 1 A). Second, with the exception of 2-bp, this sequence is identical to the core of the yeast UPRE sequence GGACAGCGTG, which is the DNA-binding site for yHac1. The binding of Hac1 to the UPRE is strictly dependent on the sequence integrity of the UPRE, because insertion of only 1 bp within the UPRE as in the case of UPREm (Fig. 1 A) completely eliminates Hac1 binding. Scanning of the rat 78 promoter sequence reveals no other substantial match with the yeast UPRE, and no Hac1 binding was detectable with the other ERSEs (data not shown). With the identification of a UPRE-like sequence within the grp78 core, we next tested whether yHac1 can be stably expressed in mammalian cells and what effect, if any, it has on the grp78 promoter activity under stressed and nonstressed conditions. First, 230-aa Hac1 was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (Fig. 1 B) and transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells. To test for the ability of the mammalian cells to stably express yHac1, cell lysates were prepared from cells either transfected with the empty vector or the Hac1 expression vector. The cell extracts were used in EMSAs with the UPRE as probe (Fig.1 C). In the control cells transfected with empty vector, no UPRE binding activity was detected. In cells transfected with the Hac1 expression vector, a strong UPRE binding complex was readily detected. The specificity of UPRE binding was confirmed by efficient competition with the wild type but not the mutated UPRE. To test the effect of overexpression of 230-aa Hac1 on grp78promoter activity, the expression vector for Hac1 was co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells with −154CAT, which retains all the ER stress-inducible properties of the rat grp78 promoter (14Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, in cells transfected with the empty vector, an 8-fold induction of the promoter activity was detected with the ER stress inducer Tg, which depletes the ER calcium store and tunicamycin, which blocks protein glycosylation (Fig. 2). In nonstressed cells, co-transfection of 230-aa Hac1 resulted in a 7-fold induction of the basal grp78 promoter activity. Upon treatment of the cells with Tg or tunicamycin, the overall promoter activity further increased to about 25-fold (Fig. 2). Similarly, thegrp94 promoter, which shares sequence identity with the 78core (17Liu E.S. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5425-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was also strongly induced by yHac1. These results indicate that yeast 230-aa Hac1, when overexpressed in mammalian cells, is highly functional as a transcription factor and acts as a potent stimulator of the grp promoter activities in both nonstressed and stressed cells. Because yHac1 can exist as a 230-aa protein if the translation is terminated at the first termination codon or as a 238-aa protein if the primary transcript has undergone splicing, we compared the potency of the various forms of yHac1 to enhance grp78promoter activity. Prior to these experiments, it is of interest to determine whether transfection of the intact yHac1 gene into nonstressed mammalian cells would result in translation block as observed in S. cerevisiae or whether translation would proceed resulting in a 230-aa protein that could be stably expressed. To facilitate detection of the yHac1, the HA epitope was inserted into the amino end of the Hac1 coding sequence, which was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pED (Fig.3 A). Similarly, an HA-taggedHac1 gene encoding the induced form of 238-aa Hac1 was also constructed. Upon transient transfection into COS cells, yHac1 protein expression level was determined by Western blotting with antibodies against the HA-epitope (Fig. 3 B). The unusual electrophoretic mobility of the 230-aa Hac1 and 238-aa Hac1 was in agreement with that previously reported for Hac1 (6Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As expected, 238-aa Hac1 was produced from the vector expressing the induced form ofHac1. However, with the expression vector containing the unspliced form of the Hac1 gene, predominantly 230-aa Hac1 was produced. These results revealed that in contrast to S. cerevisiae, the unspliced form of yHac1 can be translated and stably expressed in nonstressed mammalian cells. To investigate further whether yHac1 mRNA is processed to produce the 238-aa Hac1 in response to ER stress in mammalian cells, COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the expression vectors forHAC1 I and HAC1 u were treated with tunicamycin and cell lysates prepared for analysis by Western blotting. In contrast to the anti-HA antibody, which detected the 238- and 230-aa forms in the HAC1 I andHAC1 u transfected cells, respectively, probing the same blot with anti-Hac1 antibody that specifically recognizes 238-aa yHac1 indicated that the 238-aa form was present only in cells transfected with HAC1 i but not withHAC1 u (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2and 3). Both tunicamycin treatment and co-transfection with the human Ire1 (21Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) failed to produce the 238-aa form in theHAC1 u transfectants (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4 and 5). The inclusion of the K599A mutant form of Ire1(21Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) also showed no effect (Fig. 3 C,lane 6). Further, reverse transcription-PCR failed to detect the predicted spliced form of Hac1 mRNA (data not shown). These combined results show that yHac1 mRNA is not processed in COS-1 cells. Having established that yHac1 encoded by various DNA templates can be stably expressed in mammalian cells, their effect on the −154CAT reporter gene in both control and Tg-treated NIH3T3 cells were determined in co-transfection experiments. Our results showed that all three forms of yHac1 (230-aa Hac1, HA-tagged 230-aa Hac1 from unspliced template, and HA-tagged 238-aa Hac1 from spliced template) were able to stimulate the basal grp78 promoter activity by about 7-fold, after Tg induction, up to an overall promoter activity of 20–30-fold, as compared with the 8-fold induction observed in Tg-treated transfection with the empty vector (Fig.4). Collectively, these experiments suggest that a Hac1-like activating activity is rate-limiting in mammalian cells toward transcription induction of the grp78promoter, and this activity can be mimicked by overexpression of the yHac1, either in the form of a 230- or 238-aa protein. With the identification of a UPRE-like site within the rat grp78 core sequence, we first determined whether yHac1 can bind to the grp78 promoter sequence. For this purpose, 230-aa Hac1 was translated in vitro and used in EMSAs with either the grp78 core sequence or the yeast UPRE as radiolabeled probes (Fig. 5). Yeast Hac1 was able to bind to the grp78 core sequence, and its binding to the UPRE was stronger. The binding activity to the 78core sequence is attributed to yHac1 because it could be specifically competed by molar excess of the wild type but not the mutant UPRE. Further, as reported for yHac1 (8Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Gene Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), this binding activity was enhanced by the addition of 10 mm magnesium in the binding reaction (data not shown). To map more precisely the critical DNA contact points for yHac1 within the 78core, the ability of a set of mutants of the 78core (M1 through M4) with clustered 4-bp mutations around the UPRE-like site to bindin vitro translated yHac1 was examined (Fig.6 A). The sequence of the mutated bases is shown in Fig. 6 B. Each of the core sequences was individually labeled and used as probes in EMSAs. The wild-type core sequence and the UPRE were included as positive controls. As expected, the strongest binding of yHac1 was observed with the UPRE probe. Among the 78core sequence, yHac1 bound with similar affinity to M3 and M4 as with the wild-type sequence. In contrast, binding of Hac1 to M2 was severely diminished. In M2, the CAGC motif of ERSE-163, which shares complete sequence identity with the UPRE was mutated to ACTA. The result obtained for M3, although unexpected, suggested that the exact TTGG sequence motif at 3′ half of the UPRE-like sequence may not be critical for yHac1 binding. For M4, which lies outside the boundary of the UPRE-like sequence, this mutation was without effect on yHac1 binding. Interestingly, for M1, yHac1 binding was slightly stronger. This could be due to the fact that the last mutated base in M1 changed a C residue to A, resulting in more similarity with the UPRE core sequence ACAGCTTG. As summarized in Fig. 6 B, the most critical yHac1 binding domain to the CAGC motif spans −148 to −145, which occurs within the larger YY1 binding site previously mapped by this same set of mutations to −1"
https://openalex.org/W1987323136,"A complex 120-base pair enhancer, derived from the mouse sex-limited protein (Slp) gene, is activated solely by the androgen receptor (AR) in specific tissues, although it contains a hormone response element recognized by several steroid receptors. The generation of this transcriptional specificity has been ascribed to the interactions of the receptor with tissue-specific nonreceptor factors bound to accessory sites within the enhancer. Protein-DNA interaction assays revealed two factors binding the 5′ part of the enhancer that differ widely in abundance between cells showing AR-specific activation of the Slp element compared with those that also permit activation by glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The factor designated B formed a complex centered on the sequence TGTGGT, a core motif recognized by members of the AML/CBFα transcription factor family. This complex was competed by a high affinity binding site specific for AML/CBFα and was specifically supershifted by an antibody to AML3/CBFα1, placing factor B within the AML3/CBFα1 subclass. Interestingly, this factor was shown to bind to a second site in the 3′ part of the enhancer, positioned between the two critical AR binding sites. Transfection studies revealed that AML1-ETO, a dominant-negative AML/CBFα construct, abrogated AR induction of the enhancer, but not of simple hormone response elements. Furthermore, overexpression of AML3/CBFα1 could rescue the AML1-ETO repression. Finally, glutathione S-transferase-AML/CBFα fusion proteins demonstrated direct interaction between AML/CBFα and steroid receptors. Although this interaction was equivalent between AML1/CBFα2 and AR or GR, AML3/CBFα1 showed stronger interaction with AR than with GR. These data demonstrate that AML3/CBFα1 is functionally required for hormonal induction of the Slpenhancer and that direct, preferential protein-protein interactions may contribute to AR-specific activation.

However, it remains a paradox how the signaling pathways of receptors are distinguished at the DNA level in vivo, sincein vitro several receptors recognize the same consensus HRE (4Adler A.J.

DNA elements that vary from the consensus and provide preferential recognition by a single receptor exist but have not yet proven broadly applicable (6Rundlett S.E. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Cell.

A more versatile mechanism to generate specificity invokes the participation of nonreceptor factors bound to DNA sequences neighboring HREs of hormonally responsive genes (5Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R.

Differential interactions between such factors and steroid receptors may organize an enhancer-specific activation complex that confers transcriptional specificity dependent on information intrinsic to both the gene and the receptor. hormone response elements androgen receptor base pair(s) glucocorticoid receptor linker-scanning acute myeloid leukemia core binding factor polyoma enhancer-binding protein glutathione S-transferase high affinity To study transcriptional specificity imposed by the androgen receptor (AR), we have characterized the enhancer of the mouse sex-limited protein gene (Slp) (4Adler A.J.

Slp expression is androgen-dependent and tissue-specific, occurring primarily in liver and kidney (14Stavenhagen J.B. Robins D.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 247-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Hemenway C. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 120-bp enhancer residing 2 kilobases upstream of the gene contains a consensus HRE that is necessary but not sufficient for hormonal induction in transfection. In monkey kidney CV-1 cells, the enhancer is activated only by AR, but in mammary carcinoma T47D cells, glucocorticoid (GR) and other steroid receptors can drive gene expression as well (4Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that non-HRE enhancer sequences and cell-type restricted factors are required for AR specificity. Distinct sites within the enhancer that are crucial for efficient androgen induction, in addition to the consensus HRE, include a perfect half-site HRE and a sequence similar to that recognized by the ubiquitous octamer transcription factor, Oct-1 (17Scheller A.

These two sites may be involved in hormonal specificity, as they have differential effects on induction by AR compared with GR in contexts where both receptors can activate (17Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Linker-scanning (LS) mutations and deletions of the 5′ part of the enhancer define a 44-bp region critical for AR (or GR) induction (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that this part of the enhancer harbors factors for efficient activation. Moreover, LS mutations within the 5′ region differ in effect in CV-1versus T47D cells, suggesting tissue-specific variation (12Adler A.J. Scheller A., Y. Hoffman Y. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized factors interacting with this part of the enhancer, detected in protein-DNA gel shift complexes. One factor, initially designated B, has been identified as the transcription factor AML3/CBFα1, a member of the AML/CBFα/PEBP2 transcription factor family (21Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Crit. Rev.

These proteins have broad significance in gene regulation, as reflected by their isolation for roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and as viral enhancer-binding proteins (retroviral core binding factor (CBF) and polyoma enhancer-binding protein (PEBP)) but have not previously been demonstrated to be associated with androgen action.

Other factors, such as C/EBP and Ets, have been shown to cooperate with AML/CBFα family members in gene activation (45Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.- M.

Here, we show that AML3/CBFα1 interacts with AR physically and functionally to contribute to tissue-dependent AR-specific transcription. CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), and T47D cells were grown with 5% serum plus 1 μg of insulin/ml. CV-1 or T47D nuclear extracts were prepared by high salt extraction (47Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at about 90% confluence were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution, and homogenized by Dounce in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin). After centrifugation at 1,000 ×g, the nuclear pellets were washed and resuspended in the hypotonic buffer in a volume equal to that of the pellets. The suspensions were extracted with an equal volume of 0.9 mKCl in the hypotonic buffer containing 20% glycerol. After a 1-h incubation on ice with occasional vortexing, the extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatants were dialyzed against binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). Extracts were quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay. Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 5 μg of nuclear extracts were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm ATP, and 0.2 μg/ml BSA. 32P end-labeled probes as indicated in the figure legends were added at 0.1–0.5 ng with or without unlabeled competitors to the preincubated mixtures and incubated for an additional 20 min in a final reaction volume of 15 μl. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on pre-run 8% native acrylamide gels (37.5:1, acrylamide:bis) in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. The oligonucleotides used to identify factor B as a member of the AML/CBFα family included a high affinity core binding site (23Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundstrom T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 42-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-GGATATTTGCGGTTAGCA-3′, and its mutant, 5′-GGATATTGCCATTAGCA-3′. For antibody supershift experiments, 0.2 μg of anti-AML3/CBFα1 or anti-AML1/CBFα2 antibodies (33Meyers S. Lenny N. Sun W. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 303-312PubMed Google Scholar) (Calbiochem), both having high specificity to their respective subtypes, were used in gel shift assays. For DNase I footprinting, a PvuII-BamHI fragment containing the 120-bp enhancer was excised from C′Δ9tkCAT (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar),32P-labeled at the BamHI sites for either top or bottom strand by Klenow fill-in or polynucleotide kinase reaction, and gel-purified. The DNase I reaction was performed as described previously (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The sequence ladder of the fragment for comparison to the protected region was achieved by cleaving naked probe with piperidine (A/G). The 120-bp enhancer driving tkCAT, known as C′Δ9tkCAT, and the 3xHREtkCAT reporters have been described (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). tkCAT driven by four copies of the minimal sequence “b” was constructed by inserting a tetramer of oligonucleotide b ligated through terminal XbaI sites into the SmaI site of the ptkCAT reporter. The pCMV5-AR or -GR expression plasmids have been described previously (17Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for murine AML3/CBFα1/PEBP2α1, pEF-BOSαA1, was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Ito (Kyoto University) (48Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative construct pCMV5-AML1-ETO (35Lenny N. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar) and the murine pcDNA-AML1/CBFα2 (27Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. S. W. Hiebert (Vanderbilt University) and Dr. N. A. Speck (Dartmouth University). For transfection, CV-1 or T47D cells were plated at 50% confluence in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% charcoal-treated NuSerum IV (Collaborative Research) and cotransfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, with plasmids as indicated in figures. Differing plasmid DNA amounts between plates were adjusted with plasmid pGem3. Following overnight incubation, CV-1 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and T47D cells were glycerol-shocked for 3 min before phosphate-buffered saline washing. New medium was then added, with or without 30 nmdihydrotestosterone for AR or 30 nm dexamethasone for GR, for 28–30 h. CAT activity was measured as described previously (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and was expressed as fold induction (reporter activity in the presence of hormone relative to uninduced activity). To test direct interaction of AML3/CBFα1 with AR or GR, a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion to AML3/CBFα1 was constructed by inserting the murine cDNA into pGEX-3X using theBamHI-SmaI sites. The coding sequence was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of pEF-BOSαA1 with the primers 5′-GAAGATCTCCATGCGTATTCCTGTAGATCC-3′ and 5′-ACCAGCTGATATGGCCGCCAAACAGACTC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BglII and PvuII and inserted into pGEX-3X. Similarly, GST-AML1/CBFα2 was constructed by inserting the BglII- and NaeI-digested polymerase chain reaction product generated from pKS-AML1/CBFα2 with primers 5′-GTAGATCTCCATGCGTATCCCCGTAGATGC-3′ and 5′-ATAGCCGGCGTAGGGCCGCCACACGGC-3′. The resulting constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. The expression of GST and fusion proteins was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and equal amounts of induced preparations were immobilized on glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pGEM4-AR and pC7G-GR have been described previously (4Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,12Adler A.J. Scheller A., Y. Hoffman Y. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); their encoded proteins were produced by in vitrotranscription and translation with the TnT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The DNA binding form of the receptors was achieved by a 15-min incubation of translates at 30 °C in the presence of 50 nm respective hormone (49Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The interaction was performed by incubating equivalent amounts of translated AR or GR, judged by incorporated radioactivity, with the GST fusion proteins or GST alone in binding buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/μl bovine serum albumin). After a 2-h incubation on ice, the Sepharose pellets were washed 4 × 1 ml with the reaction buffer, and the retained receptors were resolved in 8% polyacrylamide SDS gels (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualized by fluorography. As noted previously, two linker scan mutants, LS3 and LS4, and deletions of the 5′ part of the enhancer (C′Δ9) abrogated AR inducibility of C′Δ9tkCAT in CV-1 cells (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DNA footprints confirm that LS3 and LS4 disrupted protein-DNA interactions observed at these sites with the wild type enhancer (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting the necessity of these factors for efficient AR activation. To characterize these factors, gel shift assays were performed with a 44-bp oligonucleotide, Oligo I, corresponding to the 5′ part of the enhancer, and two overlapping probes, Oligo II and Oligo III (Fig.1 A). With Oligo I and CV-1 nuclear extract, two major protein-DNA complexes of similar intensity were observed (Fig. 1 B), complex A and B; a third complex, C, was less reproducible. Complex formation was specific in that it was competed by unlabeled Oligo I itself but not by unrelated oligonucleotides containing sites for NF-κB, HNF4, and HNF-3β. The FPIV probe, containing the Oct-1 motif, caused a noticeable reduction in complex A at 100-fold molar excess, but this was insignificant compared with competition by Oligo I. Competition with unlabeled Oligo II and Oligo III assigned complex A to Oligo II and B to Oligo III (Fig. 2,upper left panel). This separation of complexes was further confirmed with labeled Oligo II or III as probe (Fig. 2, lower panels), suggesting that the region of overlap between Oligo II and III was not sufficient for formation of either complex. Gel shift assays with these Oligos and nuclear extracts from T47D cells revealed complexes similar in position to those observed with CV-1 extracts but with dramatic differences in intensity (Fig. 2, upper right panel). Complex A was much more abundant in T47D than in CV-1 cells, whereas the B complex could only be faintly detected when unlabeled Oligo II was added as a competitor. Similar to CV-1 proteins, the T47D Complex A associated independently with Oligo II, and complex B associated independently with Oligo III (Fig. 2, lower panels). These data demonstrate that two factors interact with the 5′ part of the enhancer and vary in abundance in different cells. DNA sequences involved in the formation of complexes A and B were determined by DNase I footprinting. A PvuII-BamHI DNA fragment containing the 120-bp enhancer was used to bind nuclear extracts. In addition to the previously observed FPIV region (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), two major regions were protected following incubation with CV-1 nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 A). By comparison to the sequence ladder of the same fragment, the upper protected region was within Oligo III, indicating that the sequence labeled b was protected by the factor for complex B. This was further confirmed by the loss of protection upon addition of excess Oligo III but not Oligo II. Interestingly, a lower protected region, 5′ of the consensus HRE, also disappeared with excess Oligo III but not Oligo II. This result could indicate that the same factor was involved in both protections or that factor B interacted with a factor required for the lower protection. Examination of the lower protected region revealed a centrally located TGTGGT sequence, as in the region bound by factor B. To investigate whether the second protected region resulted from factor B occupancy, Oligo IV, including sequences from the 3′ part of FPIV to the 5′ edge of the HRE (see Fig. 1 A), was used in gel shift assays. When the minimal sequence b demarcated from the footprint was used as a probe, a complex comigrating with complex B formed with CV-1 extracts (Fig. 3 B) as well as with T47D extracts (data not shown). The complex disappeared with excess unlabeled Oligo III, b, and Oligo IV but not with Oligo II, indicating that the minimal sequence was sufficient for formation of complex B and suggesting that this factor also was responsible for the lower protected footprint. When Oligo IV was used as a probe (Fig. 3 B, right), the major DNA-protein complex observed was competed by unlabeled Oligo III and b but not by Oligo II, demonstrating that the Oligo IV complex is similar to complex B and that the factor is likely common to both.

https://openalex.org/W2067229881,"Nuclear DEAF-1-related (NUDR) protein is a novel transcriptional regulator with sequence similarity to developmental and oncogenic proteins. NUDR protein deletions were used to localize the DNA binding domain between amino acids 167 and 368, and site-specific DNA photocross-linking indicated at least two sites of protein-DNA contact within this domain. The DNA binding domain contains a proline-rich region and a region with similarity to a Myc-type helix-loop-helix domain but does not include the zinc finger motif at the C terminus. Deoxyribonuclease I protection assays confirmed the presence of multiple NUDR binding motifs (TTC(C/G)G) in the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1) promoter and also in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of hNUDR cDNA. NUDR produced a 65–70% repression of the hnRNP A2/B1 promoter activity, and NUDR binding motifs in the 5′-UTR were found to mediate this repression. NUDR-dependent repression was also observed when the 5′-UTR of NUDR was placed onto a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter in an analogous 5′-UTR position but not when placed upstream of transcription initiation. These results suggest that NUDR may regulate the in vivo expression of hnRNP A2/B1 and NUDR genes and imply that inactivation of NUDR could contribute to the overexpression of hnRNP A2/B1 observed in some human cancers.

The encoded protein had 46% overall amino acid similarity toDrosophila Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (DEAF-1) (2Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and was therefore named nuclearDEAF-1 related (NUDR) (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). DEAF-1 has been shown to bind to TTCG-containing motifs located adjacent to DNA binding sites for the Deformed homeodomain protein that occur in the promoter regions of Deformed and other Deformed-regulated genes, indicating that DEAF-1 may act as a transcriptional cofactor of Deformed (2Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). NUDR was also shown to recognize TTCG-containing motifs (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the combination of sequence and functional similarities suggests that NUDR may be the mammalian homolog of DEAF-1. In our previous report, NUDR was shown to transcriptionally activate a minimal proenkephalin promoter, and activation was increased by the addition of synthetic RAREs placed 5′ of the promoter (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because we were unable to demonstrate NUDR binding to proenkephalin sequences in either DNase I protection assays or mobility shift assays, we concluded that the activation of the proenkephalin promoter was likely to occur through protein-protein interactions (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using a yeast two hybrid system, Sugihara et al. (3Sugihara T.M. Bach I. Kioussi C. Rosenfeld M.G. Andersen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15418-15423Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) identified the mouse homolog of NUDR (called mDEAF-1) through interaction with LMO-4, a new member of the LIM-only (LMO) family. LMOs contain two tandem repeats of the LIM zinc finger domain, which can associate tightly with another family of cofactors called Clims (also referred to as Ldb or NLI) to activate (4Bach I. Carriere C. Ostendorff H.P. Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) or inhibit (5Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) transcription. Since LMO and Clim complexes have not been demonstrated to bind directly to DNA, they have been postulated to regulate transcription through the recruitment of DNA-binding proteins and the assembly of transcriptional complexes (3Sugihara T.M.

Mouse NUDR was shown to interact with LMO-4, LMO-2, and Clim-2 in both in vitroand in vivo assays, and it was proposed that NUDR could provide the critical DNA binding function to LMO-Clim complexes (3Sugihara T.M. Bach I. Kioussi C. Rosenfeld M.G. Andersen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15418-15423Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because NUDR showed only moderate affinity for the RARE sequence, higher affinity sequences were selected from a library of random oligonucleotides through binding to recombinant NUDR protein and amplification by PCR (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of the selected sequences revealed the presence of one or more copies of TTCG and/or TTTCCG, and multiple sequence alignment suggested a NUDR binding consensus sequence of TTCGGGNNTTTCCGG (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Comparison of the NUDR binding motifs and the RARE sequence suggested that the original identification of NUDR was likely through the fortuitous binding of NUDR protein to the TTCGG sequence found between the RARE half-sites. The similarity in DNA recognition sequences between NUDR and Drosophila DEAF-1 implied that the DNA binding domain may be in a region of greater amino acid homology between the proteins, namely, the zinc finger homology region at the C terminus (56% similarity) and/or the nuclear domain (1Huggenvik J.I.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) located in the central region of the proteins (70% similarity). The distantly related zinc finger region of the progesterone receptor has been shown to be involved directly in the DNA binding domain, whereas the more homologous zinc finger region of MTG8 (ETO) has recently been shown to be involved in protein-protein interaction and the recruitment of nuclear corepressors and histone deacetylases (8Lutterbach B.

Staudt L.M. Blood. 1996; 88: 1423-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SP100 proteins are localized to subnuclear structures termed “nuclear bodies” and are thought to play a role in the etiology of acute promyelocytic leukemia (reviewed in Ref. 11Sternsdorf T. Grotzinger T. Jensen K. Will H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 307-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that SP100B associates with non-histone chromatin components that behave as transcriptional silencers, and when fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, SP100B can repress transcription (12Seeler J.S.

In this report, we identify the DNA binding domain in the central region of NUDR that includes the nuclear/KDWK domain and a Myc-type helix-loop-helix structure, and we demonstrate that there are at least two sites of protein contact with the DNA.

Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2237-2246PubMed Google Scholar), is identified as a potential target gene of NUDR regulation by the presence of a NUDR binding consensus sequence within the promoter region. We show that NUDR represses transcription of the hnRNP A2/B1 promoter through a DNA binding-dependent mechanism and that NUDR binding motifs within the 5′-UTR are involved in this regulation. We hypothesize that elevated levels of hnRNP A2/B1 found in some cancers may be a consequence of the inactivation or deregulation of NUDR. The bacterial expression and purification of recombinant proteins for full-length human NUDR (hNUDR) and monkey NUDR (sNUDR) have been described previously (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To facilitate the construction of various deletion proteins and peptides, sNUDR was used to derive the peptide constructs G, H, I, J, K, and L, whereas hNUDR was used to derive all other constructs. The full-length proteins of sNUDR and hNUDR differ by only five amino acids and have virtually indistinguishable binding characteristics. For the deletion constructs B, C, D, and E, cDNA fragments of hNUDR were excised from the parent vector pBSSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with BspEI and SphI (B), BspEI and HincII (C), BspEI andAatII (D), and XcmI and EcoRI (E) followed by T4 DNA polymerase fill-in, ligation of BamHI linkers, and BamHI digestion. The resulting DNA fragments were ligated into the BamHI-digested pET-16b vector (Novagen, Inc. Madison, WI) for production of N-terminal histidine-tagged proteins. For the internal deletion construct F, the cDNA in pBSSK was digested with NcoI andAflII, filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, and religated. For the internal deletion construct G, a portion of the cDNA was excised with EcoNI and AatII and replaced with an SV40 nuclear localization signal (18Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar) formed by hybridization of the following two oligonucleotides: 5′-cCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAAGGTAgacgt-3′ and 5′-cTACCTTTCTCTTCTTTTTTGGgct-3′, with the lowercase letters denotingBsmI and AatII cohesive ends. The cDNAs for constructs F and G were excised with BspEI andEcoRI and treated as described above to add BamHI linkers and then subcloned into the pET-16b vector. Recombinant histidine-tagged fusion proteins were purified as described previously for the full-length proteins except that the pH of the renaturation buffer was changed from 8.0 to 9.1 to adjust for differences in the isoelectric points of the deletion proteins. For construction of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion peptides H, I, J, K, and L, cDNA fragments of sNUDR were excised from the parent plasmid with EcoNI andAatII (H), NcoI and AatII (I),ApaI and AatII (J), NcoI andAflII (K), and ApaI and AflII (L), treated as described above to add BamHI linkers, and subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously for GST-sNUDR (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine the concentration of each protein preparation, the recombinant proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and compared with a bovine serum albumin standard curve using a Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Recombinant proteins were incubated on ice with either nonspecific or specific oligonucleotide competitors (as indicated) in a 20-μl reaction containing 500 ng of poly(dI-dC), 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.1), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 7% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 20. The glucocorticoid response element (GRE) oligonucleotide used for nonspecific competitor (Fig.2 B) was formed by hybridization of two synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-TCGACTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACT-3′ and 5′-TCGAAGTAGCTAGAACATCCTGTACAG-3′ (19Kuiper G.G. de Ruiter P.E. Trapman J. Jenster G. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the N42–78 oligonucleotide was formed by hybridization of 5′-cgggatccTTCGGACTGATTCGGCTTCCCACTTCG-3′ and 5′-cgggatccCGAAGTTCCCCGAAGTGGGAAGCCGAA-3′. The lowercase letters denote BamHI restriction sites used for subcloning. Radioactive oligonucleotide probes were produced by fill-in reactions with Klenow and [α-32P]dATP. After 15 min, the reactions were mixed with 120–240 fmol of 32P-labeled probe and incubated an additional 15 min at 25 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bis, 40:0.8, in 1× Tris-borate EDTA) at 120 volts for 3 h, and results were imaged using a 445 SI PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The following DNA fragments were isolated and radiolabeled by fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dATP and Klenow DNA polymerase:EcoRI/BspMI fragment of hNUDR8 cDNA (Fig.2 A), EcoRI/HpaI fragment of N42–78 that was inserted in the BamHI site of pBLCAT5 (Fig.2 C), HindIII/SmaI fragment of the hnRNP A2/B1 gene from hnRNPCAT (Fig. 5 A), andEcoRI/HincII fragment of the hnRNP A2/B1 gene from hnRNP in pBSKSII (Stratagene) (Fig. 5 B). DNase I protection assays were performed as described (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), except that poly(dI-dC) was not used in Fig. 5. The synthesis of the photoreactive nucleotide analog AB-dUTP (Fig. 4 A) has been described elsewhere (20Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The N42–78 oligonucleotide of hNUDR8 was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBLCAT5 and then excised with HindIII and EcoRI. After biotinylating the DNA fragment, one of the DNA strands was selectively immobilized on paramagnetic beads and used as the template in the synthesis of the photoaffinity probe (22Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Approximately one pmol of template was used in a reaction containing 6 pmol of the specific oligonucleotide 5′-CGGCTTCCCACTTCGGGG-3′, ∼4.5 pmol [α-32P]dCTP, 0.6 μm AB-dUTP, 0.6 μm dATP, and 0.25 units of exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 20 μl. After 5 min at 37 °C, 2.5 μl of 5 mm unlabeled dNTPs were added and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. A second oligonucleotide, complementary to the multiple cloning region of pBLCAT5 and 5′ of the first oligonucleotide, was annealed to the immobilized DNA, and double-stranded DNA was synthesized with T4 DNA polymerase and subsequent treatment with T4 DNA ligase to seal the nicks. The double-stranded DNA photoaffinity probe was removed from the solid support by digestion with HincII. The binding reaction conditions for cross-linking were identical to those described for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), except that 2 fmol of the photoreactive probe were used. The cross-linking of the DNA and protein was performed by irradiation with UV light at 380 μW/cm2 for 2 min at a distance of 20 cm. The cross-linked samples were treated with DNase I and S1 nuclease as described (23Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to remove all but the four labeled pyrimidines attached to the protein (labeled Intact, Fig. 4 D). An aliquot of the cross-linked sample was treated with 70% formic acid and 2% diphenylamine at 70 °C for 20 min to cleave the acid-labile Asp-Pro linkage at position 195–196 (labeled Asp-Pro cleavage, Fig.4 D). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. A 743-bp DNA fragment containing the hnRNP A2/B1 promoter (positions 1844–2586) was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR (GeneAmp 9600, Perkin-Elmer) using 600 ng of genomic DNA isolated from the human JEG-3 cell line, and the primers 5′-ACTTTCAGCAGCGAACTCTCC-3′ and 5′-AGTCGCTTCAGCCCGATTTC-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into theEcoRV site of pBSKSII (Stratagene) before excision withBamHI and HindIII and ligation into theBamHI/HindIII site of pBLCAT6 (24Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene. 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) to produce the reporter plasmid, hnRNPCAT. The hnRNP PCR product in pBSKSII was digested with BspEI, followed by a fill-in reaction and ligation of BamHI linkers. The DNA fragment containing the hnRNP promoter was excised with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the BamHI/HindIII site of pBLCAT6 to produce the reporter hnRNPΔICAT. The reporter plasmids hnRNPΔIICAT and hnRNPΔI,IICAT were produced by excision of aXhoI DNA fragment from the plasmids hnRNPCAT and hnRNPΔICAT and subsequent religation. The 5′-UTR DNA was excised from hNUDR8 withEcoRI/BspEI, followed by a fill-in reaction and the addition of BamHI linkers. The 356-bp DNA fragment was ligated into the BamHI site or BglII site of pBLCAT5 (24Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene. 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) to produce the reporter constructs (h8N1–356)TKCAT and TK(h8N1–356)CAT, respectively. The 121-bpEcoRI/BspMI fragment of hNUDR8 was treated similarly and ligated into the BglII site of pBLCAT5 to produce TK(h8N1–121)CAT. To achieve high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells, the cDNAs for hNUDR, sNUDR, and hNUDR-R302T/K304T were subcloned into an expression plasmid that utilized the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (CMV), as described previously (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The zinc finger homology region of hNUDR was deleted by HpaI andBsu36I digestion of the cDNA in pBSSKII, followed by fill-in and religation of the plasmid. The cDNA was excised withEcoRI, and BamHI linkers were added, digested with BamHI, and subcloned into the BglII site of pCMVNeo for the construct, CMVhNUDRaa1–505. TheNcoI/EcoRI DNA fragment containing the C-terminal portion of hNUDR was subcloned into the BglII site as above to produce the construct CMVhNUDRaa243–565. The primers 5′-CGCGGATCCACCATGGCAGCTCCCCTCAC-3′ and 5′-CTACCGGATCCTAGACGTCGCCCTGGGC-3′ were used in a 20-cycle PCR reaction with hNUDR as the template. The PCR product was digested withBamHI and subcloned into the BglII site of pCMVNeo for the construct, CMVhNUDRaa167–368. An EcoRI fragment of hNUDR from construct G in pBSSK was treated as above for the construct CMVhNUDRΔ255–367/SV40NLS. For each construct, the orientation and DNA sequence of the sites flanking an insertion or deletion were determined. Protein expression was confirmed in transfected CV-1 cells by immunofluorescence detection of NUDR, and the percentage of cells showing nuclear or cytoplasmic localization was estimated: hNUDRaa243–565 was 100% nuclear; hNUDR, hNUDRaa1–505 and hNUDRaa167–368 were 80% nuclear; hNUDRΔ255–367/SV40NLS was 64% nuclear; and hNUDR-R302T/K304T was 100% cytoplasmic (immunofluorescence data not shown). CV-1 cells were transfected with various reporter constructs and expression plasmids, cell extracts were prepared in 250 μl of homogenization buffer, and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activities were determined and normalized as described previously (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The normalized CAT activity determined for the indicated reporter construct was set at 100% and the effects of cotransfecting different expression plasmids with the reporter are shown relative to this activity. In a search for genes that contain the NUDR binding consensus sequence or TTCG motifs, we noted that multiple TTCG motifs occurred in the cDNA corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTRDNA) of human NUDR8 and monkey NUDR. Computer analysis of the NUDR cDNA for TTCG motifs demonstrates the presence of 14 motifs in the 5′-UTRDNA of hNUDR8, four motifs in the coding region, and the absence of motifs in the 3′-UTRDNA(Fig. 1 A). To test whether NUDR protein could bind these motifs, we performed an EMSA using radiolabeled DNA sequences from the 5′-UTRDNA (99 bp) and 3′-UTRDNA (130 bp) of hNUDR8. Low mobility complexes were observed with the 5′-UTRDNA probe when combined with 10 and 30 pmol of recombinant hNUDR protein, whereas no complexes were formed with the 3′-UTRDNA probe (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that NUDR protein could potentially bind multiple TTCG motifs within its own 5′-UTRDNA in vivo. To examine the specific sequences within the 5′-UTRDNA that NUDR was binding, we utilized DNase I protection assays. In the presence of NUDR protein, a large 74-base pair region in the upper half of the 5′-UTRDNA was protected from nuclease digestion (Fig. 2 A). This protected region contained, but was not limited to, the TTCG motifs. Within this large region was a smaller area that was protected by the lowest protein concentration and contained two sets of TTCG pairs separated by six nucleotides (shown in bold capitals letters in Fig.2 D). Comparison of the two sets showed that 9 of the 15 nucleotides of each set were identical to each other and can be represented by the sequence, TTCGGNNNNNTTCGN. In addition, 9 nucleotides within each set of TTCG pairs (15 nucleotides in length) were identical to the derived NUDR binding consensus sequence, TTCGGGNNTTTCCGG. The six-nucleotide spacing between a pair of TTCGs would align the TTCG sequences on the same face of the DNA double helix within one turn and may allow optimal binding or interaction of one or more NUDR molecules. Other areas in the lower half of the 5′-UTRDNA of hNUDR8 were also protected from nuclease digestion by NUDR binding; some of these contained TTCG motifs whereas others did not (data not shown). Because the sequences and boundaries of the DNA protected by NUDR binding were not limited to TTCG or TTCG-like motifs, protein-protein interactions may extend the protection from DNase I to flanking sequences or may alter the DNA binding specificity. To facilitate subsequent studies, an oligonucleotide spanning the two sets of TTCG pairs from the 5′-UTRDNA of hNUDR8 (nucleotides N42–78, shown in bold capital letters in Fig.2 D) and including BamHI restriction sites at both ends was synthesized. In EMSA, radiolabeled N42–78 oligonucleotide was shifted by the addition of recombinant NUDR protein (Fig.2 B). DNA binding specificity of NUDR was shown by DNA binding competition with an excess of unlabeled N42–78, whereas no competition was observed with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a glucocorticoid response element (Fig. 2 B). The N42–78 oligonucleotide was subcloned into a plasmid, and a DNA fragment containing this sequence was used in DNase I protection assays. As shown in Fig. 2 C, NUDR protein protected the entire N42–78 sequence from nuclease digestion. In addition, NUDR protein binding also produced DNase I hypersensitive sites in the sequence flanking N42–78 (Fig. 2 C) and in small regions of the 5′-UTRDNA of hNUDR8 (data not shown). We examined NUDR for a potential DNA binding domain, and the cysteine-rich, C terminus of the protein appeared as the most likely candidate. There are at least 20 protein sequences in the GenBank™ data base that have homology to this region of NUDR (1Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol.

To investigate the region(s) of the protein responsible for DNA binding, we constructed various N-terminal, C-terminal, and internal deletions of NUDR (Fig. 3) and inserted them into bacterial expression vectors to produce fusion proteins with GST or an N-terminal histidine tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). Recombinant proteins were purified and assayed for their ability to bind the radiolabeled N42–78 sequence in EMSAs. We found deletion of the last 84 amino acids, which includes the potential zinc finger motif, had little effect on the DNA binding of NUDR (Fig. 3,construct B). Similarly, deletion and site-directed mutations of the zinc finger motif in DEAF-1 had no effect on its DNA binding properties (2Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, removal of up to 195 amino acids from the C terminus of NUDR (Fig. 3, constructs B-D) and up to 138 amino acids from the N terminus (data not shown) had little effect on NUDR binding of the N42–78 probe.

This process is too slow to be accounted for by a simple diffusion-controlled mechanism. We have tested if the interaction between activated receptor and G protein is rate-limiting by fusing the coding sequence of the human A1-adenosine receptor to that of Gαi-1(A1/Gαi-1) and of Gαo(A1/Gαo). Fusion proteins of the expected molecular mass were detected following transfection of HEK293 cells. Ternary complex formation was monitored by determining the kinetics for binding of the high affinity agonist (−)-N 6-3[125I](iodo-4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl)adenosine; these were similar in the wild-type receptor and the fusion proteins over the temperature range of 10 to 30 °C. Agonist dissociation may be limited by the stability of the ternary complex. This assumption was tested by creating fusion proteins in which the Cys351 of Gαi-1 was replaced with glycine (A1/Gαi-1C351G) or isoleucine (A1/Gαi-1C351I) to lower the affinity of the receptor for the G protein. In these mutated fusion proteins, the dissociation rate of the ternary complex was accelerated; in contrast, the rate of the forward reaction was not affected. We therefore conclude that (i) receptor activation per se rather than its interaction with the G protein is rate-limiting in ternary complex formation; (ii) the stability of the ternary complex is determined by the dissociation rate of the G protein.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2374-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); upon activation of the receptor by an agonist, the activated receptor (R*) associates with its cognate G protein(s). In the resulting ternary HR*G complex, the agonist is bound with high-affinity. It is not clear whether the conformational transition to R* is rate-limiting or whether ternary complex formation is limited by the association of receptor and G protein (2Neubig R.R. Gantzos R.D.

Based on kinetic arguments, it has been suggested that a significant portion of the receptors were precoupled, i.e. there is a fraction of preformed R·G complexes in intact cells and membranes because receptors can bind G proteins in the absence of agonists (for review, see Refs. 4Schütz W.

However, earlier experiments that were designed to investigate the kinetics of adenylyl cyclase regulation by the α2-adrenergic receptor failed to detect an initial burst of receptor-dependent inhibition although this would be predicted for precoupled receptors (7Thomsen W.J. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8778-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mechanism of signal transduction in the visual system is inconsistent with precoupling of rhodopsin and transducin (8Felber S. Breuer H.P. Petruccione F. Honerkamp J. Hofmann K.P. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3051-3063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to photoreceptors (or other specialized sensory cells) where a receptor is only confronted with a single type of G protein, in most cells a given receptor selects its cognate G protein(s) from a multitude of available G protein oligomers; the specificity in this interaction that can be observed is remarkable in many instances (reviewed in Ref. 9Gudermann T. Schönerberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this fidelity is achieved is not fully understood. In the present work, we used the human A1-adenosine receptor because its interaction with G proteins has been extensively characterized in experiments with purified and defined components (10Freissmuth M.

In addition, we have altered the affinity of the G protein for the receptor by introducing mutations at the carboxyl terminus of the Gα subunit, a site that is critical for R/G interaction (16Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 17Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we show that the association of receptor and G protein is not rate-limiting; in contrast, the stability of the ternary complex is limited by the dissociation rate of the G protein. This suggests that the fidelity of receptor-G protein coupling is achieved by a kinetic proofreading mechanism. Adenosine deaminase and CompleteTMprotease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). Hepes and CHAPS were from Biomol (Munich, Federal Republic of Germany); suramin was obtained from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA).

Fetal calf serum was from PAA Laboratories (Linz, Austria), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, non-essential amino acids, β-mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine, penicillin G, streptomycin, and G418 (geneticin) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

The vector pEGFP-C1 was obtained from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). The construction of A1-adenosine receptor/Gαi-1(and Gαo) fusion proteins is described in Ref. 20Wise A. Sheehan M. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. In short, the NH2 terminus of pertussis toxin-resistant forms (Cys351 of Gαi-1 replaced by Gly or by Ile) of Gαi-1 or of wild-type Gαi-1 were fused to the COOH terminus of the human A1-adenosine receptor. This converted the Asp residue at the carboxyl-terminal of the receptor to Ala and preserved the methionine, which normally functions as the initiator in Gαi-1 (and Gαo). The conditions for cell culture and transfection are described in Ref. 21Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar. In brief, HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Media for the culture of stably transfected cells were supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml geneticin (G418) in order to maintain the selection pressure. Co-transfection of pEGFP-C1, a vector carrying a red-shifted variant of wild-type green fluorescent protein cDNA from the jellyfish Aequoria victoria served as a control to monitor transfection efficiency by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were harvested and membranes were prepared as described previously (21Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). The final membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer (25 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2) at a protein concentration of 8–10 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. In some experiments cells were treated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 1–24 h; at the end of the incubation period the cells were lysed by immersing the dish in liquid nitrogen followed by rapid thawing. The cells were scraped off and membranes were prepared. Membranes obtained from pertussis toxin-treated cells expressing the human A1-adenosine receptor were reconstituted with purified oligomeric G proteins as described (21Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). In order to deplete membranes from βγ-dimers, membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing the A1-adenosine receptor/Gαi-1 fusion protein were incubated in buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2) containing 16 mm CHAPS (the ratio of detergent to membrane protein was 2:1); after 1 h on ice, the solubilized material and the extracted membrane pellet were recovered by centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated to a protein concentration of 7 μg/μl and the pellet was resuspended in CHAPS-free buffer (composition as given above). About one-third of the receptors was retained in the pellet as assessed by [3H]DPCPX binding; immunoblots revealed that >90% of the βγ-dimers had been extracted from the membrane. Recombinant Gαi-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 harboring a plasmid encoding yeast myristoyl-CoA transferase and purified from bacterial lysates (22Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Oligomeric G proteins were purified from porcine brain membranes (23Nanoff C. Waldhoer M. Roka F. Freissmuth M. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and free βγ-dimers were chromatographically resolved from the α-subunits (24Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (23Nanoff C. Waldhoer M. Roka F. Freissmuth M. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Membranes (∼50 μg of protein) prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the A1/Gαi-1 or the A1/Gαo tandem were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with a Gαi-1 specific antiserum (I1C, raised against the residues 160–169 of Gαi-1, see Ref.25Selzer E. Wilfing A. Schiferer A. Hermann M. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Freissmuth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and with Gαo-specific antisera (ON1, OC2 raised against the amino-terminal 16 and the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of Gαo, respectively, see Ref. 26Georgoussi Z. Carr C. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 62-69PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoreactive bands on nitrocellulose blots were detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (Amersham Life Science; Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Binding of the agonist radioligand [125I]HPIA and of the antagonist radioligand [3H]DPCPX to membranes expressing the human A1-adenosine receptor and the human A1-adenosine receptor-G protein fusion tandems were carried out as follows: membranes (150–300 μg) were resuspended in 600 μl containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 8 μg/ml adenosine deaminase. The reaction was initiated by adding 900 μl of prewarmed buffer containing the indicated concentrations of [125I]HPIA or [3H]DPCPX; an aliquot of this total binding reaction was immediately withdrawn and 1 μmCPA was added to determine nonspecific binding which was typically less than 10% of total binding at 1 nm of either radioligand. Aliquots (50 μl) were withdrawn from the binding reaction at the time points indicated and immediately filtered over glass fiber filters. At 30–60 min (as indicated), the incubation was split into 2 aliquots that received buffer or 1 μm CPA to initiate the dissociation of bound [125I]HPIA or of bound [3H]DPCPX. Saturation binding experiments were done in an analogous manner using 7 logarithmically spaced concentrations of radioligand covering the range of 0.1–15 nm. The kinetics of [125I]HPIA association and dissociation were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares curve fitting using either single exponential or double exponential equations. An F-test based on the extra sum of squares principle was carried out to determine whether the more complex (double exponential) model produced a better fit than the simpler (single exponential) model. If not indicated otherwise, the experiments were carried out at 25 °C. In order to assess the energy requirements of ternary complex formation, the association and dissociation of [125I]HPIA binding was determined at different temperatures (10–30 °C) and the calculated rate constants were used to generate Arrhenius plots. The resulting plots were fitted by linear regression to calculate the slopes. The activation energies were calculated from the linearized version of the Arrhenius equation: ln k = A +E a/RT, where ln k denotes the natural logarithm of the rate constant, R the gas constant = 8.314 kJ/mol, A the pre-exponential term, and E a the activation energy. Time course experiments at the different temperatures were carried out for the following incubation periods: 3 h (10 °C), 2.5 h (15 °C), 2 h (20 °C), 1.5 h (25 °C), and 1 h (30 °C). Experiments were carried out with membranes prepared from stably and transiently transfected cells; when directly compared, there was no appreciable difference between the rate constants observed. Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. The adenine nucleotide pool was metabolically labeled by incubating confluent cells in 6-well plates for 18 h with [3H]adenine (2 μCi/well). Subsequently, the medium was replaced and the cells were preincubated for 1 h with 100 μm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO201724 and adenosine deaminase (1 unit/ml). The accumulation of cAMP was stimulated by the addition of 25 μm forskolin and receptor-dependent inhibition was elicited in the presence of CPA (0.1–10 nm). After 3 min, the incubation was terminated by the addition of 2.5% perchloric acid; [3H]cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography on Dowex AG 50W-X4 and neutral alumina (27Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 32-41Google Scholar). Each experiment reported was carried out at least three times. High affinity agonist binding to G protein-coupled receptors depends on the formation of a ternary complex HRG between agonist (H), receptor (R), and G protein (G) (1Hepler J. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Ternary complex formation can therefore be followed by measuring the apparent association rate of a high affinity agonist radioligand. Rate constants that are observed are in the order of ≤106m−1 s−1 (see also TableI) and the process is therefore too slow to be accounted for by a simple diffusion controlled mechanism. One possible rate-limiting step in HRG formation is the interaction of the activated receptor and its cognate G protein(s). We have therefore tested if ternary complex formation can be accelerated by raising the concentration of G proteins in the membrane. The A1-adenosine receptor is coupled to the pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins of the Gi/Go group (10Freissmuth M. Schütz W. Linder M.E. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human A1-adenosine receptor were treated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 24 h) to fully inactivate the endogenous G proteins (see Fig. 6 A). Membranes prepared from these cells were incubated with 10 nm (● in Fig.1) or 50 nm (○ in Fig. 1) rGαi-1 and a 4-fold molar excess of purified brain βγ-dimers to reconstitute high affinity agonist binding. It is evident from Fig. 1 A that the increase in the concentration of the heterotrimer did not result in any appreciable change in the association rate. In contrast, an increase in the concentration of the radioligand augments the apparent association rate (Fig.1 B).Table IAssociation and dissociation rate constants for binding of [125I]HPIA to the A1-adenosine receptor and fusion proteins comprising the receptor and the indicated G protein α-subunitskappkoffkonmin−1m−1s−1A10.043 ± 0.0060.020 ± 0.0044.77 × 105A1/Gα00.048 ± 0.0020.018 ± 0.0024.95 × 105A1/Gαi–10.057 ± 0.0090.021 ± 0.0045.97 × 105A1/Gαi–1C351G0.124 ± 0.0270.107 ± 0.0274.49 × 105The apparent (pseudo-first order) association rate (k app) and the dissociation rate (k off) were derived from experiments carried out as outlined in the legends to Figs. 4 and 8; the incubation temperature was 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab Figure 1Panel A, association of the agonist radioligand [125I]HPIA to the human A1-adenosine receptor reconstituted with 10 nm(●) or 50 nm (○) rGαi-1. Membranes (∼10 μg of protein) prepared from pertussis toxin-treated cells expressing the human A1-adenosine receptor were preincubated with 10 nm (●) or 50 nm (○) rGαi-1which had been combined with a 4-fold molar excess of purified brain βγ-dimer in the presence of 10 mm CHAPS. The binding reaction was started by adding buffer prewarmed to 25 °C and containing [125I]HPIA (0.5 nm final concentration) yielding a final CHAPS concentration of 2.5 mm. Aliquots were withdrawn at the time points indicated and immediately filtered over glass fiber filters. Data are expressed as percent of the respective B eq values which were 68 ± 9 fmol/mg for 10 nm and 146 ± 23 fmol/mg for 50 nm rGαi-1. Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 1 μm CPA did not change over the time course of the assay and amounted to less than 10% of the total binding seen with 10 nm rGαi-1.k app was estimated to be 0.0243 ± 0.004 min−1 for 10 nm and 0.0271 ± 0.003 min−1 for 50 nm Gαi-1, respectively. Panel B, concentration-dependent increase in the apparent association rate constantk app of [125I]HPIA. The apparent association rate constant was determined at the indicated concentrations of [125I]HPIA; the binding reaction was carried out with membranes from HEK293 cells expressing the A1-adenosine receptor. Assay conditions were as described for panel A. The pseudo-first order rates were calculated by nonlinear least squares curve fitting and the linear regression of the secondary plot was calculated. The y intercept yielding an estimate of k off was 0.02 min−1;k on estimated from the slope of the regression line was 4.2 × 105m−1s−1. The dotted lines indicate the 95% confidence interval.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The apparent (pseudo-first order) association rate (k app) and the dissociation rate (k off) were derived from experiments carried out as outlined in the legends to Figs. 4 and 8; the incubation temperature was 25 °C. The experimental data points were fitted to monoexponential equations or to equations describing the sum of two exponential processes; the latter models did not improve the fit significantly (p > 0.05 in all instances, F-test). The association rate constant (k on) was calculated from the relation: k on = (k app −k off)/L, where L denotes the radioligand concentration (0.92–1.1 nm). Data are means ± S.E. of three to six experiments carried out in duplicate. The interaction between receptor and G protein is essentially confined to a two-dimensional plane, i.e. the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, that is limited by the size of the vesicle. Because G proteins cannot be inserted into an individual vesicle to arbitrarily high levels, the variation in the concentration of G proteins that can be achieved in the vicinity of the receptor is presumably modest. As an alternative, the diffusion step, in which the activated receptor collides with the appropriate G protein, can be eliminated by fusing the receptor directly to the G protein α-subunit. We have verified that fusion proteins consisting of the A1-adenosine receptor and of the Gα subunits were expressed by immunodetecting the A1/Gαi-1 and the A1/Gαo construct with appropriate antisera (Fig. 2 A). Diffuse bands in the 70–80-kDa range were observed in the lanes which contained membrane proteins of cells transfected with the plasmids encoding the fusion proteins. These were absent in untransfected cells or in cells expressing the A1-adenosine receptor. The apparent molecular mass of the purified A1-adenosine receptor is ∼35 kDa (28Nakata H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 671-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while that of Gαi-1 and of Gαo are 39 and 41 kDa, respectively. Thus, the size of the immunoreactive material is consistent with the expected molecular mass of the fusion proteins; the broad staining pattern presumably arises from microheterogeneity due to glycosylation of the receptor moiety in the fusion protein rather than from partial proteolysis. We have employed the antisera ON1 and OC2 which are directed against the amino and carboxyl terminus of Gαo, respectively (26Georgoussi Z. Carr C. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 62-69PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining with these two antisera visualized a predominant band in the range of 70–80 kDa; in addition, antiserum ON1 detected a band at about 50 kDa (lane 1, Fig. 2 B). This band was not seen in cells lacking the fusion protein (lane 2, Fig.2 B) and in the immunoblot with antiserum OC2 (lane 3 in Fig. 2 B). Because this band retains the amino-terminal epitope, it may result from proteolysis within the Gαo moiety of the fusion protein. It is, however, evident that this cleavage product represents only a very minor fraction of the total immunoreactivity. We therefore conclude that the bulk of the fusion proteins comprise an intact G protein moiety. Saturation binding experiments with the antagonist radioligand [3H]DPCPX revealed that the fusion proteins A1/Gαi-1and A1/Gαo were stably expressed up to levels of ∼5 and 10 pmol/mg, respectively. Because HEK293 cells do not express detectable levels of Gαo, we subsequently present data on the comparison of the fusion protein A1/Gαi-1 with the wild-type receptor (which interacts with the Gαi complement endogenous to HEK 293 cells). We stress, however, that the ligand binding kinetics of the fusion protein A1/Gαo were essentially identical to that of A1/Gαi-1 (data not shown; see also Table I). The association (Fig. 3 A) and dissociation kinetics (Fig. 3 B) of the antagonist [3H]DPCPX were found to be virtually identical in binding assays that were carried out in parallel with membranes carrying the unfused A1-adenosine receptor (○ in Fig. 3, Aand B) and those containing the fusion protein A1/Gαi-1 (● in Fig. 3, A andB). For the A1-adenosine receptor, the apparent (pseudo-first order) association and the dissociation rates were calculated as 0.23 ± 0.05 min−1 and 0.14 ± 0.06 min−1, respectively; the corresponding values for the fusion protein A1/Gαi-1 werek app = 0.37 ± 0.08 min−1 andk off = 0.16 ± 0.05 min−1. The kinetically derived estimates for the dissociation constantK D were 1.5 and 0.76 nm for the A1-adenosine receptor and for A1/Gαi-1, respectively. The capacity of the A1/Gαi-1 tandem to impinge on an effector was investigated by assessing the inhibitory regulation of adenylyl cyclase. It is evident from the data shown in Fig. 3 C that inhibition of forskolin-induced [3H]cAMP formation was observed over a reasonably comparable concentration range of the A1-receptor agonist CPA in cells expressing the A1-adenosine receptor (○ in Fig. 3 C) and in cells expressing the fusion protein A1/Gαi-1(● in Fig. 3 C). Half-maximum inhibition was observed at 0.3 ± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.1 nm CPA for the A1-adenosine receptor and A1/Gαi-1, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that the A1/Gαi-1 fusion protein is expressed as a functional receptor capable of regulating its typical second messenger pathway. Given the close proximity of receptor and G protein in the A1/Gαi-1 fusion protein, a more rapid association rate of [125I]HPIA was to be expected, if the association of receptor and G protein were the rate-limiting step in the formation of the ternary complex. The experiments summarized in Fig. 4 and Table I show that this was not the case; the apparent (pseudo-first order) association (k app) and dissociation (k off) rates of the agonist [125I]HPIA on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the human A1-adenosine receptor (○ in Fig. 4) or the A1/Gαi-1 fusion protein (● in Fig.4) were comparable; accordingly the calculated association rate constants k on were similar within the experimental error (Table I). We have, furthermore, ruled out that the energy requirements for formation (or break-up) of the ternary complex differed between the native A1-adenosine receptor and"

Unexpectedly, applications of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB to cultured and isolated CA1 hippocampal neurons depressed NMDA-evoked currents. The PDGF-induced depression was blocked by a PDGF-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, by a selective inhibitor of phospholipase C-γ, and by blocking the intracellular release of Ca2+. Inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) also eliminated the PDGF-induced depression, whereas a phosphodiesterase inhibitor enhanced it. The NMDA receptor-mediated component of excitatory synaptic currents was also inhibited by PDGF, and this inhibition was prevented by co-application of a PKA inhibitor. Src inhibitors also prevented this depression. In recordings from inside-out patches, the catalytic fragment of PKA did not itself alter NMDA single channel activity, but it blocked the up-regulation of these channels by a Src activator peptide.

These receptors are expressed in the hippocampus, and their activation regulates both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid (2Valenzuela C.F. Kazlauskas A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation. Phosphotyrosyl residues of the receptor can then bind a variety of signal transduction molecules via their Src homology 2 domains. These include phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases including c-Src, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SYP-2, Ras-GTPase-activating protein, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, as well as the adaptor molecules Grb2, Nck, and Shc (5Claesson-Welsh L.

Activation of PDGF-R can therefore signal through various parallel pathways to cell growth and motility. However, recent studies have suggested that these parallel pathways can signal both stimulatory and inhibitory signals (8Heldin C.H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar activation of the MAPK cascade and mitogenesis has also been reported for G-protein-coupled receptors (9Gutkind J.S. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and we recently reported that several G-protein-coupled receptors act through a sequential activation of PKC and c-Src to up-regulate the activity ofN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (1Lu W.-Y. Xiong Z.-G. Lei S. Orser B.A. Dudek E. Browning M.D. MacDonald J.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This subtype of glutamate receptor is an ion channel that contributes to excitatory synaptic transmission, to plasticity, and to cell growth of central neurons (10Nakanishi S. Masu M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, we also demonstrated that PDGF induces a long term depression of synaptically evoked NMDA receptor-mediated currents at CA1 synapses as well as of NMDA-evoked currents recorded in cultured hippocampal neurons (3Valenzuela C.F. Xiong Z. MacDonald J.F. Weiner J.L. Frazier C.J. Dunwiddie T.V. Kazlauskas A. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16151-16159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The PDGF-R-mediated depression of NMDA channels requires activation of the PLC-γ pathway as a tyrosine site (Tyr1021) add-back mutant of the PDGF-β receptor restores this function when receptors are co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes (3Valenzuela C.F. Xiong Z. MacDonald J.F. Weiner J.L. Frazier C.J. Dunwiddie T.V. Kazlauskas A. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16151-16159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PLC-γ catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to two potent second messengers: diacylglycerol, which activates various isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), and inositol triphosphate, which releases intracellular Ca2+ (11Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore PDGF-R might be anticipated to activate the PKC/Src signaling cascade in CA1 pyramidal hippocampal neurons responsible for up-regulation of NMDA channel activity. Instead, we show here that the PDGF-R signaling is mediated through a second but functionally opposing pathway. This pathway signals a Ca2+- and PKA-dependent inhibition of the Src regulation of NMDA channels. CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons were acutely isolated using modified procedures of Wang and MacDonald (12Wang L.Y. MacDonald J.F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 486: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, Wistar rats 2–3 weeks old were decapitated via a guillotine after halothane anesthesia. Hippocampi were removed quickly and placed in a dish containing cold oxygenated external solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, 33 mm glucose, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.0003 mm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.4 (osmolarity, 320–335 mosmol liter−1). The hippocampi were cut into 300–500-μm-thick slices by hand with a razor blade. The hippocampal slices were digested at room temperature (20–22 °C) in the external solution with 5 mg/ml papaya latex (Sigma). The incubation medium was stirred with 95% O2/5% CO2. After 30 min of enzymatic digestion, the slices were rinsed three times with the external solution. The slices were kept in the external solution bubbled with oxygen and used for 8–10 h. The CA1 region was cut out with a scalpel under a phase contrast microscope and triturated with a fire-polished glass pipette. Whole cell recordings were performed with an Axopatch-1B amplifier (Axon Instruments) under voltage-clamp mode. Recording electrodes, with resistance of 3–5 MΩ were constructed from thin walled borosilicate glass (1.5-mm-diameter; World Precision Instruments) using a two-stage puller (PP83, Narishige). Data were digitized, filtered (2 kHz), and acquired on-line using the programs pClamp (Axon Instruments). The standard internal solution for recording electrode consisted of the following 140 mm CsF, 35 mm CsOH, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm tetraethylammonium, 4 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.3 (osmolarity, 300 mosmol liter−1). A multibarrel fast perfusion system (13Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar) was employed to achieve a rapid exchange of solution. NMDA (50 μm) and glycine (3 μm) in the external solution were applied to the neurons via one barrel for 2 s to evoke NMDA-mediated currents. Isolated hippocampal neurons were first patch clamped and then lifted into the outflow of the control barrel. The distance between the outlet of the barrel and the neuron was within 100 μm. The holding potential was −60 mV. PDGF and other drugs were diluted in the external solution to the required concentrations and applied to the neurons via the control barrel unless otherwise stated. Some hydrophobic drugs were initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted to the desired concentration in the external solution. The final concentration of Me2SO applied to the cells was less than 0.1%, and this concentration of Me2SO did not affect NMDA currents. Cultures of fetal hippocampal neurons were used for electrophysiological recordings 12–17 days after plating. Spontaneous miniature mEPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons were recorded after formation of the whole cell patch configuration. The bathing solution was supplemented with 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin, 1 μm strychnine, 10 μm bicuculline methiodide, and 3 μm glycine. Miniature EPSCs were filtered at 2 kHz and stored on tape prior to their off-line acquisition with an event detection program (SCAN, Strathclyde software; courtesy of Dr. J. Dempster). For detection, the trigger level was set approximately three times higher than the base-line noise. False events were eliminated by subsequent inspection of the raw data. Inside-out single channel recordings were carried out on cultured mouse hippocampal neurons (14MacDonald J.F. Mody I. Salter M.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1989; 414: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). After coating with Sylgard the electrodes were fire-polished and filled with the standard external solution containing NMDA (10 μm) and glycine (3 μm). The intracellular solution for bathing the cytoplasmic face of the patch contained 120 mm CsCl, 35 mm CsOH, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 2 mm tetraethylammonium, 4 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.3 (osmolarity, 300 mosmol liter−1). The intracellular solution was supplemented as required with EPQ(pY)EEIPIA, EPQYEEIPIA, or the catalytic subunit of PKA (cPKA) just before use. During recording, the holding potential of the pipette was +60 mV. Single channel events were recorded on videotape using a digital data recorder (VR-10, Instrutech Corp., Mineola, NY) and later played back and acquired using the pClamp 6 program (Axon Instruments). Single channel currents were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated in 6 μm fura-2-acetoxy-methyl ester dissolved in Me2SO with pluronic acid in minimal essential for 30–40 min at room temperature. Coverslips with fura-2-loaded cells were transferred to a perfusion chamber on an inverted microscope. Cells were illuminated using a xenon lamp and were observed using a 40× UV fluor oil immersion objective on an inverted microscope (Nikon). Video images were obtained using an intensified CCD camera (PTI IC-100). Digitized images were acquired by averaging four frames at video rates using an image processing board (Axon Imagine Lightening) in a computer controlled by Axon Imaging Workbench software (Axon Instruments). The shutter and filter wheels also were controlled by Axon Imaging Workbench software to allow timed illumination of cells at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths. Ratio images were analyzed by averaging pixel ratio values in circumscribed regions of all responding cells in the field of view. The values were exported from Axon Imaging Workbench software to a spreadsheet program (Sigmaplot or Graphpad). PDGF-BB provided by Synergen (Boulder, CO) was stored in 10 mm acetic acid plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin at −20 °C as a stock solution and diluted 1:1250 in the external solution immediately before use.

Recordings from matched cells that did not received PDGF demonstrated stable peak responses to NMDA over the same period of recording (Fig. 1). In all subsequent whole cell recordings we examined the effects of agents onI p. We first examined whether the tyrosine kinase activity of PDGF receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons was required for the depression ofI p by employing the novel and specific PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Win41662. This inhibitor suppresses the PDGF-stimulated autophosphorylation of PDGF receptors and the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization induced by PDGF, as well as the cell proliferation by PDGF in human vascular smooth muscle cells (15Sawutz D.G. Bode D.C. Briggs G.M. Reid J.R. Canniff P. Caldwell L. Faltynek C.R. Miller D. Dunn J.A. de Garavilla L. Guiles J.W. Weigelt C. Michne W. Treasurywala A.M. Silver P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is also approximately 500-fold more potent in inhibiting PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity than that of other tyrosine kinases (15Sawutz D.G. Bode D.C. Briggs G.M. Reid J.R. Canniff P. Caldwell L. Faltynek C.R. Miller D. Dunn J.A. de Garavilla L. Guiles J.W. Weigelt C. Michne W. Treasurywala A.M. Silver P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Application of Win41662 did not itself alter NMDA-activated currents, but it completely blocked the PDGF-induced depression ofI p (Fig.2 A). Therefore, PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity is required for expression of the PDGF response. In the PDGFα receptor tyrosine 1021 is the minimal site required for PLC-γ activation. Previously we demonstrated that this is also the minimal site required for the PDGF-induced depression of NMDA responses in Xenopusoocytes. However, it is not known whether PLC-γ is required for the PDGF-mediated depression of NMDA-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons. Therefore, we employed a specific PLC-γ inhibitor U73122. An inactive analogue U73343 was used as a control. We pretreated the cells with U73122 (10 μm) or U73343 (10 μm) for 15 min and included the same concentration of the appropriate compound in the patch pipettes to prevent recovery of PLC-γ activity during the recording period. Treatment of the cells with the inactive analogue U73343 had no effect on the PDGF-induced depression of NMDA-evoked currents. However, the effect of PDGF on I p was completely blocked by U73122 (p < 0.01, two-way analysis of variance; Fig. 2 B). This result provides strong evidence that PLC-γ is indeed required for the PDGF-mediated depression of peak NMDA-activated currents in these neurons. Activation of PLC-γ increases the production of IP3, which induces intracellular Ca2+ release in many cells. Therefore, we measured relative changes in intracellular Ca2+ in cultured hippocampal neurons using fura-2 ratiometric imaging during applications of PDGF. Absolute values of intracellular Ca2+were not measured. Bath applications of PDGF significantly increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations within 30 s of applying this growth factor (Fig. 3). The potential source of this Ca2+ signal was then examined. Heparin selectively inhibits the IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. For example it completely blocked the Ca2+ release induced following flash photolysis of caged IP3, and it blocked the intracellular Ca2+ signal recorded after exposure to PDGF or fibroblast growth factor (16Mathias R.S. Mikoshiba K. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Ives H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1456-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We anticipated that the PDGF-induced depression of NMDA-evoked currents would be blocked by heparin if an IP3-dependent release of Ca2+released were responsible for this effect. Inclusion of heparin (400 μm) in the patch pipette did not alter NMDA-evoked currents on its own, but the inhibitory effect of PDGF was eliminated (Fig. 3 C). Unexpectedly, in the presence of heparin applications of PDFG increased I p by 14.6 ± 1.9% (n = 17, p < 0.05, Student'st test). This suggests that PDGF-induced potentiation of peak NMDA-evoked currents is masked by the prominent Ca2+-dependent depression. Next we considered the potential target of the elevated intracellular Ca2+. This lead us to consider the possibility of a Ca2+-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase together with a subsequent activation of PKA as a basis of the depressant response to PDGF. We considered this pathway for a number of reasons. For example, several Ca2+-dependent adenylyl cyclases (I and VIII) are present in hippocampal neurons (17Cooper D.M. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and levels of cAMP can be increased in hippocampal neurons through a Ca2+-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase (18Chetkovich D.M.

A. 1991; 88: 6467-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal cells the activity of PKA is stimulated by PDGF (20Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Sidhu J.S. Argast G.M. Raines E.W.

This inhibitor had no effect upon the amplitude of peak currents in the absence of PDGF (Fig.4). These results suggest that activation of PKA is required for the PDGF-induced depression. To examine the potential role of PKA further, we examined the effects of the bath application of the selective PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS. This inhibitor also failed to alterI p, but it did completely block the PDGF-induced depression (Fig. 4). We then examined the effects of IBMX a potent membrane-permeable phosphodiesterase inhibitor on the PDGF-induced depression of I p. We anticipated that this phosphodiesterase inhibitor should enhance any potential PDGF-stimulated cAMP-mediated signal. Bath applications of IBMX significantly enhanced the PDGF-induced depression of NMDA currents (48.37 ± 2.58%, n = 9, for IBMX plus PDGFversus 29.2 ± 3.66%, n = 9, for PDGF alone; p < 0.01 by Student's t test; Fig.4). These results strongly support the conclusion that the PDGF-induced depression requires activation of PKA but also demonstrate that PKA does not itself regulate the amplitude of peak NMDA-evoked currents, a result consistent with previous observations (28Greengard P. Jen J. Nairn A.C. Stevens C.F. Science. 1991; 253: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We next considered the possibility that the PDGF-induced depression masked a PKC-dependent potentiation of I p. If this were the case we would anticipate that blockers of PKC might appear to enhance the PDGF-induced depression, whereas activators of PKC would reduce the depression. We tested"

However, the mechanisms that direct susceptibility and resistance to C. albicansinfection are as yet unclear, and current extensive research concernsC. albicans molecules interacting with the host immune system.

This glycolipid has been named a phospholipomannan (PLM) on the basis of its composition (17Trinel P.A. Borg-von-Zepelin M. Lepage G. Jouault T. Mackenzie D. Poulain D. Infect.

Immunology. 1994; 83: 268-273PubMed Google Scholar). When C. albicanscomes into contact with macrophages, large amounts of PLM are rapidly shed by C. albicans, which trigger intense signaling and secretory responses from these target cells (19Jouault T.

To date, homopolymers of β-1,2-linked mannose have been chemically characterized only in imperfect yeasts of the genus Candida (related to Ascomycetes). They are associated to side chains of the cell wall phosphopeptidomannan ofC. albicans and C. tropicalis through phosphodiester bridges (7Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahashi M. Ito N. Ohkubo Y.

The construction of neoglycolipids with phosphopeptidomannan-released β-1,2-oligomannosides has demonstrated that they can act as epitopes for a large number of anti-C. albicans phosphopeptidomannan monoclonal antibodies (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect.

Two anti-β-1,2-oligomannosides monoclonal antibodies have been described as protective against experimental C. albicans infection. The first one, reacting with a β-1,2-linked mannotriose, protected mice in a systemic model of candidosis (12Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Cutler J.E. Infect.

When we analyzed C. albicans molecules expressing β-1,2-oligomannosidic epitopes, we observed that all polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for these residues bound to a 14–18-kDa antigen that did not display accessible α-linked mannose residues (16Trinel P.A.

Immun. 1993; 61: 4398-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is expressed only in C. albicans andC. tropicalis, which are the most pathogenicCandida species (25Cantelli C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Jouault T. Polonelli L. Poulain D. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PLM is synthesized by C. albicans including under growth conditions that prevent association of β-1,2-linked oligomannosides to phosphopeptidomannan (30Trinel P. Cantelli C. Bernigaud A. Jouault T. Poulain D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have shown that C. albicans, in contact with macrophages, shed large amounts of PLM, which triggers an intense phosphotyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway and the secretion of TNF-α (19Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The synthesis of surface glycolipids that protect from host defenses and/or disturb host cell immune functions is recognized as a pathogenic characteristic of eukaryotic protozoa of the genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma(20Schofield L. Tachado S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and of prokaryotes of the genus Mycobacteria(21Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Abrams J.S. Lu S. Wang E.

Immun. 1997; 65: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we analyzed PLM to obtain chemical evidence for the presence of β-1,2-oligomannosides and to assess the possible structural relationships with surface glycolipids of these other microbial pathogens. Like these glycolipids, the C. albicansPLM was metabolically labeled by [3H]mannose and [3H]inositol, and both labeling profiles were superimposed in a family of hydrophilic glycolipids with β-1,2-oligomannosidic epitopes. The physicochemical analysis of the PLM sugar moiety confirmed the presence of mannose and inositol and evidenced the absence of glucosamine. The absence of this residue is consistent with the PLM resistance to nitrous acid treatment (29Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1993: 349-384Google Scholar) and its unlabeling with [3H]glucosamine (unpublished data). Glucosamine linking inositol to the sugar moiety is a common feature of GPI and GPI-related glycolipids (39McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) of eukaryotic cells. Its absence has only been reported to date in lipoarabinomannan, a GPI-like structure from prokaryotes of the genus Mycobacteria. Another peculiarity of PLM lies in the exclusive presence of β-1,2-linked mannose residues in its sugar moiety, which were found to be organized in linear chains with degrees of polymerization ranging from 8 to 18. Confirmation of the probable presence of a Man-1-phosphate linkage in the molecule, as deduced from NMR spectrum, will require further studies.The average mass of PLM may be estimated, from the present study, to be about 4 kDa. This mass is different from the former description of the PLM as corresponding to a C. albicans 14–18-kDa antigen in Western blotting (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using more reticulated gels (7–20% acrylamide) and migration conditions favoring the progressive blockage of the molecules in the gel rather than their migration speed, we observed that the PLM relative molecular mass upon SDS-PAGE decreased to 7 kDa (data not shown).In Fig. 7 we suggest a structural model for the PLM glycan moiety, based on the first chemical evidence for the presence of β-1,2-linked oligomannosides in a glycoconjugate other than the yeast phosphopeptidomannan. Very little is known about β-1,2-mannosyltransferases of C. albicans, their activation and substrate specificity, but the presence of such linear chains of up to 18 mannose residues represent quite unusual structures (24Trinel P.A. Lepage G. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a consequence of coating parasite surfaces with long sugar chains is the triggering of host effector mechanisms at a distance too great for efficient antimicrobial activity on the parasite. The recent demonstration for the presence of PLM at the C. albicans cell wall surface (19Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggests that these mechanisms may play a role during host-C. albicansinteraction. Moreover, β-1,2-oligomannosides have been shown to act as C. albicans adhesins for the macrophage membrane (15Fradin C. Jouault T. Mallet A. Mallet J. Camus D. Sinaÿ P. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and to stimulate macrophages to produce high levels of TNF-α (13Jouault T. Lepage G. Bernigaud A. Trinel P.A. Fradin C. Wieruszeski J.M. Strecker G. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2378-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jouault T. Bernigaud A. Lepage G. Trinel P. Poulain D. Immunology. 1994; 83: 268-273PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulating activity of β-1,2-oligomannosides was found to depend on the length of the mannosyl chain and maximum activity was observed for DPs of 8 or higher (13Jouault T. Lepage G. Bernigaud A. Trinel P.A. Fradin C. Wieruszeski J.M. Strecker G. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2378-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these high DPs are present mainly in the C. albicans PLM but correspond to minor components among the β-1,2-oligomannosides released from the mannan of the same species (24Trinel P.A. Lepage G. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have shown that the pathogenic yeast C. albicans synthesizes inositol-labeled glycolipids that have glycan moieties devoid of glucosamine. These C. albicansglycolipids are thus structurally more similar to lipoarabinomannans ofMycobacteria than to the glycosylinositolphospholipids of parasitic protozoa or the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania. Recently, as well as being B cell antigens, mannose sequences of lipoarabinomannan have been implicated in the presentation to T cells by CD1b nonclassical major histocompatibility complex molecules (40Prigozy T.I.

Whether or not this property is shared by C. albicans PLM remains to be investigated. An important PLM structural peculiarity lies in the presence of long chains of β-1,2-linked mannose residues. There is now considerable experimental evidence that these sugar residues are involved in virulence and immunomodulation and can elicit protective antibody responses. Therefore, PLMs are molecules that must be considered for a comprehensive analysis of host-C. albicans relationships. A complete elucidation of their structure and biosynthetic pathways will be necessary to provide a structural basis for understanding their immunochemical properties and some aspects of the pathogenesis of C. albicans infections. The yeast Candida albicans is a normal component of the human endogenous microflora, but it can cause frequent and severe disseminated infections among hospitalized patients (1Pfaller M.A. Jones R.N. Messer S.A. Edmond M.B. Wenzel R.P. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1998; 31: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Basic progress has been made in the elucidation of C. albicanscharacteristics linked to switching (2Soll D.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), dimorphism (3Leberer E. Ziegelbauer K. Schmidt A. Harcus D. Dignard D. Ash J. Johnson L. Thomas D.Y. Curr.

However, the mechanisms that direct susceptibility and resistance to C. albicansinfection are as yet unclear, and current extensive research concernsC. albicans molecules interacting with the host immune system. Among these studies, research has gradually focused on β-1,2-linked oligomannosides. Oligomannnosides with this unusual type of linkage were first described by Shibata et al. (7Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahashi M. Ito N. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as associated with the C. albicans cell wall phosphopeptidomannan by phosphodiester bridges. β-1,2-oligomannosides are immunogenic and elicit specific antibodies in animals (8Faille C. Michalski J. Strecker G. Mackenzie D.W. Camus D. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shibata N. Arai M. Haga E. Kikuchi T. Najima M. Satoh T. Kobayashi H.

Chem. 1988; 34: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and humans (11Poulain D. Faille C. Delannoy C. Jacquinot P.M. Trinel P.A. Camus D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-β-1,2-oligomannosides antibodies have been shown to be protective against C. albicans in rodent models of systemic and vaginal candidosis (5De Bernardis F. Boccanera M. Adriani D. Spreghini E. Santoni G. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3399-3405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Cutler J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5354-5357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-1,2-oligomannosides derived from C. albicans phosphopeptidomannan have also been shown to induce TNF1-α synthesis from cells of the macrophage lineage through a phosphotyrosine kinase-dependent pathway (13Jouault T. Lepage G. Bernigaud A. Trinel P.A. Fradin C. Wieruszeski J.M. Strecker G. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2378-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to bind to macrophage cell membranes (14Li R.K. Cutler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18293-18299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fradin C. Jouault T. Mallet A. Mallet J. Camus D. Sinaÿ P. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown by use of specific monoclonal antibodies (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that β-1,2-oligomannosides are present (in the absence of accessible α-linked mannose residues) on a polydispersed low molecular weight antigen and that this antigen is a glycolipid. This glycolipid has been named a phospholipomannan (PLM) on the basis of its composition (17Trinel P.A. Borg-von-Zepelin M. Lepage G. Jouault T. Mackenzie D. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4398-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PLM is a strong TNF-α inducer in vitro and in vivo (18Jouault T. Bernigaud A. Lepage G. Trinel P. Poulain D. Immunology. 1994; 83: 268-273PubMed Google Scholar). When C. albicanscomes into contact with macrophages, large amounts of PLM are rapidly shed by C. albicans, which trigger intense signaling and secretory responses from these target cells (19Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similar signaling events induced in host cells have been described as induced by GPI-related glycolipids from pathogens of the generaLeishmania, Trypanosoma, andMycobacteria (20Schofield L. Tachado S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Abrams J.S. Lu S. Wang E. Yamamura M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. J.

Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have further purified and chemically analyzed the C. albicans PLM to establish the relationship of PLM with these microbiolglycolipids and to provide a structural basis for the understanding of the immunochemical and immunomodulatory properties of PLM. DISCUSSIONUnlike α-mannosides, which are widely expressed on glycoconjugates, the rarity of β-mannosides may be explained by a less favorable stereochemistry. To date, homopolymers of β-1,2-linked mannose have been chemically characterized only in imperfect yeasts of the genus Candida (related to Ascomycetes). They are associated to side chains of the cell wall phosphopeptidomannan ofC. albicans and C. tropicalis through phosphodiester bridges (7Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahashi M. Ito N. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi H. Matsuda K. Ikeda T. Suzuki M. Takahashi S.H. Suzuki A. Shibata N. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 615-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMR analysis of these residues released from C. albicans phosphopeptidomannan by mild acid hydrolysis has also shown changes in their ratios and degrees of polymerization, depending on the strains (7Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahashi M. Ito N. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi H. Matsuda K. Ikeda T. Suzuki M. Takahashi S.H. Suzuki A. Shibata N. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 615-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cell form (32Shibata N. Kobayashi H. Tojo M. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem.

These molecules have been shown to elicit specific antibodies in mice (36Cassone A. Torosantucci A. Boccanera M. Pellegrini G., C., P. Malvasi F. J. Med. Microbiol. 1988; 27: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), rats (37Hopwood V. Poulain D. Fortier B. Evans G. Vernes A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 222-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rabbits (9Shibata N. Arai M. Haga E. Kikuchi T. Najima M. Satoh T. Kobayashi H. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (11Poulain D. Faille C. Delannoy C. Jacquinot P.M. Trinel P.A. Camus D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hernando F. Cailliez J.C. Trinel P.A. Faille C. Mackenzie D. Poulain D. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1993; 31: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The construction of neoglycolipids with phosphopeptidomannan-released β-1,2-oligomannosides has demonstrated that they can act as epitopes for a large number of anti-C. albicans phosphopeptidomannan monoclonal antibodies (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that C. albicans mannoglycoconjugate(s) expressing these residues are strong immunogens. Two anti-β-1,2-oligomannosides monoclonal antibodies have been described as protective against experimental C. albicans infection. The first one, reacting with a β-1,2-linked mannotriose, protected mice in a systemic model of candidosis (12Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Cutler J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5354-5357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second one protected rats in a model of vaginal infection (5De Bernardis F. Boccanera M. Adriani D. Spreghini E. Santoni G. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3399-3405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we analyzed C. albicans molecules expressing β-1,2-oligomannosidic epitopes, we observed that all polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for these residues bound to a 14–18-kDa antigen that did not display accessible α-linked mannose residues (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antigen, named phopholipomannan (17Trinel P.A. Borg-von-Zepelin M. Lepage G.

To date, homopolymers of β-1,2-linked mannose have been chemically characterized only in imperfect yeasts of the genus Candida (related to Ascomycetes). They are associated to side chains of the cell wall phosphopeptidomannan ofC. albicans and C. tropicalis through phosphodiester bridges (7Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahashi M. Ito N. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi H. Matsuda K. Ikeda T. Suzuki M. Takahashi S.H. Suzuki A. Shibata N. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 615-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMR analysis of these residues released from C. albicans phosphopeptidomannan by mild acid hydrolysis has also shown changes in their ratios and degrees of polymerization, depending on the strains (7Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahashi M. Ito N. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi H. Matsuda K. Ikeda T. Suzuki M.

In relation to the pathogenic character of C. albicans, several groups have investigated the recognition of β-1,2-oligomannosides by immune systems. These molecules have been shown to elicit specific antibodies in mice (36Cassone A. Torosantucci A. Boccanera M. Pellegrini G., C., P. Malvasi F. J. Med. Microbiol. 1988; 27: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), rats (37Hopwood V. Poulain D. Fortier B. Evans G. Vernes A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 222-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rabbits (9Shibata N. Arai M. Haga E. Kikuchi T. Najima M. Satoh T. Kobayashi H. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (11Poulain D. Faille C. Delannoy C. Jacquinot P.M. Trinel P.A. Camus D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hernando F. Cailliez J.C. Trinel P.A. Faille C. Mackenzie D. Poulain D. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1993; 31: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The construction of neoglycolipids with phosphopeptidomannan-released β-1,2-oligomannosides has demonstrated that they can act as epitopes for a large number of anti-C. albicans phosphopeptidomannan monoclonal antibodies (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that C. albicans mannoglycoconjugate(s) expressing these residues are strong immunogens. Two anti-β-1,2-oligomannosides monoclonal antibodies have been described as protective against experimental C. albicans infection. The first one, reacting with a β-1,2-linked mannotriose, protected mice in a systemic model of candidosis (12Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Cutler J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5354-5357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second one protected rats in a model of vaginal infection (5De Bernardis F. Boccanera M. Adriani D. Spreghini E. Santoni G. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3399-3405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we analyzed C. albicans molecules expressing β-1,2-oligomannosidic epitopes, we observed that all polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for these residues bound to a 14–18-kDa antigen that did not display accessible α-linked mannose residues (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antigen, named phopholipomannan (17Trinel P.A. Borg-von-Zepelin M. Lepage G. Jouault T. Mackenzie D. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4398-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is expressed only in C. albicans andC. tropicalis, which are the most pathogenicCandida species (25Cantelli C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Jouault T. Polonelli L. Poulain D. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PLM is synthesized by C. albicans including under growth conditions that prevent association of β-1,2-linked oligomannosides to phosphopeptidomannan (30Trinel P. Cantelli C. Bernigaud A. Jouault T. Poulain D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have shown that C. albicans, in contact with macrophages, shed large amounts of PLM, which triggers an intense phosphotyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway and the secretion of TNF-α (19Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The synthesis of surface glycolipids that protect from host defenses and/or disturb host cell immune functions is recognized as a pathogenic characteristic of eukaryotic protozoa of the genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma(20Schofield L. Tachado S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and of prokaryotes of the genus Mycobacteria(21Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Abrams J.S. Lu S. Wang E. Yamamura M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dahl K.E. Shiratsuchi H. Hamilton B.D. Ellner J.J. Toossi Z. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 399-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yoshida A. Koide Y. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed PLM to obtain chemical evidence for the presence of β-1,2-oligomannosides and to assess the possible structural relationships with surface glycolipids of these other microbial pathogens. Like these glycolipids, the C. albicansPLM was metabolically labeled by [3H]mannose and [3H]inositol, and both labeling profiles were superimposed in a family of hydrophilic glycolipids with β-1,2-oligomannosidic epitopes. The physicochemical analysis of the PLM sugar moiety confirmed the presence of mannose and inositol and evidenced the absence of glucosamine. The absence of this residue is consistent with the PLM resistance to nitrous acid treatment (29Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1993: 349-384Google Scholar) and its unlabeling with [3H]glucosamine (unpublished data). Glucosamine linking inositol to the sugar moiety is a common feature of GPI and GPI-related glycolipids (39McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) of eukaryotic cells. Its absence has only been reported to date in lipoarabinomannan, a GPI-like structure from prokaryotes of the genus Mycobacteria. Another peculiarity of PLM lies in the exclusive presence of β-1,2-linked mannose residues in its sugar moiety, which were found to be organized in linear chains with degrees of polymerization ranging from 8 to 18. Confirmation of the probable presence of a Man-1-phosphate linkage in the molecule, as deduced from NMR spectrum, will require further studies. The average mass of PLM may be estimated, from the present study, to be about 4 kDa. This mass is different from the former description of the PLM as corresponding to a C. albicans 14–18-kDa antigen in Western blotting (16Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using more reticulated gels (7–20% acrylamide) and migration conditions favoring the progressive blockage of the molecules in the gel rather than their migration speed, we observed that the PLM relative molecular mass upon SDS-PAGE decreased to 7 kDa (data not shown). In Fig. 7 we suggest a structural model for the PLM glycan moiety, based on the first chemical evidence for the presence of β-1,2-linked oligomannosides in a glycoconjugate other than the yeast phosphopeptidomannan. Very little is known about β-1,2-mannosyltransferases of C. albicans, their activation and substrate specificity, but the presence of such linear chains of up to 18 mannose residues represent quite unusual structures (24Trinel P.A. Lepage G. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a consequence of coating parasite surfaces with long sugar chains is the triggering of host effector mechanisms at a distance too great for efficient antimicrobial activity on the parasite. The recent demonstration for the presence of PLM at the C. albicans cell wall surface (19Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggests that these mechanisms may play a role during host-C. albicansinteraction. Moreover, β-1,2-oligomannosides have been shown to act as C. albicans adhesins for the macrophage membrane (15Fradin C. Jouault T. Mallet A. Mallet J. Camus D. Sinaÿ P. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and to stimulate macrophages to produce high levels of TNF-α (13Jouault T. Lepage G. Bernigaud A. Trinel P.A. Fradin C. Wieruszeski J.M. Strecker G. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2378-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jouault T. Bernigaud A. Lepage G. Trinel P. Poulain D. Immunology. 1994; 83: 268-273PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulating activity of β-1,2-oligomannosides was found to depend on the length of the mannosyl chain and maximum activity was observed for DPs of 8 or higher (13Jouault T. Lepage G. Bernigaud A. Trinel P.A. Fradin C. Wieruszeski J.M. Strecker G. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2378-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these high DPs are present mainly in the C. albicans PLM but correspond to minor components among the β-1,2-oligomannosides released from the mannan of the same species (24Trinel P.A. Lepage G. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that the pathogenic yeast C. albicans synthesizes inositol-labeled glycolipids that have glycan moieties devoid of glucosamine. These C. albicansglycolipids are thus structurally more similar to lipoarabinomannans ofMycobacteria than to the glycosylinositolphospholipids of parasitic protozoa or the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania. Recently, as well as being B cell antigens, mannose sequences of lipoarabinomannan have been implicated in the presentation to T cells by CD1b nonclassical major histocompatibility complex molecules (40Prigozy T.I. Seiling P.A. Clemens D. Stewart P.L. Behar S.M. Porcelli S.A. Brenner M.B. Modlin R.L. Kronenberg M. Immunity. 1997; 6: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Whether or not this property is shared by C. albicans PLM remains to be investigated. An important PLM structural peculiarity lies in the presence of long chains of β-1,2-linked mannose residues. There is now considerable experimental evidence that these sugar residues are involved in virulence and immunomodulation and can elicit protective antibody responses. Therefore, PLMs are molecules that must be considered for a comprehensive analysis of host-C. albicans relationships. A complete elucidation of their structure and biosynthetic pathways will be necessary to provide a structural basis for understanding their immunochemical properties and some aspects of the pathogenesis of C. albicans infections.

Here we have identified a heparin-binding region in the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg and have studied its involvement in megalin binding. Rat thyroid extracts, obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation, were separated by column fractionation into four Tg polypeptides, with apparent masses of 660, 330, 210, and 50 kDa. As assessed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays and ligand blot binding assays, megalin bound to intact Tg (660 and 330 kDa) and, to a even greater extent, to the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide. Furthermore, the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide inhibited megalin binding to intact Tg by ∼70%. Solid phase assays showed binding of biotin-labeled heparin to intact Tg and to the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide. We characterized the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis and found that it corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg. We developed a synthetic peptide corresponding to a 15-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg (Arg689–Lys703), containing a heparin-binding consensus sequence (SRRLKRP) and demonstrated heparin binding to this peptide. A rabbit antibody raised against the peptide recognized intact Tg in its native conformation and under denaturing conditions. This antibody markedly reduced heparin-binding to intact Tg, indicating that the region of native Tg corresponding to the peptide is involved in heparin binding. Furthermore, the anti-Tg peptide antibody almost completely inhibited binding of megalin to Tg, suggesting that the Tg region containing the peptide sequence is required for megalin binding. Physiologically, Tg binding to megalin on thyroid cells may be facilitated by Tg interaction with heparin-like molecules (heparan sulfate proteoglycans) via adjacent binding sites.

OVA: ovalbumin enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay alkaline phosphatase Tris-buffered saline phosphate-buffered saline Megalin (gp330) is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (1Raychowdhury R.

Based on the assumption that physiologically megalin binds to ligands to which it is exposed in different organs (5Zheng G. Bachinsky D. Abbate M. Andres G. Brown D. Stamenkovic I. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we postulated that megalin on thyroid cells is a receptor for thyroglobulin (Tg).1 Tg is synthesized in thyrocytes and released into the follicle lumen, where it is stored as the major component of colloid (6Dunn A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 81-84Google Scholar, 7Dunn J. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 85-95Google Scholar). Hormone secretion requires uptake of Tg by thyrocytes, with transport to lysosomes, where proteolytic cleavage leads to release of hormones from mature Tg molecules (6Dunn A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 81-84Google Scholar). Internalization of Tg may result from pseudopod ingestion, but under most conditions uptake occurs by micropinocytosis (vesicular internalization), which can take place both by nonselective fluid phase uptake and receptor-mediated endocytosis (6Dunn A.

We also demonstrated that heparin almost completely inhibits binding of megalin to Tg (18Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T.

In the present study we show that a 15-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg, rich in positively charged residues, is involved in binding of Tg to heparin and to megalin.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have identified a heparin-binding region in the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg and have obtained evidence that it is closely related to a megalin-binding region. To characterize Tg-binding regions we used rat thyroid extracts separated by column size fractionation and, in confirmation of previous studies (6Dunn A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 81-84Google Scholar), found that they contain four major Tg polypeptides, with estimated molecular masses of 660, 330, 210, and 50 kDa. In an extension of our earlier studies (18Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Marinò M. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12898-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we showed that megalin bound not only to intact Tg but also to the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide, and to an even greater extent than to intact Tg. In addition, the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide inhibited binding of intact Tg to megalin by ∼70%, indicating that it includes a major Tg-binding site for megalin. Furthermore, heparin bound to the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide, and co-incubation with the 210-kDa polypeptide substantially reduced (by ∼60%) heparin binding to Tg, indicating that the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide contains heparin-binding sites. MALDI-MS analysis provided evidence that the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide represents the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of rat Tg, and in support of this, a rabbit antibody raised against a synthetic peptide deduced to be in the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg recognized the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide as well as intact Tg.We postulated that even though intact Tg is anionic (pI∼4.6), it interacts with heparin through regions containing clusters of positively charged amino acids (arginine and lysine), as previously shown for the majority of heparin-binding proteins (29Cardin A.D.

We obtained a synthetic peptide (Tg peptide 1) corresponding to a 15-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg (Arg689–Lys703: RELPSRRLKRPLPVK) that contains the heparin-binding consensus sequence and showed that biotin-labeled heparin binds to this peptide but not to a 15-amino acid control peptide in which the four inner arginine and lysine residues were replaced by glycine.The heparin binding affinity of Tg peptide 1 was lower than that of intact Tg, as shown by calculations of the K d in solid phase assays (Tg peptide 1, 12.5 μm; intact Tg, 47 nm) and by the finding that Tg peptide 1 bound to a heparin-agarose column to a lower extent than intact Tg. Furthermore, the extent of inhibition of heparin binding to Tg produced by Tg peptide 1 was lower than that produced by several known heparin-binding proteins or polypeptides (lipoprotein lipase, lactoferrin, protamine, and polylysine), and Tg peptide 1 was a weaker inhibitor than intact Tg of heparin binding to the above heparin-binding peptides/proteins. The apparently anomalous ability of Tg peptide 1 to reduce binding of heparin to intact Tg to a greater extent than the 210-kDa Tg polypeptide in our assays may be explained by the much smaller molar amounts of the peptide in the 210-kDa polypeptide. Thus, the 210-kDa polypeptide was used at a concentration of 0.476 μm (100 μg/ml), with a concentration of the sequence corresponding to Tg peptide 1 of 0.0047 μm, as compared with concentrations of Tg peptide 1 (used alone) up to 250 μm.The greater heparin binding affinity of intact Tg as compared with Tg peptide 1 suggests that other heparin-binding regions are present in the Tg molecule and/or that the native conformation of Tg is important in heparin binding. To pursue this, we further analyzed the two known partial sequences (27Di Lauro R. Obici S. Condliffe D. Ursini V.M. Musti A. Moscatelli C. Avvedimento V.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Graves P.N. Davies T.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of rat Tg and identified another putative heparin-binding consensus sequence (XBBXBX), from Ala801 to Gly806 (ARRTRG). We developed a second 15-amino acid synthetic Tg peptide (Tg peptide 2), corresponding to Met796–Ile810 (MASLWARRTRGNVFI), which included this heparin-binding consensus sequence. However, we found no binding of biotin-labeled heparin to this peptide. No other heparin-binding consensus sequences could be identified in the two known partial sequences of rat Tg. To obtain information about the remaining sequences of Tg, we analyzed the complete sequence of mouse Tg (Ref. 34Caturegli P. Vidalain P.O. Vali M. Aguilera-Galaviz L.A. Rose N.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 85: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, GenBankTM accession number 008710), which is highly homologous to rat Tg, and identified only the same two heparin-binding consensus sequences found in rat Tg, corresponding to Tg peptide 1 and Tg peptide 2. Nevertheless, a contribution of other regions of Tg to its heparin binding affinity cannot be excluded. Thus, heparin-binding segments of proteins can be different from the Cardin and Weintraub model, and separate regions rich in positively charged amino acid residues can be brought together by the folding of the protein (32Conrad H.E. Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 183-202Crossref Google Scholar). The heparin binding affinity of intact Tg may thus depend in part on the conformation of the molecule. The optimal way to study how conformation affects the heparin binding ability of a protein is to analyze its three-dimensional structure, to locate regions rich in positively charged residues, and to determine whether they are brought together by the folding of the protein. However, this approach is not currently possible in the case of Tg, because its three-dimensional structure is not known.Another way to study putative heparin-binding regions of a protein is by site-directed mutagenesis studies. However, this approach is unlikely to be feasible in the case of Tg. So far only Arvan and associates (35Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.N. Lee I. Yoo S.E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have succeeded in transfecting a nearly full-length Tg gene in cultured cells. However, they found that point mutations in the carboxyl-terminal portion abolished secretion of the protein, because of its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby making it impossible to obtain preparations of purified mutated Tg. The above study supports the notion that certain Tg mutations described in humans, especially in the carboxyl-terminal portion, result in misfolding of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum with impaired secretion by thyroid cells (7Dunn J. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 85-95Google Scholar, 36Medeiros-Neto G. Targovnik H.M. Vassart G. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 165-183PubMed Google Scholar, 37Medeiros-Neto G. Kim P.S. Yoo S.E. Vono J. Targovnik H.M. Camargo R. Hossain S.A. Arvan P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Perlmutter D.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar).Our approach to the identification of a heparin-binding region, namely through the use of synthetic peptides, can be criticized because such peptides may have different conformations from those of the corresponding segments in the native protein. This may be one reason why intact Tg has a greater heparin binding affinity than Tg peptide 1. Despite this reservation, evidence obtained in the present study supports the conclusion that a continuous sequence of the 15-amino acid Tg peptide 1 corresponds to an active heparin-binding region present on the surface of native, intact Tg. Thus, a rabbit antibody raised against Tg peptide 1 recognized native, intact Tg as shown by immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that its antigenic determinants are present on the surface of the Tg molecule. Furthermore, this antibody recognized Tg by Western blotting, under denaturing conditions, where conformational epitopes are lost, suggesting that the epitopes with which the antibody reacts are probably not entirely conformational (39Berzofsky J.A. Berkower I.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press Ltd., New York1993: 235-282Google Scholar). In addition, the anti-Tg peptide 1 antibody markedly reduced heparin binding to Tg, indicating that the region recognized by the antibody is involved in heparin binding. However, the inhibition of heparin binding to intact Tg produced by the anti-Tg peptide 1 antibody was not complete (∼70%), which supports the conclusion that the Tg region corresponding to Tg peptide 1 is not entirely responsible for the heparin binding ability of intact Tg.Our experiments performed with “mutants” of Tg peptide 1 provide evidence in favor of an important role of the charge of this sequence in determining its heparin binding ability. Thus, when the sequence of Tg peptide 1 was randomly mixed, the peptide still retained ∼80% of its heparin binding capacity, whereas substitutions of any of the inner positively charged residues resulted in a striking reduction of heparin binding, down to ∼20–30% of the binding ability of the wild type sequence. The inability of Tg peptide 2 to bind heparin, even though it contains a putative heparin-binding consensus sequence, may be attributed to the lower number of positively charged residues as compared with Tg peptide 1 (three versus six positive residues). However, other factors, including conformation of the peptide and spatial relationship between positively charged residues, may also be important.The main aim of the present study was to identify heparin-binding regions that are related to megalin-binding sites. As we have shown previously (18Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Marinò M. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12898-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), heparin competes with megalin for Tg binding and can dissociate Tg from megalin. Therefore, we postulated that heparin-binding regions of Tg are closely related to megalin-binding sites. Although megalin did not bind to Tg peptide 1 and the peptide did not inhibit binding of megalin to intact Tg, the antibody raised against the synthetic Tg peptide 1 almost completely inhibited megalin binding to Tg, indicating that the Tg sequence corresponding to the peptide is involved in megalin binding. In this regard, previous studies dealing with proteins that bind to heparin and to cell surface receptors, including members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, have provided evidence that heparin and receptor-binding sites lie adjacent to each other (40Conrad H.E. Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 367-409Crossref Google Scholar). For some of these proteins efficient binding and uptake by cell surface receptors requires binding to heparin-like molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans (40Conrad H.E. Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 367-409Crossref Google Scholar, 41Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9369-9375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, binding is believed to occur via side-by-side binding sites for heparan sulfate proteoglycans and for the receptor. These considerations raise the possibility that Tg may interact with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Indeed, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are expressed by thyroid cells in a TSH-dependent manner (50Emoto N. Isozaki O. Ohmura E. Tsushima T. Shizume K. Demura H. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 1: 123-130Google Scholar, 51Emoto N. Isozaki O. Shizume K. Tsushima T. Demura H. Thyroid. 1995; 5: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and we have obtained preliminary evidence suggesting that heparan sulfate proteoglycans can facilitate binding of Tg to cultured thyroid cells.2 Thus, the inhibition produced by the antibody against Tg peptide 1 on megalin binding to intact Tg may be explained by a steric effect. The finding that the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg (210-kDa polypeptide), which bound very avidly to megalin, only partially inhibited binding of megalin to intact Tg suggests that other binding sites for megalin may be present in the amino-terminal portion of Tg. In this regard, multiple binding sites for megalin that are separate but functionally related to a heparin-binding domain have been previously demonstrated in the 39-kDa low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein, also known as RAP, a surrogate megalin ligand (52Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The identification of a heparin-binding region of Tg that is also implicated in binding to megalin is of potential interest in the understanding of the pathogenesis of certain thyroid diseases. For example, mutations of the Tg gene resulting in amino acid substitutions are associated with certain sporadic or familial, congenital forms of goiter, and some of these mutations are located in the carboxyl-terminal portion of Tg (7Dunn J. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 85-95Google Scholar, 35Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.N. Lee I.

The mechanisms by which these mutations lead to a Tg accumulation in thyroid follicles and, consequently, to goiter, have not been completely clarified, although, as noted above, a defect in intracellular trafficking of Tg because of misfolding of the molecule in the endoplasmic reticulum is thought to be important (7Dunn J. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 85-95Google Scholar, 35Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.N. Lee I.

We postulate that modifications of the Tg structure may also result in impaired Tg endocytosis via megalin, thereby promoting excessive retention of Tg in the colloid. Clearly, additional studies are needed to further characterize the Tg-binding site for megalin and to investigate whether mutations of the Tg molecule may be responsible for altered storage of Tg as a consequence of impaired Tg-megalin interactions. Megalin (gp330) is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (1Raychowdhury R. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Smith J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K.C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rastad J. Pihlgren U. Rask L. Akerstrom G. Hellman P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Based on the assumption that physiologically megalin binds to ligands to which it is exposed in different organs (5Zheng G. Bachinsky D. Abbate M. Andres G. Brown D. Stamenkovic I. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we postulated that megalin on thyroid cells is a receptor for thyroglobulin (Tg).1 Tg is synthesized in thyrocytes and released into the follicle lumen, where it is stored as the major component of colloid (6Dunn A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 81-84Google Scholar, 7Dunn J. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 85-95Google Scholar). Hormone secretion requires uptake of Tg by thyrocytes, with transport to lysosomes, where proteolytic cleavage leads to release of hormones from mature Tg molecules (6Dunn A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Test. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 81-84Google Scholar). Internalization of Tg may result from pseudopod ingestion, but under most conditions uptake occurs by micropinocytosis (vesicular internalization), which can take place both by nonselective fluid phase uptake and receptor-mediated endocytosis (6Dun"

The crystal structure for one of these aminoglycoside kinases, APH(3′)-IIIa, has been determined in complex with ADP and analysis of the electrostatic surface potential indicates that there is a large anionic depression present adjacent to the terminal phosphate group of the nucleotide. This region also includes a conserved COOH-terminal α-helix that contains the COOH-terminal residue Phe264. We report here mutagenesis and computer modeling studies aimed at examining the mode of aminoglycoside binding to APH(3′)-IIIa. Specifically, seven site mutants were studied, five from the COOH-terminal helix (Asp261, Glu262, and Phe264), and two additional residues that line the wall of the anionic depression (Tyr55 and Arg211). Using a molecular modeling approach, six ternary complexes of APH(3′)-IIIa·ATP with the antibiotics, kanamycin, amikacin, butirosin, and ribostamycin were independently constructed and these agree well with the mutagenesis data. The results obtained show that the COOH-terminal carboxylate of Phe264 is critical for proper function of the enzyme. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that there exists multiple binding modes for the aminoglycosides, which provides a molecular basis for the broad substrate- and regiospecificity observed for this enzyme.

Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that there exists multiple binding modes for the aminoglycosides, which provides a molecular basis for the broad substrate- and regiospecificity observed for this enzyme. The aminoglycoside antibiotics constitute an important class of anti-infective agents which find use in the treatment of bacterial and some protozoal infections (1Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Mobashery S. Rosen B.P. Mobashery S. Resolving the Antibiotic Paradox: Progress in Drug Design and Resistance. Plenum Press, New York1999: 27-69Google Scholar). These molecules are a significant component of our antimicrobial arsenal and, like all antibiotics, are under pressure from the spread of resistance mechanisms. Since the mode of antimicrobial action first requires interference with translational events mediated through binding of these polycationic molecules to the 16 S rRNA, ribosomal mutation at both the RNA and protein levels has been associated with aminoglycoside resistance. However, this is a minor component of clinically relevant resistance, limited to slow growing bacteria such as mycobacteria. The major route of clinically important resistance is through the production of modifying enzymes. These include kinases, acetyltransferases, and nucleotidyltransferases (2Shaw K.J. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 138-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have studied the aminoglycoside kinase, APH 1The abbreviations used are:APHaminoglycoside phosphotransferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionMICminimal inhibitory concentrationsFIDfree induction decayATPγSadenosine 5′-O- (thiotriphosphate)1The abbreviations used are:APHaminoglycoside phosphotransferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionMICminimal inhibitory concentrationsFIDfree induction decayATPγSadenosine 5′-O- (thiotriphosphate) (3′)-IIIa, which is harbored by Gram-positive cocci such as the enterococci and staphylococci, both highly relevant human pathogens, especially in clinical institutions. This enzyme has a broad aminoglycoside substrate specificity with the demonstrated capacity to phosphorylate aminoglycosides at position 3′, and for aminoglycosides with a pentose linked to position 6 of the 2-deoxyaminocyclitol ring, position 5″ (see Fig. 1 for representative structures and ring numbering) (3McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8686-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to naturally occurring aminoglycosides (and their semi-synthetic derivatives), APH(3′)-IIIa has been shown to phosphorylate a series of de-aminated and deoxyaminoglycoside derivatives with higher tolerance than the related APH(3′)-Ia and APH(3′)-IIa which are found in Gram-negative bacteria (5McKay G.A. Roestamadji J. Mobashery S. Wright G.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2648-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APH(3′)-IIIa thus has the broadest substrate specificity of the 3′-aminoglycoside kinases (6Wright G.D. Thompson P.R. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D9-D21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the APH(3′)-IIIa·ADP binary complex has been determined to 2.2 Å and demonstrates striking similarity with the Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinase family (7Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This observation is paralleled by work which indicates that APH(3′)-IIIa has a similar chemical mechanism as protein kinases (8Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aminoglycoside kinases, such as APH(3′)-IIIa, have been demonstrated to be sensitive to inhibitors of protein kinases (9Daigle D.M. McKay G.A. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24755-24758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and have been shown to have bona fide protein kinase activity with the potential to phosphorylate some proteins and peptides on Ser (10Daigle D.M. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1998; 6: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus the aminoglycoside-binding pocket on APH(3′)-IIIa is highly tolerant of many diverse structures.In an effort to define the structural basis of substrate specificity, we have initiated site-directed mutagenesis studies in combination with molecular modeling. Our results demonstrate that the COOH-terminal residue of the enzyme is critical for efficient substrate binding and indicate that the bulk of the aminoglycoside specificity lies in the COOH-terminal domain, but that there are many binding modes for aminoglycoside substrates.MATERIALS AND METHODSSite-directed Mutagenesis of APH(3′)-IIIaThe Phe264 deletion mutant (ΔPhe264) was generated by PCR amplification of the wild type gene, encoded on plasmid pETSACG1, using the mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-CCCGAAGCTTCTACAATTCATCCAG-3′, as the reverse primer. The forward PCR primer has been described previously (3McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The D261A, E262A, F264A, and D261A/ΔPhe264 double mutant were similarly generated using the mutagenic oligonucleotides, 5′-CCCGAAGCTTCTAAAACAATTCAGCCAGTAAAATATAATA-3′, 5′-CCCGAAGCTTCTAAAACAATGCATCCAGTAAAAT-3′, 5′-CGAAGCTTGGATCCCTAAGCCAATTCATCCA-3′ and 5′-CCCGAAGCTTCTACAATTCAGCCAGTAAAATATAATATTTTA-3′, respectively, as the reverse primers. The PCR amplified products were digested withHindIII and NdeI and cloned into similarly digested pET22b(+).The mutagenic oligonucleotides, 5′-AAAGGGACCACCGCTGATGTGGAACG-3′, 5′-ATTGATCTTGGGGCAAGCGGCAGG-3′, and their reverse complements were used to generate the Y55A and R211A mutants by the QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Our APH(3′)-IIIa overexpression construct, pETSACG1, was used as the template in PCR reactions. The resultant mutant overexpression constructs, pETY55A4 and pETR211A6, were cloned into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for protein overexpression and purification. All mutagenized genes were completely sequenced to ensure that the proper mutation had been incorporated and that no other mutations had been introduced during the PCR process.Protein PurificationMutant APH(3′)-IIIa proteins were overexpressed and purified by the method described previously (3McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) which consisted of two consecutive anion exchange chromatography steps. In this work, a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.5 × 10 cm) was used in place of the MacroPrep Q column described (3McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Purification of certain mutant APH(3′)-IIIa proteins required modifications of the purification protocol. For example, during purification of the Y55A, E262A, and the F264A mutants, the second anion exchange step was replaced by chromatography over a smaller Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (10 × 1 cm). Mutant proteins were eluted using a linear gradient (15–40%) of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1m NaCl) over at least 8 column volumes. The ΔPhe264 mutant was similarly purified, but in order to obtained pure protein, fractions from the small Q-Sepharose column were applied to an Superdex 200 column (HR 10/30) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl and the proteins separated at a rate of 0.4 ml/min. The purification of the D261A and the D261A/ΔPhe264 mutants required that the second anion exchange column be again replaced with the smaller Q-Sepharose column and the mutant proteins eluted as described above. In order to obtain pure protein, fractions of the D261A mutant were applied to a Mono Q (HR 5/5) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) analytical anion exchanger and proteins were eluted using a linear gradient (10–40%) of Buffer B over 45 ml. Similarly, fractions of the D261A/ΔPhe264mutant were applied to a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and proteins were eluted using a linear gradient (15–45%) of Buffer B over 50 ml.Kinetic Analysis of Mutant APH(3′)-IIIa ProteinsThe kinetic assay monitors the production of ADP and couples this to the oxidation of NADH by a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system. The assay is described in greater detail elsewhere (3McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When the kinetic parameters of the D261A were determined for neomycin we found that the K m was near the detection limit for the assay described above. To confirm the accuracy of theK m reported we took advantage of the fact that this mutant is significantly impaired in its ability to phosphorylate neomycin. Therefore, we used neomycin as an inhibitor of kanamycin A phosphorylation to determine a K i for neomycin. The steady state parameters for kanamycin A were determined in the presence of 1.0, 10, 100, and 1000 μm neomycin B and 1 mm ATP. Since some residual neomycin activity was detected the basal rate of neomycin phosphorylation was subtracted from the kanamycin A rates of phosphorylation.Purification of Phosphorylated AminoglycosidesPhosphorylated ribostamycin was purified using a slight modification of the methodology described in Thompson et al. (4Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8686-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of ribostamycin were dissolved in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 such that the concentration of ribostamycin was approximately 10-fold below the substrate inhibitionK i for this aminoglycoside. A 3-fold molar excess (over aminoglycoside amount) of ATP was also added to the reaction mixture. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the purified mutant enzyme and allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C in an orbital shaker set for 250 rpm. The following morning additional pure mutant enzyme was added and the reactions allowed to proceed for approximately 6 additional hours at which time the reaction mixture was applied batchwise to a slurry of AG 50W-X8 (Bio-Rad)(NH4+ form). The slurry was washed with 1 liter of H2O and bound material was eluted with 8 × 50-ml fractions of 1.0% NH4OH. The presence of phosphorylated aminoglycoside in individual fractions was analyzed by TLC as described in McKay et al. (3McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the phosphorylated aminoglycoside were pooled, neutralized with 6m HCl, and lyophilized.Typically, the lyophilized products were dissolved in 30 ml of H2O and desalted by the application of 5-ml aliquots to a Sephadex G-25 column (80 × 2 cm). The mobile phase was water, the column run at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, and 3-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed by TLC and those fractions containing the phosphorylated aminoglycoside were pooled and applied to Mono S (HR 5/5), as described (4Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8686-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fractions containing pure phosphorylated aminoglycoside were pooled and lyophilized.Determination of Aminoglycoside Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC)MICs of aminoglycosides for E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the various mutant aph(3′)-IIIa genes were estimated through the use of antibiotic gradient plates in the absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (11Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.M. Spitzer S.G. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gradient plates were prepared by the addition of aminoglycoside antibiotic and 25 μl of a 10% suspension of Antifoam B (Sigma) to 25 ml of molten Mueller Hinton Agar (Difco). Kanamycin A was added to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml and neomycin was added to 75 μg/ml. The resultant solution was then poured into a square sterile culture plate at an incline in order to create a wedge. The agar was allowed to solidify for approximately 1 h at which time an overlaying wedge, made up of molten Mueller Hinton Agar without antibiotic (25 ml) was poured while the culture dish laid flat. The overlaying wedge was allowed to solidify for a further 2 h. Overnight cell cultures ofE. coli BL21 (DE3) containing wild type or mutant APH(3′)-IIIa were diluted 100-fold in top agar (1% tryptone, 0.8% NaCl, 0.8% agar). The top agar was spread across a sterile microscope slide and a uniform distribution of cells was achieved by dipping the long edge of a second sterile microscope slide into the cell suspension. The edge of the slide was then applied to the surface of the plate parallel to the gradient of drug. The plates were inverted and grown for 24 h at which point 5 ml of a 0.2% solution of acridine orange in ethanol was poured over the top and allowed to evaporate. The stained plates were photographed under shortwave UV light. The antibiotic gradient was assumed to be linear and the fraction of the total distance of the gradient that the mutant cell strains were able to grow was used to estimate the MICs of the APH(3′)-IIIa mutants.In order to ensure that protein expression for each mutant was comparable to the wild type enzyme, the amount of protein produced under noninducing conditions was qualitatively assessed by Western analysis. Overnight cultures of wild type and mutant APH(3′)-IIIa producing strains (50 ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g and resuspended in 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 200 mm NaCl. Cells were then lysed by 2 passages through a French pressure cell, and cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The concentration of protein was determined for each of the cleared lysates and equivalent amounts of protein (10 μg) were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with rabbit anti-APH(3′)-IIIa polyclonals antibody. The Western blot was developed using a donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase.Characterization of PhosphoaminoglycosidesMass spectra of neomycin and ribostamycin phosphorylated by the APH(3′)-IIIa ΔPhe264 deletion mutant were determined in the positive ion mode in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2% formic acid, respectively. Electrospray mass spectral analysis of ribostamycin phosphorylated by the Y55A and the E262A mutants was carried out in the positive ion mode in the presence of 0.2% formic acid. All mass spectra were recorded at the McMaster Regional Center for Mass Spectrometry.All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX-500 NMR spectrometer. Proton spectra were acquired at 500.13 MHz using a 5-mm broad band inverse probe with triple axis gradient capability. Spectra were obtained in 32 scans in 32 K data points over a 3.592 kHz spectral width (4.561 s acquisition time). Sample temperature was maintained at 30 °C by a Bruker Eurotherm variable temperature unit. The free induction decay (FID) was processed using Gaussian multiplication (line broadening: −1.5 Hz, Gaussian broadening: 0.2). The FID was also zero-filled to 64 K before Fourier transformation.Proton COSY two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in the absolute value mode using the pulse sequence 90° − t 1− 45° − acquisition and included pulsed field gradients for coherence selection. The data were acquired in 1 scan for each of the 256 FIDs that contained 2 K data points in the F2 dimension over a 3.592 kHz spectral width. The 1H 90° pulse width was 6.6 μs. A 1.0-s relaxation delay was used between acquisitions. Zero-filling in the F1 dimension produced a 1 K × 1 K data matrix with a digital resolution of 3.508 Hz/point in both dimensions. During two-dimensional Fourier transformation a sine-bell squared window function was applied to both dimensions. The transformed data were then symmetrized.Selective one-dimensional TOCSY 1H NMR spectra were recorded over a 4.006 KHz spectral width in 32 K data points (4.089 s acquisition time). Gaussian shaped pulses were defined by 256 data points with the pulse being truncated at 1% of the maximum pulse amplitude. The 90° Gaussian pulse width was 25.5 μs. This pulse was followed by a 40-μs fixed delay and then by the standard TOCSY MLEV-17 spin lock pulse sequence. The 90° spin lock pulse width was 27.0 μs. A 1.0-s relaxation delay was used. The 20-ms spin lock period was followed by a z-filter which contained 5 variable delay times ranging from 4 to 18 ms. The transmitter offset was adjusted to the frequency of the 1H being selectively excited. Thirty-two scans were acquired for each of the delays in the z-filter resulting in a total of 160 scans. The FID was processed using Gaussian multiplication (line broadening: −1.5 Hz; Gaussian broadening: 0.2) and was zero-filled to 64 K before Fourier transformation.Phosphorus 31 NMR spectra were recorded at 202.456 MHz using the 5-mm triple axis gradient broad band inverse probe. The spectra were acquired over a 48.544 KHz spectral width in 32 K data points (0.338 s acquisition time). Spectra were obtained with a 31P pulse width of 3.0 μs (33° flip angle) and a relaxation delay of 0.5 s. The FID's were processed using exponential multiplication (line broadening: 5.0 Hz) and were zero-filled to 64 K before Fourier transformation.The compounds were dissolved in 99.996% D2O (Isotec, Inc.) to a concentration of approximately 20.0 mg/ml. Chemical shifts are reported in parts/million relative to tetramethylsilane using the HDO signals at 4.60 ppm as internal reference for the 1H NMR spectra. The 31P NMR spectra were referenced relative to external 85% phosphoric acid in D2O at 0.0 ppm.Electrostatic Field Analysis and Docking Simulations with AminoglycosidesThe crystal structure of APH(3′)-IIIa with bound ADP has been determined to a resolution of 2.2 Å (7Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, for examining the interaction of this enzyme with aminoglycoside substrates at an atomic level, analysis of the ATP bound form is more appropriate. Therefore, a model of APH(3′)-IIIa with ATP bound in the nucleotide binding pocket was constructed in the following manner. One of the two crystallographically independent APH(3′)-IIIa molecules was selected and the bound ADP molecule removed. Subsequently, an ATP molecule was modeled into the nucleotide binding pocket based on the conformation of ADP in the crystal structure of APH(3′)-III·ADP, and the conformation of ATP in crystal structures of two protein kinases (catalytic domain of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Protein Data Bank code 1ATP (12Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), and catalytic domain of phosphorylase kinase, Protein Data Bank code 1PHK (13Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)). Note that the structure of APH(3′)-IIIa shows extensive structural homology with Ser/Thr and Tyr protein kinases, especially around the nucleotide binding pocket (7Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), thus justifying the use of protein kinase crystal structures for modeling the ATP conformation. Furthermore, the conformation of ATP co-factors is essentially identical in the two protein kinase crystal structures, i.e. when overlaid, the γ-phosphate groups are within 0.3 Å of one another. Also, preliminary analysis of the crystal structure of APH(3′)-IIIa with bound AMPPNP (a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue) validated the modeled conformation of ATP. 2A. M. Berghuis and W.-C. Hon, unpublished data.The electrostatic field surrounding the APH(3′)-IIIa enzyme molecule complex with ATP was evaluated using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation as implemented in DELPHI (14Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comp. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 15Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). For the calculation, a dielectric constant of 80 was used for the solvent region and a value of 2 was assumed for the interior of the protein molecule. Partial charges for protein and co-factor atoms were adopted from the AMBER force field (16Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagoma G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4860) Google Scholar).The molecular surface of the APH(3′)-III·ATP complex was calculated with the GRASP program (17Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Gen. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar) which incorporates the algorithm by Connolly (18Connolly M.L. Science. 1983; 221: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). GRASP was also used to evaluate the electrostatic potential at the molecular surface, based on the DELPHI electrostatic field analysis.Six models of the APH(3′)-III·ATP·aminoglycoside ternary complexes, with the aminoglycosides: kanamycin (3′ productive complex), amikacin (3′ productive complex), ribostamycin (3′ and 5″ productive complexes) and butirosin (3′ and 5″ productive complexes), were constructed using the following procedure. The molecular docking program DockVision (19Hart T.N. Ness S.R. Read R.J. Proteins. 1997; 1 (suppl.): 205-209Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was employed to generate a large number (100–250) of possible models for a specific ternary complex, from which one model was subsequently selected that was consistent with functional studies. The precise process used by the DockVision software to arrive at possible models involved three stages. During stage one, 3000 conformations of an aminoglycoside were randomly generated and allowed to flexibly (i.e. torsion angles were allowed to change) dock in the APH(3′)-IIIa aminoglycoside binding pocket. Approximately, 20% of these models were clustered resulting in 200–500 unique solutions. In stage two, the models were refined and again clustered, resulting in approximately 100–300 distinct models. And in the final stage, the remaining models were further refined and ultimately clustered, producing between 100 and 250 different ternary complex models.The minimization routine used by DockVision was a Monte Carlo-based simulated annealing algorithm (20Hart T. Read R. Proteins. 1992; 13: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which allowed for different annealing schedules during each of the three stages in the docking run. For example, in the beginning of the docking run a large part of conformational space was coarsely sampled (e.g. high temperature and maximum allowed rotation of 12.0o), while at the end of the docking exercise a small section of conformational space was finely sampled (e.g. low temperature and maximum allowed rotation of 1.5o).The target function used in the minimization was a modified Merck Molecular Force Field (21Halgren T.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 490-641Crossref Scopus (4207) Google Scholar). The Merck Molecular Force Field is optimized for docking simulations, and incorporates electrostatic and van der Waals terms in its score function. Partial charges used for the protein and ATP atoms were based on the AMBER parameters, and partial charges for the different amino groups of the aminoglycosides were derived from pK a values as determined by NMR (22Botto R.E. Coxon B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 1021-1028Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Cox J.R. Serpersu E.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2353-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24DiGiammarino E.L. Draker K.A. Wright G.D. Serpersu E.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 3638-3644Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The specific modification made to the Merck Molecular Force Field was the incorporation of a distance function which penalized the score function based on the separation between two designated atoms. For the aminoglycoside docking simulations, the two designated atoms were the γ-phosphate group of ATP and the 3′ or 5″ hydroxyl group of the aminoglycoside. This penalty function was in force during the first stage of the docking run, in the second stage its influence on the target function was halved, and during stage three the distance function was eliminated. The effect of the distance penalty function on the docking simulation was 2-fold. First, it removed models that were inconsistent with phosphoryl transfer early on in the docking runs. Second, it allowed for a more extensive sampling of models that were consistent with productive aminoglycoside binding.The 100–250 possible models for each of the different ternary complexes thus generated were subjected to a variety of tests that assessed numerous criteria. The tests could be divided into two groups, (a) evaluation of properties indicative of favorable protein-ligand interactions, and (b) evaluation of properties consistent with functional studies. For the first group of test, the models were examined on: reduction in non-polar surface area upon complexation, the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the enzyme and the substrate, and the strength of these hydrogen bonds as assessed by geometric considerations. The second group of tests examined the distance of the phosphoryl accepting hydroxyl group and the terminal phosphate group of ATP, and the proximity of aminoglycoside atoms to residues known to interact with the substrate based on mutagenesis studies. The models were scored on each of the criteria, giving particular weight to agreement with functional data, and the top 20 solutions for each ternary complex were visually inspected. The graphical analysis allowed for the selection of one single model for each of the six ternary APH(3′)-IIIa·ATP·aminoglycoside complexes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExamination of the electrostatic properties of APH(3′)-IIIa reveals that adjacent to the modeled γ-phosphate group of ATP is a surface depression which is strikingly negatively charged under physiological conditions (Fig. 2). Considering that aminoglycosides, due to the preponderance of amine groups, invariably carry a positive charge at neutral pH, it is likely that the negatively charged surface depression is the site of antibiotic binding. The most prominent structural component which contributes to this putative aminoglycoside-binding site is the COOH-terminal helix.Figure 2Model of the three-dimensional structure of the APH (3′)-IIIa·ATP complex.

PCC 6803 triple mutant D2R8 with V247M/A249T/M329I mutations in the D2 subunit of the photosystem II is impaired in QA function, has an apparently mobile QA, and is unable to grow photoautotrophically. Several photoautotrophic pseudorevertants of this mutant have been isolated, each of which retained the originalpsbDI mutations of D2R8. Using a newly developed mapping technique, the site of the secondary mutations has been located in the open reading frame slr0399. Two different nucleotide substitutions and a deletion of about 60% of slr0399 were each shown to restore photoautotrophy in different pseudorevertants of the mutant D2R8, suggesting that inactivation of Slr0399 leads to photoautotrophic growth in D2R8. Indeed, a targeted deletion ofslr0399 restores photoautotrophy in D2R8 and in otherpsbDI mutants impaired in QA function. Slr0399 is similar to the hypothetical protein Ycf39, which is encoded in the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa; in the chloroplast genomes of diatoms, dinoflagellates, and red algae; and in the nuclear genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. Slr0399 and Ycf39 have a NAD(P)H binding motif near their N terminus and have some similarity to isoflavone reductase-like proteins and to a subunit of the eukaryotic NADH dehydrogenase complex I. Deletion of slr0399 in wild type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has no significant phenotypic effects other than a decrease in thermotolerance under both photoautotrophic and photomixotrophic conditions. We suggest that Slr0399 is a chaperone-like protein that aids in, but is not essential for, quinone insertion and protein folding around QA in photosystem II. Moreover, as the effects of Slr0399 are not limited to photosystem II, this protein may also be involved in assembly of quinones in other photosynthetic and respiratory complexes.

PCC 6803 is a useful molecular genetic system to study oxygenic photosynthesis and cell physiology of photosynthetic microorganisms. The organism is unique in that it combines several desirable properties: (i)Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is spontaneously transformable and incorporates exogenous DNA into its genome via double-homologous recombination (1Grigorieva G. Shestakov S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 13: 367-370Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 2Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (845) Google Scholar); (ii) the strain can grow (photo)heterotropically, thus enabling the creation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains impaired in photosystem I (PS I)1 and/or photosystem II (PS II) function (for a recent review, see Ref. 3Vermaas W.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); and (iii) the entire genome sequence of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is known (4Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because of these properties, a variety of molecular genetic approaches have been applied to study the role of particular proteins in this organism. One of these approaches is the mapping and characterization of pseudorevertants, which carry second-site mutations restoring viability under conditions that are lethal for the original mutants. In the case of mutants that are impaired in photosynthesis, pseudorevertants with improved photosynthetic function and with secondary mutations in genes coding for proteins with known function have been isolated and analyzed (for example, see Refs. 5Nixon P.J. Rögner M. Diner B.A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Kless H. Vermaas W. J. Biol.

These genes may be identical to the ones carrying the original mutations or may be at a different locus. In eukaryotic genetic systems such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii or Arabidopsis thaliana mapping of a site of a suppressor mutation in an unrelated gene is a time-consuming and complicated project. However, with the advent of a known genomic sequence, in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the process of mapping of genes that contain second-site mutations has been simplified and accelerated by development of a novel technique of functional complementation with size-separated restriction fragment pools (3Vermaas W.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this way, a functionally complementing gene can be identified using the pseudorevertant DNA without the need for library construction. In the present study we have applied this technique to characterize frequently occurring photoautotrophic pseudorevertants of the obligate photoheterotrophic D2R8 mutant (12Ermakova-Gerdes S. Vermaas W.F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11569-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which has primary mutations in the QA-binding niche of the D2 protein that is part of the PS II reaction center complex. Surprisingly, the location of these pseudoreversions was found to map to slr0399, an open reading frame coding for a protein of an unknown function. As will be presented in this paper, we suggest that Slr0399 may function as a chaperone helping to insert QA into its site. Even though chaperone function has been well established for folding of soluble proteins (reviewed recently in Refs. 13Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar and 14Ellis R.J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), much less is known about the possible involvement of chaperones in folding of membrane protein complexes and in insertion of cofactors. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (15Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with 5 mm glucose at the light intensity of 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1. Liquid medium was perfused with sterile air. Solid medium was supplemented with 1.5% agar, 0.3% sodium thiosulfate, and 10 mm TES/NaOH buffer, pH 8.2. The PS II inhibitor atrazine (20 μm) was added to solid medium for maintenance of obligate photoheterotrophic mutants with defects in PS II in order to avoid inadvertent selection for photoautotrophic (pseudo)revertants. For the isolation of genomic DNA, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were pelleted and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 2 ml of saturated NaI solution/g (wet weight) of cells. After dilution of NaI with 5–10 volumes of water, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, and 5 mm EDTA; lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 7 mg/ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min,N-lauryl sarcosine was added to 1% (w/v) final concentration, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to induce cell lysis. DNA was extracted several times with phenol, and then with a 1:1 phenol:chloroform mix. During extraction, very gentle agitation was used to avoid extensive fragmentation. After precipitation with ethanol, DNA was resuspended in TE buffer and ammonium acetate was added to a final concentration of 2.5m. The solution was incubated on ice for 1 h and cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Ethanol (1.5 volumes) was added to the supernatant to precipitate the DNA. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed in 70% ethanol, and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 2 mm EDTA) buffer. After digestion of the chromosomal DNA with restriction endonucleases and size fractionation on a 0.4% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetic acid, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), the gel was soaked in distilled water for 30 min and then in BG-11 with gentle agitation, stained with ethidium bromide, and each lane of the gel was sliced into 20–25 pieces, each representing a specific size range. DNA fragments from each size range were eluted from the agarose as follows. Agarose slices were incubated at −80 °C overnight, thawed at 37 °C for 30–60 min, spun in a microcentrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 5 min, and then at 14,000 rpm for another 10 min. The supernatant was used for Synechocystissp. PCC 6803 transformation without further purification. D2R8 mutant cells were grown to mid-log phase (OD730 about 0.5 as measured on a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer), were concentrated to OD730 = 10, and 1 ml of this culture was spread on a BG-11 agar plate. After the spread suspension had dried on the plate, 50–100 μl of each DNA sample (10–15 different samples per plate, each at a different spot) were applied directly on the cell lawn and allowed to dry. Photoautotrophic transformants were visible after 8–10 days of incubation at 30 °C in the light at 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1. The steady-state rate of oxygen evolution was determined in intact cells on a Gilson model KM oxygraph at a chlorophyll concentration of 7 μg/ml. Measurements were performed in BG-11 medium buffered with 25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, with or without electron acceptors (0.1 mm2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone (DMBQ) and 0.5 mmK3[Fe(CN)6]). The light from a 150-watt xenon arc lamp was filtered through water and through a Schott OG-570 filter and was saturating for maximal electron transfer rates (1800 μmol photons m−2 s−1). PS II quantitation in whole cells on a chlorophyll basis using atrazine-replaceable [14C]diuron binding was performed as described in Ref. 16Vermaas W.F.J. Charité J. Shen G. Z.

PCC 6803 culture was harvested in mid-exponential growth phase (OD730 between 0.4 and 0.6), and thylakoid membranes were isolated as described in Ref. 18He Q. Vermaas W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Quinones and other prenyllipids were extracted by incubation with chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.3) for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark under nitrogen with agitation according to Ref. 19Kalén A.

The ratio of chloroform/methanol/water in the extract was subsequently adjusted to 3:2:1, and the tubes were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to separate the phases. The lower, dark green phase was evaporated in the dark under nitrogen, and pigments were dissolved in 500 μl of a chloroform/methanol mix (2:1). HPLC analysis was performed on a Beckman solvent pump model 126 HPLC instrument fitted with a Phenomenex Prodigy, ODS, 5-μm reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm). Per HPLC run, 100 μl of prenyllipids isolate in the chloroform/methanol mix was injected onto the column. A combination of linear gradients from the initial methanol/water (9:1) mixture to methanol/isopropanol/hexane (2:1:1) was run for 30 min, followed by a 8-min elution with methanol/isopropanol/hexane mixture, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min (20Koivuniemi A. Swiezewska E. Aro E.-M. Styring S. Andersson B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 263 nm on a Beckman model 166 absorbance detector. The data were processed with the System Gold software (Beckman). Vitamin K1(Aldrich) was used as a standard for quantification of the amount of quinone detected. Quinone peaks were eluted and spectrally analyzed in oxidized form and after reduction with NaBH4. Peak assignments were made on the basis of comparison with published absorption spectra (21Cramer W.A. Knaff D.B. Energy Transduction in Biological Membranes: A Textbook of Bioenergetics.

The Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant D2R8 does not grow photoautotrophically due to two mutations in the QA-binding de-loop of the D2 protein (V247M and A249T) that greatly alter the properties of QA and cause QA to be apparently mobile and replaceable by other quinones (12Ermakova-Gerdes S. Vermaas W.F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11569-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This mutant lacks psbDII (the second gene coding for the D2 protein), and has three mutations inpsbDI, leading to a V247M/A249T/M329I mutation combination. When the obligate photoheterotrophic D2R8 mutant was plated in the absence of glucose, photoautotrophic colonies were found to appear frequently. The estimated frequency was 10−5 to 10−6, which was about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than the frequency of true reversion that we observe for obligate photoheterotrophic single-base change mutants. In order to determine the genetic cause of the photoautotrophic nature of the D2R8 derivatives, the psbDI gene from three independent photoautotrophic D2R8 derivatives (D2R8R1, D2R8R2, and D2R8R3) was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Interestingly, in all three strains, the mutations V247M, A249T, and M329I remained present in thepsbDI gene. Therefore, the three photoautotrophic strains were clearly pseudorevertants. Moreover, no additional mutations were found in psbDI that was isolated from the revertants. Corroborating these findings, PCR-amplified psbDI from the pseudorevertants failed to transform the initial D2R8 mutant to photoautotrophy, indicating that the site of pseudoreversion in the three pseudorevertant strains was located outside of psbDI. Total genomic DNA isolated from the same pseudorevertants transformed the D2R8 mutant to photoautotrophy with high frequency, establishing that the pseudoreversion of D2R8 to photoautotrophic growth is due to a single genetic event. We find cotransformation of different loci to be uncommon in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Several genes or gene clusters coding for structural PS II proteins that might have domains close to the QA site (psbA2, psbA3,psbC, psbH, and psbEFLJ) were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of the three pseudorevertants. These PCR products were examined for their ability to transform the original mutant to photoautotrophy. All of these genes tested failed to complement D2R8, indicating that they did not contain the site of the secondary mutation. In order to identify the locus or loci responsible for the pseudoreversion in the three strains, a novel mapping technique of functional complementation with size-separated restriction fragment pools was applied (3Vermaas W.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), making use of the genomic restriction map ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that has been constructed for 16 enzymes based on the genomic sequence. The genomic DNA from pseudorevertant D2R8R1 was isolated and purified gently to avoid fragmentation. About 25 μg of genomic DNA was completely digested with one of the following 10 enzymes (BamHI,BglII, EcoRI, EcoRV, KpnI,NheI, PstI, ScaI, SmaI, andXbaI) and size-separated on a 0.4% agarose gel. Each of the 10 lanes of the gel was cut into 20–25 fractions, containing DNA fragments of size categories between 1 and 35 kb. Every fraction was collected in a separate microcentrifuge tube, and DNA was extracted and used to transform the original D2R8 mutant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The capability to perform photoautotrophic growth was used as the selection criterion. Only one DNA fraction in each of seven restriction digestions complemented the D2R8 mutant, indicating that these fractions contained the restriction fragment carrying the secondary mutation (TableI). However, no complementation was observed after transformation with DNA fractions generated by restriction with BamHI, KpnI, and NheI (Table I). This may indicate that either (i) a restriction site of these enzymes is too close to the locus of the secondary mutation, not leaving a large enough flanking region to facilitate efficient homologous recombination in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803; or (ii) the restriction fragment containing the secondary mutation generated by these enzymes was less than 1 kb or longer than 35 kb and was not represented in the complementation test.Table IMapping of the secondary mutation in D2R8R1 by functional complementation using size-separated restriction fragment poolsRestriction enzymeAs determined from complementation testAs determined from comparison with theSynechocystis sp.

Open table in a new tab The size ranges of the seven restriction fragments that led to functional complementation of the original mutant were compared with the size-sorted restriction map of the entire Synechocystissp. PCC 6803 chromosome (3Vermaas W.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in order to determine a single region in the genome that fitted this unique restriction pattern. Only one genomic location was found to yield restriction fragments compatible with the sizes observed for each of the seven complementing restriction fragment collections. This location was 2,147,054–2,149,574 base pairs (numbering according to CyanoBase Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan), corresponding to a 2,528-base pairEcoRI/ScaI fragment. This region of the genome should contain the site of the pseudoreversion. To verify this finding, this EcoRI/ScaI fragment was amplified by PCR from pseudorevertants D2R8R1, D2R8R2, and D2R8R3, and from the wild type, cloned into the pACYC184 vector (yielding plasmids pD2R8R1, pD2R8R2, pD2R8R3, and pWT, respectively), and used to transform the D2R8 mutant. Indeed, PCR products cloned from the pseudorevertants, but not the wild type, could transform the original mutant to photoautotrophy. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the complementing 2,528-base pair EcoRI/ScaI fragment contained two complete open reading frames (slr0398 andslr0399) and two partial ones (slr0397 andslr0400) (Ref. 4Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; CyanoBase). Slr0397 and Slr0398 have no significant similarity to other open reading frames in the data base, whereas Slr0399 is similar to the polypeptide predicted to be encoded by an open reading frame (ycf39) found in chloroplasts of non-green algae. Slr0400 is similar to the putative protein encoded byyfjB in Escherichia coli. In order to determine which of these open reading frames contained the site of the pseudoreversions, the inserts in plasmids pD2R8R2 and pD2R8R3 were digested, size-separated on an agarose gel, purified, and used in a complementation test (Fig. 1 B). In both cases the smallest complementing region was determined to be a 1.16-kbBstEII-SpeI fragment containingslr0399 only (Fig. 1 B). Sequencing ofslr0399 from pseudorevertants D2R8R1, D2R8R2, and D2R8R3 showed that D2R8R1 and D2R8R3 contained point mutations within this open reading frame, leading to amino acid substitutions Y291C and R254H, respectively. Surprisingly, D2R8R2 carried a large deletion between the codons for Thr-128 and Leu-255, which also introduced a frameshift. This led to the loss of the C-terminal 60% of Slr0399 in D2R8R2. These results suggest that inactivation of slr0399 in the D2R8 psbDI mutant leads to restoration of PS II function in this mutant. An important question to ask was whether inactivation of slr0399 could restore PS II function in various PS II mutants, or whether this effect was limited to the mutant D2R8 only. For this purpose, the plasmids pD2R8R2, pD2R8R3, and pWT were used to transform different obligate photoheterotrophicSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains with mutations inpsbDI, psbA2, or psbB. The results of this complementation test are presented in TableII and demonstrate that several different mutations in the QA-binding niche of D2 (V247M/A249T, S254F, and G258D) can be complemented to photoautotrophic growth by inactivation of slr0399 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. However, the absence of complementation in the mutant A260V, which has no functional PS II centers and no oxygen evolution, suggests that photoautotrophic growth can be restored by a secondary mutation inslr0399 only in mutants with some PS II activity still present.Table IIFunctional complementation of different obligate photoheterotrophic PS II mutants by transformation with plasmids pD2R8R1 and pD2R8R2, which contain the mutant slr0399 alleles from two D2R8 pseudorevertants, and with plasmid pWT containing wild type slr0399MutantLocation of mutation(s)Oxygen evolution in Hill reactionComplementation to photoautotrophic growth by slr0399 from:Wild typeD2R8R1 (Y291C)D2R8R2 (Δ128–255)psbDI mutants (D2 protein) S79FaThe ability of the plasmids to complement has been indicated by +, and the lack of functional complementation has been indicated by −.

Open table in a new tab Functional complementation with pseudorevertant DNA was not observed in any of the strains where the introduced PS II mutation affected regions other than the QA site. This strongly suggests that in PS II Slr0399 affects solely the QA-binding niche. However, strains carrying mutations a few residues away from the changes in D2R8 could also be complemented by mutated Slr0399, indicating that Slr0399 may interact with the QA site as a whole rather than with individual residues. To verify the notion that deletion of a large part of Slr0399 leads to photoautotrophic growth in previously obligate photoheterotrophic PS II mutants with changes at the QA site, a plasmid was constructed (pΔslr0399) in which a 620-base pair BsaBI/SpeI fragment near the 3′ end of slr0399 was replaced by the kanamycin (Km) resistance cassette from pUC4K. To rule out possible polar effects of this deletion and/or Km insertion on the transcription of sequences located downstream of slr0399, another DNA construct was designed that contained intact slr0399, but where the Km resistance cassette was inserted at the SpeI restriction site adjacent to the stop codon of slr0399. Both constructs were used to transform the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild type, the D2R8 strain, and the D2 mutant S254F (see Table II), selecting for resistance to kanamycin. The complete segregation of the introduced deletions was demonstrated by PCR (Fig.2); as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains multiple genome copies per cell, demonstration of segregation prior to functional analysis is essential. As expected, targeted inactivation of slr0399 restored photoautotrophic growth in the photoheterotrophic psbDI mutants D2R8 and S254F (Table III). However, slr0399 inactivation had essentially no effect on the properties of the wild type (Table III). The photoautotrophic growth rate, the PS II content (a"

In several cell types calcium mobilization plays a central role in the modulation of c-fos gene expression; however, the mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. Calcium ions act as intracellular secondary messengers either after entering cells through various ion channels and/or upon release from internal stores. Ca2+ differentially activates cellular processes, and immediate early genes such as c-fos gene provide important targets to characterize how the calcium signal is transduced to the nucleus to activate various transcription programs (22Sheng M.

In other situations increased levels of intracellular calcium induced by membrane depolarization with elevated levels of KCl or exposure to the calcium ionophore ionomycin have been shown to activate the c-fos promoter in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. These have been linked to SRF independently of Elk-1 (24Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). SRF-driven activation did not involve Ras but did appear to involve calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (25Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The mechanism is still uncertain, since mutation of the major phosphorylation site in SRF showed continued activity in this study. Finally some evidence implies that calcium signals to the Fos AP1-like element immediately downstream of the SRE-binding site (26Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), even though no transcription factor has been directly implicated in control via the Fos AP1-like site alone. Other pathways activate c-fos transcription independently of the SRE, primarily via the CRE located at position −65 (reviewed in Refs. 27Greenberg M.E. Thompson M.A. Sheng M. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1992; 86: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 28Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This element is sufficient to mediate calcium-dependent reporter gene activation in some cell contexts, while in other cells additional cryptic CREs in the upstream promoter contribute to reporter gene activity (19Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Simon M.C. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To further complicate the role of the CRE, intracellular calcium fluxes can also activate kinases downstream of Ras and ERK that phosphorylate CREB at serine 133 and thus potentially modulate transcription through the CRE (14Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 29Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). An explanation for the multiplicity of the effects mediated by calcium on gene expression has recently been provided by elegant microinjection experiments aimed at unraveling how spatially distinct calcium signals generate diverse transcriptional responses (30Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Nuclear injection of a non-diffusible calcium chelator blocked increases in nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, calcium concentrations following activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in a mouse pituitary cell line. Using reporters driven by different c-fos promoter regions, Hardingham et al. (30Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) showed that increases in nuclear calcium control CRE-mediated transcription, whereas a rise of cytoplasmic calcium activated SRE-driven transcription. In fact, this suggests that the mode of calcium entry and the cell type determine which upstream promoter element is required for the activation of a transiently introduced reporter gene. Accordingly the CRE alone can mediate activation by calcium signals triggered by membrane depolarization of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (21Sheng M. Dougan S.T. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar, 31Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), an effect that is not reproduced in HeLa cells (8Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3490-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). More recently, a new calcium-sensitive transcriptional repressor has been proposed to bind a downstream regulatory element (DRE) present within the human prodynorphin gene (32Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by calcium this repressor, named DREAM for DRE-antagonist modulator, is no longer able to bind the DRE. In addition to prodynorphin promoter, DREAM represses also transcription from the c-fos gene in a transient transfection assay. However, whether this is true for the endogenous gene remains to be established. A close inspection of the c-fos transcription unit through high resolution run-on analysis has also suggested the involvement of intragenic regulatory elements as important targets of c-fosregulation by calcium (33Thompson M.A. Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4224-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 34Collart M.A. Tourkine N. Belin D. Vassalli P. Jeanteur P.

Belin D. Conne B. Roche E. Lew D.P. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16596-16601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured macrophages, c-fos transcription is stimulated by multiple pathways requiring the mobilization of calcium from internal sources (34Collart M.A. Tourkine N. Belin D. Vassalli P. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Collart M.A. Belin D. Briottet C. Thorens B. Vassalli J.D. Vassalli P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 237-241PubMed Google Scholar). A strong block to transcriptional elongation, mapping beyond c-fos exon 1, was observed when freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages were put into primary culture (34Collart M.A. Tourkine N. Belin D. Vassalli P. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent relief of this block strongly increased c-fos mRNA levels. In T cells, elevated cytoplasmic calcium is a critical mediator of activation upon stimulation of the antigen receptor. The synergistic action of calcium ionophore and agonists of protein kinase C mimics authentic antigen treatment in some T cell hybridomas (38Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the principal effect of calcium was shown to be on the elongation of c-fostranscripts (35Lee G. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4579-4587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using nuclear extracts from Ltk− cells, we had previously mapped an in vitro arrest site within the murine c-fos gene (39Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2832-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this work we confirm and extend these results in vivo. However, because most previous studies on c-fos transcription have dealt with transient transfection experiments, we sought to use permanent cell lines carrying integrated reporter genes. We find that a sequence within c-fos intron 1, while barely active on its own, can strongly augment a calcium ionophore-driven transcriptional response together with its homologous or a heterologous upstream promoter. Even though this is correlated with CREB phosphorylation on Ser133, it is mediated by a novel signaling pathway that surprisingly is potentiated by the calmodulin antagonist W7. Tissue culture medium, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, G418, Random primers DNA labeling system, and TRIZOL were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), A23187, W5, W7, KN62, KN93, and secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Quentin Fallavier, France). Antisera directed against phosphorylated forms of CREB and ERK came from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, Paris), all radioactive nucleotides and ECL reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, the pHOOK-2 vector and Capture-Tec beads came from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands), and all restriction enzymes and bovine serum albumin from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Meylan, France). The calmodulin-dependent protein kinase assay kit was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (EUROMEDEX, France). Bradford protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad (Ivry Sur Seine, France) and Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes from Millipore. Radioactive signals were revealed by autoradiography using intensifying screens at −80 °C and quantitated by PhosphorImager technology. Mouse Ltk− fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 containing atmosphere in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. When indicated, cells were serum starved for 24 h and stimulated by refeeding with 10% serum for the indicated times. 3–5 × 106 exponentially growing cells were treated with either 100 nm PMA, 100 mm IBMX + 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, 0.1–10 μm rapamycin or cyclosporin A, 10 μm KN62 or KN93, 2.5–250 μm W5 or W7, 20 μm PD98059, or 10 mg/ml of the calcium ionophore A23187 alone, or a combination of these agents as indicated in the legends of the figures. All media were supplemented with streptomycin, penicillin, and l-glutamine. Cells were transfected with the various constructs described in the figures using calcium phosphate and pools of G418-resistant cells were used throughout this work. 6 μg of pHOOK-2-Lac Z (control), CaM-KIIi-HOOK, CaM-KIIa-HOOK, or CaM-KIVa-HOOK were transfected in 3–5 × 106 Ltk−p19/1 cells by the calcium phosphate technique. 16 h later, cells were washed with HS buffer (25 mm Hepes, 140 mmNaCl, pH 7.4), fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added and after 2 h A23187 stimulation was performed, where indicated, for 1 h. Cells were then detached with 6 mm EDTA, spun down, and resuspended in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, also containing A23187 where indicated. 50 μl of magnetics beads (Invitrogen Capture-Tec system) were added and tubes were gently stirred at 37 °C for 1 h. After selection on a magnetic stand and 3 washes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were split into two batches: one was resuspended in TRIZOL reagent for RNA extraction while the other one was treated with Laemmli's polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-SDS sample buffer. Extraction of nuclei, run-on transcript labeling and hybridization were carried out as described (39Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2832-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Preparations of crude nuclei were split into aliquots containing 5 × 107 nuclei which were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed immediately prior to the labeling reaction. Incubations were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl). Labeled run-on transcripts were purified and hybridized to nitrocellulose filters containing equimolar amounts of the plasmids indicated. Hybridization was carried out for 48 h at 42 °C. Filters were washed twice at 65 °C in 0.2 × SSC and at 25 °C in 2 × SSC containing 2 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A. Signals were corrected for the thymidine content of each hybridizing DNA strand and standardized to those obtained with the gapdh cDNA probe. Total RNA was extracted using a standard 5 m guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol procedure at pH 5. Blots were sequentially hybridized to a mouse c-fos and gapdh cDNA probes labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The RNA probe was prepared from PM37.37 (containing a mouse genomic c-fos DNA spanning nucleotides −599 to +251, cloned into pBluescript) linearized with BssHII, uniformly labeled with [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol), and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 20 μg of RNA for each sample was hybridized, processed for degradation by RNase A, and the resulting protected bands analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gels as described (40Plet A. Eick D. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 319-328PubMed Google Scholar). For c-fos constructs the starting construct was p19/1, which contains a 4-kilobaseNaeI-BamHI mouse genomic DNA fragment under the control of the human metallothionein IIa promoter (41Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Muller R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Large deletions were generated using unique XhoI, XbaI, andSalI restriction sites and religation as indicated. Intron 1 small deletions were generated with exonuclease III onXhoI-linearized p19/1, followed by blunt-ending by S1 nuclease treatment and religation. Plasmids containing overlapping deletions were selected and sequenced. pMT-globin was derived from p19/1 after deleting the BamHI-BamHI c-fos fragment and replacing it with a rabbit β-globin genomic fragment. pFos-globin contained the rabbit β-globin gene under the control of the c-fos promoter contained in theSmaI-PvuII DNA fragment spanning nucleotides −500 to −19 relative to the transcription initiation site (42Rech J. Fort P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The CaM kinase II catalytic subunit (amino acids 1–290) was derived from plasmids pSG5-192 I (inactive) or pSG5-192 A (active) (Ref. 43Cruzalegui F.H. Kapiloff M.S. Morfin J.P. Kemp B.E.

These fragments were cloned in the pHOOK-2 vector to produce CaM-KIIi-HOOK and CaM-KIIa-HOOK. The CaM kinase IV catalytic subunit (amino acids 1–313) was obtained from plasmid RSV-CaM-KIV (Ref. 44Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, kindly provided by S. Soderling) by HindIII andBglII digestion and cloned in pHOOK-2 vector to produce CaM-KIVa-HOOK. 5 × 105exponentially growing cells were treated with various inhibitors for 1 h prior to A23187 stimulation for 10 min as indicated and then lysed as described previously (45Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. 5 μg of whole cell extracts were fractionated by electrophoresis through 8.5% SDS gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After a quick dip into methanol, membranes were saturated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V). Primary antibodies (anti-phospho-Thr183/Tyr185 ERK or anti-phospho-Ser133 CREB) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same medium at a 1/1000 dilution. After 3 washes with TBST, an anti-rabbit IgG antibody was added at a 1/5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody complexes were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit) after 6 washes 5 min each with TBST. CaM-activated kinases were purified through a small scale quick batch binding of a whole cell extract (100 μg) to a calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene). Activity was measured by incubating the immobilized kinases for 10 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of a mixture containing 100 μm auto Camtide II, 2 μm each of PKC and PKA inhibitor peptides, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2. Incorporated radioactivity was monitored by liquid scintillation after spotting 25 μl of reaction mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and several washes with 0.75% phosphoric acid, according to the supplier's recommendations. We initially analyzed the response of mouse Ltk− fibroblasts to agents that elevate intracellular levels of calcium and/or cAMP, since these pathways were shown to synergize in c-fosactivation (46Li S.L. Godson C. Roche E. Zhao S.J. Prentki M. Schlegel W. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 47Ran W. Dean M. Levine R.A. Henkle C. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8216-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In Ltk− cells, PMA, IBMX + 8-Br-cAMP, or calcium ionophore (A23187) generated only a minor induction of c-fos mRNA (Fig.1 A). In contrast, co-treatment with A23187 and either PMA or IBMX + 8-Br-cAMP gave rise to a much stronger induction of c-fos (Fig. 1 A). Notably the signal was still high after 4 h of stimulation by a combination of A23187 + IBMX + 8-Br-cAMP, whereas it was undetectable 90 min after serum refeeding (Fig. 1 B). This strong induction was sensitive to actinomycin D (data not shown; Fig. 4), indicating that it resulted from an increase in de novotranscription.Figure 4c-fos intragenic sequences confer calcium inducibility to a heterologous promoter. A, exponentially growing Ltk− cells, stably transfected with p19/1 (lanes 1–3) or p19/1ΔNsiI-MstII (lanes 4–6), were stimulated for 1 h with A23187, followed by actinomycin D as indicated. B, exponentially growing Ltk− cells, stably transfected with either pMT-globin (lanes 1 and 2) or pFos-globin (lanes 3 and 4), were induced for 1 h with A23187 as indicated. RNA from cells left untreated (−) or treated as indicated (+) was processed for Northern blot analysis as described in the legend of Fig. 1. A mouse c-fos cDNA probe was used in A and a rabbit genomic DNA probe was used inB. In all cases membranes were rehybridized to a ratgapdh probe for normalization. The band marked by anasterisk in the upper panels of panel B, lanes 3 and 4, represent a globin splicing intermediate (53Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This was confirmed by a run-on analysis carried out on nuclei prepared from cells treated for 1 h with A23187, 8-Br-cAMP and IBMX (Fig.2). The labeled nascent transcripts were hybridized to two DNA fragments spanning the 5′-half of the murine c-fos gene. The first one, (A), contains the first exon and the 3′-half of the first intron. The second (B), spans the 3′-half of the first intron, the second exon and the 5′-half of the second intron. Previous work has shown that c-fos transcription can be regulated in part at the level of elongation (34Collart M.A. Tourkine N. Belin D. Vassalli P. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Lee G. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4579-4587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Plet A. Eick D. Blanchard J.M.

Piechaczyk M. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5657-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and fragment A contains the premature termination site mapped in vitro (39Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Jeanteur P. Lebleu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2832-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Prior to stimulation, a signal was detected on the promoter proximal fragment, whereas that from fragment B was disproportionately low, especially upon correction for the amount of uridine transcribed into RNA hybridizing to each fragment. Induction gave rise to a small increase in transcription of fragment A, together with a strongly enhanced signal from fragment B. Thus, in Ltk− cells the endogenous c-fos gene is regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation. Interestingly, A23187 also acts to stabilize c-fos mRNA. Cells were stimulated for 1 h with A23187 + IBMX + 8-Br-cAMP, and then actinomycin D was added for the indicated times (Fig.3 A). c-fos mRNA was still detectable 4 h after actinomycin D addition, whereas the same level was obtained with a 1-h actinomycin D chase after serum induction (Fig. 3 B). The synergy between calcium ionophore and the other inducers suggests that both upstream and downstream regulatory elements are required for a full response to calcium in these cells. To address the contribution of regions downstream from the promoter to the calcium effect, we transfected Ltk− cells with a construct expressing the mouse c-fos gene under the control of the human metallothionein IIa promoter (MTLIIa) (p19/1; Ref. 41Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Muller R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which has high basal activity. A23187 alone was sufficient to substantially induce (60-fold) the transfected gene (Fig.4 A), unlike the endogenous c-fos gene (see above). A slightly reduced induction (30-fold) was observed with a mutant lacking the 3′-untranslated region (p19/ΔNsiI-MstII) that was previously shown to enhance mRNA stability (49Fort P. Rech J. Vie A.

This inhibition is mediated by an arginine-rich domain localized between amino acids 1487–1500 of the HCV polyprotein. The data presented here indicate that the arginine-rich domain, when embedded in recombinant fragments of NS3, interacts with the catalytic site of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibits the phosphorylation mediated by this enzyme in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a direct binding of PKC to the NS3 fragments leads to an inhibition of the free shuttling of the kinase between the cytoplasm and the particulate fraction. In contrast, a peptide corresponding to the arginine-rich domain (HCV (1487–1500)), despite also being a PKC inhibitor, did not influence the PKC shuttling process and was transported to the particulate fraction by the translocating kinase upon activation with tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Using the tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate -stimulated respiratory burst of NS3-introduced neutrophils as a model system, we could demonstrate that NS3 is able to block PKC-mediated functions within intact cells.

Fischer E.H. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4379-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In fact, this NS3 protein sequence mediates the inhibition of PKA activity. The catalytic subunit of the kinase directly binds to the viral protein, and consequently the cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of the kinase is slowed down (8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arginine residues are also known to be recognition motifs of substrates and autoregulatory regions of numerous serine/threonine specific protein kinases (9Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This is the reason for overlapping specificities of the kinases with regard to their substrates (10Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or to their inhibition mediated by inhibitory peptides resembling their autoinhibitory domains (11Smith K.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that a peptide (HCV (1487–1500)) that reproduces the PKA binding domain of NS3 mentioned above is recognized by another serine/threonine protein kinase, the PKC. The peptide directly interacts with the kinase and serves as an excellent substrate for the enzyme (12Borowski P. Heiland M. Resch K. Laufs R. Schmitz H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the arginine-rich sequence embedded in a larger fragment of the HCV polyprotein interacts with the catalytic domain of PKC, as observed in the case of PKAin vivo (8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By means of these protein-protein interactions, the PKC functions could be blocked or slowed down. These interactions may be a new important aspect of pathogenesis of the HCV infection. In the present study we investigate the mechanisms by which PKC interacts with NS3 in vitro. Furthermore, we examine certain biological effects controlled by PKC in cells harboring the viral protein. Our results provide the first evidence that NS3 affects PKC functions by a complex mechanism similar to the one that impairs the functions of PKA. Affinity-purified rat brain PKC isolated according to the method described previously (13Borowski P. Roloff S. Medem S. Kühl R. Laufs R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Hilz (University of Hamburg). Human HCV-positive antisera against NS3 and NS4 of HCV were kindly provided by Dr. Polywka (University of Hamburg). Peptides were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography by Dr. Kullmann (Zentrum für Molekulare Neurobiologie of the University of Hamburg). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 125I-labeled protein A (30 mCi/mg) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.N-Succinimidyl [2,3-3H]propionate and125I were purchased from DuPont. Antibody (MC5) specific for α-,βI- and βII-PKC-isoforms and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Blood from healthy volunteers was kindly provided by Dr. Roos (Abteilung für Transfusionsmedizin, University of Hamburg). Highly purified neutrophils (> 95%) were prepared from freshly drawn blood by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation, dextrane sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of red cells (14Markert M. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and kept at 37 °C in humified air containing 10% CO2. The introduction of proteins or peptides by protease permeabilization was performed as described previously (15Lemons R. Forster S. Thoene J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The persistence of the introduced proteins in neutrophils was determined as follows. The introduced cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium, and at regular time intervals aliquots of the cell were harvested for immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified anti-NS3 antiserum. The signals were measured by counting the radioactivity of [125I]protein A-labeled bands. The stability of the introduced peptide was measured with 3H-labeled HCV (1487–1500) (see below). Aliquots of the [3H]HCV (1487–1500)-introduced cells were analyzed by 20% SDS/PAGE. The dried gels were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film supplemented by intensifying screen (BioMax TranScreen). The parts of the gel containing the peptide were cut out and subjected to scintillation counting. The respiratory burst of neutrophils was analyzed by determing the rate of superoxide production by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c using visible absorption spectroscopy (14Markert M. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The HCV proteins HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) and HCV polyprotein-(1923–2023) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (5Borowski P. Heiland M. Oehlmann K. Becker B. Kornetzky L. Feucht H.-H. Laufs R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the expression of HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615), the DNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the sense primer, 5′-TCTGAATCGGCCGGGAGATACTGCTCGG-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-GTGAATTCAAGAAGTGCGACGAAC-3′, under standard conditions (16Feucht H.-H. Zöllner B. Polywka S. Laufs R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the vector pTrxFus downstream of the thioredoxin gene (TRX) and expressed inEscherichia coli. The fusion protein TRX-HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615) was purified by affinity chromatography on aminophenylarsine oxide-agarose as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The purification procedure was completed by gel filtration chromatography (HiLoad, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purity of the proteins was verified by silver staining after SDS/PAGE. The protein kinase C activity was determined according to the method of Hannun and Bell (17Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9341-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a mixed micells assay with modifications described previously (5Borowski P. Heiland M. Oehlmann K. Becker B. Kornetzky L. Feucht H.-H. Laufs R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters were determined by a nonlinear regression analysis using ENZFITTER (BioSoft), and the graphical analyses were performed with SIGMA PLOT (Jandel Corp.). To label proteins with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), equal volumes of the protein solution (5 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and of FITC (1 mg/ml in 0.5m NaHCO3/Na2CO3 buffer, pH 7.5) were mixed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The modified proteins were isolated with Sephadex G-25 in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and concentrated with Microcentrifuge filters (10 kDa) (Millipore). The FITC labeling of the GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) did not affect its binding to PKC in an overlay assay. The3H-labeling of HCV (1487–1500) was performed withN-succinimidyl [2,3-3H]propionate according to the procedure described by Muller (18Muller G.H. J. Cell Sci. 1980; 43: 319-328PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was applied to a HA-Ultrogel column (approximately 5 mg peptide/1 ml matrix), and the column was washed with 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.8. Bound peptide was eluted with 0.5 mammonium acetate, pH 9.5, and the fraction was freeze-dried for 24 h. PKC (50 pmol) was radioiodinated in a reaction with Iodogen (1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3,6-diphenylglycouril) as described by Judd (19Judd R.C. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unbound radioactivity was separated on a NICK Column (Sephadex G-50, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with TTBS buffer (see below). Immunoblot analyses were performed as described by Towbin et al. (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The transferred proteins were probed with antisera (diluted 1:1000) and then with rabbit anti-mouse or with rabbit anti-human antibodies followed by binding to [125I]protein A. The nitrocellulose was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The protein binding was investigated in an overlay method as described previously (8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate was performed as described previously (8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils (107cells) were introduced and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium for 4 h as described above. Thereafter the cells were washed and suspended in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum for 30 min. The medium was replaced by medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (at a final concentration of 0.5 mCi/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. During this incubation, TPA treatment (100 nm) was carried out for 5 and 20 min before the end of labeling. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with cold 150 mm NaCl, and extracted with 100 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 2 mm N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin for 5 min at 30 °C. The extracts were boiled for 10 min and centrifugated at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were mixed with SDS sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Heat stable proteins serving as PKC substrates in in vitro reactions were partially purified according to the method described by Mahadevan et al. (22Mahadevan L. Atiken A. Heath J. Foulkes J.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were washed with cold 150 mm NaCl and resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 2 mm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. The suspension was processed in a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes of glass) and centrifugated at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifugated at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in the same buffer as mentioned above supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged again at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for the in vitrophosphorylation assays. It should be mentioned that p80 present in the preparation showed the same migration pattern in SDS/PAGE as the p80 phosphorylated in intact cells (Ref. 22Mahadevan L. Atiken A. Heath J. Foulkes J.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and data not shown). Introduced neutrophils were plated on coverslips, dried, fixed with acetone for 10 min at 4 °C, air dried, and incubated with Hoechst number 33258 (2′-[4-Hydroxyphenyl]-5-[4-methyl-1-piperazinyl]-2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole) (5 μm in H2O) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with destilled water the coverslips were placed in glycerol containing 10% (v/v) phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.5, and 0.1% (w/v) 1,4-phenyldiamin. The cells were viewed with a Zeiss AXIOPLAN microscope equipped with fluorescence illuminator and photographed on Kodak film. The cytosolic and particulate fractions of the neutrophils were prepared as described above (22Mahadevan L. Atiken A. Heath J. Foulkes J.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured according to the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The comparison of the amino acid sequence of the NS3 arginine-rich region: Arg1487-Arg-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Gly-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ile-Tyr-Arg1500with the sequence of the PKC autoregulatory domain revealed a similarity. A synthetic peptide reproducing the sequence above served as an excellent substrate for the kinase and inhibited the kinase activity competitively in respect of other substrates (12Borowski P. Heiland M. Resch K. Laufs R. Schmitz H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Therefore, we now examined the possibility that NS3 interacts via its arginine-rich region with PKC in vitro and affects PKC-mediated functions in vivo. To obtain sufficient amounts of HCV proteins, we cloned and expressed the proteins in E. coli. Because the entire NS3 protein was not found to be readily soluble (Ref. 24Warrener P. Tamura J.K. Collett M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), we investigated the interaction between NS3 and PKC, using the well characterized C- and N-truncated form of the NS3 protein (HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525)) (5Borowski P. Heiland M. Oehlmann K. Becker B. Kornetzky L. Feucht H.-H. Laufs R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second NS3 fragment that also contains the amino acid sequence HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615) was synthesized to ascertain the specificity of the NS3-PKC interaction. The position of both fragments within the NS3 is schematically represented in Fig. 1. The assays performed were controlled with a further fragment of HCV polyprotein containing amino acid residues 1923–2043 (HCV polyprotein-(1923–2023)). All proteins were numbered according to their position within the HCV polyprotein (6Takamizawa A. Mori C. Fuke I. Manabe S. Murakami S. Fujita J. Onoshi E. Andoh T. Yoshida I. Okayama H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We used the overlay method to analyze the specific physical interactions between NS3 or its derived peptide fragments and PKC. Equimolar amounts of the fusion proteins; GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525), GST-HCV polyprotein-(1923–2043), and TRX-HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615) as well as of GST and TRX were immobilized on nitrocellulose sheets, and their binding to125I-labeled PKC was determined. Both proteins GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) and TRX-HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615) were found to bind PKC. A lack of binding of the kinase to GST-HCV polyprotein-(1923–2043) as well as to GST and TRX demonstrated the specificity of these interactions. Interestingly, at all protein concentrations tested, GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) showed a higher binding capacity than TRX-HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615) (Fig.2 A). In further experiments, we analyzed the PKC binding to NS3 in competition binding assays. Increasing amounts of GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) were immobilized on nitrocellulose and incubated with 125I-labeled PKC in the presence of HCV polyprotein-(1487–1500) or PKC-derived peptide (PKC (19Judd R.C.

We performed a further study in which derivatives of HCV (1487–1500); a peptide with a scrambled sequence 1487–1500 and substituted analogues [Lys1487, Lys1488]HCV (1487–1500) and [Ile1487, Ile1488]HCV (1487–1500) were tested on their ability to inhibit the binding of the PKC to the immobilized GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525). These compounds were previously demonstrated to bind and inhibit the PKC at a lower level compared with the parent peptide (12Borowski P. Heiland M. Resch K. Laufs R. Schmitz H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The incubation of the immobilized GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) with125I-labeled PKC in the presence of the derivatives of HCV (1487–1500) reveals, in comparison with the HCV (1487–1500) a reduced binding of PKC. These results suggest that the catalytic site of PKC binds NS3 via the arginine-rich region HCV (1487–1500). It is conceivable that such an involvement of the catalytic site of the kinase in protein-protein interactions affects its activity. Indeed, our previous studies indicated that a similar interaction between PKA and NS3 resulted in an inhibition of PKA kinase activity (5Borowski P. Heiland M. Oehlmann K. Becker B. Kornetzky L. Feucht H.-H. Laufs R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the substrate phosphorylation by PKC in the presence of HCV proteins in vitro. Experiments performed with histone IIIS as a substrate revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the kinase activity by GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525). When myelin basic protein and histone H2B were used as substrates, the GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) concentrations that were required to give a 50% inhibition of substrate phosphorylation (IC50) varied significantly (Fig.3 A). The kinetic analysis of the inhibition revealed a mixed type of inhibition (Fig.3 B). Studies performed with TRX-HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615) also revealed significant differences between the IC50 for the phosphorylation of different substrates and a mixed type of inhibition. This suggests, in analogy to the inhibition of PKA by NS3 observed previously, a complex interaction between PKC, its substrate, and the inhibiting viral protein. Previous studies that investigated the subcellular distribution of NS3 in HCV-infected cells demonstrated its cytoplasmatic localization (26Krawczynski K. Beach M. Bradley D. Kuo G. di-Bisceglie A.M. Houghton M. Reyes G.R. Kim J.P. Choo Q.-L. Alter M.J. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 622-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, NS3 fragments GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) and TRX-HCV polyprotein-(1400–1615) introduced into HEp-2 cells were also detected in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear region (Ref. 8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). In the following experiments, we examined the subcellular localization of the introduced GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) in neutrophils as well. The HCV protein was labeled with FITC and introduced into the cells, and the nuclei of the introduced cells were stained with Hoechst dye (33258). The results of the double labeling (Fig. 4) confirmed the subcellular localization of the introduced GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) and the exclusion of the protein from the nuclei. Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions obtained from GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525)-introduced cells revealed that approximately 40% of the introduced protein was associated with the particulate and approximately 60% with the cytosolic fraction. Separation of cell organelles according to the method of Storrie and Madden (27Storrie B. Madden E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) did not reveal any association of the introduced protein with cell organelles. These procedures affected the cell viability only marginally, as tested with trypan blue. The evaluated half-life of the introduced GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) was longer than 12 h (data not shown). Because NS3 binds and inhibits PKC, we investigated these interactions with regard to their ability to inhibit the translocation of PKC from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction. GST-HCV polyprotein-(1189–1525) as well as GST were introduced into the cells, and the effect of the proteins on the subcellular distribution of PKC was evaluated after treatment of the cells with 100 nm TPA for 5 min. Subsequently, the cytosolic and particulate fractions were separated and examined for their PKC content by immunoblot. The result indicates that the NS3 fragment was able to inhibit the TPA-induced redistribution of PKC (Fig.5 A). Very similar results were obtained with HEp-2 cells (res"

We show that TR endocytosis is not affected by tyrosine kinase or protein kinase C inhibitors, but is inhibited by one serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H-89. Inhibition occurred within 15 min, was completely reversible after H-89 withdrawal, and was specific for endocytosis rather than pinocytosis since a TR mutant lacking an internalization signal was not affected. Interestingly, H-89 also inhibited the internalization of a TR chimera containing the major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain cytoplasmic tail, indicating that the effect was not specific for the TR. Since H-89 inhibits a number of kinases, we employed a permeabilized cell endocytosis assay to further characterize the kinase. In permeabilized 3T3-L1 cells, addition of pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptides of casein kinase II (CKII) blocked TR internalization by more than 50%, whereas pseudosubstrates of cyclic AMP-dependent kinase A, protein kinase C, and casein kinase I had no effect. Furthermore, addition of purified CKII to the cell-free reactions containing CKII pseudosubstrates reversed the endocytosis block, suggesting that CKII or a CKII-like activity is required for constitutive endocytosis.

This interaction provides a mechanism for promoting TR clustering in clathrin-coated pits and subsequent internalization. The AP-2 adaptor complex is also required for clathrin recruitment (4Virshup D.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Lin H.C. Moore M.S. Sanan D.A.

Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and, together with its direct interaction with receptor cytoplasmic tails, links the cell surface receptors to the clathrin-based endocytic machinery (reviewed in Refs. 8Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 9Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive characterization of many of the proteins involved in endocytosis, little is known about how the clathrin-based endocytic machinery is regulated. What is evident, however, is endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits is blocked during mitosis (10Fawcett D.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1965; 13: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), starting at prophase and continuing through telophase (11Berlin R.D. Oliver J.M. Walter R.J.

In A431 cells, the mitotic block appears to arrest clathrin assembly at various stages of invagination (13Pypaert M. Lucocq J.M. Warren G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the continuous activity of an enzyme (or enzymes) is required for vesicle formation (reviewed in Ref. 14Smythe E. Warren G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Using in vitro reconstitution assays, mitotic cytosol has been shown to inhibit invagination of clathrin-coated pits and one of the factors responsible is cdc2 kinase (15Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The role of kinases in receptor trafficking has been demonstrated in studies on the asialoglycoprotein receptor which show that a tyrosine kinase is required for endocytosis (16Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3401-3406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic tail (17Fallon R.J. Danaher M. Saylors R.L. Saxena A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11011-11017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also shown that components of the clathrin-coated vesicles can be phosphorylated by vesicle-associated kinases, but the functional significance of these results remains unclear (18Morris S.A. Mann A. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3354-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of cell surface proteins including CD4 (19Disanto J.P. Klein J.S.

A. 1984; 81: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) are rapidly endocytosed following phorbol ester-mediated stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC). However, the PKC phosphorylation site in TR, Ser24, is not required for this effect (24Zerial M. Suomalainen M. Zanetti-Schneider M. Schneider C. Garoff H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2661-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Davis R.J. Meisner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16041-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC is acting at the level of the internalization machinery rather than the receptor itself (26Eichholtz T. Vossebeld P. van Overveld M. Ploegh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22490-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schonhorn J.E. Akompong T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3698-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A has also been reported to be required for the internalization of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (28Goretzki L. Mueller B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that a number of kinases are somehow involved in receptor internalization. In yeast, casein kinase I (CKI) has been shown to be required for constitutive endocytosis of the pheromone receptor Ste3p (29Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although a similar function for CKI has not been described in mammalian cells, one intriguing model proposed (29Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) is that CKI activity regulates endocytosis by phosphorylating the adaptor complex, thereby activating the complex to promote coat assembly and endocytosis. However, since the adaptor complex in yeast is homologous to the recently identified AP-3 complex found at the endosome (30Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 31Le Borgne R. Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29451-29461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), it remains possible that CKI is required for vacuolar targeting rather than endocytosis. In the present study, we examined the role of protein kinases in TR internalization. Using pharmacological approaches and in vitro assays that reconstitute endocytosis, we found that compounds that inhibit tyrosine kinases and a number of serine/threonine kinases including PKA, PKC, and CKI have no effect on TR endocytosis. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that suggests casein kinase II, or a closely related kinase, is required. HeLa and 3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. A431 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) and 2 mml-glutamine. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% chicken serum and 1% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 2% (v/v) tryptose phosphate broth (Difco, Detroit, MI), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Biotinylated transferrin (B-Tf) was prepared as described previously (32Lamaze C. Baba T. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol.

The protein kinase A pseudosubstrate peptide TYADFIASGRTGRRNAI (36Glass D.B. Cheng H.C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Control peptides containing the same amino acid composition but lacking the consensus phosphorylation sites were also prepared for CKI (STIRRDDDEE) and CKII (EEEEEERRRT) by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Peptides were prepared as 20 mm stocks in KSHM buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 85 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm magnesium acetate), the pH was adjusted to 7.4, and the peptides were stored at 4 °C. Genistein and H-89 were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Genistein was prepared fresh for each experiment and H-89 was stored as a 48 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide at −20 °C. Herbimycin A was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) and stored as a 1.75 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide at −20 °C. All other inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Calphostin incubation was performed in the presence of fluorescent light as described by the manufacturer (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Wild-type, S24A, Δ3–18, 29–59 TR, Δ3–59 TR, and Ii-TR chimeras were expressed in CEF as described previously (1Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 7.5 × 104cells/cm2 in 24-well tissue culture plates 24 h before the assay (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). Cells were then incubated in serum-free media for 1 h at 37 °C. Inhibitors were included during this incubation period for times ranging from 15 min to 1 h. Internalization rates were determined using the IN/SUR method (38Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (37Kang S. Liang L. Parker C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20644-20652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ATP levels were determined using an ATP detection kit (Calbiochem). Briefly, HeLa cells were incubated in the absence or presence of inhibitors for 60 min. An energy-depleting system consisting of 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 5 mm sodium azide was used as a control. Treated cells were placed on ice, scraped at 4 °C in HEPES buffer (25 mmHEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% NaN3), and aliquots were transferred to a cuvette and the volume adjusted to 200 μl with HEPES buffer. 200 μl of releasing agent was added to each sample and the reaction was started by adding 100 μl of the luciferin-luciferase enzyme mixture. Luminescence was measured at 560 nm on a Turner Designs Luminometer (TD-20/20) and the ATP concentrations were determined from a standard calibration curve. The protein concentration of the lysate was determined using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad) and total ATP was measured as micromoles of ATP per mg of protein lysate. Rat brains snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen were obtained from Pel-Freeze (Rogers, AR), sliced into small pieces, and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer containing an equal volume of KSHM buffer and protease inhibitors (Complete mini-inhibitors, Roche Diagnostic Corp. (Indianapolis, IN)). The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 11,200 rpm in a Beckman J20 rotor, and the supernatant was centrifuged for an additional 45 min at 39,000 rpm using a Beckman Ti75 rotor. The resultant supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in 250-μl aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Stock cytosol protein concentrations ranged from 15 to 30 mg/ml. Permeabilized cells were prepared and endocytosis assays were preformed as described (32Lamaze C. Baba T. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Permeabilized 3T3-L1 cells were used in place of A431 cells and were prepared by submerging plates in liquid nitrogen before scraping. After cytosol depletion, 10 μl of cells were incubated with pseudosubstrates or inhibitors for 10 min before addition to the reaction mixtures. Briefly, incubations were performed for 20 min at 37 °C in 40-μl reaction volumes containing an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, and 40 units/ml creatine phosphokinase), 6 mg/ml cytosol, and 2 μg/ml B-Tf and 0.2% bovine serum albumin in KSHM assay buffer. Reactions were stopped on ice, cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatants were carefully removed. Control reactions contained an ATP-depleting system (5 mm glucose and 40 units/ml hexokinase) in place of the ATP-generating system and 6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in place of the cytosol. The cell pellets were resuspended in avidin (50 μg/ml in 0.2% bovine serum albumin in KSHM buffer) and processed as described (32Lamaze C. Baba T. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Results are presented as the total cell-associated B-Tf (determined from cells not treated with avidin) endocytosed in an ATP- and cytosol-dependent manner. 200 μg of dephosphorylated casein (Sigma) was incubated with either 62.5 ng of CKII (Calbiochem) or 28 ng of CKI (Promega) and 20 μm[γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) in a total reaction volume of 40 μl of KSHM buffer. Inhibitors and pseudosubstrates were included at various concentrations, as specified in the figure legends. The phosphorylation reactions were performed at room temperature for 10 min and terminated with the addition of 10 μl of SDS sample buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and casein phosphorylation was quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To determine the role of kinases in TR internalization, endocytosis was monitored in HeLa and A431 cells after pretreatment with tyrosine kinase and PKC inhibitors. Using the IN/SUR method for measuring the internalization rate (38Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TR endocytosis was found to be rapid in both HeLa and A431 cells under control conditions (k e = 0.123 min−1and 0.99 min−1, respectively, TableI) and comparable to TR internalization rates measured in other cells types (37Kang S. Liang L. Parker C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20644-20652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After pretreatment of the HeLa and A431 cells at 37 °C for 1 h or more with a number of tyrosine kinase and PKC inhibitors, the results indicate that TR endocytosis was unaffected (Table I). Interestingly, however, when the genistein concentration was increased to 500 μm (the concentration required to block asialoglycoprotein receptor endocytosis (16Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3401-3406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 5-fold higher than is normally used to inhibit tyrosine kinases (40Wu-Wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8103-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), TR endocytosis was inhibited by more than 50% (data not shown). This suggests that a kinase, not necessarily a tyrosine kinase, was required for TR endocytosis.Table IEffect of various tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors on transferrin receptor internalizationDrug pretreatmentHeLa cellsA431 cellsInternalization rateInternalization efficiencyInternalization rateInternalization efficiencymin−1%min−1%Control (none)0.123 ± 0.017 (7)aMean ± S.E., number in parentheses is the number of independent experiments.100bPercentage of internalization efficiency of untreated controls was arbitrarily set to 100%.0.099 ± 0.028 (6)100Tyrosine kinase inhibitors Genistein (100 μm)0.120 ± 0.041 (4)980.079 ± 0.004 (4)80 Herbimycin A (8 μm)0.124 ± 0.006 (3)1010.116 ± 0.024 (3)117 Tyrphostin A25 (50 μm)0.113 ± 0.020 (3)920.086 ± 0.030 (3)87 Tyrphostin B46 (50 μm)0.118 ± 0.007 (3)960.081 ± 0.019 (3)82PKC inhibitors Calphostin C (100 nm)0.128 ± 0.032 (6)1040.118 ± 0.035 (4)119 Iso-H-7 (50 μm)0.109 ± 0.005 (5)89not tested— Bisindomaleimide (200 nm)0.112 ± 0.006 (3)910.105 ± 0.010 (3)106a Mean ± S.E., number in parentheses is the number of independent experiments.b Percentage of internalization efficiency of untreated controls was arbitrarily set to 100%. Open table in a new tab When a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H-89, was tested, TR endocytosis was dramatically inhibited in both HeLa and A431 cells (Fig. 1). After as little as a 15-min pretreatment with 150 μm H-89, TR internalization decreased by ∼50% (average of 47 and 55% in HeLa and A431, respectively). Inhibition of endocytosis was confirmed in steady-state distribution assays at 37 °C in HeLa cells as well, which demonstrated that the TR surface expression increased from 20.4 ± 0.2 to 38.8 ± 6.1% (mean ± S.D. from three experiments). Calculation of the estimated internalization rate from the steady-state distribution (1Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) suggests that after H-89 treatment, the TR internalization rate was 44% of the untreated control, indicating that recycling was not affected. To confirm that H-89 was not indirectly inhibiting TR internalization by altering cell viability, the capacity of the cells to recover after H-89 treatment was tested. In this experiment, HeLa cells were treated for 1 h in 150 μm H-89, after which the media was exchanged with fresh inhibitor-free media every hour. After a 4-h recovery period, TR internalization was then compared with untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, TR internalization returned to 116% of control values, demonstrating that the H-89 inhibition was reversible. To assess the possible cytotoxic effects of H-89 using another approach, we measured cellular ATP concentrations immediately after a 1-h pretreatment in 150 μm H-89. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the treated cells had 95% of the control levels of ATP. Taken together, the results suggested that H-89 treatment was not causing a general cytotoxic effect that indirectly inhibited TR endocytosis. As a further control, we treated cells with 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 5 mm sodium azide and found that intracellular ATP levels dropped 55%, confirming that changes in ATP levels were easily monitored (Fig. 2 B). To determine if H-89 treatment also affected TR internalization in nontransformed cells, endocytosis was examined in primary CEFs. This experimental system also allowed us to test human TR mutants and chimeras (Fig. 3 A) in order to determine the structural features of the TR cytoplasmic tail required for H-89 inhibition. Pretreatment of cells expressing the wild-type TR with 150 μm H-89 inhibited TR endocytosis by more than 80% (Fig. 3 B). The only phosphorylation site in the TR cytoplasmic tail is serine 24, a PKC phosphorylation site (41Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Kelleher D.J. Anderson J.K. Mole J.E. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9034-9041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this site was not important for the H-89 inhibition, internalization assays were performed on CEF expressing a mutant TR lacking this site (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 C, S24A was inhibited to the same extent as wild-type TR, suggesting that the presence of the phosphorylation site on the receptor was not required for the inhibitory effect. To determine if the H-89 inhibition was specific for the TR, we tested two additional mutants, a TR cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant, Δ3–18, 29–59 TR, that lacks most of the cytoplasmic tail but contains the internalization signal (1Collawn J.F.

As shown in Fig. 3 C, endocytosis of both the deletion mutant and the MHC class II invariant chain chimera were dramatically inhibited by H-89 treatment, suggesting that the wild-type TR is not the only cell surface molecule affected. Furthermore, since the MHC class II invariant chain contains a di-leucine internalization signal rather than a tyrosine-based signal (37Kang S. Liang L. Parker C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20644-20652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), this indicates that receptors containing either class of internalization signal are equally inhibited by H-89 treatment. One possible concern with the H-89 inhibition was that the H-89 was having an indirect effect on membrane dynamics, in which case pinocytosis would be affected as well. To test for this, we monitored the internalization of a TR mutant that lacked the endocytosis signal, Δ3–59 TR (Fig. 3 A), after H-89 treatment. The results in Fig. 3 C show that internalization of the Δ3–59 TR mutant was not affected by this treatment, indicating that inhibition was not due to nonspecific membrane effects. H-89 inhibits a number of kinases including PKA, PKC, CKI, and CKII by competing for the ATP-binding site (43Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which kinase was being inhibited, we tested pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitors of several serine/threonine kinases in an in vitro assay that reconstitutes endocytosis (32Lamaze C.

Upon addition of exogenous cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system, B-Tf becomes sequestered in deeply invaginated coated pits and vesicles. Under these conditions, the B-Tf is inaccessible to avidin and is scored as internalized Tf (32Lamaze C. Baba T. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the initial characterization, we confirmed that H-89 inhibited B-Tf internalization in permeabilized 3T3-L1 cells. At 150 μmH-89, B-Tf uptake was inhibited by 38.1 ± 4.9% (mean ± S.D). At 300 and 500 μm, B-Tf internalization was inhibited by 66.2 ± 5.8 and 95.7 ± 3.5%, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Next, we tested TR endocytosis after H-89 treatment in intact 3T3-L1 cells using the standard IN/SUR assay and 125I-labeled Tf. As shown in Fig.4 B, TR endocytosis was blocked by ∼54% after a 15-min pretreatment with 150 μm H-89, demonstrating that H-89 inhibited TR endocytosis in 3T3-L1 cells in both assays. Since the IC50 of H-89 for CKII is 137 μm (43Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

The results show that H-89 at concentrations of 150, 300, and 500 μm inhibited CKII activity 43, 56, and 62%, respectively. This indicated that the loss of CKII activity in the in vitro phosphorylation assay paralleled the loss of B-Tf internalization after H-89 treatment, suggesting a possible link. Next, we tested the ability of pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitors of PKA, PKC, CKI, and CKII to block B-Tf internalization in permeabilized 3T3-L1 cells. During a 10-min preincubation period when cytosol, ATP, GTP, and an ATP-regenerating system are added, we introduced pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitors of PKA, PKC, CKI, or CKII at 2-fold higher concentrations than the IC50 of the peptides for the kinases. As shown in Fig.5 A, the PKA, PKC, and CKI pseudosubstrate peptides had little effect on B-Tf endocytosis, whereas the CKII peptide inhibited endocytosis by more than 70%. Comparison of the pseudosubstrate peptide to a control peptide containing the same amino acid composition but lacking the consensus site for CKII, indicated that the pseudosubstrate peptide effect was specific an"

In contrast, the prokaryotic enzymes, as typified by Escherichia coli MutM (Fpg) (3Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As part of a study of DNA glycosylase sequences, we recently screened several new DNA glycosylase superfamily homologs for base excision activity. 2A. Gogos, D. Jantz, S. Senturker, D. Richardson, M. Dizdaroglu, and N. D. Clarke, manuscript in preparation. In the course of that screen, we found that Methanococcus jannaschii open reading frame MJ0704 has oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. The specificity of this enzyme for oxoG (and for a second guanine oxidation product, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG)) was established using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze bases released by the enzyme following treatment of oxidized DNA.2 Because this enzyme appears to be the first archaeal oxoG DNA glycosylase to be identified, it is important to investigate its properties in detail. The mjOgg gene was cloned as described previously.2 The gene was expressed in E. colias a fusion to maltose-binding protein using the vector pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs). The fusion polypeptide contains a Factor Xa cleavage site that is expected to produce mjOgg with two extraneous residues (Ile and Ser) at the N-terminal end. The fusion protein was expressed in the mutM− strain NR12389 (provided by Dr. Roel M. Schaaper). The cells were grown in rich broth to mid-log phase and induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cell pellet was collected, resuspended in Buffer A (0.5 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with the addition of protease inhibitors (Pefabloc SC, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and frozen at −20 °C overnight. The cells were lysed by sonication. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography of the crude bacterial lysate on an amylose column, eluted with 10 mm maltose in Buffer A, and then cleaved using Factor Xa protease (≈12 μg/mg of protein for 42 h at room temperature). The digestion mixture was heated to 65 °C for 50 min, which effectively precipitates any uncleaved fusion protein. Following centrifugation to remove precipitated protein, mjOgg was diluted 5-fold to reduce the salt concentration and was applied to a heparin column. mjOgg was then eluted with Buffer A (0.5 m NaCl) in an essentially homogeneous form. mjOgg was stored at −20 °C in Buffer A plus 10% glycerol at a concentration of 40 μg/ml. The two complementary oligonucleotides synthesized were d(5′-GTGACGATCTGCAGTGGCCTTCTGCAGGCA-3′) and d(3′-CACTGCTAGACGTCAXCGGAAGACGTCCGT-5′), where Xstands for A, C, G, or T and G stands for oxoG. The deprotection of oligomers containing oxoG was supplemented with 0.25m β-mercaptoethanol. The oxoG-containing oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech G-25 microspin columns. The duplexes were annealed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 3% glycerol by heating to 75 °C for 5 min and then cooling to room temperature. Unless otherwise noted, the substrates were incubated with mjOgg at 37 or 50 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. The final concentrations were 8 nm substrate and 0.8 nm mjOgg (10:1 ratio). To measure glycosylase activity (production of abasic DNA), aliquots were treated with 1 m piperidine and incubated at 98 °C for 30 min to cleave the DNA strand at the abasic site. To measure lyase activity (production of backbone-cleaved DNA), aliquots were removed and the reaction was stopped by extraction with phenol/chloroform. All mixtures were ethanol-precipitated, air-dried, resuspended in 90% formamide loading buffer, and electrophoresed on a denaturing gel. The gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The fraction of cleaved DNA was calculated from the intensity of the substrate and product bands. A correction was made for the amount of the substrate that comigrates with the product band in the absence of enzyme (typically ∼5% for lyase and ∼10% for glycosylase assays). This high background precluded the use of substantially higher substrate:enzyme ratios. Initial reaction rates were obtained by fitting to a modified Michaelis-Menten equation that included an exponential decay term to model the loss of enzyme activity. The effect of pH was examined using 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 3% glycerol and one of the following: (a) 30 mm MES, pH 6.4; (b) 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.15; (c) 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3; (d) 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.8; (e) 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1; (f) 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5; (g) 20 mm Ches, pH 9.0; (h) 20 mm Ches, pH 9.5; or (i) 20 mm CAPS, pH 10.1. All pH values were measured at 50 °C. The protein (0.8 nm) was preincubated with 0, 100, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 and 30 min in a total volume of 95.5 μl. The substrate was added at the start of the reaction to a concentration of 8 nm. The protein stock was preincubated for different time periods. To start the reaction, 1 μl of the preincubated enzyme was added to the substrate in a total volume of 50 μl. The final concentrations were 32 nm protein and 320 nm substrate. The K129S mutant was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis by combining polymerase chain reaction fragments that overlap in sequence. Primers 1 and 2 produce the 5′-gene fragment and 3 and 4 produce the 3′-gene fragment; primers 2 and 3 are complementary to one another and encode the amino acid substitution. The sequences of the four primers are as follows: primer 1, 5′-GCCGCCACCATGGAAAAC-3′; primer 2, 5′-GATTGGATATAGTGAGGCGAGCCA-3′; primer 3, 5′-TGGCTCGCCTCACTATATCCAATC-3′; and primer 4, 5′-GGGGGGGATCCCTACTATTTTAAAACTTTTCCTGTCCTTAAATA-3′. TheNcoI/BamHI fragment of the final polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into the pMal-c2 vector, and its sequence was verified. The protein was overexpressed and purified as described for the wild-type protein. Circular dichroism data were obtained for mjOgg and the K129S mutant using an Aviv CD60 spectropolarimeter. Thermal denaturation was performed using a Peltier device temperature controller at a rate of 2 °C/min at 222 nm. mjOgg was readily purified as a fusion protein, proteolytically cleaved, and purified to homogeneity by preferential heat denaturation and heparin chromatography. As expected for a protein from a thermophilic organism, mjOgg is thermally stable, denaturing at 93 °C (Fig. 1). However, the enzyme loses activity under normal assay conditions. This apparent loss of activity is not due to depletion of substrate because the extent of the reaction is similar even when the DNA concentration is increased 10-fold. It also does not appear to be due to product inhibition because incubation of the enzyme under assay conditions in the absence of substrate led to the complete loss of activity within 1 h (data not shown). To obtain rate constants from these data, the time courses were fit with the assumption that the loss in activity follows an exponential decay once it is diluted into the assay mix. Testing under a variety of conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that the protein is more stable in the presence of bovine serum albumin and DNA and less stable in high levels of salt (200 mmNaCl). The protein as purified and stored is quite stable, however. Incubation of the enzyme stock for 3 h at 50 °C decreased the activity by only one-third (data not shown). The enzyme activity is optimal near pH 8.5 (Fig. 2).Figure 2pH profile. Error barsindicate errors in the calculated fit to the kinetic data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enzyme is 6-fold more active at 50 °C than at 37 °C (Fig.3). It seems probable that the enzyme is active at significantly higher temperatures, but this was not investigated because of concern for the denaturation of substrate. At both 37 and 50 °C, the rate of the combined glycosylase/lyase activity is very similar to that of the glycosylase activity alone, indicating that the lyase reaction is fast once the base has been excised (Fig. 3). This is consistent with a proposed mechanism for bifunctional glycosylases like mjOgg (14Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this proposal, a lysine common to this subgroup of enzymes (Lys-129 in mjOgg) displaces the base by nucleophilic attack and, in a concerted reaction, forms a Schiff base with the ring-opened sugar that promotes β-elimination and cleavage of the backbone. To verify the importance of Lys-129, it was mutated to serine, and the mutant protein was assayed for DNA glycosylase activity toward both oxoG·C and oxoG·A base pairs. No activity was detected on either strand. The loss of activity is probably not due to disruption of the structure because the thermal denaturation properties of the mutant are nearly the same as those of the wild type (data not shown). mjOgg was assayed for glycosylase/lyase activity against all four oxoG·N substrates. Unlike other oxoG DNA glycosylases, mjOgg has little specificity for the base opposite oxoG (Fig.4). Although there is a slight preference for pyrimidines over purines, the strong preference for oxoG·C base pairs that characterizes yeast and hOgg1 was not observed (7Bjoras M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 12Girard P.M. Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). M. jannaschii is a hyperthermophilic methanogen and a member of the euryarchaeotal kingdom of the Archaea. It was originally isolated from a deep sea vent and grows optimally at 85 °C and at pressures up to 200 atm. The entire genome sequence of M. jannaschii has been determined, making it the first archael organism to be sequenced in its entirety (16Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S.M. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). mjOgg was originally identified in a screen of several novel DNA glycosylase homologs whose specificity was not readily predicted from considerations of sequence similarity. Fig. 5 illustrates the point that mjOgg is very distantly related to the other known oxoG-specific enzymes that belong to the same glycosylase superfamily. Indeed, the degree of sequence similarity between mjOgg and its eukaryotic counterparts is not dramatically greater than between mjOgg and other members of the superfamily that have very different specificity.2 As a result conventional sequence clustering methods fail to group mjOgg with eukaryotic homologs of similar specificity. However, principal component analysis of the sequence family does cluster mjOgg properly with its eukaryotic counterparts.2 mjOgg differs from the eukaryotic oxoG DNA glycosylases not only within the common catalytic domain but also in lacking an extended segment N-terminal to this domain (Fig. 5). The existence of this N-terminal sequence in the eukaryotic enzymes and its absence in mjOgg may be related to differences in specificity. In particular, the N-terminal region of the eukaryotic enzymes could be responsible for their specificity for C opposite the excised oxoG. There is precedence for this suggestion; we have recently shown that MutY, an adenine DNA glycosylase belonging to the same superfamily as mjOgg, uses a C-terminal domain unique to its subfamily to confer opposite-base specificity for oxoguanine over guanine (13Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6374-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have established that mjOgg is an authentic DNA lyase as well as a DNA glycosylase. The lyase reaction probably proceeds through β-elimination, as has been shown for related enzymes, because the product of the lyase reaction has slightly slower electrophoretic mobility than the product of the piperidine-cleaved glycosylase product. This is the expected result because β-elimination leaves a 3′-phosphoribosyl moiety rather than the 3′-phosphate left by piperidine cleavage. Lys-129 is analogous to lysines in other homologs that have been shown to be necessary for lyase activity because they form a Schiff base to the sugar (12Girard P.M. Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). According to the prevailing model for the mechanism of bifunctional DNA glycosylases (14Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), this lysine has also been proposed to be the nucleophile that cleaves the glycosylic bond. Consistent with this model, mutation to serine resulted in the complete loss of glycosylase activity. However, this experiment, and similar ones in the literature, should be interpreted with caution. The amino acid found at this position is correlated quite strongly with the substrate specificity of the enzyme; homologs that exise oxidized bases (e.g. mjOgg and endonuclease III) tend to have a lysine at this position, those that excise alkylated purines tend to have a tryptophan, and those that excise adenine mispairs tend to have a hydroxyl-containing amino acid. Thus, loss of glycosylase activity could be due to the loss of substrate recognition rather than the loss of an active site nucleophile. mjOgg adds important information to our understanding of the endoIII/MutY/AlkA superfamily because it is the first oxoG-specific glycosylase in this family to be characterized from a noneukaryotic organism. Although clearly belonging to the same family, mjOgg is remote in sequence from its eukaryotic homologs. This divergence in sequence helps to identify the residues that are most characteristic of oxoG DNA glycosylases2 and can provide insights into the way these enzymes recognize substrate and how they evolve. mjOgg also differs from the eukaryotic oxoG DNA glycosylases in its relative indifference to the base opposite oxoG. Further characterization of other distantly related members of the family will shed further light on the sequence features responsible for substrate specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2024861066,"Abstract Topoisomerase II-catalyzed DNA transport requires coordination between two distinct reactions: ATP hydrolysis and DNA cleavage/religation. To further understand how these reactions are coupled, inhibition by the clinically used anticancer drug etoposide was studied. The IC50 for perturbing the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium is nucleotide-dependent; its value is 6 μm in the presence of ATP, 25 μm in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, and 45 μm in the presence of ADP or no nucleotide. This inhibition was further characterized using steady-state and pre-steady-state ATPase and decatenation assays. Etoposide is a hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibitor of the ATPase activity with aK i(app) of 5.6 μm; no inhibition of ATP hydrolysis is seen in the absence of DNA cleavage. In order to determine which steps of the ATPase mechanism etoposide inhibits, pre-steady-state analysis was performed. These results showed that etoposide does not reduce the rate of binding two ATP, hydrolyzing the first ATP, or releasing the second ADP. Inhibition is therefore associated with the first product release step or hydrolysis of the second ATP, suggesting that DNA religation normally occurs at one of these two steps. Multiple turnover decatenation is inhibited when etoposide is present; however, single turnover decatenation occurs normally. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of their contribution to our current model for the topoisomerase II mechanism."

The type III receptor (TRIII) is a proteoglycan that lacks significant intracellular signaling or enzymatic motifs but may facilitate transforming growth factor-β binding to other receptors, stabilize multimeric receptor complexes, or segregate growth factor from activating receptors. Because various agents or events that regulate osteoblast function rapidly modulate TRIII expression, we cloned the 5′ region of the rat TRIII gene to assess possible control elements. DNA fragments from this region directed high reporter gene expression in osteoblasts. Sequencing showed no consensus TATA or CCAAT boxes, whereas several nuclear factors binding sequences within the 3′ region of the promoter co-mapped with multiple transcription initiation sites, DNase I footprints, gel mobility shift analysis, or loss of activity by deletion or mutation. An upstream enhancer was evident 5′ proximal to nucleotide −979, and a silencer region occurred between nucleotides −2014 and −2194. Glucocorticoid sensitivity mapped between nucleotides −687 and −253, whereas bone morphogenetic protein 2 sensitivity co-mapped within the silencer region. Thus, the TRIII promoter contains cooperative basal elements and dispersed growth factor- and hormone-sensitive regulatory regions that can control TRIII expression by osteoblasts.

Type I and type II receptors (TRI and TRII) have intracellular kinase domains responsible for heterologous receptor activation or downstream signal transduction (1Franzen P. tenDijke P. Ichijo H.

The type III receptor (TRIII), a membrane-anchored proteoglycan also termed betaglycan, is thought to have a biological function distinct from TRI and TRII (5Wang X.-F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E.

The rat TRIII gene encodes a 91.6-kDa protein core that is modified by approximately 10 kDa of N-linked glycosyl residues and 150–200 kDa of heparan and chondroitin sulfate side chains. TRIII has a relatively short, 43-amino acid cytoplasmic domain that lacks commonly recognized protein docking or kinase like motifs but is enriched with serines and threonines to approximately 42% (5Wang X.-F.

Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). TRIII is prevalent on many fetal cells, where it can be the most abundant TGF-β-binding site. All TGF-β isoforms bind to TRIII with comparably high affinity, although this is about 3–5-fold less than that for TRI and TRII (7Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Certain cells lack TRIII but maintain TGF-β sensitivity. Nonetheless, TRIII may attract and enhance TGF-β binding to TRII and form a more stable ligand-receptor complex (6Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). On certain cell types this appears more pronounced or limited to the TGF-β2 isoform (8Cheifetz S. Hernandez H.

Moreover, disproportionately high levels of TRIII may sequester and possibly limit its binding to signaling receptor complexes (10Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amount of TRIII is thought to vary with development, with differentiation, or in a tissue-specific manner. For example, TRIII levels are prevalent on less differentiated bone, endothelial, adrenocortical, prostate, and muscle cells but are rapidly regulated by agents or events that control cell differentiation. On bone cells, TRIII levels decrease when differentiation is enhanced by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 but rise in response to glucocorticoid or agents that increase intracellular cAMP (10Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Centrella M. Kim J. Pham T. Casinghino S. Rosen V. Wozney J. McCarthy T.L.

TRIII levels also decrease with endothelial cell differentiation in three-dimensional culture and during the transition from myoblasts to myotubes. In the ventral prostate, TRIII levels rise after castration and are resuppressed by androgen administration (14Sankar S. Mahooti-Brooks N. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Madri J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1436-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Ewton D.Z. Spizz G. Olson E.N. Florini J.R. J. Biol.

Analogous to the effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on osteoblasts (10Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), corticotropin produces a cAMP-dependent increase in TRIII on adrenal cells (17Cochet C. Feige J.J. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we predicted that complex changes in TRIII are regulated in part by constitutive, developmental, and hormone-dependent genomic elements and in this way control how the effects of TGF-β are perceived within various tissues. To define how these events might occur at the molecular level, we cloned the promoter for rat TRIII. Because we previously defined situations and agents that regulate TRIII levels on bone cells, we have also begun to assess regions within the promoter that may account for constitutive and hormone-dependent changes in its expression by osteoblasts. A rat liver genomic DNA library was partially digested with Sau3AI and cloned into the BamHI site of the EMBL3 Sp6/T7 phage vector (CLONTECH). Approximately 6 × 105plaques were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and screened by hybridization with a 0.4-kb rat TRIII cDNA probe containing 334 bp of 5′-untranslated region and 61 bp of coding sequence (5Wang X.-F.

The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with a random primer labeling kit (New England Biolabs). Hybridization was for 20 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 0.1% SDS, 5× SSPE (0.9 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmsodium phosphate pH 8.3), and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Positive clones were rescreened twice, recombinant bacteriophage were plaque purified, and phage DNA was isolated by cell lysis (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Phage inserts were cloned into pBluescript-KSII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and mapped with an assortment of restriction endonucleases, and subclones were produced by restriction site cleavage (see Fig. 1 and Table I). Double-stranded plasmid DNA was denatured with 0.2 n sodium hydroxide and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To produce pTR3/3.7, a 3.7-kb StuI/SacI fragment was generated by cleavage with StuI and partial digestion with SacI and inserted at SmaI andSacI sites by blunt and cohesive end ligations. pTR3/1.9 (forward orientation) and pTR3/1.9R (backward orientation) were produced by inserting the 1.9-kb fragment generated by SacI digestion into the SacI site, and orientation was determined by restriction fragment analysis. pTR3/1.8 was produced by digestion with MscI and SacI and inserted atSmaI and SacI sites by blunt and cohesive end ligations. pTR3/1.9δ was produced by deleting the 1.1-kb internal fragment flanked by NcoI sites from pTR3/1.9. pTR3/0.4K was produced by inserting the 0.4-kb KpnI to SacI fragment into homologous vector sites. pTR3/0.4S, pTR3/0.2B, pTR3/0.2E, and pTR3/0.1A were produced by deleting theKpnI/SmaI, the KpnI/BssHII, the KpnI/EagI or theKpnI/ApaI fragments from pTR3/0.4K, respectively. pTR3/0.3P was produced by PCR with GLprimer 2, complementary to DNA sequences in pGL2-Basic, and primer TR3F1 (5′-CGGGGTACCAGGAGGAGAGGAGGGGCAGGAGGAGGAGTTTC-3′), defined by nucleotides −534 to −503 from the rat TRIII promoter and modified at the 5′ end to include a KpnI cleavage site (underlined) to facilitate cloning the PCR product into pGL2-Basic. pTR3/0.3Pμ, introducing a mutation within a putative GC box, was produced by substituting two nucleotides (bold) in forward primer TR3F1M (5′-CGGGGTACCAGGAGGAGAGGTTGGGCAGGAGGAGGAGTTTC-3′). pTR3/0.2Bμ, introducing a mutation within a putative Sp1-binding sequence, was produced by substituting three nucleotides (bold) in forward primer TR3F2M (5′-CGGGGTACCGCGCGCCCGACCCTTTCCGCGCGTGT-3′), defined by nucleotides −441 to −416 from the rat TRIII promoter, and retaining the BssHII restriction cleavage site at the 5′ end (underlined) for subsequent plasmid cloning.

Osteoblast-enriched cell cultures were prepared from parietal bones of 22-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) by methods approved by Yale Animal Care and Use Committee.

Total RNA was extracted from primary osteoblast-enriched cell cultures with acid guanidine-monothiocyanate, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and dissolved for assay. To assess TRIII mRNA, total RNA was fractionated on a 1.5% agarose and 2.2 mformaldehyde gel, blotted onto charged nylon and hybridized with a32P-labeled cDNA restriction fragment of plasmid λbg7 encoding rat TRIII (6Lopez-Casillas F.

To assess start sites of TRIII transcription, two antisense cRNA probes were synthesized. For probe 1, pTR3Bs/5XN was linearized with KpnI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase, generating a fragment corresponding to nucleotides −692 to −179. For probe 2, the TRIII genomic fragment corresponding to nucleotides −692 to −273 was cloned into pBluescript KS II by PCR.

https://openalex.org/W2024000827,"Related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) (also known as PYK2) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase related to the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) p125FAK. RAFTK is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to various stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, changes in osmolarity, elevation in intracellular calcium concentration, lysophosphatidic acid, and bradykinin. Overexpression of RAFTK induces activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (also known as stress-activated protein kinase), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p38 MAPK. The present studies demonstrate that RAFTK binds constitutively to the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP1. In contrast to PTP1B, overexpression of wild-type SHPTP1 blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. The results further demonstrate that RAFTK is a direct substrate of SHPTP1 in vitro. Moreover, treatment of PC12 cells with bradykinin is associated with inhibition in tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in the presence of SHPTP1. Furthermore, in contrast to the phosphatase-dead SHPTP1 C453S mutant, overexpression of wild-type SHPTP1 blocks interaction of RAFTK with the SH2-domain of c-Src and inhibits RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation. Significantly, cotransfection of RAFTK with SHPTP1 did not inhibit RAFTK-mediated c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that SHPTP1 plays a negative role in PYK2/RAFTK signaling by dephosphorylating RAFTK.

Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of RAFTK Y402F mutant failed to activate MAPK, these findings, taken together, indicated that RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation and RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation depend on induction of c-Src kinase activity by binding of c-Src to autophosphorylated Tyr-402 on RAFTK. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-402 of RAFTK are presently unclear. The present studies have addressed the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase, SHPTP1, in RAFTK-mediated signaling. The results demonstrate that RAFTK binds constitutively to SHPTP1. We also show that, by contrast to PTP1B, overexpression of SHPTP1 blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK and its subsequent interaction with the SH2 domain of Src. Furthermore, SHPTP1 selectively inhibits certain functions of RAFTK, such as RAFTK-mediated activation of MAPK but not of JNK.

Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK antibody, and precipitated proteins were sedimented with protein A-Sepharose beads. The resultant immune complexes were incubated in an assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. Following the autophosphorylation reactions, the beads were extensively washed to remove excess ATP, and immunopurified autophosphorylated RAFTK was then incubated with buffer or column purified SHPTP1 for another 30 min.

Kinase reactions were then stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 293T cells were also transfected with 2 μg of c-Raf-1 (provided by J. Auruch, MGH, Boston) with HA-MAPK with or without wild-type SHPTP1 or SHPTP1 C453S mutant. Total cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies, and protein complexes were incubated in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and MBP as described. After 15 min, kinase reactions were then stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Total lysates were also separately analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Raf, anti-HA, or anti-SHPTP1 antibodies. PC12 cells were transiently cotransfected with FLAG-RAFTK and wild-type SHPTP1 or SHPTP1 C453S mutant. Following transfections, cells were treated with 1 μm bradykinin for 5 min. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Src antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. The protein bands were scanned by densitometer, and signal intensities were plotted and expressed as arbitrary values ± S.D from three independent experiments. Lysates from transfected 293T cells were incubated with affinity purified GST-c-Src-SH2 domain (Upstate Biotechnology) fusion protein linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (30Kumar S. Pandey P. Bharti A. Jin S. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25654-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The resulting protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% detergent and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Tyr(P) or anti-RAFTK antibodies. 293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-RAFTK. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK. The resulting immune complexes were incubated in an assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. Following the autophosphorylation reactions, the beads were extensively washed to remove excess ATP and then incubated with buffer or column purified SHPTP1 for 30 min. Following dephosphorylation reactions, RAFTK protein was eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads in 0.5% SDS elution buffer. Reaction mixtures were then diluted with lysis buffer to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS and then incubated with GST-Src-SH2 domain fusion protein for 45 min. Following extensive washing, the beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. U-937 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHPTP1. The results demonstrated reactivity with a 70-kDa protein (Fig.1 A). In the reciprocal experiment, analysis of anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates with anti-RAFTK confirmed constitutive interaction between these two proteins (Fig.1 B). Since treatment with bradykinin induces activation of RAFTK (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musachhio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), we investigated whether bradykinin affects the interaction between RAFTK and SHPTP1. The results demonstrate that treatment of PC12 cells with bradykinin is associated with little, if any, increase in the association of RAFTK with SHPTP1 (Fig. 1 C). The association between RAFTK and SHPTP1 was further analyzed by overexpression of wild-type FLAG-SHPTP1 and FLAG-RAFTK in human embryonic kidney 293T cells that do not express RAFTK (20Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Incubation of total cell lysates with preimmune rabbit serum was used as a negative control. Anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates and total cell lysate were used as positive controls. Reactivity at 70 kDa with anti-FLAG immunoblot in anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitates confirmed association of these two proteins (Fig. 1 D). To evaluate the stoichiometry of the interaction between RAFTK and SHPTP1, we subjected U-937 cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK, and we analyzed the supernatants before and after immunoprecipitation by immunoblotting with anti-SHPTP1. Signal intensities from lysates before and after anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitation were compared by laser densitometric scanning. The results demonstrate that approximately 60% (average of three independent experiments) of RAFTK is associated with SHPTP1 (Fig.2 A). Similar results were obtained in a reciprocal experiment in which the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SHPTP1, and we analyzed the supernatants before and after immunoprecipitation by immunoblotting with anti-RAFTK (Fig. 2 B). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in response to various inducers has suggested that RAFTK is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musachhio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 3Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11354-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously, overexpression of RAFTK in 293T cells leads to approximately a 12–15-fold induction of its tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.3 A). RAFTK autophosphorylates itself on Tyr-402 (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of RAFTK Y402F or dominant negative RAFTK K-M mutants in 293T cells did not increase their level of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). The ability of SHPTP1 to bind to RAFTK suggests that this protein might be a physiological target for SHPTP1. To address this issue, we cotransfected 293T cells with wild-type RAFTK and SHPTP1 or phosphatase-dead SHPTP1 (SHPTP1 C453S) (31Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmüller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and analyzed anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Importantly, in contrast to SHPTP1 C453S mutant, the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated RAFTK is substantially reduced in 293T cells transfected with wild-type SHPTP1 (Fig. 3 B, top panel). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-RAFTK antibodies to ensure that the immunoprecipitates contained equal levels of RAFTK (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). Total cell lysates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHPTP1 (Fig. 3 B, bottom panel). Since overexpression of SHPTP1 can nonspecifically dephosphorylate all potential targets within the cell, 293T cells were transfected with RAFTK with or without SHPTP1, and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). As a control, RAFTK Y402F mutant was separately transfected in 293T cells. The results demonstrate that many other phosphotyrosyl proteins are not affected by SHPTP1 expression, indicating that this phosphatase does not indiscriminately dephosphorylate all potential targets within the cell (Fig. 3 C, upper panel). This effect was without any difference in the RAFTK protein levels (Fig. 3 C, lower panel). Moreover, to confirm specificity of SHPTP1, a non-SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, was overexpressed with RAFTK, and anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). The results demonstrate that, by contrast to SHPTP1, overexpression of PTP1B failed to block tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig. 3 D). Taken together, these findings indicated that activation of RAFTK by autophosphorylation on Tyr-402 is specifically regulated by SHPTP1 in vivo. Whereas the present findings demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type SHPTP1 is associated with inhibition of autophosphorylation of RAFTK, we asked whether RAFTK is a direct target of SHPTP1 in vitro. To address this issue, we immunopurified RAFTK from 293T cells transiently overexpressing RAFTK and incubated with purified recombinant phosphatase-active SHPTP1 protein in the presence of cold or [γ32-P]ATP. RAFTK autophosphorylation was determined in these reactions either by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) or by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, respectively. The results demonstrate that autophosphorylation of RAFTK is inhibited in the presence of SHPTP1 in vitro (Fig. 4,A and B). Since purified SHPTP1 dephosphorylates RAFTK autophosphorylation site Tyr-402 in vitro, we asked whether dephosphorylation of RAFTK affects its kinase function. To address this, we first incubated purified SHPTP1 with immunopurified RAFTK in the presence of ATP. After washing, RAFTK activity was measured in a kinase reaction containing [γ32-P]ATP and poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) as a substrate (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musachhio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate little, if any, change in RAFTK-mediated phosphorylation of poly(Glu-Tyr) in the presence or absence of SHPTP1 (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, these findings indicate the following: (i) RAFTK is a direct substrate of SHPTP1, and (ii) dephosphorylation of RAFTK by SHPTP1 does not inhibits its kinase activity. To assess the functional significance of the interaction of RAFTK with SHPTP1 in vivo, we asked whether SHPTP1 regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK induced in response to bradykinin. To address this issue, PC12 cells were transfected with wild-type or C453S mutant of SHPTP1 and then treated with bradykinin. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). Three independent experiments were performed, and signal intensities were determined by densitometric analysis. The results demonstrate that treatment of PC12 cells with bradykinin is associated with induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig. 5 A) as well as induction of MAPK activity (Fig. 5 B). Importantly, by contrast to SHPTP1 C453S mutant, analysis of anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) in cells overexpressing wild-type SHPTP1 demonstrated over 3-fold inhibition in tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig. 5 C, left and right panels). Collectively, these findings support SHPTP1-mediated dephosphorylation of RAFTK in vitro as well as in response to bradykinin. Few insights are available regarding the functional role of RAFTK. Recent studies have shown that RAFTK regulates stress-induced c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 20Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously, the finding that overexpression of RAFTK in 293T cells induces phosphorylation of GST-Jun (20Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) supported RAFTK-mediated activation of JNK in these cells (Fig.6 A). The activation of JNK was dependent on expression of the RAFTK protein (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). Increased activation of JNK in these assays was without any change in JNK protein levels (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). Since RAFTK is activated by certain agents such as tumor necrosis factor-α or UV light and contributes to activation of JNK (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar,20Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Pandey P.

Davis R.J. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10140-10144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we asked whether SHPTP1 is involved in regulation of this stress pathway. To address this issue, we cotransfected pEBG-SAPK and RAFTK with SHPTP1 or SHPTP1 C453S mutant and assayed glutathione-Sepharose protein precipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Jun fusion protein. The results demonstrate that cotransfection of pEBG-SAPK with SHPTP1 or SHPTP1 C435S mutant was associated with similar levels of RAFTK-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these findings indicated that, although SHPTP1 regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK, this effect is independent of RAFTK-dependent activation of JNK. Recent studies have demonstrated that RAFTK also regulates MAPK activation (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musachhio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Since MAPK is activated in response to stimuli that induce tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK, we examined the possibility that overexpression of SHPTP1 could influence RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation. To address this issue, we cotransfected HA-MAPK and FLAG-RAFTK with FLAG-SHPTP1 or FLAG-SHPTP1 C453S mutant and analyzed anti-HA immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of MBP. As reported previously (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), overexpression of RAFTK in 293T cells induced the phosphorylation of MBP by a mechanism dependent on the level of RAFTK expression (Fig. 7 A). More importantly, in contrast to the SHPTP1 C453S mutant, cotransfection of RAFTK with SHPTP1 significantly blocked RAFTK-dependent activation of MAPK (Fig. 7 B). The inhibition of RAFTK-induced activation of MAPK was without any change in RAFTK or MAPK protein levels (Fig. 7 B). These findings indicated that SHPTP1 plays a negative role in RAFTK signal transduction by acting on signaling molecules that regulate RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation. Previous studies have shown that c-Raf-1 acts upstream to the MAPK pathway (32Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 30837-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Minden A. Lin A. McMohan M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7030-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the inhibitory effect of SHPTP1 on RAFTK-mediated activation of MAPK, demonstrated in the present study, could be a result of SHPTP1-mediated dephosphorylation of other targets downstream of RAFTK, such as c-Raf-1. To address this issue, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-MAPK with c-Raf-1 and wild-type or C453S mutant of SHPTP1. Following transfections, total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, and in vitro immune complex kinase assays were performed using MBP as a substrate. The results demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type SHPTP1 has little, if any, effect on c-Raf-1-mediated activation of MAPK (Fig. 7 C). Taken together, these findings suggested that RAFTK-dependent activation of MAPK is inhibited by SHPTP1-mediated dephosphorylation of RAFTK. Previous studies have demonstrated that RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation and RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation depend on c-Src kinase activity stimulated by binding to autophosphorylated Tyr-402 on RAFTK (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the role of SHPTP1 in regulating the interaction of RAFTK with c-Src. To address this issue, RAFTK protein was immunopurified by transiently overexpressing FLAG-RAFTK in 293T cells. Immunopurified RAFTK was incubated in a kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Following extensive washing, autophosphorylated RAFTK protein was incubated with purified SHPTP1 protein for an additional 30 min. The resulting dephosphorylated RAFTK protein was eluted from the beads and subjected to incubation with GST-c-Src-SH2 domain fusion protein. Following fusion protein-binding reactions, the bound proteins were analyzed by autoradiography. The results demonstrate that incubation of SHPTP1 with RAFTK significantly inhibits the interaction of c-Src-SH2 domain with RAFTK (Fig. 8 A). In vitro binding experiments using a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of c-Src were also performed in lysates overexpressing wild-type RAFTK with or without wild-type or C453S SHPTP1. Lysate from overexpressing RAFTK Y402F mutant was separately used as control. GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Src was associated with binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated RAFTK but not to the RAFTK Y402F mutant (Fig. 8 B). In contrast to SHPTP1 C453S mutant, cotransfection of RAFTK with wild-type SHPTP1 completely blocked RAFTK interaction with the SH2 domain of c-Src (Fig. 8 B). To address further this issue in vivo, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-RAFTK and wild-type SHPTP1 or SHPTP1 C453S mutant. Cells were treated with bradykinin, and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Src antibody. The precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. The results demonstrate that, in concert with the in vitrofindings, overexpression of SHPTP1 significantly inhibits bradykinin-induced interaction of c-Src with RAFTK (Fig.8 C). Recent studies have shown that autophosphorylation of RAFTK on Tyr-402 leads to binding of the SH2 domain of c-Src and contributes to activation of MAPK (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Since SHPTP1 also associates with RAFTK, inhibition of RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation in the presence of SHPTP1 might be due to competition of SHPTP1 and c-Src for binding to RAFTK. To address this, 293T cells were cotransfected with wild-type SHPTP1 and FLAG-RAFTK or FLAG-RAFTK Y402F mutant, and anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHPTP1. The results demonstrate that, similar to wild-type RAFTK, RAFTK Y402F mutant also interacts with SHPTP1 (Fig. 8 D). Taken together, these findings indicated that SHPTP1 inhibits recruitment of c-Src to RAFTK by blocking the interaction of the SH2-domain of c-Src and not by competing for binding to RAFTK. Our results suggest that the tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP1 regulates autophosphorylation of RAFTK on Tyr-402, thereby inhibiting the interaction of the SH2 domain of c-Src with RAFTK. In this context, recent studies have shown that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase Csk (negative regulator of Src; see Ref. 35Nada S. Okada M. MacAuly A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) inhibits RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation and further indicate the role of Src in mediating RAFTK response. The present results indicate that SHPTP1 plays an important role in RAFTK-mediated MAPK activation. Our findings also demonstrate that SHPTP1-mediated dephosphorylation of RAFTK on Tyr-402 is not associated with inhibition of the kinase function of RAFTK. Other studies have shown that kinase activity of RAFTK is necessary for RAFTK-mediated induction of JNK (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In concert with these findings, the results of the present study demonstrate that SHPTP1 had no effect on RAFTK-mediated JNK activation. Other studies have shown that overexpression of RAFTK in rat and mouse fibroblasts leads to apoptotic cell death (36Xiong W.-C. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain and tyrosine kinase activity of RAFTK is required for efficient induction of apoptotic death (36Xiong W.-C. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoptosis induced by RAFTK is suppressed by overexpression of catalytically active c-Src (36Xiong W.-C. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) probably by activating the MAPK pathway. The present findings that RAFTK binds constitutively to SHPTP1 supports the existence of distinct RAFTK pools. Moreover, the finding that SHPTP1 down-regulates RAFTK-induced MAPK activation supports a role for SHPTP1 as a negative regulator of the RAFTK → MAPK cascade and regulates RAFTK-mediated apoptosis.

Although this group IA intron possesses the conserved secondary and tertiary structures found in all group I introns, it varies in important ways from the prototype Tetrahymena rRNA intron (4Michel F. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 585-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). In particular, the internal guide sequence that establishes the substrate specificity starts 220 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ splice junction, rather than the usual 14–20 nucleotides found in most other group I introns. The intron is AU-rich, and requires higher levels of Mg2+ for stabilization of the active structure than the GC-rich Tetrahymena group I intron. Like other group IA introns, the fifth intron of COB pre-mRNA (bI5) is also devoid of the peripheral RNA element, P5abc, that is important for stabilizing the catalytic core of theTetrahymena rRNA intron (5Cate J.H.

It is therefore conceivable that Cbp2 compensates for this RNA structure and stabilizes its RNA partner by contributing substantial binding energy in a manner similar to the CYT-18 protein of Neurospora (6Mohr G.

UV cross-linking, chemical, and enzymatic modification studies indicate that Cbp2 contacts bI5 at multiple sites in the catalytic core and peripheral RNA elements and stimulates the formation of the catalytically active structure (8Shaw L.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Chemical modification studies 1L. C. Shaw and A. S. Lewin, submitted for publication. show that Cbp2 binds to intron 5 RNA even in the absence of Mg2+ and nucleates the formation of the catalytic core by stabilizing the P4/P6 domain. Thus, Cbp2 appears to be involved in a dynamic process of stabilizing RNA structure both at the secondary and tertiary structure levels, stimulating the formation of the catalytically active RNA structure. Weeks and Cech (9Weeks K.M. Cech T.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 221-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Weeks K.M. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7728-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) provided a kinetic framework for both Cbp2-mediated and self-splicing reactions of intron 5 RNA. At low Mg2+ levels (5 mm), the self-splicing reaction is estimated to be 1,000-fold slower than the protein-facilitated reaction. At near saturating concentrations of Mg2+ (40 mm), the protein-independent reaction is still 8-fold slower, indicating that high levels of the cation cannot completely compensate for Cbp2 function. The self-splicing reaction has to proceed through two additional transitions compared with protein-stimulated splicing. The first step involves a transition in secondary structure to an intermediate state that is efficiently promoted by Mg2+. However, self-splicing must still overcome a second barrier, which is the transition from the intermediate to an active enzyme state that finally gives rise to products. The kinetics of Cbp2-mediated splicing, on the other hand, include two significant steps, namely, guanosine binding to the Cbp2-active intron 5 RNA complex followed by efficient conversion of this ternary complex to products. Studies on phosphorothioate substitution at the 5′ splice site and pH profiles indicate that at physiological pH the self-splicing reaction is limited by chemistry, whereas the Cbp2-facilitated reaction is limited by a conformational step (12Weeks K.M. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7728-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that Cbp2 binding compensates for at least two structural defects while increasing the rate of chemistry. The availability of a two-component in vitro system to study autocatalytic and protein-facilitated splicing offers the advantage of studying RNA catalysis in isolation or in combination with the RNA-binding protein simply by varying the Mg2+ and monovalent salt concentrations. Studies so far have focused on mapping the Cbp2 contact sites on bI5 RNA and the kinetics of splicing in the presence and absence of the protein. Little is known about the structure of Cbp2 protein or its interaction withbI5 from the protein point of view. To understand the role of Cbp2 in stimulation of splicing, we have attempted to identify potential RNA binding regions of Cbp2 using the technique of UV cross-linking and label transfer. Following the mapping of major contact sites, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to confirm the importance of various amino acid residues in these sites for interaction with intron 5 RNA and facilitation of splicing. UV cross-linking identified two major RNA contact sites in Cbp2, with the NH2-terminal site occurring within the first 37 residues of the protein. Mutagenesis of this region identified an RNA binding domain essential for protein-stimulated RNA catalysis. Plasmid pET15b-CBP2 was constructed by cloning theNdeI-ClaI fragment carrying the CBP2gene from pET3a-CBP2, downstream of the 6x histidine tag in the T7 expression vector, pET15b (Novagen). Escherichia coli strain JM109(DE3), which carries the T7 RNA polymerase gene on a lambda lysogen, was used for the expression of His-tagged Cbp2. Native Cbp2 protein was expressed from pET3a-CBP2 plasmid in BL21(DE3), anotherE. coli strain carrying the T7 RNA polymerase gene. This plasmid was constructed by introducing an NdeI site at the start codon of CBP2 gene by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and cloning the NdeI-SnaBI fragment between theNdeI-BamHI sites of pET3a expression vector (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The Cbp2 protein expressed from this construct is 20 amino acid residues shorter than the His-tagged version. An overnight culture of bacteria carrying the Cbp2 expression plasmid was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB/ampicillin medium at 1:100 dilution. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached anA 550 of 0.35, and the expression of Cbp2 was induced with 0.4–1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1–3 h. Cells were pelleted after addition of 17 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, snap frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −70 °C until purification. The His-tagged protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow (Qiagen) column. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of column buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 700 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazole, 17.5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Ti 42.1 rotor. The supernatant was loaded on a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column pre-equilibrated with 10 volumes of column buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of column buffer (1 mmimidazole) followed by 7.5 volumes of wash buffer (20 mmimidazole). Cbp2 protein was then eluted with 7.5 column volumes each of buffers containing 80 and 200 mm imidazole. The fractions containing Cbp2 (detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled and dialyzed twice against 1 liter each of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and once with a liter of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, and stored at −70 °C after rapid freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Native Cbp2 protein was isolated according to the purification protocol described by Shaw and Lewin (8Shaw L.C. Lewin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21552-21562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSPI5 DNA was purified by CsCl gradients and linearized with SmaI and used forin vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (2Partono S. Lewin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2562-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transcripts contain the entire intron 5 RNA sequence and the flanking exon sequences. The transcripts were internally labeled using [α-32P]UTP and/or [α-32P]ATP (ICN). Cbp2-RNA complexes were generated according to the UV cross-linking technique of Zamore and Green (14Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). 5 pmol of 32P-labeled bI5 transcripts were incubated at room temperature or 37 °C for 30 min with an excess of His-tagged Cbp2 or native Cbp2 in a low salt buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmNH4Cl) containing excess tRNA as a nonspecific competitor. Each sample was split into several 10-μl aliquots in a 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon) placed on ice and exposed to 600 mJ of UV radiation in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). The aliquots of each sample were pooled in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and treated with 0.32 μg/ml of RNase A and 100 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 2 h to remove uncross-linked RNA. The samples were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the band corresponding to Cbp2 excised after Coomassie Blue staining. The Cbp2 thus purified includes both the cross-linked and uncross-linked forms of the protein. The gel pieces were washed four times with distilled water over a period of 20 min, placed into appropriate cleavage buffer and thoroughly macerated with a Kontes Eppendorf pestle. The slurry was completely covered with the cleavage buffer and incubated overnight at appropriate temperature. The asparaginyl side chain has a tendency to form a cyclic imide that is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by hydroxylamine (15Bornstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 78: 132-145Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The cyclization is more favored in the context of a smaller amino acid-like glycine resulting in increased susceptibility of Asn-Gly bonds. Chemical cleavage of proteins with hydroxylamine generates relatively large peptides due to the infrequency of Asn-Gly bonds. Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) cleavage of Cbp2 was performed by overnight incubation of Cbp2 containing gel pieces in 2.4 mguanidine-HCl, 2 m hydroxylamine buffer, pH 9, at room temperature, as described above. LiOH was used to neutralize the guanidine-HCl and hydroxylamine-HCl. Cleavage with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoate (NTCB)2 was a two-step process. First, the thiol groups on cysteine residues of denatured proteins were modified to SCN groups by NTCB (16Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Degani Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), followed by cleavage at the amino group of the modified cysteine by exposure to alkaline pH conditions. Gel-purified Cbp2 protein was incubated in 2.4m guanidine-HCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m Tris acetate, pH 8, buffer at 37 °C for 2 h to denature the protein and reduce the disulfide bonds to SH groups. A 10-fold excess of NTCB (50 mm) over the total thiol was added to the gel slurry, and the incubation was continued for 0.5 h at the same temperature to effect modification of the SH groups to SCN groups. The slurry was filtered through a 0.22-mm low protein-binding cellulose acetate centrifugal filter (Corning-Costar), and washed once with distilled water. The slurry was later transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and incubated overnight in 2.4 m guanidine-HCl, pH 9, cleavage buffer at 37 °C. After cleavage, the slurry was filtered through a Costar filter, washed once with distilled water, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in the extraction buffer (0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate). On the third day, the gel slurry was heated at 85 °C for 5 min and rapidly filtered through a Costar filter to recover soluble peptides. The slurry was further incubated with 0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 20 min at room temperature and filtered to extract the residual peptides in the gel. The filtrates containing the peptides were pooled, dried in a Speed-Vac (Savant), resuspended in water, and precipitated overnight at −20 °C with 9 volumes of acidified acetone. Peptides were pelleted at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 20 min and resuspended in 15 μl of SDS gel-loading buffer. The samples were dried in a Speed-Vac to remove the residual acetone, brought to a final volume of 40 μl with water, resolved on 15% (for hydroxylamine) or 16.5% (for NTCB) Tris-Tricine gels (18Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), along with 14C-labeled low molecular weight peptide markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to x-ray film. The NH2-terminal RNA contact site on Cbp2 (identified by the UV cross-linking strategy) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to identify key residues for Cbp2 function. Mutations were designed to either delete the region of interest (residues 17–25) or make point mutations within that region. The XbaI-BamHI fragment encoding the first 97 codons of CBP2 from pET15b-CBP2 was subcloned into the M13mp19 vector and used as the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, performed according to the double primer method of Zoller and Smith (19Zoller M.J. Smith M. DNA. 1984; 3: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) using the mutagenic oligonucleotides listed in Table I. The resulting mutants were plaque purified, and the single-stranded DNA sequenced. The CBP2 segment carrying the mutation of interest was then re-cloned in pET15b-CBP2 expression vector and was sequenced using Sequenase 2.0 kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Table INH2-terminal mutations introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesisNameLengthSequences (5′ to 3′)DescriptionbasesAL26240TCTCCATGTTGAACAAATACAAGTAAAGAGAGGAACTGCCChanges RYRYKF to LYLYLF at aa 20, 22, 24AL26333CACCTGTGTGATATTGCCCTGTCTCCTCAADeletion of aa 17–28 of CBP2AL26442GATATTCTCCATGTTCAACTTCAACCTTAAACGAGAGGAACTChanges RYRYKF to RLRLKL at aa 21, 23, 25AL29030GTTGAACTTATACCTTAAACGAGAGGAACTChanges Tyr to Leu at aa 21AL29130CTCCATGTTGAACTTTAACCTGTAACGAGAChanges Tyr to Leu at aa 23AL292aAL292 also changes the codon usage for glycine at position 16 from CGC to GGU.36GTACCTGTAACGACCCTGTCTCCTCAATGAAACTTADeletion of SSS at aa 17, 18, 19AL29331GATATTCTCCATGTTCAACTTATACCTGTAAChanges Phe to Leu at aa 25a AL292 also changes the codon usage for glycine at position 16 from CGC to GGU. Open table in a new tab The activity of various mutant Cbp2 proteins was determined by an in vitro splicing assay (2Partono S. Lewin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2562-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).32P-labeled precursor RNA (1 pmol) containingbI5 was incubated with wild-type or mutant Cbp2 proteins in a 100-μl reaction including low salt buffer (see above), in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol and 2 units of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega), at 37 °C for 10 min. Splicing was initiated with 0.2 mm GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the reactions allowed to continue for varying lengths of time. Reactions were terminated by the addition of equal volumes of 90% formamide, 25 mm EDTA, and resolved on 4% polyacrylamide 8 murea gels and exposed to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Initial rates of splicing were determined by the fraction of exon products (ligated exons and 5′ exon) expressed as a fraction of the exon sequences present in the precursor. These assays were done essentially as described above but in the presence of a constant amount of the wild-type protein and increasing concentrations of mutant Cbp2 proteins. As a control, the concentration of wild-type Cbp2 was increased to the same level of total Cbp2 protein (wild-type and mutant) used in the above reactions but in the absence of mutant proteins. Spliced products were resolved on denaturing gels and quantitated using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The conformation of mutant Cbp2 proteins was determined by comparing the partial proteolytic profiles of wild-type and mutant Cbp2. Partial proteolysis was done by incubating 0.5–1 μg of the wild-type (native or heat-denatured) or the mutant Cbp2 protein with trypsin, at protease:Cbp2 ratios of 1:50 and 1:100 (w/w), for 1 h at room temperature, and the peptides were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The peptide profiles were detected by Western blotting performed according to Tobin et al. (20Tobin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), with a Cbp2-specific polyclonal antibody (a generous gift of Dr. Alexander Tzagoloff). The affinity of wild-type and mutant Cbp2 proteins for bI5 RNA was determined by the double-filter binding assay (21Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), with the exception that a charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+ from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in place of DEAE. Protein-RNA complexes were generated by incubating a low concentration (16 pm) of32P-labeled intron 5 RNA with increasing concentrations (0–4,000 pm) of wild-type or mutant Cbp2 in 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NH4Cl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. Duplicate reactions were filtered through a pre-soaked BA 85 nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) overlaid on a pre-wetted Hybond N+ nylon membrane, in a 96-well Dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The filters were washed four times with low salt buffer, and the radioactivity retained on both the membranes was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). UV photolysis provides a useful approach to determine the contact points between nucleic acid and protein, because it produces direct cross-links in contrast to chemical cross-linking agents. A free radical mechanism has been proposed to explain the process of UV cross-linking of amino acids to nucleic acid bases (22Shetlar M. Smith K. Photochemical and Photobiological Reviews. Plenum Press, New York1980: 105-107Crossref Google Scholar). The extent of photo-cross-linking also depends on the intrinsic structure of the nucleic acid or protein. Photochemical cross-linking has been adapted to detect protein bound to specific sites on double-stranded DNA using32P-labeled site-specific probes (23Safer B. Cohen R.B. Garfinkel S. Thompson J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This method permits transfer of 32P from specific phosphodiester bonds to amino acid residues at the interface upon photo-cross-linking (24Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 516-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have employed a similar method to detect intron 5 RNA binding sites on Cbp2 protein. We synthesized transcripts of bI5 (internally labeled with [α-32P]UTP), UV cross-linked them to purified Cbp2 under conditions that favor specific complex formation. We generated peptides from these complexes by chemical cleavage and detected the cross-linked peptides by label transfer using gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. To optimize the yields of cross-linked species, we varied the dosage of ultraviolet radiation used. In these experiments,32P-labeled transcripts were incubated with native Cbp2 under low salt conditions without GTP. Cbp2 binds to intron 5 RNA under these conditions and induces formation of the catalytic RNA conformation (8Shaw L.C. Lewin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21552-21562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Cbp2-RNA complexes generated were UV cross-linked in the presence of excess tRNA (added as a nonspecific competitor) (14Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), as described under “Materials and Methods.” The samples were irradiated at an increasing UV dosage ranging from 100 to 950 mJ. As a control, intron 5 RNA was irradiated with noncognate proteins, bovine serum albumin and the RNA-binding protein PUB1 (a gift from Dr. Maurice Swanson) (25Anderson J.T. Paddy M.R. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6102-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All samples were extensively treated with RNase A and RNase T1 to remove uncross-linked RNA, and the protein-RNA complexes were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). No cross-linked complex was observed with bovine serum albumin or PUB1 even at high doses of UV radiation. The extent of cross-linking of intron 5 RNA to Cbp2 was 2-fold higher at a UV dosage of 600 mJ than at 100 mJ and remained relatively constant at higher doses. Thus a UV dosage of 600 mJ was chosen as the lowest UV dosage that yielded optimal amounts of ribonucleoprotein complex. The Cbp2-RNA complexes thus generated were purified on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel fragments were then soaked in different chemical cleavage reagents like NH2OH and NTCB to generate peptides. The peptides were separated on high percentage gels (18Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), and the cross-linked peptides that retained the label were identified by autoradiography (Fig. 1). NH2OH cleaves proteins at asparaginyl-glycyl peptide bonds (15Bornstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 78: 132-145Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and would yield three large peptides (15.1, 21.6, and 37.1 kDa) in a complete digestion of Cbp2. Upon cleavage of the cross-linked Cbp2-RNA complex (Fig. 1 A), the 21.6-kDa amino-terminal and the 15.2-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragments of Cbp2 strongly cross-linked with intron 5 RNA. In addition to native Cbp2, we analyzed the cross-linking of a histidine-tagged version of the protein that stimulated splicing as well as untagged wild-type Cbp2 (Fig.1 C). The histidine tag added an additional 20 amino acid residues (2.3 kDa) to the NH2 terminus of the Cbp2 protein. Therefore, the indirectly labeled NH2-terminal peptide and the partials obtained with this tagged Cbp2 would migrate slower in the gels than their nontagged counterparts. This difference in electrophoretic mobility was used as an analytical tool to confirm the assignment of the cross-link site to the NH2-terminal fragment. As expected, the NH2-terminal peptide of the His-tagged protein obtained by NH2OH cleavage migrated at apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa, whereas the nontagged peptide (Fig.1 A) migrated faster (at 21.6 kDa). Migration of the 15.2-kDa COOH-terminal peptides derived from both versions of Cbp2 was unaffected. The cleavage reagent NTCB is specific to amino groups of cysteines (16Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Degani Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NTCB cleavage of Cbp2 would produce 9 peptides ranging from 0.17 to 29.5 kDa if the reaction proceeded to completion. However, only a partial digestion of the protein could be achieved despite our efforts to optimize the conditions. Incomplete cleavage often results from β-elimination and/or incomplete modification due to the reversible nature of the cyanylation reaction (17Degani Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Failure to completely denature the protein may also result in poor cleavage at internal sites. Cbp2, a relatively large protein (630 residues), appears to be somewhat refractile even to the strong denaturation conditions used in these cleavage reactions. Cleavage of cross-linked Cbp2-RNA complexes with NTCB (Fig. 1 B) generated several peptides that retained the label. Among the various indirectly labeled peptides, the 4.6-kDa NH2-terminal peptide, which is the size expected of the NH2-terminal peptide, and fragments of apparent molecular mass 6.3 and 16.9 kDa (indicated by asterisks) could be readily identified. All three fragments were shifted upwards in the histidine-tagged version of Cbp2 suggesting that the 6.3- and 16.9-kDa bands were partial digestion fragments including the NH2terminus. These results suggest that the NH2-terminal RNA contact site is located close to the His-tag (within the first 37 residues of untagged Cbp2). The 5.6-kDa COOH-terminal fragment generated by NTCB (identified by silver staining, data not shown) did not retain the label, suggesting that the extreme COOH-terminal region does not contain a cross-linkable site. The contact site within the 15.2-kDa NH2OH fragment may therefore be located upstream of the NTCB cleavage site at residue 582. To demonstrate that the conditions employed for UV cross-linking promote the formation of active Cbp2-intron complexes, portions of the reactions were removed before UV irradiation, incubated with 0.2 mm GTP at 37 °C for 30 min, and the products resolved on denaturing gels. (Fig. 1 C). Reaction mixes containing either native (lane 2) or His-tagged Cbp2 (lane 3) clearly demonstrated splicing, whereas the RNA alone (lane 1) could not splice under similar low salt conditions.

Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The F0 portion contains membrane-spanning subunits and is responsible for translocating protons across the membrane. The F11portion is an extrinsic membrane complex, composed of five different subunits α, β, γ, δ, and ε, and retains the ability to hydrolyze ATP after purification from F0. In the crystal structure of F1 from bovine heart mitochondria (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar), the catalytic sites are located on each of the three β subunits with some contribution from the proximal α subunit. The enzyme crystallized with one catalytic site that contained Mg2+-AMPPNP, one that contained Mg2+-ADP, and one that was empty. Three noncatalytic sites, each located primarily on an α subunit, contained bound Mg2+-AMPPNP in this structure. Chloroplast F1 has about four metal-nucleotides tightly bound upon purification from F0 (6Shapiro A.B. Huber A.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol.

The metal-nucleotide bound to the site designated Site 3 can be removed by gel filtration chromatography, whereas depletion of Site 2 requires partial unfolding of CF1 by precipitation in ammonium sulfate and EDTA (7Bruist M.F.

Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that Site 3 is catalytic (9Chen W. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7089-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements using TNP nucleotides enabled the mapping of the positions of Sites 1–3 relative to each other and to locations of fluorescent groups covalently modified to unique locations on CF1 (10McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 234-237Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This FRET map shows a close correspondence to the locations of the metal-nucleotides in the crystal structure of F1 from bovine mitochondria. From this correspondence, Site 2 is a noncatalytic site and Site 1, like Site 3, is catalytic (7Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The observation of unique identifiable locations for Sites 1–3 and the correspondence between the FRET map and the crystal structure indicate that each of the metal-nucleotide binding Sites 1–3 can be selectively filled with metal-nucleotide complex (7Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The F1 portion binds substrate with high affinity in a manner that allows rapid interconversion of ADP and phosphate with bound ATP in the absence of the proton-motive force (3O'Neal C.C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proton-motive force drives two sequential conformational changes of the catalytic site that decreases the affinity of the enzyme for ATP relative to ADP that facilitates the selective dissociation of ATP. This generates a chemical gradient in which the cellular concentration of ATP is much higher relative to ADP and phosphate than it would be at equilibrium. The conformation of each of three catalytic sites on the enzyme is staggered such that the enzyme contains a catalytic site in each of the three sequential conformations at any instant as supported by the structure of F1 (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). Nucleotides bind the catalytic sites as a complex with Mg2+(4Frasch W.D. Selman B.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which serves as a cofactor for the reaction. The decrease in affinity for ATP that results from the sequential conformational changes is directly dependent on the presence of Mg2+ (5Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These differences in affinity, which can be as much as 5 orders of magnitude for the F1 from Escherichia coli, strongly suggest that the selective release of ATP results from changes in the metal ligands that are a consequence of the different conformations of the catalytic site. Thylakoids maintain high rates of photophosphorylation by diverting some of the reducing equivalents derived from the light-driven electron transfer reactions to thioredoxin that in turn keeps a disulfide bond on the γ subunit of CF1 reduced. Formation of this disulfide in darkness converts the enzyme from the activated to the latent state that has very low ATPase activity. Addition of ADP accelerates the dark decay of ATPase activity, suggesting that tightly bound ADP in a catalytic site serves a regulatory function. This is required as part of the mechanism to maintain the enzyme in its latent state in the dark (14Dunham K.R. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 212-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhou J.M. Xue Z. Du Z. Melese T. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Conversion of this ADP from loosely to tightly bound correlates with formation of latent CF1 (14Dunham K.R. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 212-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This regulatory interconversion only occurs upon subsequent addition of Mg2+ (15Zhou J.M. Xue Z. Du Z. Melese T. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Feldman R.I. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13088-13094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the metal that serves as a cofactor by binding as a complex with the nucleotide can also serve in a regulatory role by forming a nonfunctional conformation. Vanadyl (VIV=O)2+ has been used as a direct probe to identify the types of groups that serve as metal ligands at Sites 2 and 3 of CF1 (11Houseman A.L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Houseman A.L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The A and g tensors of51V hyperfine couplings from the EPR spectrum of the bound VO2+ are a direct measure of the nature of the equatorial metal binding ligands (28Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar). In a mixed ligand environment, each type of ligand contributes independently to the observed51V-hyperfine coupling (28Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar, 29Holyk N. An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study of Model Oxovanadium (IV) Complexes in Aqueous Solution: Correlation of Magnetic Properties with Ligand Type and Metal Chelate Structure. M.Sc. thesis. University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH1979Google Scholar). As a result, the51V-hyperfine parameters can provide information concerning the type of groups coordinated to the enzyme-bound metal. When Site 2 of latent CF1 is filled with VO2+-nucleotide, the bound VO2+-ATP gives rise to EPR species A (11Houseman A.L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At Site 3, the majority of VO2+-nucleotide binds in a ligand environment that gives rise to EPR species B, whereas a smaller fraction binds to Site 3 in a form that gives rise to EPR species C (11Houseman A.L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Nilges M.J. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Studies of Low Symmetry Nickel (I) and Molybenum (V) Complexes. Ph.D. thesis. University of Illinois, Urbana, IL1979Google Scholar). Upon activation of the enzyme, all of the signal intensity of species B converts to species C, suggesting that the latter results from the metal ligands when the enzyme is catalytically active. Titration of VO2+-nucleotide to CF1 that had been depleted of metal-nucleotide only from Site 3 showed that the VO2+binds selectively to a single site (11Houseman A.L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is possible for the Mg2+ bound at each catalytic site to have up to six ligands. However, in the two catalytic sites in the crystal structure of F1 from bovine mitochondria that contain Mg2+-nucleotide, only the oxygens of the phosphates and the hydroxyl of Thr-156 were within the 2.5 Å distance that would suggest that they were ligands. This threonine is a residue in a motif composed of GXXXXGKT known as Walker Homology A or phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) conserved among several enzymes that catalyze ATP hydrolysis. The Walker Homology B (WHB) motif is also conserved among several Mg2+-nucleotide binding proteins including adenylate kinase, phosphofructokinase, human mdrI protein, ATP/ADP translocase, elongation factor Tu, as well as the α and β subunits of the F1-ATPases (17Walker J.E.

This motif, with the consensus sequence of four hydrophobic residues followed by an aspartate, terminates a β-strand with the carboxyl group facing the binding pocket for metal-nucleotide (2Abrahams J.P.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The aspartate carboxyl of WHB has been suggested to hydrogen bond to a water that is coordinated to the metal, or to coordinate to a metal directly in several proteins including the β subunit of the F1-ATPase (8Hu C.-Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase shows the closest carboxyl-oxygen of this residue to be 3.9 Å to 4.3 Å from the metal at catalytic sites that contain bound Mg2+-AMPPNP and Mg2+-ADP, respectively (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). Recently, site-directed mutations of the P-loop threonine of the β subunit in CF1 from Chlamydomonas (βT168) were compared to determine whether changes in the EPR spectra of VO2+ bound to catalytic Site 3 could be detected (9Chen W. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7089-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutations were found to cause changes in both the signal intensity and51V hyperfine parameters of the bound VO2+ that gave rise to EPR species C in a manner that indicated that this residue was a metal ligand in the activated conformation. The lack of changes in EPR species B in the mutant CF1 indicated that the P-loop threonine is not a ligand in the form that predominates in the latent state of the enzyme. We now report an analysis of site-directed mutants of the WHB-aspartate (βD262) of Chlamydomonas CF1 by EPR spectroscopy of VO2+ bound to catalytic Site 3. The results presented here indicate that βD262 participates in metal binding at Site 3 in the metal-nucleotide complex that predominates in the latent form, but not in the complex that occurs in the activated form of the enzyme. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains (CC-125 and CC-373) were obtained from the C. reinhardtii Culture Collection at Duke University. The plasmid pWT-373 (8Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N.

Each mutagenesis reaction requires a selection primer and a mutagenic primer. The sequence of the selection primer is the same for every mutagenesis reaction, 5′-CGC CCC GAA GAA CGG ATC CCA ATG ATG AGC AC-3′.

Cell cultures and photoautotrophic growth curves of each C. reinhardtii strain were maintained and measured as per Hu et al. (8Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes in which electron transfer and ATP synthesis were tightly coupled were prepared, and photophosphorylation assays were measured as per Hu et al. (8Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P.

The ability of purified thylakoids to generate a light-driven proton gradient was monitored using 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching as per Chenet al. (9Chen W. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. J. Biol.

The ATPase activity was determined using the coupled ATPase assay including lactic dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase as described by Harris and Bashford (33Harris D.H. Bashford C.L. Spectrophotometry and Spectrofluorimetry. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford, UK1987Google Scholar). To activate the CF1, final concentrations of 50 mm dithiothreitol and 20% ethanol were incubated with purified CF1 for more than one h at room temperature. The reaction rates were determined from the initial slopes, typically in the first 20–30 s after adding the protein into the reaction mixture. EPR experiments were carried out at X-band (9 GHz) using a Bruker 580E spectrometer with a TE102 standard cavity and a liquid nitrogen flow cryostat operating at 125 K. Simulations of the CW-EPR spectra employed the program QPOWA (12Nilges M.J. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Studies of Low Symmetry Nickel (I) and Molybenum (V) Complexes. Ph.D. thesis.

Growth curves of wild type and mutantChlamydomonas cultures were obtained under photoautotrophic conditions at 25 °C at a light intensity of 80 microEinstein·m−2 s−1. As shown in Table I, all of the mutations of βD262 caused dramatic decreases in the ability to grow photoautotrophically compared with wild type. The D262N, C, and T mutants grew at 5–10% of the wild type rate. The D262H mutant was completely incapable of photoautotrophic growth.Table IFunctional comparison of wild-type and D262 mutantsGenotypePhotoautotrophic growth rateaMeasured as the rate of increase in optical density (cell scattering) of the liquid culture at 720 nm in log phase at 25 °C with a light intensity of 80 microEinstein ·m−2 s−1.ATP synthase activitybBased on the rate of 250 μmol of ATP (mg of chlorophyll · h)−1 using Mg2+-ADP and phosphate concentrations of 2 and 3 mm, respectively, with thylakoids from wild type.ATPase activitycBased on the rate of 9.6 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed (mg of CF1 · min)−1 using 10 mmMg2+-ATP with CF1 purified from wild-typeChlamydomonas.%Wild-type100100100βD262H030βD262N9104βD262C5145βD262T41010a Measured as the rate of increase in optical density (cell scattering) of the liquid culture at 720 nm in log phase at 25 °C with a light intensity of 80 microEinstein ·m−2 s−1.b Based on the rate of 250 μmol of ATP (mg of chlorophyll · h)−1 using Mg2+-ADP and phosphate concentrations of 2 and 3 mm, respectively, with thylakoids from wild type.c Based on the rate of 9.6 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed (mg of CF1 · min)−1 using 10 mmMg2+-ATP with CF1 purified from wild-typeChlamydomonas. Open table in a new tab The effects of these mutations on rates of phenazine methylsulfate-dependent photophosphorylation of isolated thylakoids, and ATPase activity of purified CF1 preparations are summarized in Table I. The results are consistent with the relative ability of the mutants to grow photoautotrophically. In all cases, the activities of the D262N, C, and T mutants were about 10% of wild type, whereas those of the D262H mutant were negligible. The subunit composition of CF1 isolated from wild type and mutants are compared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Fig.1. All mutants were found to contain α, β, γ, and ε subunits as does the wild type. The abundance of the δ subunit relative to the other subunits was variable among preparations. This subunit is known to be weakly associated with theChlamydomonas CF1 and is easily lost when the enzyme preparation is stored (8Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Merchant S. Selman B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The variability of the abundance of the δ subunit among preparations did not differ from that of wild-type CF1. Other bands visible in these preparations are polypeptides that have been reported previously to copurify with CF1 from Chlamydomonas (36Selman-Reimer S. Merchant S. Selman B. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5476-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that no significant differences in the yields of purified CF1 were observed between preparations from wild type and mutants. The low rates of photophosphorylation were not the result of the inability of the thylakoids to form a light-driven proton gradient. Fig. 2 shows the relative fluorescence quenching of 9-aminoacridine in the wild type and mutant thylakoids upon illumination. The rate and extent of fluorescence quenching was about the same in each of the mutants as in the wild type. Thus, none of the mutations caused the membranes to become uncoupled. Combined with the observations that the yield and subunit composition of the mutant proteins are the same as wild type, it is unlikely that any of the mutations has caused a large conformational change that interferes with folding and assembly of the CF1F0complex. Fig. 3shows parallel transitions of EPR spectra of VO2+ bound to Site 3 of CF1 from wild type Chlamydomonas. Because of the anisotropy that results from the oxo group of VO2+, the single unpaired electron and the nuclear spin I = 7/2 result in an EPR spectrum that consists of 8 transitions from that fraction of molecules where the molecular axis (defined by the V=O bond) is aligned parallel with the magnetic field of the spectrometer, and 8 transitions from the perpendicular alignment. The center of each group of 8 transitions and the spacing between them is determined by the values of g and A, respectively. The magnitude of these values depends on the strength of the hyperfine coupling between the unpaired electron and the51V nucleus. The 51V-hyperfine coupling of VO2+ is sensitive to the types of group coordinated at the equatorial positions. Of these parameters, the coupling constant for the equatorial ligand donor group, A ∥, shows the largest and most easily discerned changes as a function of the types of groups that serve as equatorial ligands. These changes will be evident as differences in the spacing between the −7/2, −5/2, +3/2, +5/2, and +7/2 transitions shown in Fig. 3, which do not overlap with perpendicular transitions. Addition of an equivalent of VO2+-ATP to CF1under conditions in which all other higher affinity binding sites for metal-nucleotides were filled with Mg2+-nucleotide complexes resulted in two sets of parallel transitions for VO2+. The simulated spectrum for each set (Fig. 3, spectrab and c) and the values ofA ∥ and g ∥ used to generate these spectra are given in TableII. Spectra b and c correspond to EPR species B and C that result from the two specific binding environments for VO2+ as a complex with nucleotide in Site 3 each with its own set of equatorial ligands. In the latent form of the enzyme, species B predominates, but activation induces the conversion of species B into species C. The ratios of the amplitudes of the simulated spectra for EPR species B and C from each mutant that, when summed, reproduced the experimental spectra are also shown in Table II. These data provide the ratio of the amount of vanadyl bound in the form that gives rise to species B versus species C.Table IIExperimental 51V-hyperfine parameters derived from VO2+bound as a complex with ATP at Site 3 in CF1 from wild-type and βD262 mutantsStrainRatio of C:BSpecies BSpecies CA∥g∥A∥g∥Wild-type0.87498.21.948456.51.957βD262H0.28493.81.949458.01.957βD262T0.51502.21.950456.51.957βD262N0.68498.21.948456.51.957βD262C0.17498.21.948457.51.957Experimental parameters were determined by simulation of entire spectrum using QPOWA. Open table in a new tab Experimental parameters were determined by simulation of entire spectrum using QPOWA. The parallel transitions of the EPR spectrum from VO2+-ATP bound to Site 3 of CF1 with the D262H mutation is shown in Fig. 4 along with the simulations of EPR species B and C that best fit the experimental data. The value ofA ∥ for EPR species B in this mutant decreased 4.4 MHz from that of the wild type enzyme to a value of 493.8 MHz, whereas the 51V-hyperfine components of species C remained unchanged (Table II). This mutation also caused an increase in the species C:B ratio by more than 3-fold of that observed with the wild type enzyme. No significant differences in A ∥ could be discerned for species B in the spectrum of VO2+ bound to the D262N mutant (Fig. 5)versus those of wild type enzyme. However, much higher signal-to-noise in the EPR spectrum is required to resolve the small difference in A ∥ that would be anticipated if the asparagine side chain were to become a ligand (8Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) such that this experiment serves as a negative control. This conservative change in the side chain did increase the signal intensity of species B relative to species C by about 20% such that the ratio of the C:B signal intensity decreased to 0.68. The EPR spectrum that resulted from VO2+-ATP bound to Site 3 of CF1 that contained the D262T mutation is shown in Fig.6. A value of 502.2 MHz forA ∥ was derived from the simulation of EPR species B, which represents a 4 MHz increase inA ∥ of species B from that of wild type. This mutation decreased the ratio of species C:B by 1.7-fold. In the D262C mutant, if there were a single substitution of the sulfhydryl for the carboxyl in the equatorial ligands of the bound VO2+, a decrease in A ∥ of 31.6 MHz from that of the wild type is expected. However,A ∥ of species B remained unchanged (Fig.7). This mutation did have the largest effect on the C:B ratio of any of the mutants, causing a decrease of more than 5-fold from that of wild type. None of the mutations was found to change the 51V-hyperfine parameters of EPR species C. This indicates that the WHB-aspartate is not an equatorial ligand to VO2+ bound at Site 3 in the species C conformation. This also serves as a negative control that indicates that the changes in 51V-hyperfine parameters observed in species B are specific for that binding environment. All of the mutations were found to change the ratio of EPR species C:B from that observed in wild type CF1. BecauseA ∥ and g ∥ are not affected by the mutations, these changes are indicative of changes in the affinity of the VO2+-ATP complex for the conformation of Site 3 that gives rise to species B. The results presented here indicate that βD262 serves as an essential residue of the chloroplast F1F0-ATP synthase in both a catalytic and regulatory capacity. Catalytic function of the enzyme was significantly affected by every mutation examined. In addition, every mutation changed the ratio of EPR species C:B and/or the 51V-hyperfine parameters of EPR species B, the predominant conformation of VO2+-nucleotide bound to Site 3 of latent CF1. None of the crystal structures of F1 determined to date (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) measured the binding affinities of nucleotides to the catalytic sites of the βY331W mutant of E. coli F1 by the fluorescence quenching that results from a direct interaction between the adenine ring of the nucleotide and the tryptophan residue. These studies revealed that Mg2+ was responsible for the large differences in affinities of nucleotide among the three catalytic sites. When the WHB-aspartate was mutated to create a double mutant βY331W/βD242N of E. coli F1, the nucleotide binding affinities of the three catalytic sites were not increased by Mg2+ but became closely similar to the lower affinity observed when nucleotide binds alone (26Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on these results Weber et al. (26Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) concluded that there must be a water molecule not visible in the crystal structure that is both hydrogen-bonded to the WHB carboxyl and coordinated to the metal in all three catalytic sites. The results presented here for EPR species C show that, in this conformation, the WHB carboxyl is neither an equatorial ligand to VO2+ nor is it hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule coordinated at an equatorial position at Site 3. The51V-hyperfine parameters of EPR species C, the species present exclusively in the activated enzyme, were not changed significantly by any of the mutations examined. These mutations did inhibit catalytic function as observed for the D242N mutant in E. coli F1 (26Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the WHB carboxyl has hydrogen bonded to the vanadyl-oxo or to a water molecule coordinated at the axial position of the VO2+ in Site 3. The loss of activity in these mutants could also be explained if this residue were to serve as a direct ligand in one of the other catalytic sites. This will be resolved as more of the residues that serve as metal ligands at each catalytic site are identified. The EPR data that result from VO2+ bound to Site 3 of mutant CF1 provide insight into the metal ligation responsible for the changes in EPR species B in each of these mutants. Based on the measured coupling constants of A ∥from model studies (28Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar, 37Hamstra B.J. Houseman A.L. Colpas G.J. Kampf J.W. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Pecoraro V.L. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 36: 4866-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the hyperfine coupling for a given group of equatorial ligands can be calculated from Eq. 1A∥calc=∑niA∥i/4Equation 1 where i counts the different types of equatorial ligand donor groups, n i(= 1–4) is the number of ligands of type i, and A ∥i is the measured coupling constant for equatorial ligand donor group of typei (28Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar). Similar equations can be written forg ∥ and for A iso, though the changes in A ∥ are the largest and most easily discerned. Table III shows the values ofA ∥ and g ∥ calculated from Eq. 1 that give the closest fit to the experimental data derived from simulation of the spectra (Table II) and summarizes the equatorial ligands used for these calculations. The best fit of the data for species B at Site 3 of wild type CF1 includes a water, as well as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and phosphate groups as equatorial ligands to VO2+ (9Chen W. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7089-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One interpretation of the data presented here is that the putative carboxyl ligand is D262. In this case, we expect to observe a change in 51V-hyperfine parameters consistent with displacement of the carboxyl by the type of group substituted in the D262 mutation. Alternatively, D262 may be hydrogen-bonded to the putative water ligand derived from the best fit to EPR species B. No changes 51V-hyperfine parameters are typically expected except in the rare event that the mutation causes a ligand to be displaced. Instead, the differences in the ability of the mutated groups to hydrogen bond to water are anticipated to change the ratio of EPR species C:B.Table IIIBest fits of the 51V-hyperfine parameters of VO2+ bound as a complex with ATP at Site 3 in CF1 from wild-type and βD262 mutants to the groups of equatorial ligands based on Eq. 1StrainCalculatedaFrom Eq. 1 based on the ligands shown.Most probable equatorial ligandsA∥g∥Wild-type498.81.946RCOOROHH2OPiβD262H492.71.948R = NR′ROHH2OPiβD262T501.51.946RNH2ArOHH2OPiβD262N498.81.946RCONROHH2OPiβD262C497.41.946RSHH2OH2OPia From Eq. 1 based on the ligands shown. Open table in a new tab If D262 acts as a direct metal ligand, the 4.4 MHz change inA ∥ of species B observed with D262H can be easily explained as a simple substitution of an imidazole nitrogen for a carboxyl oxygen as an equatorial ligand to the bound VO2+. This change in A ∥ is more difficult to explain if D262 is only hydrogen-bonded to the coordinated water because this requires a double substitution of imidazole nitrogen for water and water for carboxyl. The EPR data shown for the D262N mutation does not provide any information to distinguish between the possible roles of the carboxyl as a direct ligand, or as an indirect ligand hydrogen bonded to a coordinated water. An asparagine side chain coordinated to VO2+ shows changes in A ∥ that can be resolved only at much higher signal-to-noise than that reported here (8Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ability of this side chain to hydrogen bond to water also allows for the latter possibility. It is noteworthy that the D262N mutation causes a small change in the ratio of EPR species C:B signal intensities. If the βD262T mutation were to result solely in the substitution of a carboxyl for a hydroxyl oxygen, a decrease inA ∥ of about 22 MHz is expected. However, an increase in A ∥ of 4 MHz was observed in this mutant to a value of 502.2 MHz. These data are best fit to a set of equatorial ligands where the carboxyl group and the hydroxyl group have been substituted for an amino group and a tyrosine hydroxyl. Although these are somewhat unexpected substitutions, both the P-loop lysine (βK157) and the catch-loop tyrosine (βY311) are in close proximity to the Mg2+ in the catalytic sites of F1 from bovine mitochondria (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). Clearly, the D262T mutation caused profound changes in the equatorial ligands of VO2+ bound at catalytic Site 3. Because a hydroxyl group is capable of hydrogen bonding, the changes observed here are inconsistent with D262 serving only to hydrogen bond to a coordinated water. The D262C mutation did not change the 51V-hyperfine parameters. Although this appears to favor hydrogen bonding over direct ligation, sulfhydryl groups are relatively poor in forming hydrogen bonds. Consequently, if the group at this position is needed to hydrogen bond to the coordinated water, this mutant should increase the ratio of EPR species C:B. However, a large decrease in the ratio of EPR species C:B was observed. Furthermore, a double substitution of equatorial ligands of sulfhydryl sulfur for carboxyl oxygen and water oxygen for hydroxyl oxygen will also result in51V-hyperfine parameters closely similar to those of wild type (Table III). The results presented here strongly favor the conclusion that the WHB carboxyl serves as an equatorial ligand to the VO2+ bound in Site 3 in the form that gives rise to EPR species B, the form of Site 3 that predominates in latent CF1. Upon activation of the enzyme with dithiothreitol, the signal intensity of species B converts into species C. The lack of effects of the mutations to the WHB carboxyl on EPR species C indicates that activation of the enzyme causes the loss of this carboxyl group as an equatorial ligand. Chenet al. (9Chen W. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7089-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that the P-loop threonine (βT168 inChlamydomonas) serves as an equatorial ligand to VO2+ at Site 3 under conditions that give rise to species C but not to that which results in species B. When combined with the results presented here, it appears that activation changes the conformation of the enzyme to cause the substitution of the WHB carboxyl for the P-loop threonine as a metal ligand at Site 3.
