https://openalex.org/W2080374319,"The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) has emerged as a key factor in cellular responses to oxygen availability, being required for the oxygen-dependent proteolysis of α subunits of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF). Mutations in VHL cause a hereditary cancer syndrome associated with dysregulated angiogenesis, and up-regulation of hypoxia inducible genes. Here we investigate the mechanisms underlying these processes and show that extracts from VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cells have a defect in HIF-α ubiquitylation activity which is complemented by exogenous pVHL. This defect was specific for HIF-α among a range of substrates tested. Furthermore, HIF-α subunits were the only pVHL-associated proteasomal substrates identified by comparison of metabolically labeled anti-pVHL immunoprecipitates from proteosomally inhibited cells and normal cells. Analysis of pVHL/HIF-α interactions defined short sequences of conserved residues within the internal transactivation domains of HIF-α molecules sufficient for recognition by pVHL. In contrast, while full-length pVHL and the p19 variant interact with HIF-α, the association was abrogated by further N-terminal and C-terminal truncations. The interaction was also disrupted by tumor-associated mutations in the β-domain of pVHL and loss of interaction was associated with defective HIF-α ubiquitylation and regulation, defining a mechanism by which these mutations generate a constitutively hypoxic pattern of gene expression promoting angiogenesis. The findings indicate that pVHL regulates HIF-α proteolysis by acting as the recognition component of a ubiquitin ligase complex, and support a model in which its β domain interacts with short recognition sequences in HIF-α subunits.

In the inherited syndrome, affected individuals bearing a germ-line mutation are strongly predisposed to highly angiogenic tumors of the retina and central nervous system, phaeochromocytoma, and renal cell carcinoma, whereas in sporadic renal cell carcinoma an important pathogenetic role is indicated by the high frequency of somatic mutation or inactivation of both VHL alleles (for review, see Ref. 1Kaelin W.G. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A function in oxygen-regulated gene expression was first suggested by the observation that the hypoxia inducible mRNAs encoding vascular endothelial growth factor and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) were up-regulated in VHL defective renal cell carcinoma cell lines (2Iliopoulos O. Levy A.P. Jiang C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 3Gnarra J.R. Zhou S. Merrill M.J. Wagner J.R.

Important mechanistic insights into this phenomenon have recently been gained through studies of the action of pVHL on the transcriptional complex hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (4Maxwell P. Wiesener M. Chang G.-W. Clifford S. Vaux E. Cockman M. Wykoff C. Pugh C. Maher E. Ratcliffe P. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimer of basic helix-loop-helix PAS proteins, HIF-α and HIF-β (5Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar), which plays a critical role in a broad range of responses to hypoxia. These include the regulation of genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, energy metabolism, iron metabolism, vasomotor control, inflammation, tissue matrix metabolism, and cell survival decisions (6Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). A central mode of regulation of HIF-1 is through oxygen-regulated proteolysis of HIF-α subunits (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) involving the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (7Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 8Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in VHL defective renal cell carcinoma lines indicated that pVHL has a critical function in this process, since in VHL-defective cells HIF-α subunits were found to be constitutively stabilized, and re-expression of pVHL restored oxygen-dependent proteolysis. Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility supershift assays demonstrated that pVHL and HIF-α subunits were physically associated in a range of cell types, consistent with a general role for pVHL in the regulation of HIF-α proteolysis (4Maxwell P. Wiesener M. Chang G.-W. Clifford S. Vaux E. Cockman M. Wykoff C. Pugh C. Maher E. Ratcliffe P. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of HIF-α targeting by pVHL was not defined. In an independent line of investigation into pVHL function, protein association experiments defined a series of molecules that interact with pVHL, including elongins B and C and a member of the cullin family (CUL2) (10Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 11Kibel A.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The recognition that another cullin (Cdc53) played a key role in ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are necessary for proteolytic destruction at cell cycle transitions in yeast, suggested a role for pVHL in proteolysis (12Pause A. Lee S. Worrell R.A. Chen D.Y.T. Burgess W.H. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and led to the proposal of a model based on homology with the SCF (Skp-1-Cdc53/Cullin-F-box) class of ubiquitin ligases (13Lonergan K.M. Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kamura T. Conaway R.C. Weliky Conaway J. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Combinatorial arrangements of Skp-1, Cullin, and F-box proteins in SCF complexes provide different E3 target specificities, which are known or predicted to depend on association between substrate and an interaction domain on the F-box component (for review, see Ref. 14Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the VHL·elongin B/C·CUL2 complex might form a new class of ubiquitin ligases with pVHL playing a role analagous to the F-box protein, although the substrate(s) were undefined. This model has recently been supported by further similarities to SCF complexes noted in structural studies of the VHL·elongin B/C complex (15Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), and by recognition that another protein, Rbx1, is a common component of SCF and VHL·elongin B/C·CUL2 complexes (16Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Elledge S.J. Conaway R.C. Harper J.W. Conaway J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggested a specific hypothesis, that pVHL might act as the recognition component of a ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIF-α subunits for ubiqutin-dependent proteolysis. If correct, this hypothesis has clear implications for understanding the role of pVHL in cellular oxygen sensing, and the mechanism of tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, it raises important questions concerning the range of pVHL substrates, the domains responsible for substrate capture, and the relationship to sites of oncogenic mutation. In this work we provide direct evidence in support of this hypothesis and address the associated questions. We demonstrate a critical role for pVHL in HIF-α ubiquitylation using in vitroubiquitylation assays. Using a display of metabolically labeled proteins which co-precipitated with pVHL in untreated and proteasomally blocked cells we show that the range of pVHL-associated proteolytic targets is limited and confined in these experiments to HIF-1α and HIF-2α. We analyze the domains involved in the association between HIF-α subunits and pVHL and define small subdomains within the internal transactivation domains that interact with pVHL. Furthermore, we show that the HIF-α interactions are disrupted by tumor-associated mutations in the β-domain of pVHL and that this is associated with defective HIF-α ubiquitylation in vitro, defective HIF-α regulation in vivo, and up-regulation of HIF target gene expression. RCC4 cells (4Maxwell P. Wiesener M. Chang G.-W. Clifford S. Vaux E. Cockman M. Wykoff C. Pugh C. Maher E. Ratcliffe P. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar), originally a gift from C. H. M. C. Buys, and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. RCC4/VHL is a subline re-expressing wild type pVHL following stable transfection with pcDNA3-VHL (4Maxwell P. Wiesener M. Chang G.-W. Clifford S. Vaux E. Cockman M. Wykoff C. Pugh C. Maher E. Ratcliffe P. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar). Further series of stable transfectants were generated from RCC4 by transfection with wild type or mutant pVHL expression plasmids (see below), or empty vector, using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by selection in G418 (1 mg/ml). Clones were picked as individual colonies and maintained in G418. Expression of stably transfected VHL genes was checked by immunoblotting with anti-pVHL or anti-HA antibodies, and at least two independent clones were studied for each expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours before the experimental exposures, cells were subdivided onto 75-cm2 dishes in medium lacking G418. Parallel exposures to control and test conditions were generally for 4 h. Hypoxic incubation was in an atmosphere of 1% oxygen, 5% CO2, balance nitrogen in a Napco 7001 incubator (Jouan). For radioisotopic labeling, cells were first incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium lacking methionine and cystine, which was replaced with 4.5 ml of medium lacking methionine and cystine with 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Pro-mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteasomal inhibition was with 10 μm N-carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norvalinal and 100 μm calpain inhibitor 1 (Sigma). pcDNA3-VHL contains the VHL coding sequence in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (4Maxwell P. Wiesener M. Chang G.-W. Clifford S. Vaux E. Cockman M. Wykoff C. Pugh C. Maher E. Ratcliffe P. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar). To make pcDNA3-VHL.HA, pcDNA3-VHL was PCR amplified with primers 5′-AGGGACACACGATGGGCTTCTG-3′ and 5′-GCAGAATTCGGCTTCACAAGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATCCATCTCCCATCCGTTGATGTGGC-3′. The PCR product was cut at an internal BglII site and at theEcoRI site incorporated into the 3′-oligonucleotide, and used to replace a corresponding fragment in pcDNA3-VHL. pcDNA3-HA.VHL contained the sequence encoding pVHL with an HA epitope tag at the N terminus from pRC-HAVHL (a gift from W. Kaelin) inserted as a HindIII-XbaI restriction fragment into pcDNA3.1. pcDNA3(54–213).HA, pcDNA3-VHL(1–156).HA, and pcDNA3-VHL(1–187).HA were derived from pcDNA3-VHL.HA by removal of HindIII-HaeII,AccI-SmaI, andBglII-XbaI restriction fragments, respectively, followed by repair with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and religation. pcDNA3-HA.VHL(72–213) was derived by PCR amplification of pcDNA3-VHL with 5′-CGGGATCCCAGGTCATCTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-CGTCAACATTGAGAGATGG-3′. The PCR product was cut withBamHI and HpaI and ligated into pcDNA3-HA.VHL linearized at these sites. Missense mutations were generated in pcDNA3-VHL.HA by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). All PCRs were performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and in all plasmids the VHLsequence and modifications were confirmed by sequence analysis. The plasmids encoding different series of GAL4 fusions with HIF-1α (pGal/α/ARNT-ta) and HIF-2α (pGal/EPAS), and glucocorticoid receptor fusions with HIF-1α (pGR/α) have been described previously (17Pugh C.W.

Plasmids based on pcDNA3 expressing the entire open reading frames of human HIF-1α, human HIF-2α, human HIF-1β, rat IRP-2, and human c-Myc were made by standard recombinant maneuvers from plasmids kindly provided by G. Semenza, S. McKnight, O. Hankinson, E. Liebold, and G. Evan. Anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, anti-pVHL antibody (IG32) was from Pharmingen, anti-HIF-1α antibody (clone 54) was from Transduction Laboratories, polyclonal anti-GLUT1 antibody (GT-11A) was from Alpha Diagnostic, and antibody to SV40 T antigen (PAb419) was a gift from E. Harlow. Anti-HIF-2α antibody (190b) was described previously (9Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. William C. Eckardt K.-U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 100 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA630 (Sigma), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 μm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm levamisole with aprotinin (1 μg/ml), “Complete” protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.5 mm AEBSF for 1 h on ice with occasional mixing. Lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 200 μg of cell extract was precleared overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads pre-blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 1 μg of antibody was then added and samples incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by 2 h incubation with 10 μl of pre-blocked protein G-Sepharose beads on a rotator. Beads were washed five times in lysis buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, generally using discontinuous gels (8% acylamide upper portion, 13% lower portion) and were detected by fluorography (Amplify, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were prepared by coupled transcription and translation reactions of expression plasmids in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT, Promega). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were produced in reticulocyte lysates programmed with plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged pVHL and HIF-α sequences. 1 μl of the indicated lysates was mixed in 100 μl of NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% v/v Igepal CA630). After 90 min at 4 °C, 0.25 μg of anti-HA antibody was added, followed after a further 1 h by 10 μl of pre-blocked protein G-Sepharose beads. After 30 min mixing on a rotator, beads were washed three times with NETN buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. To prepare extracts cells were washed twice with cold hypotonic extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After removal of buffer, cells were disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer. Following lysis, crude extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and nuclei, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Ubiquitylation assays were carried out at 30 °C in a total volume of 40 μl, containing 2 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate, 27 μl of cell extract, 4 μl of 10 × ATP-regenerating system (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 300 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), 4 μl of 5 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma) or methylated ubiquitin (AFFINITI Research Products), 0.83 μl of 150 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (AFFINITI Research Products). For pVHL reconstitution experiments, [35S]methionine-labeled wild type or mutant pVHL (4 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate) was preincubated with the reaction mixture at room temperature for 5 min prior to addition of substrate. Aliquots were removed at indicated times, mixed with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Gels were quantitated using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To test the hypothesis that pVHL is a necessary component of a ubiquitin ligase complex recognizing HIF-α we developed an in vitro ubiquitylation assay for HIF-1α. In this assay, cell extracts (initially from COS7) were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled HIF-1α prepared in vitro in reticulocyte lysates. Incubation with extract alone converted the HIF-1α substrate to a slower migrating form, an effect which was enhanced by an ATP-regenerating system (Fig.1) and was prevented by addition of the protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine (data not shown). This indicated that these mobility shifts were most likely due to phosphorylation of HIF-1α as demonstrated recently by others (19Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Addition of ubiquitin resulted in the conversion of these species to a high molecular weight35S-labeled protein ladder of polyubiquitylated HIF-1α species. This assignment was confirmed by enhancement with addition of ubiquitin aldehyde, an isopeptidase inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of ubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 1). In contrast addition of methylated ubiquitin, which prevents the formation of multiubiquitin chains and acts as a chain terminator (20Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not support the generation of high molecular weight species, and when added in an equimolar ratio inhibited the formation of these species (Fig. 1). To determine the role of pVHL in HIF-1α ubiquitylation, we performed similar assays using extracts from RCC4 cells, and different stable transfectants re-expressing pVHL or pVHL.HA. Comparison of extracts from VHL defective, and pVHL re-expressing cells showed large differences in the rate of ubiquitylation of the HIF-1α substrate, particularly in the generation of the highest molecular weight conjugates, whereas the phosphorylation of HIF-1α occurred at a similar rate (Fig. 2 A). Similar effects were seen for HIF-2α (data not shown). Fig.2 B shows quantitative results of four independent comparisons of pairs of extracts from different VHL-defective and pVHL re-expressing RCC4 sublines. Although HIF-1α ubiquitylation was clearly more efficient in VHL-competent cells, a low level was apparent in the defective cells. We next tested the specificity of pVHL-dependent ubiquitylation using a range of other transcription factors. No ubiquitylation of HIF-1β could be demonstrated, irrespective of VHL status (Fig. 3, second panel), consistent with the inherent stability of this subunit (21Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Myc is a highly unstable transcription factor, which is destroyed by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (22Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Myc substrate was ubiquitylated, but in contrast with HIF-1α, Myc ubiquitylation was similar between VHL defective and VHL competent extracts (Fig. 3, third panel). Iron regulatory protein-2 (IRP-2) which, like HIF-1α, is destroyed in an oxygen-dependent manner by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (23Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) also showed no evidence of pVHL-dependent ubiquitylation (Fig. 3, fourth panel). Thus pVHL-dependent ubiquitylation was specific for HIF-α among a range of substrates tested in this assay. To provide a further unprejudiced insight into the range of proteolytic substrates targeted by pVHL we sought to display metabolically labeled substrates captured in vivo in pVHL immunoprecipitates. We performed a comparative display of anti-pVHL immunoprecipitates from normal cells and cells treated with proteasomal inhibitors, arguing that this should reveal differentially expressed species corresponding to HIF-α subunits, and should also provide a display of other pVHL target proteins which are degraded in a similar manner. For these experiments we used the VHL defective renal carcinoma line RCC4, and stably transfected derivatives expressing wild type pVHL (RCC4/VHL) or C-terminal HA epitope-tagged pVHL (RCC4/VHL.HA). Lysates were prepared from cells labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence or absence of proteasomal inhibitors, at 21 or 1% oxygen. Immunoprecipitation from RCC4/VHL lysates was with anti-pVHL, whereas immunoprecipitation from RCC4/VHL.HA lysates was with anti-HA. Fig.4 A shows an autoradiograph of anti-pVHL immunoprecipitates. pVHL is seen as several species of approximate molecular mass 27, 24, and 19 kDa. This pattern is similar to that which we observe using this antibody for Western analysis of extracts from RCC4/VHL cells, and cells expressing a normal endogenous VHL gene (data not shown). The 19-kDa species has been shown to arise from translational initiation at an internal methionine at codon 54 (24, 25), but the modifications giving rise to the other species are yet to be identified. In addition to the pVHL species, other proteins were precipitated from RCC4/VHL cells, but not from RCC4 cells. Species observed in cells cultured under standard culture conditions were similar to those identified previously and assigned as fibronectin, CUL2, elongin B, and elongin C (10Duan D.R. Pause A.

In anti-pVHL immunoprecipitates from proteasomally inhibited RCC4/VHL cells two further species were seen, migrating with apparent molecular masses of ∼135 kDa and ∼120 kDa (Fig. 4 A), consistent with the mobilities of HIF-1α and HIF-2α on Western analysis. Identical species at these mobilities were observed in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates and could be seen at lower intensity when cells were exposed to hypoxia in the absence of proteasomal blockade (Fig.4 B). Parallel immunoprecipitations using specific HIF-1α and HIF-2α antibodies demonstrated precise co-migration with the labeled species co-precipitated with pVHL molecules (e.g.Figs. 4 C, 5 A, and 6 A). No other labeled species were revealed by the proteasomal blockade. Similar results were obtained in a range of immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-pVHL or anti-HA antibodies, indicating that any failure of capture is unlikely to be ascribable to steric interference with binding by one or other antibody. Thus, at least under the experimental conditions tested, we found that HIF-1α and HIF-2α are the most abundant proteasomal substrates interacting with pVHL.Figure 5Effects of truncating mutations of pVHL on co-immunoprecipitation of proteins and regulation of HIF -α subunits.

We previously observed that the c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor regulates lactate dehydrogenase A and induces lactate overproduction. We, therefore, sought to determine whether c-Myc controls other genes regulating glucose metabolism. In Rat1a fibroblasts and murine livers overexpressing c-Myc, the mRNA levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase were elevated. c-Myc directly transactivates genes encoding GLUT1, phosphofructokinase, and enolase and increases glucose uptake in Rat1 fibroblasts. Nuclear run-on studies confirmed that the GLUT1 transcriptional rate is elevated by c-Myc. Our findings suggest that overexpression of the c-Myc oncoprotein deregulates glycolysis through the activation of several components of the glucose metabolic pathway.

The most striking feature of tumor cells is the production of large amounts of lactic acid, which is due to the glycolytic conversion of glucose to lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen (3.Warburg O.H.

In particular, it stimulates transcription of genes encoding glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes in adipocytes and hepatocytes through the carbohydrate response element (ChoRE),1 a 5′-CACGTG-3′ motif (7.Jacoby D.B.

The ChoRE is similar to the core binding site for the transcription factors USF2 (12.Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol.

Hence, the ChoRE serves to integrate physiological signals through transcription factors to regulate glucose metabolism. During tumor formation, adaptation to hypoxia may be mediated by the HIF-1 family of transcription factors, which induce angiogenesis and other metabolic changes. (2.Dang C.V. Semenza G.L.

Intriguingly, the ChoRE sequence matches the core E-box (5′-CACGTG-3′) binding site for c-Myc, which binds E-boxes of target genes to stimulate transcription (2.Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem.

Previous work showed that c-Myc directly up-regulates the expression of the lactate dehydrogenase gene (LDH-A) (20.Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V.

In addition to LDH-A, we report here the deregulation of GLUT 1 and several glycolytic genes by c-Myc. Rat fibroblasts were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. Rat1a and Myc-transformed Rat1a-Myc fibroblasts were as described previously (22.Hoang A.T. Cohen K.J. Barrett J.F. Bergstrom D.A. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A Rat1 cell line expressing a fusion protein of c-Myc and the human estrogen receptor (MycER) (a gift of J. M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Myc activity was induced when confluent MycER cells were treated with 0.25 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HOTM; Research Biochemicals, Natrick, MA) for the times indicated as described (20.Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 26.Grandori C. Mac J. Siebelt F.

To block protein synthesis, 10 μmcycloheximide (CHX) was added to the cells 30 min prior to 4-HOTM treatment. Animal studies were approved by The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Animal Use and Care Committee. Adenoviral constructs (a gift from W. El-Deiry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) containing either LacZ (Ad/LacZ) or c-myc (Ad/c-myc) coding sequence were as described (27.Mitchell K.O. El-Deiry W.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar). Two-month-old male BALB/c mice, weighing 20–25 g, were intravenously injected with 4 × 109plaque-forming units (pfu) of either Ad/LacZ or Ad/c-myc. Mice were then sacrificed by exposure to CO2 on days 3, 4, and 5 after viral injection. Their livers were quickly removed and processed for RNAs or frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated by guanidium thiocyanate lysis followed by cesium chloride centrifugation. 15-μg aliquots of RNA were used in Northern blot analysis (22.Hoang A.T. Cohen K.J. Barrett J.F.

Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described (20.Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nuclei were isolated from nonadherent cells (2 × 107) and incubated with buffered [32P]UTP (500 μCi), and labeled RNAs were isolated after treatment with DNase, proteinase K incubation, and phenol-chloroform extraction. Labeled RNAs (1.2 × 107cpm) from either Rat1a-Myc or Rat1a cells were hybridized at 42 °C for 40 h with membrane slot-blotted with denatured glucose transporter 1 and vimentin cDNA fragments. Uptake experiments were conducted on confluent Rat1a and MycER cells. Cells were treated with 0.25 μm 4-HOTM (Research Biochemicals, Natrick, MA) 1 h before 0.1 mm 2-DG with 10 nm [3H]2-DG (final concentration) were added. At the end of a 10-min incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were than lysed by the addition of 2 ml of 10 mm NaOH containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and a 100-μl aliquot was assayed for 3H by liquid scintillation counting (30.Yu N. Maciejewski-Lenoir D. Bloom F.E. Magistretti P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 550-558PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content was measured by the method of Bradford (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). To identify genes whose expression is deregulated in the presence of increased ectopic c-Myc, c-Myc-transformed Rat1a cells were studied (Fig. 1 A). Using this system of isogenic cell lines, GLUT1, phosphofructokinase (PFK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglucose isomerase (GPI), phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), and enolase showed elevated mRNA levels in c-Myc-transformed cells as compared with the nontransformed Rat1a cells. The expression levels of aldolase A, aldolase C, and triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) were decreased, and the expression levels of hexokinase I, hexokinase II, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were unchanged. Rat vimentin was used as a control (32.Lewis B.C. Shim H. Li Q. Wu C.S. Lee L.A. Maity A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4967-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Myc could induce GLUT1 and glycolytic gene expression in vivo, we injected adenoviruses expressing either LacZ or c-Myc into mice. Tail-vein injection of adenoviruses has the advantage of very high hepatic clearance, which yields highly efficient gene delivery to the liver (33.Ferry N. Heard J.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Four days after injection, 40% of hepatocytes were positive for β-galactosidase in LacZ adenovirus-treated animals (data not shown). 2S. Kim, Q. Li, C. V. Dang, and A. Lee, unpublished observations. c-Myc protein levels were 10-fold elevated in Myc adenovirus-treated animals (Fig.1 B). GLUT1, PFK, GAPDH, PGM, and enolase mRNAs were significantly induced in the Myc-expressing livers as compared with LacZ-expressing livers at 4 and 5 days after injection of viruses (Fig.1 C). These observations suggest that transient expression of Myc in vivo induces hepatic expression of the same glycolytic genes that are induced in the Rat1a system. To determine whether the genes displaying increased or decreased levels of mRNA expression are transcriptionally activated by Myc, we used a previously described Rat1 fibroblast line expressing a protein that fuses Myc to the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (MycER). With exposure of cells expressing the MycER protein to estrogenic compounds such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HOTM), the ligand-bound MycER protein translocates to the nucleus. The MycER protein then activates target genes without requiring new intervening protein synthesis (26.Grandori C. Mac J. Siebelt F. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4344-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 34.Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Hence, prior exposure of MycER cells to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) would not block activation or repression of direct target genes by 4-HOTM. Activation of MycER by 4-HOTM caused induction of GLUT1, PFK, and enolase mRNAs in the presence of CHX at 2 and 4 h (Fig. 2 A). Note that mRNA levels are diminished in the CHX + TM samples at the 6 h time point; this is likely due to decreased MycER protein (10% of 0 h level) with CHX treatment (data not shown). GAPDH, GPI, and PGM expression were not increased in the MycER system. Thus, GAPDH, GPI, and PGM do not meet this criterion for direct targets of c-Myc. Among the potentially down-regulated genes identified in Rat1a-Myc cells, only TPI mRNA moderately decreased in MycER cells exposed to 4-HOTM. However, a decrease in TPI mRNA was also seen with CHX treatment alone. The ribosomal phosphoprotein (36B4) mRNA level was shown to be unresponsive to estrogen and independent of cell cycle progression (35.Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 36.Keyomarsi K. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and was therefore used as a control. To account for experimental variation, a separate tamoxifen induction experiment was performed, and GLUT1 expression in MycER cells was determined (Fig.2 B). Following c-Myc induction, GLUT1 expression behaves in a manner that is consistent with a direct c-Myc target. To determine whether 4-HOTM itself may directly increase the expression of GLUT1, PFK, and enolase independent of the MycER protein, we treated Rat1a cells lacking MycER with 4-HOTM, with or without CHX, and performed Northern analysis. The mRNA levels of these genes were unchanged upon addition of 4-HOTM and cycloheximide in the absence of the MycER protein (Fig. 2 C). Hence, the induction of enolase, GLUT1, and PFK expression in the Rat1a-MycER cells by 4-HOTM is dependent on MycER activity. To further authenticate GLUT1, PFK, and enolase as c-Myc targets, we sought to determine their expression in Rat1 fibroblasts lacking c-myc (Fig. 3). All three transcripts showed decreased levels in c-myc null cells as compared with wild type parental cells. The expression of PFK and enolase are elevated in c-myc null cells rescued by a constitutively overexpressed c-Myc (HO15-Myc) when compared with empty vector control transfected myc null cells (HO15-MLV). GLUT1 expression, however, was only slightly elevated in the c-Myc-overexpressing HO15 cells as compared with control MLV transfected cells, which display elevated GLUT1 as compared with the parental HO15 cells. Replicate experiments yielded similar results, in which the HO15-MLV cells have elevated expression of all three genes as compared with the HO15 parental cell line. The cause for this elevation in our control HO15-MLV cells is not known. Thus, in this genetically defined system Myc levels parallel the expression of these three target genes. Among the three up-regulated genes, GLUT1 is most frequently implicated in tumorigenesis (35.Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 36.Keyomarsi K. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 37.Younes M. Lechago L.V. Somoano J.R. Mosharaf M. Lechago J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1164-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Younes M. Lechago L.V. Lechago J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1151-1154PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore chose to characterize GLUT1 further. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated an enhanced transcriptional rate of GLUT1 in Rat1a-Myc cells as compared with Rat1a fibroblasts (Fig. 4 A). The nuclear run-on signals for enolase and PFK were low and insufficient for interpretation (not shown). These results, nevertheless, underscore the activation of GLUT1 by c-Myc at the transcriptional level. We further sought to determine whether GLUT1 expression parallels that of c-myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells that are characterized by c-myc gene activation by chromosomal translocation. Both c-Myc-transformed lymphoblastoid (CB33-Myc) and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, Ramos and ST486, have elevated c-Myc protein levels (20.Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) that are associated with elevations of GLUT1 mRNA levels compared with the nontransformed lymphoblastoid CB33 cells (Fig. 4 B). We thus observed a correlation between c-Myc expression and the endogenous levels of GLUT1 mRNA in these Myc-transformed human lymphoid cells. To determine whether increased Myc activity influences glucose transport, [3H]2-DG uptake was studied in MycER Rat1 cells as well as Rat1a cells lacking the MycER system. 4-HOTM increased [3H]2-DG uptake in MycER cells, while it had no influence in Rat1a cells (Fig. 5). Normal mammalian cells use oxygen to generate energy from glucose and other metabolites through oxidative phosphorylation. In conditions of oxygen deprivation, normal cells rely on glycolysis to generate energy by converting glucose to lactic acid. Neoplastic transformation, however, alters glucose metabolism with enhanced conversion of glucose to lactic acid, thereby making tumor cells less dependent on oxygen. The molecular basis for physiological and pathological regulation of glucose metabolism is beginning to emerge with the identification of transcription factors that regulate glycolytic genes (2.Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The ability of c-Myc, USF1, and HIF-1 transcription factors to regulate the LDH-A promoter through a Myc consensus binding site 5′-CACGTG-3′ suggests that these transcription factors converge onto commoncis elements (5′-RCGTG-3′) that are found in regulatory sequences of glycolytic genes (20.Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Because hypoxia physiologically induces glycolytic gene expression through HIF-1 binding sites, it stands to reason that glycolysis might also be activated by USF or c-Myc. Hence, we sought to determine whether c-Myc regulates genes that are also regulated by HIF-1. In this study, we observe that the glucose transporter GLUT1, PFK, GAPDH, GPI, PGM, and enolase are up-regulated by c-Myc in fibroblasts. In addition, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the liver as a means of studying in vivo gene expression and determined that these genes are also up-regulated by c-Myc in vivo. Our findings agree with a previous study of transgenic mice that also suggests the in vivo regulation of hepatic glycolysis by c-myc (41.Valera A. Pujol A. Gregori X. Riu E. Visa J. Bosch F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although GLUT2, but not GLUT1, was induced in the transgenic livers. While our observation supports the hypothesis that c-Myc induces GLUT1 expression in the liver in vivo, the physiological significance of this induction is unclear because GLUT2 is the dominant form of hepatic glucose transporter. The use of transgenic mice, however, cannot establish whether c-Myc regulates certain genes directly. In our study, only GLUT1, PFK, and enolase behave as direct target genes in the MycER system. While some HIF-1 and c-Myc target genes overlap, the two sets of targets remain distinct. For example, the mRNA levels for HKI and adolase are unchanged or decreased by c-Myc, but are hypoxia inducible (2.Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem.

Furthermore, we have reported that c-Myc overexpression down-regulates VEGF, a HIF-1-mediated hypoxia-inducible gene (42.Barr L.F. Campbell S.E. Diette G.B. Gabrielson E.W. Kim S. Shim H. Dang C.V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that c-Myc directly induces GLUT1 and increases glucose uptake in the Rat1 MycER cells. In addition to LDH-A, GLUT1 is an intriguing c-Myc target when its role in oncogenesis is considered (37.Younes M. Lechago L.V. Somoano J.R. Mosharaf M. Lechago J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1164-1167PubMed Google Scholar,38.Younes M. Lechago L.V. Lechago J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1151-1154PubMed Google Scholar). Elevation of GLUT1 and c-Myc RNA are among the earliest changes in gene expression after Ha-ras T24 transformation of Rat1a fibroblasts (39.Godwin A.K. Lieberman M.W. Mol. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 4: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Reduction of GLUT1 expression through antisense GLUT1 RNA suppresses NIH 3T3 cell transformation by N-ras (40.Choi J.W. Yoon D.J. Lee H.W. Han D.P. Ahn Y.H. Yonsei Med. J. 1995; 36: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hence, the induction of GLUT1 expression by c-Myc may play an important role in tumor glucose metabolism. The specific roles of PFK and enolase in tumorigenesis are less clear. Glycolytic flux is controlled at multiple steps of glycolysis, such that interruption of a non-rate-limiting step may affect overall flux (43.Fell D.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 58: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PFK is a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme due to its intricate allosteric responses to ATP/ADP ratios and therefore may be critically important for the control of glycolytic flux. Enolase has not been directly implicated in human cancers; however, it is intriguing to note that a negative transactivating factor of the c-myc promoter (myc-binding protein 1) may be identical to enolase A (44.Chaudhary D. Miller D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45.Subramanian A. Miller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5958-5965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). While the role for enolase in regulating c-mycexpression remains to be confirmed and further studied, this finding suggests that the induction of enolase by c-Myc may increase glycolysis and also serves as a negative feedback onto c-myc gene expression. In summary, we observe that while both c-Myc and HIF-1 up-regulates GLUT1 and glycolytic gene expression, the sets of target genes for these transcription factors are distinct. HIF-1 physiologically induces glycolytic gene expression in hypoxic cells that also undergo growth arrest. By contrast, c-Myc stimulates glucose uptake, glycolysis, and overall metabolism as well as activates the cell cycle machinery, which are all necessary for cell proliferation (46.Elend M. Eilers M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 28: R936-R938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The widespread deregulation of the c-myc gene in human cancers, therefore, may be a major contributor to the enhanced tumor glycolysis known as the Warburg effect, which may confer growth advantage to tumor cells deprived of oxygen.

https://openalex.org/W2073575984,"We previously demonstrated that AKT2, a member of protein kinase B family, is activated by a number of growth factors via Ras and PI 3-kinase signaling pathways. Here, we report the frequent activation of AKT2 in human primary ovarian cancer and induction of apoptosis by inhibition of phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt pathway. In vitro AKT2 kinase assay analyses in 91 ovarian cancer specimens revealed elevated levels of AKT2 activity (>3-fold) in 33 cases (36.3%). The majority of tumors displaying activated AKT2 were high grade and stages III and IV. Immunostaining and Western blot analyses using a phospho-ser-473 Akt antibody that detects the activated form of AKT2 (AKT2 phosphorylated at serine-474) confirmed the frequent activation of AKT2 in ovarian cancer specimens. Phosphorylated AKT2 in tumor specimens localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm but not the nucleus. To address the mechanism of AKT2 activation, we measured in vitro PI 3-kinase activity in 43 ovarian cancer specimens, including the 33 cases displaying elevated AKT2 activation. High levels of PI 3-kinase activity were observed in 20 cases, 15 of which also exhibited AKT2 activation. The remaining five cases displayed elevated AKT1 activation. Among the cases with elevated AKT2, but not PI 3-kinase activity (18 cases), three showed down-regulation of PTEN protein expression. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase/AKT2 by wortmannin or LY294002 induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells exhibiting activation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT2 pathway. These findings demonstrate for the first time that activation of AKT2 is a common occurrence in human ovarian cancer and that PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway may be an important target for ovarian cancer intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2009381049,"The central regulatory role of the adipocyte in whole body energy homeostasis is well established. However, recent findings suggest that preadipocytes and adipocytes may play an important physiological role in the regulation of both the innate and adaptive immune response. To systematically characterize the molecular machinery of the adipocyte that mediates the recognition of pathogens, we have focused our analysis on the recently identified Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These receptors have been implicated as mediators of the cellular response to bacterial lipopolysacharides (LPSs). Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of mouse TLR-2 from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. TLR-2 synthesis is strongly induced in the adipocyte by LPS, TNFα, and the yeast cell wall extract zymosan. TLR-2 undergoes a lengthy intracellular maturation process with a half-life of exit from the ER of approximately 3 h. Furthermore, LPS treatment of adipocytes results in dramatic changes at the level of gene expression, including the synthesis of a distinct set of secretory proteins such as interleukin-6.

NM_016562 and NM_016610). The founding member of the family, theDrosophila Toll protein, plays an essential role in embryonic development as a receptor for the maternal factor spaetzle and is critically involved in the establishment of dorsoventral polarity (4Anderson K.V. Bokla L. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1985; 42: 791-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it participates in the antifungal response in the adult fly (5Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar).

Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Adipocytes also actively secrete and respond to inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα,1 IL-1β, and IL-6 (11Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6152) Google Scholar, 12Mattacks C.A. Pond C.M.

Disord. 1998; 22: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). A recent report by Marette and colleagues (14Kapur S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E635-E641PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that systemic administration of LPS to rats markedly increased inducible nitric-oxide synthase mRNA and protein levels in white and brown adipose tissues. This effect was comparable with or greater than the induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in liver, kidney, or skeletal muscle. Loskutoff and colleagues (15Samad F. Yamamoto K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) report that LPS induces plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 mRNA in adipose tissue. Many of these observations could be explained with a response to LPS via increased TNFα secretion from macrophages. This macrophage-borne TNFα in turn was thought to be responsible for the downstream effects triggered in the adipocyte. We wanted to test whether adipocytes can directly and acutely respond to systemic or local LPS. We therefore determined whether adipocytes express the two known “pattern recognition receptors” for bacterial and fungal cell wall components, TLR-2 and TLR-4. We found that TLR-4, but not TLR-2, is constitutively present in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, activation of TLR-4 with LPS results in the rapid induction of high levels of TLR-2 in these cells. This allowed us to use the adipocyte system to study the biogenesis of the endogenous TLR-2 receptor and to examine the effects of TLR-4 receptor activation at the gene expression level.

In brief, the cells were propagated in FCS (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml each)) and allowed to reach confluence (day −2). After 2 days (day 0), the medium was changed to DM1 (containing FCS and 160 nm insulin, 250 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine). Two days later (day 2), the medium was switched to DM2 (FCS containing 160 nminsulin). After another 2 days, the cells were switched backed to FCS. NIH-3T3 cells were grown and propagated in DMEM containing 10% donor calf serum and antibiotics. J774 cells were grown in FCS and were a gift from Dr. Matthew Scharff. 4 days before the experiment, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of a 4% solution of thioglycollate medium (Difco). Mice were sacrificed, the peritoneum was perfused with DMEM plus 1% bovine serum albumin, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g. From the same mice, visceral adipose tissue was excised, minced, and washed in DMEM. Adipocytes were then isolated as described in Refs. 11Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M.

In brief, a day 8 3T3-L1 adipocyte library in vector pcDNAI (19Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) in MC1061 cells was subdivided in 96 pools, each pool representing 5000 individual clones. Bacteria were grown up overnight in 96-well plates in 200 μl of selective LB medium. Subsequently, 50 μl of culture medium from each well was pooled across each column and each row. The resulting 20 pools were then screened by PCR for the presence of a 400-bp fragment generated with primers based on a mouse EST sequence with strong homology to human TLR-2 3′-untranslated region. Positive wells were identified on the basis of the intersection of positive pools from columns and positive pools from rows. The procedure was repeated four times, in each round reducing the complexity of clones per well by a factor of 10. One full-length TLR-2 clone was isolated and subjected to sequencing. Isolation of mRNA from tissues was as described in Ref. 19Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10× Denhardt's solution, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(A); the 32P-labeled DNA probes were used at concentrations of 2 × 106 cpm/ml. The filters were subsequently washed in 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 50 °C before autoradiography. RT-PCR was performed on mRNA using a RT-PCR kit from Life Technologies, Inc. Primers used for PCR comprised the 5′ and 3′ regions of the open reading frame of mouse Cab45 (1.1-kilobase fragment) and mouse caveolin-2 (0.5-kilobase fragment) and a portion of the IL-6 coding region (5′ primer, CTT CCA TCC AGT TGG CTT CTT; 3′ primer, GCT TTG TCT TTC TTG TTA TCT). TLR-2 was subcloned into vector pEF6/V5-His-Topo (Invitrogen) and used for transient transfection assays in 293-T cells. Plasmids were transiently transfected into 293-T cells (10-cm dishes) by the Effectene method (Qiagen). 48 h after transfection, cells were labeled, for the time indicated in the specific experiments, in 3 ml of DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine and supplemented with 0.5 mCi (1000 Ci/mmol) of Express Protein Labeling Reagent. Cells were thereafter washed three times with chase medium (DMEM containing unlabeled methionine and cysteine at 1 mm and cycloheximide at 300 μm). At the end of the chase period, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then scraped into TNET-OG buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 60 mm octyl glucoside, and protease inhibitors). Cells were lysed in TNET-OG buffer. When indicated, total cpm of protein-incorporated [35S]Cys/Met were adjusted by determining trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts by mixing 50 μl of lysate with an equal volume of 80% acetone, 20% trichloroacetic acid solution and incubation on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Pellets were washed with 1 ml of acetone (−20 °C), and the centrifugation was repeated. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 2% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and cpm were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Lysates were precleared by the addition of 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TNET buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 30 min at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged for 5 s at 15,000 × g, the supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube, and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added together with the corresponding antiserum. Samples were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times in TNET buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Endo H digestions, immunoprecipitates were washed once in PBS and then resuspended in Endo H buffer (0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 1% SDS) and boiled for 5 min. For peptide N-glycanase F (PNGase F) reactions, samples were resuspended in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol; boiled for 5 min; and then supplemented with Nonidet P-40 (1% final concentration) and sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm final concentration; pH 7.0); samples were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 500 units of Endo H (New England Biolabs) or 1 unit of PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by boiling in 2× sample buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 20% sucrose) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of TNT buffer (TNET lacking EDTA) containing 60 mmoctyl glucoside and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Solubilized material was then loaded atop a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient (4.0 ml) and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm (∼340,000 ×g) for 7 h in a SW 60 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Note that the gradient was prepared with TNT buffer containing the appropriate amount of sucrose and LPS where indicated. After centrifugation, 13 380-μl gradient fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The antibodies to GDP dissociation inhibitor were generous gifts from Dr. Perry Bickel (Washington University, St. Louis). A fusion protein construct was generated in pMALc (New England Biolabs) comprising the cytoplasmic tail of TLR-2. Antibodies were prepared in rabbits using the facility at Covance Inc. (Denver, PA). Anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were purchased from Sigma. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in PBS or Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS or Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEN Life Science Products). Isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (20Scherer P.E. Manning-Krieg U.C. Jeno P. Schatz G. Horst M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11930-11934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) on a Hoefer GT-1 tube gel apparatus. Separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (21Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Automated DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA sequencing facility at AECOM. Since the sequence for mouse TLR-2 was not available at the beginning of this project, we decided to obtain a full-length version of TLR-2 from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte library. We employed a PCR-screening strategy described by Takumi and Lodish (18Takumi T. Lodish H.F. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 443-444PubMed Google Scholar) to isolate a mouse cDNA clone. The sequence of TLR-2 is 70% conserved with its human homolog and has been deposited in GenBankTM with accession no. AF165189. While this manuscript was in preparation, the sequence for mouse TLR-2 was also reported by Heine and colleagues (22Heine H. Kirschning C.J. Lien E. Monks B.G. Rothe M. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the tissue distribution of TLR-2 mRNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from healthy mice. Northern analysis was performed using a probe comprising the open reading frame of the mouse TLR-2 cDNA. A number of tissues, including spleen, smooth muscle, and lung and to a lesser extent kidney and heart, express detectable levels of TLR-2 mRNA. Surprisingly, adipose tissue also displayed significant levels of TLR-2, suggesting that adipose tissue expresses TLR-2 even in an immunologically unchallenged state. In parallel, we probed another Northern blot of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, adipose tissue, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and J774 macrophages with a TLR-4 probe. As expected, we find that J774 cells express high levels of TLR-4. Adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 adipocytes express TLR-4 as well, albeit at a lower level. Surprisingly, even NIH 3T3 cells express significant levels of TLR-4 mRNA. To normalize for loading the Northern blots were also probed with the constitutive markers ribophorin and GDP dissociation inhibitor. To determine whether the TLR-2 clone isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes encodes a full-length protein with a functional signal sequence capable of translocating the protein into the luminal portion of the secretory pathway, the cDNA for TLR-2 was carboxyl-terminally tagged with the FLAG epitope and subcloned into vector pEF6/V5-His-Topo. 293-T cells were transiently transfected with this expression construct, and 48 h post-transfection cells were labeled for 30 min with [35S]Cys/Met. The reactions were subsequently chased for 1 h in the presence of cycloheximide and excess unlabeled amino acids. Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. To determine whether TLR-2 undergoes post-translational modification withN-linked carbohydrates, immunoprecipitates were divided and treated with either endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or PNGase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig.2 A shows that 293-T cells indeed produce a protein of the estimated molecular weight that is completely sensitive to Endo H and PNGase F, suggesting that the bulk of the transiently expressed protein resides in a pre-Golgi compartment. To be able to study endogenous TLR-2, we generated polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. Fig.2 B shows an experiment similar to the one shown in Fig.2 A, except that the chase period was extended to 14 h to allow the TLR-2 to reach its final intracellular destination. Another labeling reaction was performed in parallel with 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-TLR-2 antibodies and, when indicated, treated with Endo H. Both anti-FLAG and anti-TLR-2 antibodies immunoprecipitate a protein of similar electrophoretic mobility from 293-T cells as from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Surprisingly, even after 14 h of chase, the vast majority of TLR-2 remains in a pre-Golgi compartment in 293-T cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes are highly responsive to TNFα. Many groups have demonstrated the effects of TNFα on the insulin signal transduction cascade in which TNFα acts as an insulin desensitizer (23Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M.

At the gene expression level, we have previously demonstrated that TNFα induces a host of secretory proteins while repressing the expression of others (10Scherer P.E. Bickel P.E. Kotler M. Lodish H.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test whether TNFα has an effect on TLR-2 expression, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes for various times with TNFα. After the TNFα treatment, cells were briefly pulsed with [35S]Cys/Met, and cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-TLR-2 (Fig. 3 A). 3T3-L1 adipocytes induce TLR-2 with maximal induction observed after approximately 3 h. These observations were confirmed by Western blot analysis on uninduced and TNFα-induced cells. This confirmed that 3T3-L1 adipocytes have very low levels of TLR-2 present in the uninduced state that cannot be detected by Western blot analysis. This is in contrast to adipose tissue (Fig. 1) that expresses detectable mRNA levels for TLR-2 even in the uninduced state. Our initial observations in 293-T cells with a transiently transfected TLR-2 construct suggested that TLR-2 is post-translationally modified by N-linked carbohydrates. Additionally, using Endo H resistance, we determined that the bulk of TLR-2 remains in a pre-Golgi compartment in 293-T cells. To determine the fate of endogenously expressed TLR-2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were pretreated with TNFα for 1.5 h and then pulse-labeled with [35S]Cys/Met for 30 min (Fig.4). The cells were subsequently chased in presence of cycloheximide for various lengths of time and analyzed for resistance to Endo H treatment. Similar to the situation in 293-T cells, endogenous TLR-2 is N-glycosylated in adipocytes as well. TLR-2 undergoes a lengthy intracellular maturation process as judged by the kinetics with which it acquires resistance to Endo H, with a half-life of maturation of approximately 3 h. Note that a doublet is observed at later chase points in the untreated samples with the lower band corresponding to the Endo H-resistant form. Northern blot analysis suggested significant expression of TLR-2 in adipose tissue. While it is difficult to precisely gauge the significance of the systemic contributions of TLR-2 expressed in adipose tissue, we have undertaken a qualitative assessment of TLR-2 induction in response to TNFα in various cell lines. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (an uncommitted, undifferentiated cell line) were compared with 3T3-L1 fibroblasts in both the pre- and postdifferentiation state as well as J774 cells that represent a widely used model macrophage cell line. All cells were pretreated for the indicated lengths of time with TNFα and subsequently pulse-labeled for 1 h with [35S]Cys/Met. Overall incorporation of labeled amino acids into protein was measured by assessing the level of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts. Lysates were adjusted, and an aliquot was analyzed either directly by SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitated with anti-TLR-2 antibodies. Fig. 5(bottom panel) shows that all cells incorporated the label uniformly. Both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were highly responsive to TNFα, much more so than NIH-3T3 fibroblasts or J774 macrophages (top panel). The inflammatory cytokine TNFα induces TLR-2. We wondered whether LPS could directly trigger the up-regulation of TLR-2. Similar to the experiment described in Fig.4, cells were treated for various amounts of time with LPS followed by a brief pulse with [35S]Cys/Met. Since LPS binds to TLR-4 complexed with CD14, we performed this and all subsequent experiments involving LPS in presence of 10% fetal calf serum that supplies soluble CD14. Total extracts as well as TLR-2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed. Fig. 6 A shows a comparison between 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. NIH-3T3 cells failed to induce TLR-2 upon treatment with LPS; even prolonged exposure of the gel did not reveal any detectable TLR-2. 3T3-L1 adipocytes, however, rapidly induced significant levels of TLR-2, reaching peak levels within 1 h. Interestingly, a direct comparison of the induction kinetics of TLR-2 in adipocytes and J774 macrophages in response to LPS shows a more rapid up-regulation of TLR-2 in the adipocyte compared with the macrophage, suggesting functional differences in the response to LPS in the two cell types (Fig. 6 B). Additionally, the fact that NIH 3T3 cells fail to induce TLR-2 despite significant levels of TLR-4 mRNA (Fig.1 B) is surprising. Possibly, mRNA levels for TLR-4 may not reflect protein levels in the various cell types. Alternatively, additional cell type-specific factors may be needed for the downstream response that are present in macrophages and (pre)adipocytes but are not available in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In our pulse-labeling assay, we are looking only at de novosynthesized TLR-2. To test whether LPS stimulation of TLR-2 synthesis also requires de novo transcription, we included the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D during incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with LPS. Fig. 6 C shows that the presence of actinomycin D inhibits the induction of TLR-2, suggesting that TLR-4 activation triggers a transcriptional event that leads to TLR-2 induction. In addition, we tested whether a known activator of TLR-2, zymosan (a yeast cell wall preparation), or GXM, (a cell wall preparation from C. neoformans) was able to trigger TLR-2 induction within a similar time frame. Treatment at this short time scale with either of these preparations did not result in induction of TLR-2. This is in agreement with our observation that in unstimulated cells TLR-2 is not present at significant levels. Fig. 6 Ddemonstrates that the LPS-triggered TLR-2 induction occurs even at very low LPS concentrations in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with changes in TLR-2 expression triggered between 1 and 10 ng/ml LPS, reaching a plateau at concentrations higher than 100 ng/ml under the conditions chosen. Fig. 6 Chas demonstrated that acute treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TLR-2 ligand zymosan does not lead to the up-regulation of TLR-2 expression. We wanted to test whether prolonged incubation with zymosan could trigger up-regulation of TLR-2. The rationale is that low basal level expression of TLR-2 present in the unstimulated state may up-regulate TLR-2 expression at low levels. Newly synthesized TLR-2 that reaches the cell surface may in turn cause a burst of TLR-2 induction in the continued presence of zymosan. Since we have shown that newly synthesized TLR-2 requires more than 3 h to appear on the cell surface, we would expect a delayed but sudden burst of TLR-2 induction concomitant with the rate of maturation of the de novosynthesized TLR-2. This should be followed by rapid down-regulation ofde novo synthesis similar to the phenomenon observed for TLR-4-triggered TLR-2 up-regulation. Fig.7 shows that this indeed the case. We have assayed TLR-2 production in this case by immunoprecipitation of lysates from treated cells with anti-TLR-2 antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-TLR-2. Therefore, in contrast to the experiments involving metabolic labeling with [35S]Cys/Met that reflect the rate of synthesis, we are measuring the total accumulation of TLR-2 in this case. Thetop panel shows the Western blot of TLR-2, and the bottom panel shows a quantitation of the experiment. LPS triggers a much more linear response for TLR-2 induction, whereas zymosan treatment causes a delayed response with an acute burst of TLR-2 induction between 3 and 6 h. By 12 h, the LPS-treated cells start to clear TLR-2 as judged by the decreased overall levels of TLR-2 at later time points. The Northern blot data shown in Fig. 1 demonstrates that TLR-2 is constitutively expressed in adipose tissue. To determine whether TLR-2 expression can be induced in bona fide mouse adipocytes, we treated adipocytes isolated from a visceral fat pad for 3 h with LPS and TNFα in the presence of [35S]Cys/Met. As a control, peritoneal exudate cells were isolated from the same animals and treated in parallel. After the labeling reaction, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-TLR-2 antibodies. Both adipocytes and peritoneal exudate cells induced the expression of TLR-2 in response to either LPS or TNFα (Fig. 8). Surprisingly, freshly isolated adipocytes expressed TLR-2 even in the uninduced state at levels much higher than observed for uninduced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Since the TLR-2 induction is not limited to the 3T3-L1 tissue culture system, these experiments suggest that TLR-2 induction in adipose tissue may play an important physiological rolein vivo. To test whether binding of LPS induces changes in the oligomerization state of TLR-2, the size of the TLR-2 complex was estimated by velocity sedimentation analysis. Cells were labeled for several hours with [35S]Cys/Met in the presence of TNFα to achieve high level expression of recept"
https://openalex.org/W2013065884,"Apoptosis involves mitochondrial steps such as the release of the apoptogenic factor cytochrome c which are effectively blocked by Bcl-2. Although Bcl-2 may have a direct action on the mitochondrial membrane, it also resides and functions on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and there is increasing evidence for a role of the ER in apoptosis regulation as well. Here we uncover a hitherto unrecognized, apoptotic crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria that is controlled by Bcl-2. After triggering massive ER dilation due to an inhibition of secretion, the drug brefeldin A (BFA) induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in a caspase-8- and Bid-independent manner. This is followed by caspase-3 activation and DNA/nuclear fragmentation. Surprisingly, cytochrome c release by BFA is not only blocked by wild-type Bcl-2 but also by a Bcl-2 variant that is exclusively targeted to the ER (Bcl-2/cb5). Similar findings were obtained with tunicamycin, an agent interfering with N-linked glycosylations in the secretory system. Thus, apoptotic agents perturbing ER functions induce a novel crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria that can be interrupted by ER-based Bcl-2."
https://openalex.org/W1975866732,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has an anti-apoptotic role in anchorage-dependent cells via an unknown mechanism. To elucidate the role of FAK in anti-apoptosis, we have established several FAK cDNA-transfected HL-60 cell lines and examined whether FAK-transfected cells have resistance to apoptotic stimuli. FAK-transfected HL-60 (HL-60/FAK) cells were highly resistant to apoptosis induced with hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) and etoposide (50 μg/ml) compared with the parental HL-60 cells or the vector-transfected cells, when determined using viability assay, DNA fragmentation, and flow cytometry analysis. Because no proteolytic cleavage of pro-caspase 3 to mature caspase 3 fragment was observed in HL-60/FAK cells, FAK was presumed to inhibit an upstream signal pathway leading to the activation of caspase 3. HL-60/FAK activated the phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH-kinase-Akt survival pathway and exhibited significant activation of NF-κB with marked induction of inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs: cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP), regardless of the hydrogen peroxide-treated or untreated conditions, whereas no significant IAPs were detected in the parental or vector-transfected HL-60 cells. Apoptotic agents induced higher NF-κB activation in HL-60/FAK cells than in HL-60/Vect cells, and it appeared that sustained NF-κB activation is critical to the anti-apoptotic states in HL-60/FAK cells. Mutagenesis of FAK cDNA revealed that Y397 and Y925, which are involved in the tyrosine-phosphorylation sites, were prerequisite for the anti-apoptotic activity as well as induction of IAPs, and that K454, which is involved in the kinase activity, was also required for the full anti-apoptotic activity of FAK. Taken together, we have demonstrated definitively that FAK-transfected HL-60 cells, otherwise sensitive to apoptosis, become resistant to the apoptotic stimuli. We conclude that FAK activates the phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH-kinase-Akt survival pathway with the concomitant activation of NF-kB and induction of IAPs, which ultimately inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 cascade.

The mechanism of these antioxidant molecules to suppress apoptosis has not fully been elucidated.Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated in the integration of signals from integrins, oncogenes, and neuropeptides (22.Schaller M.D. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 241-255PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnika M. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). FAK has also been shown to play an important role in the cell survival of anchorage-dependent cells (24.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of FAK by caspase-3 has been reported during growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (25.Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which implies an association between FAK and apoptosis.We found that FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated by oxidative stress before apoptosis occurred (26.Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein kinase B/Akt which has been implicated in the pathway of survival signal, was serine-phosphorylated following tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. This proposed that FAK has an anti-apoptotic role in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the human glioblastoma cell line T98G (27.Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this paper, we attempted to elucidate the possibility that FAK may also have an anti-apoptotic function in HL-60 cells. We observed that naive HL-60 cells are not resistant to various apoptosis-inducing reagents, whereas FAK-overexpressed cells acquire resistance to oxidative stress, etoposide-induced apoptosis, with a concomitant inhibition of caspase-3 proteases. We further found that the phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH-kinase (PI3-kinase)-Akt survival pathway, NF-κB activation, and increase of inhibitory apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are involved in the FAK-induced resistance to apoptosis. Thus, FAK was found to activate a signal linking NF-κB and IAPs.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of FAK endowed HL-60 cells to protect against apoptosis otherwise induced by two representative apoptosis-inducers, an oxidative stress or an anticancer drug, etoposide. In addition to hydrogen peroxide and etoposide, FAK-overexpressed cells were also found to be resistant to C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis (data not shown).It has been widely recognized that HL-60 cells do not adhere, but 10 nm PMA-treated cells adhered mildly after 1 day of treatment with PMA and differentiated to macrophage-like cells. HL-60/FAK cells adhered mildly similarly to PMA-treated HL-60 cells (data not shown). It is unknown whether the expression of FAK is prerequisite for or merely concomitant with the differentiation into macrophage form. It should be noted that PMA-treated cells exhibited enhanced FAK expression and acquired the resistance to the hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis similar to the HL-60/FAK, strongly suggesting that FAK plays a role in the anti-apoptosis during the differentiation into macrophages. There have been several reports describing the anti-apoptotic roles of FAK in various apoptosis-inducing system. Hungerford et al. (36.Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) reported on anchorage-dependent cells that became apoptotic when cells were microinjected with anti-FAK antibody, or with a peptide corresponding to the portion of the β1-integrin cytoplasmic domain presumed to be required for the β1-integrin-FAK interaction. In another study, Frischet al. (24.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) reported that constitutively activated FAK protected MDCK cells from apoptosis consequent to the loss of matrix contact. Furthermore, Xu et al. (37.Xu L. Owens G.C. Sturge X. Yang E.T. Liu R.J. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar) reported that attenuation of FAK expression leads to apoptosis in some tumor cells. Interestingly, Ilic et al. (38.Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) reported that the extracellular matrix survival signals transduced by FAK suppressed a p53-regulated apoptosis by serum withdrawal in anchorage-dependent cells. Whether FAK has an anti-apoptotic effect on other stress or drug-induced apoptosis has not been explored, and the mechanism of FAK anti-apoptosis has not been elucidated so far. In this study, we showed evidences that demonstrate that FAK has an anti-apoptotic role in the apoptosis induced by oxidative stress as well as etoposide in anchorage-independent HL-60 cells. Etoposide and hydrogen peroxide are known to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) (39.Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung K.C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions used in this study induced apoptosis in parental HL-60 and HL-60/Vect cells during a 4-h incubation period. In contrast, HL-60/FAK cells did not result in apoptosis by these stimuli during the 4-h incubation period. The anti-apoptotic effect by FAK continued at 24 h (data not shown). So far, there has been no reports on the anti-apoptotic role of FAK in ROS-producing stimuli.Although the mechanism of etoposide-induced apoptosis remains largely unknown, one possible mechanism is that ROS produced by etoposide induce apoptosis. ROS are presumed to destroy mitochondria function and induce apoptosis by activating caspase-3 (19.Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is a critical downstream protease in the caspase cascade (40.Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), responsible for the cleavage of important substrates such as poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (41.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar) and inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (42.Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). The caspase family controls apoptosis by multiple stimuli, including Fas ligand and TNF-α (43.Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 44.Nagata S. Cell. 1996; 88: 335-365Google Scholar). We found HL-60/FAK blocked the caspase-3 activation by hydrogen peroxide or etoposide, which indicated that FAK regulation occurs upstream of caspase-3 activation.Fas-associated death domain-like ICE inhibitory protein (45.Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) is known as an inhibitor of Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic proteins, CrmA and p35, have also been shown to inhibit apoptosis by directly inhibiting ICE family proteases (3.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rounke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar), most likely by functioning as substrates for and as competitive inhibitors of ICE family proteases. In contrast, IAPs bind to caspases and inhibit its activity. Expression of the IAP mRNAs (c-IAP1,2 and XIAP) was minimal in HL-60/Vect cells but remarkable in HL-60/FAK cells during untreated conditions, indicating FAK augmented the expression of these genes. HL-60/FAK showed higher basal NF-κB activation than did HL-60/Vect cells. High constitutive NF-κB activation may be critical to the antiapoptotic states induced by FAK cDNA transfection, which results in sustained expression of IAPs. It is reasonable to link FAK to the IAP, because IAP genes are the NF-κB-regulated genes. We showed here that the FAK-PI3-kinase-Akt survival pathway is constitutively activated in HL-60/FAK cells. Recently, it is reported that Akt mediates IκBkinase phosphorylation followed by NF-κB activation (35.Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 46.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin D.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). We should also take into consideration whether this pathway functions in HL-60/FAK cells.FAK Tyr-397 is an autophosphorylation site and a high-affinity binding site for Src homology 2 domains of Src family kinases (35.Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ also interact with this site. FAK Lys-454 is essential for kinase activity. FAK Tyr-925 is a binding site for the Grb2 Src homology 2 domain, and this interaction contributes to integrin-stimulated activation of Ras. Transfection with kinase-inactive FAK (K454R) indicated that the catalytic activity of FAK might be necessary for the full anti-apoptosis effect of FAK. Transfection with FAK mutants (Y397F and Y925F) indicated that tyrosine residues of 397 and 925 were essential for the anti-apoptotic effect. These results suggested that the signals through Src family kinase, PI3-kinase and/or Grb2, link to NF-κB activation and induction of IAPs. Further signal analysis of NF-κB activation by FAK should provide more information about the role of FAK in apoptosis. Recently, Chan et al. (47.Chan P.-C. Lai J.-F. Cheng C.-H. Tang M.-J. Chiu C.-C. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of FAK in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells suppressed the UV-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, they compared the anti-apoptotic activity of wild type FAK with those of FAK mutants (D395A, Y397F, p712/715A, and Y925F). These mutants failed to promote cell survival upon UV irradiation. The interaction of FAK with these proteins might lead to survival signals from FAK, proposing that the binding of PI3-kinase and p130cas with FAK is required for the anti-apoptotic function of FAK. We demonstrated here that FAK protects against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells as well as the glioblastoma cell line T98G (27.Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, Chan et al. (47.Chan P.-C. Lai J.-F. Cheng C.-H. Tang M.-J.

Particularly, the involvement of NF-κB and IAPs and the resulting abrogation of caspase-3 activation was evidenced in the suppression of apoptosis in this study. To our knowledge, the data presented here provide the first line of evidence for the regulation of IAPs through NF-κB by FAK. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) contributes to the normal development and tissue remodeling of multicellular organisms (1.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev.

The mechanism of these antioxidant molecules to suppress apoptosis has not fully been elucidated. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated in the integration of signals from integrins, oncogenes, and neuropeptides (22.Schaller M.D. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 241-255PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnika M. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). FAK has also been shown to play an important role in the cell survival of anchorage-dependent cells (24.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of FAK by caspase-3 has been reported during growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (25.Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which implies an association between FAK and apoptosis. We found that FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated by oxidative stress before apoptosis occurred (26.Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein kinase B/Akt which has been implicated in the pathway of survival signal, was serine-phosphorylated following tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. This proposed that FAK has an anti-apoptotic role in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the human glioblastoma cell line T98G (27.Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this paper, we attempted to elucidate the possibility that FAK may also have an anti-apoptotic function in HL-60 cells. We observed that naive HL-60 cells are not resistant to various apoptosis-inducing reagents, whereas FAK-overexpressed cells acquire resistance to oxidative stress, etoposide-induced apoptosis, with a concomitant inhibition of caspase-3 proteases. We further found that the phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH-kinase (PI3-kinase)-Akt survival pathway, NF-κB activation, and increase of inhibitory apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are involved in the FAK-induced resistance to apoptosis. Thus, FAK was found to activate a signal linking NF-κB and IAPs. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of FAK endowed HL-60 cells to protect against apoptosis otherwise induced by two representative apoptosis-inducers, an oxidative stress or an anticancer drug, etoposide. In addition to hydrogen peroxide and etoposide, FAK-overexpressed cells were also found to be resistant to C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis (data not shown).It has been widely recognized that HL-60 cells do not adhere, but 10 nm PMA-treated cells adhered mildly after 1 day of treatment with PMA and differentiated to macrophage-like cells. HL-60/FAK cells adhered mildly similarly to PMA-treated HL-60 cells (data not shown). It is unknown whether the expression of FAK is prerequisite for or merely concomitant with the differentiation into macrophage form. It should be noted that PMA-treated cells exhibited enhanced FAK expression and acquired the resistance to the hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis similar to the HL-60/FAK, strongly suggesting that FAK plays a role in the anti-apoptosis during the differentiation into macrophages. There have been several reports describing the anti-apoptotic roles of FAK in various apoptosis-inducing system. Hungerford et al. (36.Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) reported on anchorage-dependent cells that became apoptotic when cells were microinjected with anti-FAK antibody, or with a peptide corresponding to the portion of the β1-integrin cytoplasmic domain presumed to be required for the β1-integrin-FAK interaction. In another study, Frischet al. (24.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) reported that constitutively activated FAK protected MDCK cells from apoptosis consequent to the loss of matrix contact. Furthermore, Xu et al. (37.Xu L. Owens G.C. Sturge X. Yang E.T. Liu R.J. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar) reported that attenuation of FAK expression leads to apoptosis in some tumor cells. Interestingly, Ilic et al. (38.Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) reported that the extracellular matrix survival signals transduced by FAK suppressed a p53-regulated apoptosis by serum withdrawal in anchorage-dependent cells. Whether FAK has an anti-apoptotic effect on other stress or drug-induced apoptosis has not been explored, and the mechanism of FAK anti-apoptosis has not been elucidated so far. In this study, we showed evidences that demonstrate that FAK has an anti-apoptotic role in the apoptosis induced by oxidative stress as well as etoposide in anchorage-independent HL-60 cells. Etoposide and hydrogen peroxide are known to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) (39.Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung K.C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions used in this study induced apoptosis in parental HL-60 and HL-60/Vect cells during a 4-h incubation period. In contrast, HL-60/FAK cells did not result in apoptosis by these stimuli during the 4-h incubation period. The anti-apoptotic effect by FAK continued at 24 h (data not shown). So far, there has been no reports on the anti-apoptotic role of FAK in ROS-producing stimuli.Although the mechanism of etoposide-induced apoptosis remains largely unknown, one possible mechanism is that ROS produced by etoposide induce apoptosis. ROS are presumed to destroy mitochondria function and induce apoptosis by activating caspase-3 (19.Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is a critical downstream protease in the caspase cascade (40.Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), responsible for the cleavage of important substrates such as poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (41.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar) and inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (42.Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). The caspase family controls apoptosis by multiple stimuli, including Fas ligand and TNF-α (43.Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 44.Nagata S. Cell. 1996; 88: 335-365Google Scholar). We found HL-60/FAK blocked the caspase-3 activation by hydrogen peroxide or etoposide, which indicated that FAK regulation occurs upstream of caspase-3 activation.Fas-associated death domain-like ICE inhibitory protein (45.Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) is known as an inhibitor of Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic proteins, CrmA and p35, have also been shown to inhibit apoptosis by directly inhibiting ICE family proteases (3.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rounke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar), most likely by functioning as substrates for and as competitive inhibitors of ICE family proteases. In contrast, IAPs bind to caspases and inhibit its activity. Expression of the IAP mRNAs (c-IAP1,2 and XIAP) was minimal in HL-60/Vect cells but remarkable in HL-60/FAK cells during untreated conditions, indicating FAK augmented the expression of these genes. HL-60/FAK showed higher basal NF-κB activation than did HL-60/Vect cells. High constitutive NF-κB activation may be critical to the antiapoptotic states induced by FAK cDNA transfection, which results in sustained expression of IAPs. It is reasonable to link FAK to the IAP, because IAP genes are the NF-κB-regulated genes. We showed here that the FAK-PI3-kinase-Akt survival pathway is constitutively activated in HL-60/FAK cells. Recently, it is reported that Akt mediates IκBkinase phosphorylation followed by NF-κB activation (35.Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 46.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin D.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). We should also take into consideration whether this pathway functions in HL-60/FAK cells.FAK Tyr-397 is an autophosphorylation site and a high-affinity binding site for Src homology 2 domains of Src family kinases (35.Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ also interact with this site. FAK Lys-454 is essential for kinase activity. FAK Tyr-925 is a binding site for the Grb2 Src homology 2 domain, and this interaction contributes to integrin-stimulated activation of Ras. Transfection with kinase-inactive FAK (K454R) indicated that the catalytic activity of FAK might be necessary for the full anti-apoptosis effect of FAK. Transfection with FAK mutants (Y397F and Y925F) indicated that tyrosine residues of 397 and 925 were essential for the anti-apoptotic effect. These results suggested that the signals through Src family kinase, PI3-kinase and/or Grb2, link to NF-κB activation and induction of IAPs. Further signal analysis of NF-κB activation by FAK should provide more information about the role of FAK in apoptosis. Recently, Chan et al. (47.Chan P.-C. Lai J.-F. Cheng C.-H. Tang M.-J. Chiu C.-C. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of FAK in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells suppressed the UV-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, they compared the anti-apoptotic activity of wild type FAK with those of FAK mutants (D395A, Y397F, p712/715A, and Y925F). These mutants failed to promote cell survival upon UV irradiation. The interaction of FAK with these proteins might lead to survival signals from FAK, proposing that the binding of PI3-kinase and p130cas with FAK is required for the anti-apoptotic function of FAK. We demonstrated here that FAK protects against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells as well as the glioblastoma cell line T98G (27.Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E.

Particularly, the involvement of NF-κB and IAPs and the resulting abrogation of caspase-3 activation was evidenced in the suppression of apoptosis in this study. To our knowledge, the data presented here provide the first line of evidence for the regulation of IAPs through NF-κB by FAK.

https://openalex.org/W954261861,"Protein kinase C-delta is activated during apoptosis, following proteolytic cleavage by caspase 3. Furthermore, overexpression of the catalytic kinase fragment of PKC-delta induces the nuclear phenotype associated with apoptosis, though the molecular basis of this effect has not been determined. In these studies we have examined the role of PKC-delta in the disassembly of the nuclear lamina at apoptosis. The nuclear lamina is disassembled during mitosis and apoptosis and mitotic disassembly involves hyperphosphorylation of lamin proteins by mitotic lamin kinases. During apoptosis, lamin proteins are degraded by caspase 6 and the contribution made by phosphorylation has not been proven. We show here that protein kinase C-delta co-localized with lamin B during apoptosis and activation of PKC-delta by caspase 3 was concomitant with lamin B phosphorylation and proteolysis. Inhibition of PKC-delta delayed lamin proteolysis, even in the presence of active caspase 6, whilst inhibitors of mitotic lamin kinases were without effect. In addition recombinant human PKC-delta was able to phosphorylate lamin B in vitro suggesting that its actions are direct and not via an intermediary kinase. We propose that PKC-delta is an apoptotic lamin kinase and that efficient lamina disassembly at apoptosis requires both lamin hyperphosphorylation and caspase mediated proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2002357878,"We investigated the effects of mild oxidation on protein kinase C (PKC) using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system of generating superoxide. Exposure of various PKC preparations to superoxide stimulated the autonomous activity of PKC. Similarly, thiol oxidation increased autonomous PKC activity, consistent with the notion that superoxide stimulates PKC via thiol oxidation. The superoxide-induced stimulation of PKC activity was partially reversed by reducing agents, suggesting that disulfide bond formation contributed to the oxidative stimulation of PKC. In addition, superoxide increased the autonomous activity of the α, βII, e, and ζ PKC isoforms, all of which contain at least one cysteine-rich region. Taken together, our observations suggested that superoxide interacts with PKC at the cysteine-rich region, zinc finger motif of the enzyme. Therefore, we examined the effects of superoxide on this region by testing the hypothesis that superoxide stimulates PKC by promoting the release of zinc from PKC. We found that a zinc chelator stimulated the autonomous activity of PKC and that superoxide induced zinc release from an PKC-enriched enzyme preparation. In addition, oxidized PKC contained significantly less zinc than reduced PKC. Finally, we have isolated a persistent, autonomously active PKC by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography from hippocampal slices incubated with superoxide. Taken together, these data suggest that superoxide stimulates autonomous PKC activity via thiol oxidation and release of zinc from cysteine-rich region of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W2019365102,"Decorin belongs to a family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans that are directly involved in the control of matrix organization and cell growth. Genetic evidence indicates that decorin is required for the proper assembly of collagenous matrices. Here, we sought to establish the precise binding site of decorin on type I collagen. Using rotary shadowing electron microscopy and photoaffinity labeling, we mapped the binding site of decorin protein core to a narrow region near the C terminus of type I collagen. This region is located within the cyanogen bromide peptide fragment alpha1(I) CB6 and is approximately 25 nm from the C terminus, in a zone that coincides with the c(1) band of the collagen fibril d-period. This location is very close to one of the major intermolecular cross-linking sites of collagen heterotrimers. Thus, decorin protein core possesses a unique binding specificity that could potentially regulate collagen fibril stability."

Inhibition of caspases prevented TRAIL/anti-APO-1-induced apoptosis, but not NF-κB activation, indicating that both pathways bifurcate upstream of the receptor-proximal caspase-8. Under these conditions, TRAIL and anti-APO-1 up-regulated the expression of the known NF-κB targets interleukin-6, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2), and TRAF1 (TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associate factor). In the presence of CHX, the stable overexpression of a deletion mutant of the Fas-associated death domain molecule FADD comprising solely the death domain of the molecule but lacking its death effector domain (FADD-(80–208)) led to the same response pattern as TRAIL or anti-APO-1 treatment. Moreover, the ability of death receptors to induce NF-κB activation was drastically reduced in a FADD-deficient Jurkat cell line.

A subgroup of the TNF receptor superfamily can be defined by the capability of its members to induce cell death with the critical involvement of an ∼100-amino acid intracellular motif, the death domain (3Schulze-Osthoff K.

At present, six human death domain-containing receptors have been identified: TNF-R1, Apo1/Fas, DR3 (TRAMP/Wsl/Apo3/LARD), TRAIL-R1 (DR4), TRAIL-R2 (DR5/TRICK2/KILLER), and DR6 (3Schulze-Osthoff K.

Oligomerization of the procaspases within the receptor signaling complexes may then lead to their autoproteolytic activation, culminating in the initiation of the apoptotic program of the cell (8Martin D.A.

Recruitment of caspase-8 into the death-inducing complex of Apo1/Fas is mediated by FADD (Fas-associating protein with adeath domain) (10Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6578-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the case of TNF-R1, FADD is indirectly recruited into the receptor signaling complex via death domain-mediated interaction with another cytoplasmic death domain protein called TRADD (12Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar) that directly interacts with the death domain of TNF-R1 (13Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Moreover, as fibroblasts from FADD knockout mice are completely protected against the cytotoxic action of TNF-R1, Apo1/Fas, and DR3 (14Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia E.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 15Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), the latter should also mediate apoptosis under critical involvement of FADD. However, the coupling of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 to the apoptotic program is rather undefined. As transient transfection of TRAIL-R1 leads to an apoptotic response in FADD fibroblasts, it appears that FADD has no major role in TRAIL-R1-induced apoptosis (14Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia E.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a role of FADD in TRAIL-R2-induced apoptosis and/or a FADD-related molecule in TRAIL-R1- and TRAIL-R2-induced apoptosis is conceivable, as overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of FADD was shown to interfere with TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (16Chaudhary P.M.

In fact, direct binding of FADD has been shown in transient overexpression studies for both receptors (16Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L.

In addition, TRADD was found in immunoprecipitates of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 when coexpressed with FADD, whereas TRADD binding was not observed in the absence of coexpressed FADD (17Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.-L. Hofmann K. Kataoka K. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Moreover, in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis is completely blocked (20Bodmer J.-L. Holler N. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). A broad range of non-apoptotic cellular responses have been described for TNF-R1. In contrast, Apo1/Fas, TRAIL-R1, and TRAIL-R2 have been predominantly studied with respect to their death-inducing capabilities. Nevertheless, gene induction may also be a function of these receptors. Indeed, some reports have shown the capability of these receptors to activate the transcription factor NF-κB (16Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar,17Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.-L. Hofmann K.

In this report, we demonstrate that both TRAIL (TNF-relatedapoptosis-inducing ligand) and an agonistic Apo1/Fas-specific antibody have a capacity similar to TNF with regard to NF-κB activation, IL-6 production, and up-regulation of cIAP2 as well as TRAF1 mRNA. Moreover, a dominant-negative TRAF2 mutant and the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 interfere with TNF-, TRAIL-, and anti-APO-1-induced activation of NF-κB, arguing for the utilization of common or at least related gene-inducting pathways. However, in contrast to TNF-R1, gene induction by TRAIL and anti-APO-1 likely occurs via a FADD-dependent pathway that is negatively regulated by a CHX-sensitive factor in HeLa cells. Interestingly, we found that the expression of FLIP, a known inhibitor of death receptor-induced apoptosis, is reduced upon CHX treatment and inhibits death receptor-mediated NF-κB activation. The Kym-1 cell line was generously supplied by M. Sekiguchi (University of Tokyo) and maintained in Click-RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom, Berlin) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. HeLa cells as well as transfectants derived thereof and HEK293 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom) containing 5% fetal calf serum. The HeLa and HEK293 cell line were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Recombinant human TNF (2 × 107 units/mg) was kindly provided by I.-M. von Broen (Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany). Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The murine Fas-specific monoclonal antibody Jo2 as well as fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Jo2 were from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany). The Apo1/Fas-specific mAb anti-APO-1 was a kind gift from Marcus Peter (Deutsches Krebsforschungs Zentrum, Heidelberg, Germany), and the anti-caspase-8 mAb was from Prof. Klaus Schulze-Osthoff (University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany). The expression plasmids for murine Fas and murine FasΔ (pEBB-Myc-Fas and pEBB-Myc-FasΔ, respectively) were kindly supplied by David Baltimore (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). The FLIP-specific antiserum and the FLIPL expression plasmid (pCR3-FLIPL) were from Jurg Tschopp (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). The FADD-deficient mutant Jurkat cell line was a kind gift from John Blenis and Peter Juo (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Kym-1 or HeLa cells (106) were seeded in 60-mm cell culture dishes and cultivated overnight. The next day, the cells were stimulated for various times with the indicated combinations of TNF, leucine zipper-tagged TRAIL (TRAIL-LZ), and Z-VAD-fmk. Nuclear extracts were prepared for EMSA analysis as described (24Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed following a standard procedure using a high pressure liquid chromatography-purified NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide (5′-ATC AGG GAC TTT CCG CTG GGG ACT TTC CG-3′) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Finally, the samples were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in low ionic strength buffer. For transient transfection assays, HeLa or HEK293 cells (0.8 × 105) were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates. The following day, the cells were transfected with a 3xNF-κB/luciferase reporter plasmid and the constructs of interest as well as an SV40 promoter-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid to normalize the transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed with SuperFect reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 1 day of recovery, the cells were treated as indicated, harvested in PBS, and lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Mannheim, Germany); and finally, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using a Lumat 9501 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). For transient transfection assays with Jurkat cells, the cells were transfected only with the 3xNF-κB/luciferase reporter plasmid and empty vector as described above, but in the presence of fetal calf serum. After 6 h of recovery, the transfected Jurkat cells were split into the wells of a 96-well plate. The next day, the cells were stimulated as indicated, harvested in PBS, and lysed in luciferase lysis buffer; and again, luciferase activities were determined using the Lumat 9501 luminometer. HeLa cells (1.5 × 104/well) were plated in triplicates in 96-well microtiter plates in 100 μl of Click-RPMI 1640 medium and cultured overnight. The following day, the cells were treated as indicated with the reagents of interest for an additional 12–24 h. The supernatants were then removed and cleared by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the IL-6 concentration was determined using a commercially available ELISA kit (Pharmingen). HeLa cells (10 × 106) were treated with the reagents of interest for 5 h; and subsequently, total RNA was isolated with an RNA INSTAPURE kit (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The presence of transcripts of xIAP, TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF4, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), cIAP1, and cIAP2 as well as that of the internal controls L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were analyzed using the human Apo5a Multi-Probe template set (Pharmingen). Probe synthesis, hybridization, and RNase treatment were performed with the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase Protection assay system (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Finally, protected transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (5%) and quantified on a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). To correct signals of protected transcripts for background intensities, the latter were determined for each individual lane in close proximity to the respective mRNA signal and subtracted from the value of the protected transcript. Background intensities for TRAF1, cIAP2, and xIAP were determined in the area between the location of the xIAP and TRAF1 bands, and background intensities for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were taken directly below the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase band. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.1 volume of a protease inhibitor mixture stock solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%) overnight. The membrane was incubated with anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-2 (Pharmingen), or anti-FLIP antiserum (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS/Tween 20, membranes were incubated with anti-mouse (caspase-8, caspase-2) or anti-rabbit (FLIP) alkaline phosphatase antibody (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 1 h. After four washes with PBS/Tween 20, the blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. We have recently found that HeLa and Kym-1 cells are TRAIL-responsive with respect to induction of apoptosis and activation of JNK (25Mühlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the gene-inductive properties of TRAIL in these cells in greater detail. In Kym-1 cells, TRAIL treatment led to a significant activation of the transcription factor NF-κB as revealed by EMSA analysis (Fig. 1 A); concomitantly, cell death was also induced (data not shown). When the onset of apoptosis was completely blocked using the broad range caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, NF-κB activation was even enhanced (Fig.1 A). For these and the following experiments, a leucine zipper-tagged form of TRAIL (18Walczak H. Degli-Esposti M.A. Johnson R.S. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N. Timour M.S. Gerhart M.J. Schooley K.A. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5386-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) was used. Different results were obtained in HeLa cells. Although mRNA (25Mühlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and protein (data not shown) of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 were detectable in HeLa cells, TRAIL failed to induce NF-κB activation in EMSAs (Fig. 1 B) and reporter gene assays (Fig. 1 C). As HeLa cells are sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis only in the presence of CHX (25Mühlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we also looked for TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation under these conditions. In fact, when protein synthesis in HeLa cells was reduced by CHX treatment and induction of apoptosis was blocked by Z-VAD-fmk, stimulation with TRAIL led to a significant activation of NF-κB in terms of nuclear translocation (Fig. 1 B) and NF-κB-dependent gene induction (Fig. 1 C). Hence, it seems that in HeLa cells, not only is TRAIL-induced apoptosis blocked by a CHX-sensitive factor(s), but also TRAIL-induced activation of NF-κB. Similarly, activation of NF-κB by Apo1/Fas in Apo1/Fas-transfected HeLa cells (HeLa-Fas cells) also depended on the presence of CHX and inhibition of apoptosis (Fig. 1 D). To verify that TRAIL-LZ- and anti-APO-1-mediated NF-κB activation in HeLa cells results in induction of endogenous genes, we analyzed the biosynthesis of the NF-κB-regulated gene products IL-6, cIAP2, and TRAF1. Treatment of HeLa or HeLa-Fas cells with TRAIL or anti-APO-1, respectively, led to the up-regulation of IL-6 production only when CHX was added and concomitantly induced apoptosis was blocked. TNF treatment, however, did not require reduction of protein synthesis to induce this response (Fig.2 A). As expected, reduction of protein synthesis was necessary and sufficient for TRAIL-induced IL-6 production in HeLa cells stably transfected with thecrmA (cytokine responsemodifier A) gene of cowpox virus (Fig.2 B). The CrmA protein is an efficient inhibitor of caspase-1 and, more important in this context, caspase-8 and renders cells resistant to the apoptotic effects of TNF, TRAIL, and anti-APO-1. Hence, CHX has to affect gene products acting upstream of caspase-8 or on a pathway that bifurcates upstream of this molecule to allow gene induction. TRAIL (Fig. 3 A) and anti-APO-1 (Fig. 3 B) efficiently induced the production of IL-6 in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of CHX when induction of apoptosis was blocked. In contrast, TNF-induced IL-6 production was already induced in the absence of CHX (Fig. 3 C), but addition of CHX together with inhibition of cell death shifted the dose-response curve of TNF-mediated IL-6 production strongly toward lower concentrations (Fig. 3 C). Remarkably, IL-1-induced IL-6 production was not or only moderately affected by CHX/Z-VAD-fmk treatment (Fig. 3 D). Concentrations of CHX between 2 and 5 μg/ml were sufficient to allow half-maximal activation of IL-6 production upon TRAIL and anti-APO-1 treatment and were also sufficient to significantly enhance TNF-induced IL-6 production (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, there was no effect of CHX on IL-1-induced IL-6 production even at concentrations up to 50 μg/ml. The modest CHX concentrations used in our experiments had almost no effect on the viability of the cells and did not activate NF-κB (Fig. 1) or JNK (data not shown).Figure 3Effect of CHX and apoptosis inhibition on IL-6 production by TRAIL, anti-APO-1, TNF and IL-1. HeLa and HeLa-Fas cells were cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 2. HeLa cells were then treated for an additional 18 h with TRAIL-LZ (A), TNF (C), or IL-1 (D), and HeLa-Fas cells were incubated with anti-APO-1 (B) alone (○) or in the presence of 2 μg/ml CHX (●). IL-6 concentrations in supernatants were measured using a commercially available ELISA kit. InE, HeLa cells (1.5 × 104) were cultured overnight in 96-well assay plates. The next day, cells were incubated for an additional 18 h with TNF (10 ng/ml; ○), TRAIL-LZ (100 ng/ml; ■), IL-1 (10 ng/ml; ▿), or medium alone (●) in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (20 μm) and the indicated concentrations of CHX. Finally, IL-6 production was measured as already described in the legend to Fig. 2. In F are shown the results from the RNase protection assay analysis of various members of the TRAF and IAP protein families in HeLa and HeLa-Fas cells upon TRAIL-LZ and anti-APO-1 treatment, respectively. Cells were treated with TRAIL-LZ (100 ng/ml) or anti-APO-1 (100 ng/ml) for 5 h in the presence of the indicated reagents (20 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Z) and 2 μg/ml CHX (C)). Please note that isolation of RNA from CHX/TRAIL- and CHX/anti-APO-1-treated cells failed due to extended cell death. Whole RNAs were isolated after treatment, and 10 μg of each RNA was analyzed with the human Apo5a Multi-Probe template set to detect the indicated mRNAs. Relative expression levels were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using RNase protection assays, we have previously shown that cIAP2 and TRAF1 are transcriptionally up-regulated by NF-κB-inducing reagents (26Schwenzer R.

Moreover, cIAP2 has been identified as an NF-κB-regulated gene (27Chu Z.-L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In line with our previous results, transcripts of both genes were up-regulated after TRAIL and anti-APO-1 treatment in the presence of CHX/Z-VAD-fmk, but not in the absence of these reagents (Fig.3 F). Again, TNF was able to elicit the same response in the absence of CHX/Z-VAD-fmk (data not shown). Together, these data argue for a specific inhibitory effect of a CHX-sensitive factor on death receptor-mediated activation of NF-κB. As it has been shown for TNF-R1 that a deletion mutant of TRAF2 lacking the amino-terminal RING finger structure (TRAF2-(87–501)) interferes with NF-κB activation (28Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), we checked whether this mutant also affects TRAIL- and anti-APO-1-induced NF-κB activation. In fact, overexpression of TRAF2-(87–501) blocked TRAIL- and anti-APO-1-mediated activation of an NF-κB-driven reporter gene construct in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). In addition, TNF- and TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation was abrogated by transient overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of the NF-κB-inducing kinase NIK, but not by dominant-negative MEKK1 (data not shown). Some recent reports suggest that TNF-induced expression of NF-κB-dependent genes is the result of a cooperative mechanism comprising translocation into the nucleus and DNA binding of NF-κB as well as modulation of the transactivation machinery via the p38 kinase pathway (29Beyaert R.

Therefore, we analyzed the effect of the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 on TRAIL- and anti-APO-1-induced NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 4 B, in HeLa cells, treatment with 66 μm SB203580 inhibited 93, 83, and 72% of anti-APO-1-, TRAIL-, and TNF-induced IL-6 production, respectively. Moreover, treatment with SB203580 inhibited >70% of the TRAIL-induced up-regulation of TRAF1 mRNA (Fig. 4 C). These data indicate that TRAIL receptors and Apo1/Fas utilize a cooperative mechanism for the induction of NF-κB-regulated genes, as has been already shown for TNF-R1. Taken together, our results suggest that TRAIL-, FasL-, and TNF-engaged gene inductions converge upstream of or at the level of TRAF2. Hence, the CHX-sensitive factor(s) that prevent NF-κB activation and gene induction by TRAIL-LZ and anti-APO-1 should be located upstream or parallel to TRAF2. The adaptor protein FADD has been implicated in the apoptotic signaling of Apo1/Fas, TNF-R1, and the death domain-containing TRAIL receptors (14Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia E.J.

https://openalex.org/W2160770127,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus upon activation by tyrosine phosphorylation. Several protein-tyrosine kinases can induce phosphorylation of STATs in cells, including Janus kinase (JAK) and Src family kinases. One STAT family member, Stat3, is constitutively activated in Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells and is required for cell transformation. However, it is not entirely clear whether Src kinase can phosphorylate Stat3 directly or through another pathway, such as JAK family kinases. To address this question, we investigated the phosphorylation of STATs in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 insect cells in the presence of Src. Our results show that Src can tyrosine-phosphorylate Stat1 and Stat3 but not Stat5 in this system. The phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat3 proteins are functionally activated, as measured by their abilities to specifically bind DNA oligonucleotide probes. In addition, the JAK family member Jak1 efficiently phosphorylates Stat1 but not Stat3 in Sf-9 cells. By contrast, we observe that AG490, a JAK family-selective inhibitor, and dominant negative Jak1 protein can significantly inhibit Stat3-induced DNA binding activity as well as Stat3-mediated gene activation in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, wild-type or kinase-inactive platelet-derived growth factor receptor enhances Stat3 activation by v-Src, consistent with the receptor serving a scaffolding function for recruitment and activation of Stat3. Our results demonstrate that Src kinase is capable of activating STATs in Sf-9 insect cells without expression of JAK family members; however, Jak1 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor are required for maximal Stat3 activation by Src kinase in mammalian cells. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which Jak1 serves to recruit Stat3 to a receptor complex with Src kinase, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates Stat3 in Src-transformed fibroblasts.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Upon cytokine stimulation, cytokine receptors dimerize and thereby activate receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (JAK) family (3Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The activated JAKs induce STAT activation by a two-step mechanism. First, JAKs phosphorylate receptor tyrosine residues, which in turn become docking sites for the recruitment of cytoplasmic STAT proteins. Second, the recruited STAT proteins are directly phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAKs. Activated STATs then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to specific promoter sequences of target genes and induce transcription (4Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). This signaling mechanism is often referred to as the JAK-STAT pathway (2Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev.

The different STATs are involved in mediating a variety of biological functions in diverse cell types. For example, Stat1 is critical for interferon functions as well as innate immunity (5Durbin J.E.

A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), which demonstrates the importance of Stat3 in the development of mouse embryos. In addition, Stat5 has been shown to be important in lactation and hematopoiesis (11Gouilleux F. Moritz D. Humar M. Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Groner B.

Stem Cells. 1999; 17: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).STAT activation has also been observed to be induced by epidermal growth factor and PDGF receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities (14Fu X.Y. Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S.

Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). While receptor tyrosine kinases may directly phosphorylate STATs, some reports suggest that JAKs are involved in PDGF-induced STAT activation. For example, the JAK family kinases, Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, are activated in cells stimulated with PDGF (18Vignais M.L. Sadowski H.B. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1759-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that Stat3 activation by PDGF receptor is mediated by JAK kinases but that Stat1 activation is not (19Vignais M.L. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PDGF can also activate the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src (20Gould K.L. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,21Courtneidge S.A. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Superti-Furga G. Twamley-Stein G.M. Dev. Suppl. 1993; : 57-64PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that c-Src activates Stat1 and Stat3 in PDGF-stimulated murine fibroblast cells (22Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that STAT activation by polypeptide hormones involves nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in addition to the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of their receptors.We and others have observed the constitutive activation of Stat3 in v-Src-transformed cells (23Yu C.L.

Further studies demonstrated that this Stat3 activation results in gene activation and is essential for v-Src transformation (26Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 27Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Although direct activation of Stat3 by Src has been suggested (24Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 28Chaturvedi P. Reddy M.V. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the mechanism of Stat3 activation is not entirely clear (29Garcia R. Jove R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and may employ different mechanisms that are dependent on the cell type. In v-Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts, Jak1 and, to a much lesser extent, Jak2 are also constitutively activated (30Campbell G.S., Yu, C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of Stat3 activation by Src, we examined STAT activation by Src and Jak1 expressed from recombinant baculoviruses in Sf-9 insect cells as well as the role of Jak1 in Stat3 activation in mouse fibroblasts transformed by v-Src.Here we report that Stat1 and Stat3 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in Sf-9 cells by activated Src in the absence of other mammalian tyrosine kinases. The phosphorylated STAT proteins bind to specific DNA sequences in gel shift assays, indicating that this phosphorylation induces functional activation of the STAT proteins. Furthermore, Jak1 enhances activation of Stat1 but not Stat3 when co-expressed with Src in Sf-9 cells, and the phosphorylation level of Jak1 is also increased with the expression of Src. By contrast, in NIH3T3 cells, Jak1 activity is required for maximal Stat3-mediated gene induction. In addition, activation of Stat3 by Src in mammalian cells is enhanced by the PDGF receptor independently of receptor kinase activity, consistent with a scaffolding function for the receptor. Our results indicate that, although Src can directly activate Stat3 in insect cells, Jak1 plays an important role in the activation of Stat3 in Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts. These findings support a model in which Src and Jak1 cooperate together with the PDGF receptor and possibly other receptors to activate Stat3 in the context of oncogenesis.DISCUSSIONWhile constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling has previously been shown to be required for cell transformation by the oncogenic Src tyrosine kinase (26Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 27Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), the mechanism of Stat3 activation by Src was not entirely clear. Our results presented here demonstrate that maximal activation of Stat3 requires Jak1 and PDGF-R in v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells, indicating that the mechanism of Stat3 activation induced by oncogenic Src is more complex than a simple interaction between Stat3 and Src. However, in Sf-9 insect cells, Src is much more efficient than Jak1 at phosphorylating Stat3, arguing that Jak1 is not acting as an intermediary kinase between Src and Stat3. Furthermore, the role of PDGF-R in Stat3 activation by Src in NIH3T3 cells does not require the receptor's intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Based on our findings, we propose that the oncogenic Src kinase activates Jak1 kinase, which in turn phosphorylates tyrosine sites on PDGF-R and possibly other receptors that provide docking sites for Stat3 (Fig.11). In this model, activation of Jak1 is required for the recruitment of Stat3 proteins into a receptor complex with Src kinase, which then directly phosphorylates Stat3 at Tyr-705. Our model is consistent with the earlier findings that Stat3 is co-immunoprecipitated with Src (24Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 25Chaturvedi P. Sharma S. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3295-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that Jak1 is constitutively activated in Src transformed cells (30Campbell G.S., Yu, C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Our data (Fig. 1) demonstrate that Src can efficiently activate Stat1 and Stat3, but not Stat5A, in Sf-9 cells in the absence of other mammalian kinases, suggesting that Stat1 and Stat3 are immediate substrates of Src. Although we cannot quantitatively compare the phosphorylation levels of Stat1 and Stat3 with each other, since different antibodies are used for each protein, we can determine the phosphorylation status of these STAT proteins (Fig. 3). Either Stat5A is not a substrate of Src or else an additional component is required for its activation. This observation is consistent with our previous findings that c-Fes activates Stat3 but not Stat5A in Sf-9 cells (39Nelson K.L. Rogers J.A. Bowman T.L. Jove R. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7072-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that v-Src does not activate Stat5 in NIH3T3 cells (43Garcia R., Yu, C.L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K.L. Smithgall T. Fujita D.J. Ethier S.P. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that baculovirus-expressed Bcr-Abl can activate Stat5A rules out the possibility that Stat5A expressed in insect cells is resistant to activation (39Nelson K.L. Rogers J.A. Bowman T.L. Jove R. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7072-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although we could not exclude the possible involvement of an insect equivalent of mammalian JAK kinase, the endogenous insect JAK counterpart would probably be expressed at very low levels compared with baculovirus-overexpressed STAT and Src proteins. We did not observe a rate-limiting step in STAT activation by Src in insect cells, suggesting that low levels of endogenous insect kinases are not involved in STAT activation by overexpressed Src. Moreover, co-expression of Jak1 did not significantly increase Stat3 activation by Src in Sf-9 cells, indicating that JAK family kinases are not a factor in Stat3 activation by Src in insect cells.Several lines of evidence support our model shown in Fig. 11. First, we show in insect cells that Src is able to activate Stat1 and Stat3 selectively, consistent with Src being the immediate upstream kinase for phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3. Second, Jak1 is unable to phosphorylate Stat3 efficiently, which is in striking contrast to the result that it phosphorylates Stat1 equally as well as Src does. This finding suggests that Jak1 is unlikely to be the kinase for Stat3 activation acting downstream of Src kinase in v-Src-transformed cells. Third, the JAK-selective inhibitor, AG490, and the Src-selective inhibitor, PD180970, significantly inhibit Stat3 DNA binding activity in v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells, which indicates a requirement for both Src and JAKs in Stat3 activation. Fourth, Jak1 is hyperphosphorylated in the presence of active Src in insect cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In addition, inhibition of Src kinase activity by PD180970 abolishes Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation in v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells. Since the tyrosine phosphorylation level of Jak1 has been found to correlate with its kinase activity (30Campbell G.S., Yu, C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), these results suggest that Jak1 is directly activated by Src in v-Src transformed NIH3T3 cells. Fifth, both AG490 and dominant negative Jak1 inhibit Stat3-mediated gene regulation, further establishing a requirement of Jak1 for Stat3 activation by Src in NIH3T3 cells. Sixth, the lack of Stat1 activation in v-Src-transformed fibroblast cells may be due to the inaccessibility (possibly resulting from the lack of Stat1-specific docking sites) to the kinases, which is consistent with the notion that membrane-bound receptors contribute to the specificity of STAT signaling (4Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Previous studies (24Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) have shown that Stat1 can be activated by interferon-γ stimulation of v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells, indicating that the normal Jak1-Stat1 pathway is intact in v-Src-transformed fibroblasts. These findings point to different mechanisms for activation of Stat1 and Stat3. One plausible reason why Stat1 signaling is down-regulated in v-Src-transformed cells may be that Stat1 is involved in growth-inhibitory and proapoptosis functions (51Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M.

Reddy M.V. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), consistent with a direct role for c-Src in Stat3 activation. Normal c-Src has been shown to be activated in epidermal growth factor- and PDGF-stimulated cells and to interact with epidermal growth factor and PDGF receptors (17Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2075-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one recent study (54Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) reported that the activation of STAT proteins induced by epidermal growth factor receptor is mediated by c-Src. Using a cell-free system, another recent study provided evidence for differences between Stat1 and Stat3 activation by PDGF (19Vignais M.L. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In particular, JAK kinases are indispensable for Stat3 activation induced by PDGF but not for Stat1 activation; however, these studies did not address the involvement of c-Src in activation of Stat1 and Stat3 in response to PDGF stimulation (19Vignais M.L. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Other studies have also suggested that c-Src activates Stat1 and Stat3 in PDGF-stimulated NIH3T3 cells (22Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 53Wang Y. Wharton W. Garcia R. Kraker A. Jove R. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2075-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and a multiprotein complex containing PDGF-R, c-Src, and STAT proteins has been detected (53Wang Y. Wharton W. Garcia R. Kraker A. Jove R. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2075-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that Src and JAK family kinases are both required for PDGF-mediated Stat3 signaling in normal NIH3T3 cells (Ref. 53Wang Y. Wharton W. Garcia R. Kraker A. Jove R. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2075-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; our unpublished results). Therefore, cooperation among Src, JAKs, and PDGF-R may be required for Stat3 activation in normal growth factor signaling events. We have shown that the expression of PDGF-R is essential for maximal Stat3 activation induced by v-Src in mammalian cells (Fig. 10). Importantly, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of PDGF-R is not required for Stat3 activation by v-Src, consistent with the receptor's proposed role as a scaffolding complex for recruitment of Stat3 into close proximity of Src. However, our findings do not exclude the possibility that other receptors may also provide this scaffold function for recruitment and activation of Stat3 by v-Src.The requirement of JAK kinases for STAT activation has been previously observed in other oncogenic signaling events (55Catlett-Falcone R. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of JAK family kinases, AG490, blocks IL-6-dependent Stat3 activation in human multiple myeloma tumor cells (8Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). In human mycosis fungoides tumor cell lines, Jak3 and Tyk2 are in a complex with Stat3 and are required for Stat3 activation as well as for cell growth (56Nielsen M. Kaltoft K. Nordahl M. Ropke C. Geisler C. Mustelin T. Dobson P. Svejgaard A. Odum N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6764-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the case of v-Abl-transformed cells, Jak1 is required for proliferation in BAF/3 cells (57Danial N.N. Losman J.A. Lu T. Yip N. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Goff S.P. Wang J.Y. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of Jak1 and v-Abl has been observed, and this interaction is essential for STAT activation (57Danial N.N. Losman J.A. Lu T. Yip N. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Goff S.P. Wang J.Y. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells, Jak1, but not Jak2 or Tyk2, is important in Stat3 activation by v-Src, since dominant negative Jak2 and Tyk2 did not affect Stat3-mediated gene activation by v-Src. 2Y. Zhang, J. Turkson, C. Carter-Su, T. Smithgall, A. Levitzki, A. Kraker, J. J. Krolewski, P. Medveczky, and R. Jove, unpublished results. By contrast, JAK kinases are neither activated nor required for Bcr-Abl-induced STAT activation (12Frank D.A. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 432-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the activated Lck kinase can directly phosphorylate Stat3 (58Lund T.C. Coleman C. Horvath E. Sefton B.M. Jove R. Medveczky M.M. Medveczky P.G. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the requirement of JAK family kinases is dependent on the specific cell type as well as the particular oncogenic signals involved.Consistent with the results presented here, recent studies demonstrate that both Src and JAK tyrosine kinases are required for constitutive Stat3 activation in human breast cancer cell lines. 3R. Garcia, J. Sun, T. L. Bowman, G. Niu, Y. Zhang, S. Minton, C. A. Muro-Cacho, N. N. Ku, R. Falcone, C. Cox, A. Kraker, A. Levitzki, S. Parsons, S. M. Sebti, and R. Jove, submitted for publication. Inhibition of Src or JAKs by PD180970 or AG490, respectively, results in inactivation of Stat3 DNA binding activity and growth inhibition of these breast cancer cells. Thus, the cooperation between Src and JAK tyrosine kinases is important for the constitutive Stat3 activation in various cell types, including human tumor cell lines. Our findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism of Stat3 activation that requires cooperation of Src and Jak1 kinase in v-Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts. In this model, Jak1 has a critical role in recruiting Stat3 to a receptor complex with Src kinase, which in turn directly phosphorylates Stat3. This model may be relevant not only to oncogenic signaling by tyrosine kinases but also to normal growth factor receptor signaling. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs)1 are a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated in response to various extracellular polypeptide ligands, including cytokines and growth factors (1Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar[email protected] , 2Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Upon cytokine stimulation, cytokine receptors dimerize and thereby activate receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (JAK) family (3Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The activated JAKs induce STAT activation by a two-step mechanism. First, JAKs phosphorylate receptor tyrosine residues, which in turn become docking sites for the recruitment of cytoplasmic STAT proteins. Second, the recruited STAT proteins are directly phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAKs. Activated STATs then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to specific promoter sequences of target genes and induce transcription (4Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). This signaling mechanism is often referred to as the JAK-STAT pathway (2Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 3Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Seven mammalian STAT family members have been identified and characterized, and they share similar structural features as well as activation mechanism (1Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar, 4Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). The different STATs are involved in mediating a variety of biological functions in diverse cell types. For example, Stat1 is critical for interferon functions as well as innate immunity (5Durbin J.E.

Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), while Stat3 is required for IL-6 signaling in hematopoietic cells as well as anti-apoptosis (7Fukada T.

https://openalex.org/W1999466080,"Scatter factor (SF) [aka. hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)] (designated HGF/SF) is a multifunctional cytokine that stimulates tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis. We recently reported that HGF/SF protects epithelial and carcinoma cells against cytotoxicity from DNA-damaging agents and that HGF/SF-mediated cytoprotection was associated with up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in cells exposed to adriamycin. We now report that in addition to blocking apoptosis, HGF/SF markedly enhances the repair of DNA strand breaks caused by adriamycin or gamma radiation. Constitutive expression of Bcl-XL in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells not only simulated the HGF/SF-mediated chemoradioresistance, but also enhanced the repair of DNA strand breaks. The ability of HGF/SF to induce both chemoresistance and DNA repair was inhibited by wortmannin, suggesting that these activities of HGF/SF are due, in part, to a phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K) dependent signaling pathway. Consistent with this finding, HGF/SF induced the phosphorylation of c-Akt (protein kinase-B), a PI3K substrate implicated in apoptosis inhibition; and an expression vector encoding a dominant negative kinase inactive Akt partially but significantly inhibited HGF/SF-mediated cell protection and DNA repair. These findings suggest that HGF/SF activates a cell survival and DNA repair pathway that involves signaling through PI3K and c-Akt and stabilization of the expression of Bcl-XL; and they implicate Bcl-XL in the DNA repair process."

Feeding a bile acid-containing atherogenic diet for 3 weeks to C57BL/6 mice led to a 70% reduction in the expression of hepatic CYP7A1 mRNA, whereas no reduction was observed in C3H/HeJ mice. The strain-specific response to repression of CYP7A1 paralleled the activation of hepatic cytokine expression. Studies using cultured THP-1 monocyte/macrophages showed that the hydrophobic bile acid chenodeoxycholate, a well established potent repressor of CYP7A1, induced the expression of mRNAs encoding interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). In contrast, the hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholate, which does not repress CYP7A1, did not induce cytokine mRNA expression by THP-1 cells. Chenodeoxycholate activation of cytokines by THP-1 cells was blocked by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist rosiglitazone. The expression of cytokines (e.g. IL-1 and TNFα) by THP-1 cells paralleled with the ability of these cells to produce conditioned medium that when added to rat L35 hepatoma cells, repressed CYP7A1. Moreover, rosiglitazone, which blocks cytokine activation by macrophages, also blocked the repression of CYP7A1 normally exhibited by C57BL/6 mice fed the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet.

In the studies reported herein, we show that these factors are cytokines produced by macrophages. Female C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6 mice 10–12 weeks old were obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME.

Mice were maintained on the above diets for 3 weeks. In the experiments examining the effect of rosiglitazone on CYP7A1 expression, C57BL/6 mice fed the chow diet and the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet were divided into two groups. Half the mice in each diet group were given either vehicle (0.25% Tween 80, 1% carboxymethylcellulose) alone or vehicle containing 1 mg/ml of rosiglitazone daily by oral gavage. Mice were sacrificed at 9 a.m., and blood was obtained for subsequent analysis. Poly(A) RNA was isolated from mouse livers, as described previously (23.Dueland S. Drisko J. Graf L. Machleder D.

Quantitative trait loci analysis of C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6 mice shows that marked phenotypic differences exist in regard to displaying inflammation in response to consuming the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet (26.Liao F.

J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). C3H/HeJ display essentially a complete resistance to hepatic inflammation, whereas C57BL/6 display a remarkable susceptibility (26.Liao F. Andalibi A. deBeer F.C. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27.Liao F. Andalibi A. Qiao J.H. Allayee H. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We examined if strain-specific differences in cytokine activation might be the basis for the strain-specific differences in CYP7A1 repression. On the normal chow diet, the expression of CYP7A1 mRNA expression was similar in C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice (Fig. 1,A and B). In contrast, the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet caused marked differences in the expression of CYP7A1 by the two strains of mice. While C3H/HeJ mice displayed no significant change in CYP7A1 expression, C57BL/6 mice showed a marked 70% decrease, p < 0.01 (Fig. 1, A andB). The individual strains also displayed distinct differences in the response of hepatic cytokine expression to the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet (Fig. 1 C). In C57BL/6 mice, the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet increased the hepatic expression of mRNAs encoding IL-1α (7-fold, p < 0.01), IL-1β (4-fold, p < 0.01), TNFα (3-fold, p< 0.01), IFNβ (6-fold, p < 0.01), and TGF-β1 (7-fold, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1 C). In marked contrast, the expression of hepatic cytokines by C3H/HeJ mice was unaffected by the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet (Fig.1 C). The concordance between the ability of the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet to induce the expression of mRNAs encoding cytokines while repressing CYP7A1 mRNA expression suggested the possibility that cytokines might mediate the repression of CYP7A1 caused by the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet. Indeed, recent studies have shown that administering lipopolysaccharide as well as the cytokines TNFα or IL-1 to hamsters resulted in a marked suppression of CYP7A1 (28.Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these combined findings, we formulated the following experimentally testable model (Fig. 1 D). Following their active absorption in the distal intestine, bile acids return to the liver via the portal vein entering the hepatic parenchymal cell by crossing through the sinusoids. As bile acids move across the sinusoids, they may interact with resident macrophages (i.e.Kupffer cells) which reside along the sinusoidal surface. At sufficient concentration, bile acids may cause the activation of cytokines by Kupffer cells. These regulatory cytokines may subsequently act on hepatic parenchymal cells, leading to the repression of CYP7A1 (28.Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We attempted to reconstruct this model using the cultured rat hepatoma cell line (L35 cells) and human monocyte/macrophages (THP-1 cells). To approximate the intercellular relationships that may exist between hepatic macrophages and parenchymal cells (Fig. 1 D), THP-1 cells were exposed to bile acids and the effects of the conditioned medium was examined on the expression of CYP7A1 by L35 cells. CYP7A1 expression by L35 cells was unaffected by changing the culture medium to serum-free DMEM, without dexamethasone but containing either 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA containing the hydrophobic bile acid CDCA (100 μm) or conditioned medium obtained from THP-1 cells (Fig.2 A). However, changing the cultured medium to serum-free DMEM, without dexamethasone but containing conditioned medium obtained from THP-1 cells exposed to CDCA, repressed CYP7A1 expression by >70% (Fig. 2 A). These data indicate that: 1) CDCA requires THP-1 cells to repress CYP7A1 expression by L35 cells, and 2) CDCA caused THP-1 cells to secrete a factor that repressed CYP7A1. To further examine the validity of our hypothesis (Fig. 1 D), we determined if CDCA altered the expression of cytokine mRNAs by THP-1 cells (Fig. 2 B). CDCA caused THP-1 cells to markedly increase (∼10-fold) their expression of TNFα, TGF-β1, and IL-1β mRNAs. In contrast, the hydrophilic bile acid, UDCA, which does not repress CYP7A1 (12.Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not induce the expression of the regulatory cytokines TNFα, TGF-β1, and IL-1β (Fig. 2 B). According to our hypothesis (Fig. 1 D) cytokines mediate the repression of CYP7A1 caused by dietary bile acids. Thus, our model predicts that blocking the activation of cytokines by bile acids should block the repression of CYP7A1. PPARγ agonism inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines by monocyte/macrophages (29.Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Therefore, if our model is valid, the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone should prevent repression of CYP7A1. Treating THP-1 cells with rosiglitazone completely blocked the ability of CDCA to induce the expression of cytokine mRNAs (Fig. 2 B). Rosiglitazone also blocked the ability of THP-1 cells exposed to CDCA to produce conditioned medium that could repress CYP7A1 expression by L35 cells (Fig. 2 C). The additional finding that TNFα caused a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of CYP7A1 mRNA by L35 cells (Fig.2 D) further indicates that cytokines produced by THP-1 cells in response to CDCA are responsible for repression of CYP7A1. Further analysis showed that L35 cells did not express detectable levels of mRNAs encoding the regulatory cytokines TNFα, TGF-β1, or IL-1β (data not shown). Treatment of L35 cells with culture medium containing CDCA or rosiglitazone did not induce the expression of these cytokines to detectable levels (data not shown). In marked contrast to L35 cells, HepG2 cells display the ability to express most inflammatory cytokines (30.Gutierrez R.M. Quiroz S.C. Souza V. Bucio L. Hernandez E. Olivares I.P. Llorente L. Vargas V.F. Kershenobich D. Toxicology. 1999; 134: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31.Stonans I. Stonane E. Russwurm S. Deigner H.P. Bohm K.J. Wiederhold M. Jager L. Reinhart K. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The inability of L35 cells to express TNFα, TGF-β1, or IL-1β may explain their requirement for THP-1 cells to observe a CDCA repression of CYP7A1 (Fig. 2, A andB). Our model also predicts that blocking the activation of cytokines by dietary bile acids in C57BL/6 mice should result in the C3H/HeJ phenotype (i.e. resistance to both the activation of hepatic cytokines and the repression of CYP7A1; Fig. 1). We, therefore, determined if treating C57BL/6 mice with rosiglitazone would prevent repression of CYP7A1 by the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet. Rosiglitazone treatment of chow-fed C57BL/6 mice did not alter the expression of CYP7A1. However, in C57BL/6 mice fed the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet, administration of rosiglitazone blocked the repression of CYP7A1 (Fig.3). Our combined data suggest that the ability to induce the expression of hepatic cytokines in response to the bile acid-containing atherogenic diet is responsible for the divergent phenotypic response exhibited by C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice. Thus, C57BL/6 mice display an induction of hepatic cytokine expression (Fig. 1 B) and a repression of CYP7A1 (Fig. 1 A), whereas C3H/HeJ neither display an induction of hepatic cytokines nor a repression of CYP7A1. In essence, rosiglitazone treatment caused C57BL/6 mice to display the C3H/HeJ phenotype in regard to resistance to repression of CYP7A1 by dietary bile acids. Our findings do not exclude other mechanisms, independent of cytokines, acting to repress CYP7A1 in response to bile acids. In experimental models other than inbred mice and L35 cells, bile acid repression of CYP7A1 has been shown to involve BARE (17.Crestani M. Sadeghpour A. Stroup D. Galli G. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 192-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), activation of protein kinase C (18.Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Hylemon P.B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1359-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of FXR (16.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D.

Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Our additional findings showing that while unconjugated CDCA activated THP1 cells to produce cytokine repressors of CYP7A1 (Fig. 2), its taurine and glycine conjugates were without effect (data not shown) are consistent with the distinct physiochemical and physiological properties of unconjugated and conjugated bile acids. Conjugated bile acids require cell type-specific bile acid transporters to be efficiently taken up by cells in the ileum and liver (33.Love M.W. Dawson P.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, unconjugated bile acids can enter cells lacking bile acid transporters via diffusion (33.Love M.W. Dawson P.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our combined results suggest that the unconjugated, hydrophobic bile acid CDCA entering the enterohepatic circulation via intestinal absorption may initiate CYP7A1 repression via the activation of regulatory cytokines by resident macrophages. Therefore, it is likely that the composition and concentration of the bile acid pool within the enterohepatic circulation determines which of several possible mechanisms will be invoked in regard to regulating the expression of CYP7A1.

HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme to generate biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin, a potent endogenous antioxidant (3Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N.

Carbon monoxide shares many similarities with nitric oxide, such as its ability to increase cGMP levels and promote vasodilation, thereby modulating tissue perfusion (4Morita T.

The induction of HO-1 in response to cellular stress is an important protective mechanism, since mice lacking HO-1 show reduced survival when subjected to endotoxemia (6Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc.

Two enhancer regions, located 4 and 10 kilobases (kb) upstream from the transcription start site, are important for induction of HO-1 by LPS in macrophages (11Camhi S. Alam J. Wiegand G. Yoke Chin B. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Both enhancer regions contain multiple activator protein (AP)-1 binding sites, the mutation of which impairs LPS responsiveness in macrophages (11Camhi S. Alam J. Wiegand G. Yoke Chin B. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 plays a pivotal role in LPS and IL-1β signaling (12Karin M. Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are responsible for the up-regulation of a battery of genes involved in the inflammatory response. These include genes encoding adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and inflammatory cytokines (13Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Friedrichs B. Muller C. Brigelius-Flohe R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Genes that require AP-1 for transcriptional regulation demonstrate an increase in AP-1 protein-DNA binding, which is often associated with an increase in the level of AP-1 proteins. Post-translational modifications of AP-1 proteins, such as the phosphorylation of critical serine residues in their activation domains, may also enhance the transactivation potential of these factors (15Karin M. Liu Z.-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). However, alterations in redox status play a critical role in the transcriptional activity mediated by AP-1 proteins, and this redox regulation maps to a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA binding domains of both Fos and Jun (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Although reduced sulfhydryl groups of this cysteine are required for DNA binding and AP-1 activation, the molecular entity of the inactive, oxidized form of the cysteine is less clear. Abate and colleagues (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) have suggested that oxidation of this cysteine does not involve the formation of intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds, and recently Klatt and colleagues (17Klatt P. Molina E.P. De Lacoba M.G. Padilla C.A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Barcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) showed thatS-glutathiolation may contribute to the oxidation of c-Jun sulfhydryls and thus interfere with DNA binding. Since AP-1 proteins are important for signaling during oxidative stress, it has been hypothesized that specific endogenous factors may exist to prevent oxidation, and thus activate intracellular AP-1 proteins and allow DNA binding in response to oxidative stress (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar).An intracellular redox regulator that has been shown to be important for the regulation of transcription factors is thioredoxin (TRX) (18Schenk H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). When reduced by TRX reductase (TRXr) and NADPH, TRX can reactivate oxidatively inactive transcription factors such as Jun and Fos (21Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TRX does not interact directly with AP-1 proteins, but TRX activates AP-1 transcription by direct association with intranuclear redox factor 1 (Ref-1) (19Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 22Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Ref-1 associates transiently with and reduces the conserved cysteine in Fos and Jun, thus enhancing their DNA binding activity (23Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). TRX is usually located in the cytosol (24Holmgren A. Luthman M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but it translocates into the nucleus in response to various stimuli associated with oxidative stress. Therefore, the nuclear translocation of TRX may be a converging step mediating Ref-1-dependent activation of AP-1 proteins by a variety of stress-inducing agents.At the present time, it is not known whether TRX alters the DNA binding activity of AP-1 proteins in response to inflammatory mediators such as LPS and IL-1β. Because many stimuli that induce the nuclear translocation of TRX also induce HO-1, we designed the present experiments to determine the role of TRX in the regulation of HO-1. We hypothesized that TRX is an endogenous factor promoting transactivation of the HO-1 promoter in response to IL-1β and LPS. We tested this hypothesis in RASMC and in macrophages, two cell types that play a central role in the vascular response to inflammation and oxidative stress.DISCUSSIONTRX is responsible for maintaining many cytosolic proteins in the reduced state. Beyond this homeostatic function, TRX has been shown to play a regulatory role in several cellular processes. TRX potentiates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (31Schenk H. Vogt M. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 765-771PubMed Google Scholar), and accentuates the transformed phenotype of tumor cells (32Biguet C. Wakasugi N. Mishal Z. Holmgren A. Chouaib S. Tursz T. Wakasugi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28865-28870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, nuclear TRX may restore the DNA binding activity of several transcription factors in the presence of reactive oxygen species, including AP-1 proteins and the glucocorticoid receptor (19Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 33Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, no data are available on the role of TRX in the regulation of HO-1 in response to inflammatory agents. Our present data suggest that TRX is involved in the AP-1-mediated induction of HO-1 in response to LPS and IL-1β.We demonstrated previously that LPS and IL-1β induce HO-1 gene transcription in RASMC in vivo and in vitro (10Yet S.-F. Pellacani A. Patterson C. Tan L. Folta S.C. Foster L. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4295-4301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). LPS and IL-1β are inflammatory mediators in a number of disease processes including endotoxemia. During endotoxemia, LPS-responsive immune cells (such as macrophages) become activated and release a battery of mediators and proinflammatory cytokines (34Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Similar to what has been described in macrophages stimulated with LPS (11Camhi S. Alam J. Wiegand G. Yoke Chin B. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we show in RASMC that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β increases binding of AP-1 proteins to a cognate motif in the −4-kb enhancer of the HO-1 promoter region (Figs. 1 and 2). In both RASMC and RAW cells, we found that free sulfhydryl groups in nuclear proteins are necessary for DNA binding activity (Fig. 3). Abate and colleagues (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) had previously demonstrated that the redox status of a conserved cysteine residue in Fos and Jun can alter their ability to interact with DNA, and that exogenous TRX can increase the DNA binding activity of recombinant AP-1 proteins. To do so, TRX needed to be in the reduced form, and required the participation of additional nuclear proteins (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). One of these nuclear factors cooperating with TRX is Ref-1 (19Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). TRX may be responsible for the redox cycling of Ref-1, which has been shown to enhance the DNA binding activity of Fos and Jun (23Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nuclear translocation of reduced TRX has been suggested to represent an important signaling event in the induction of AP-1 driven genes.Here we demonstrate that IL-1β induces the nuclear translocation of TRX in RASMC (Fig. 4, A and B) in vitro. Until now, the stimuli known to induce the nuclear translocation of TRX in vitro included hydrogen peroxide (35Tanaka T. Nishiyama Y. Okada K. Matsui M. Yodoi J. Hiai H. Toyokuni S. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 145-155PubMed Google Scholar), tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (19Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), UV irradiation (36Masutani H. Hirota K. Sasada T. Ueda-Tanigushu Y. Tanigushi Y. Matsui M. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and hypoxia/reperfusion (33Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fjii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrate in rats given LPS, a physiological stimulus, that nuclear translocation of TRX occursin vivo in vascular smooth muscle cells (Fig.4 C). Stimuli known to induce the nuclear translocation of TRX cause oxidative stress. We therefore anticipate that reactive oxygen species induced by these stimuli may be involved in the yet undefined mechanisms underlying the nuclear translocation of TRX.In the present study, we demonstrate that the −4-kb enhancer of the HO-1 gene is induced by LPS (Fig. 5 A). Moreover exogenous reduced TRX, in the presence of Ref-1, induces this −4-kb enhancer to a level comparable with that achieved by LPS (Fig. 6 A). This effect of TRX on HO-1 promoter activity was abolished by mutation of the AP-1 sites in the −4-kb enhancer (Fig. 6 B). We then used an irreversible inhibitor of TRXr, DNCB, to evaluate the role of reduced TRX in the induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein by IL-1β and LPS. DNCB is an alkylating agent that potently and specifically inhibits TRXr. For example, DNCB reacts with TRXr about 10,000 times faster than with reduced glutathione (38Arnér E.S.J. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3479-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with DNCB dose-dependently suppressed the induction of HO-1 by IL-1β and LPS (Fig. 7). This effect was not due to a general decrease in transcriptional activity, since DNCB did not affect HO-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 7). As expected, DNCB did not decrease basal HO-1 expression, indicating that reduced TRX is not necessary for the binding of AP-1 proteins to their cognate cis-acting elements in unstimulated cells. Taken together, our data support a role for TRX in the signaling events promoting the induction of HO-1 by inflammatory mediators. HO1-1 is a stress response protein that is induced by a variety of stimuli associated with oxidative stress (1Keyse S.M. Tyrrel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme to generate biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin, a potent endogenous antioxidant (3Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1042-1046Crossref Scopus (2886) Google Scholar). Carbon monoxide shares many similarities with nitric oxide, such as its ability to increase cGMP levels and promote vasodilation, thereby modulating tissue perfusion (4Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 5Christodoulides N. Durante W. Kroll M.H. Schafer A.I. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2306-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The induction of HO-1 in response to cellular stress is an important protective mechanism, since mice lacking HO-1 show reduced survival when subjected to endotoxemia (6Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), chronic hypoxia (7Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Layne M.D. Hsieh C.-M. Maemura K. Kobzik L. Wiesel P. Christou H. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: R23-R29Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), or transplantation of cardiac xenografts (8Soares M.P. Lin Y.L. Csizmadia E.

In macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, HO-1 gene transcription is up-regulated by inflammatory mediators such as LPS and IL-1β (9Camhi S.L. Alam J. Otterbein L. Sylvester S.L. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Yet S.-F. Pellacani A. Patterson C. Tan L. Folta S.C. Foster L. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4295-4301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two enhancer regions, located 4 and 10 kilobases (kb) upstream from the transcription start site, are important for induction of HO-1 by LPS in macrophages (11Camhi S. Alam J. Wiegand G. Yoke Chin B. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Both enhancer regions contain multiple activator protein (AP)-1 binding sites, the mutation of which impairs LPS responsiveness in macrophages (11Camhi S. Alam J. Wiegand G. Yoke Chin B. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 plays a pivotal role in LPS and IL-1β signaling (12Karin M. Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are responsible for the up-regulation of a battery of genes involved in the inflammatory response. These include genes encoding adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and inflammatory cytokines (13Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Friedrichs B. Muller C. Brigelius-Flohe R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Genes that require AP-1 for transcriptional regulation demonstrate an increase in AP-1 protein-DNA binding, which is often associated with an increase in the level of AP-1 proteins. Post-translational modifications of AP-1 proteins, such as the phosphorylation of critical serine residues in their activation domains, may also enhance the transactivation potential of these factors (15Karin M. Liu Z.-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). However, alterations in redox status play a critical role in the transcriptional activity mediated by AP-1 proteins, and this redox regulation maps to a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA binding domains of both Fos and Jun (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Although reduced sulfhydryl groups of this cysteine are required for DNA binding and AP-1 activation, the molecular entity of the inactive, oxidized form of the cysteine is less clear. Abate and colleagues (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) have suggested that oxidation of this cysteine does not involve the formation of intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds, and recently Klatt and colleagues (17Klatt P. Molina E.P. De Lacoba M.G. Padilla C.A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Barcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) showed thatS-glutathiolation may contribute to the oxidation of c-Jun sulfhydryls and thus interfere with DNA binding. Since AP-1 proteins are important for signaling during oxidative stress, it has been hypothesized that specific endogenous factors may exist to prevent oxidation, and thus activate intracellular AP-1 proteins and allow DNA binding in response to oxidative stress (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). An intracellular redox regulator that has been shown to be important for the regulation of transcription factors is thioredoxin (TRX) (18Schenk H. Klein M. Erdebrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 19Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 20Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). When reduced by TRX reductase (TRXr) and NADPH, TRX can reactivate oxidatively inactive transcription factors such as Jun and Fos (21Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TRX does not interact directly with AP-1 proteins, but TRX activates AP-1 transcription by direct association with intranuclear redox factor 1 (Ref-1) (19Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 22Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Ref-1 associates transiently with and reduces the conserved cysteine in Fos and Jun, thus enhancing their DNA binding activity (23Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). TRX is usually located in the cytosol (24Holmgren A. Luthman M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but it translocates into the nucleus in response to various stimuli associated with oxidative stress. Therefore, the nuclear translocation of TRX may be a converging step mediating Ref-1-dependent activation of AP-1 proteins by a variety of stress-inducing agents. At the present time, it is not known whether TRX alters the DNA binding activity of AP-1 proteins in response to inflammatory mediators such as LPS and IL-1β. Because many stimuli that induce the nuclear translocation of TRX also induce HO-1, we designed the present experiments to determine the role of TRX in the regulation of HO-1. We hypothesized that TRX is an endogenous factor promoting transactivation of the HO-1 promoter in response to IL-1β and LPS. We tested this hypothesis in RASMC and in macrophages, two cell types that play a central role in the vascular response to inflammation and oxidative stress. DISCUSSIONTRX is responsible for maintaining many cytosolic proteins in the reduced state. Beyond this homeostatic function, TRX has been shown to play a regulatory role in several cellular processes. TRX potentiates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (31Schenk H. Vogt M. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 765-771PubMed Google Scholar), and accentuates the transformed phenotype of tumor cells (32Biguet C. Wakasugi N. Mishal Z. Holmgren A. Chouaib S. Tursz T. Wakasugi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28865-28870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, nuclear TRX may restore the DNA binding activity of several transcription factors in the presence of reactive oxygen species, including AP-1 proteins and the glucocorticoid receptor (19Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 33Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, no data are available on the role of TRX in the regulation of HO-1 in response to inflammatory agents. Our present data suggest that TRX is involved in the AP-1-mediated induction of HO-1 in response to LPS and IL-1β.We demonstrated previously that LPS and IL-1β induce HO-1 gene transcription in RASMC in vivo and in vitro (10Yet S.-F. Pellacani A. Patterson C. Tan L. Folta S.C. Foster L. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4295-4301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). LPS and IL-1β are inflammatory mediators in a number of disease processes including endotoxemia. During endotoxemia, LPS-responsive immune cells (such as macrophages) become activated and release a battery of mediators and proinflammatory cytokines (34Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Similar to what has been described in macrophages stimulated with LPS (11Camhi S. Alam J. Wiegand G. Yoke Chin B. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we show in RASMC that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β increases binding of AP-1 proteins to a cognate motif in the −4-kb enhancer of the HO-1 promoter region (Figs. 1 and 2). In both RASMC and RAW cells, we found that free sulfhydryl groups in nuclear proteins are necessary for DNA binding activity (Fig. 3). Abate and colleagues (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) had previously demonstrated that the redox status of a conserved cysteine residue in Fos and Jun can alter their ability to interact with DNA, and that exogenous TRX can increase the DNA binding activity of recombinant AP-1 proteins.

We have examined in transiently transfected asynchronous HeLa cells the localization of HA-tagged CDC25B proteins and found that they are nuclear or cytoplasmic suggesting the existence of an active shuttling. Accordingly, localization analysis of deletion and truncation proteins indicates that CDC25B contains a putative nuclear localization signal located between residues 335 and 354. We also demonstrated that a short 58 residues deletion of the amino-terminus end of CDC25B is sufficient to retain it to the nucleus. Mutational analysis indicates that a nuclear export sequence is located between residues 28 and 40. In addition, treatment of the cells with the exportin inhibitor, Leptomycin B, has the same effect. The mutation of Ser-323, a residue that is essential for the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, also abolishes cytoplasmic staining. The subcellular localization of CDC25B is therefore dependent on the combined effects of a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear export signal and on the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins."

Here we examine in greater detail the structural determinants of inactivation using a series of chimeras comprising various regions of wild type α1C and α1Ecalcium channels. Substitution of the II S6 and/or III S6 segments of α1E into the α1C backbone resulted in rapid inactivation rates that closely approximated those of wild type α1E channels. However, neither individual or combined substitution of the II S6 and III S6 segments could account for the 60 mV more negative half-inactivation potential seen with wild type α1E channels, indicating that the S6 regions contribute only partially to the voltage dependence of inactivation. Interestingly, the converse replacement of α1E S6 segments of domains II, III, or II+III with those of α1Cwas insufficient to significantly slow inactivation rates. Only when the I-II linker region and the domain II and III S6 regions of α1E were concomitantly replaced with α1Csequence could inactivation be abolished. Conversely, introduction of the α1E domain I-II linker sequence into α1C conferred α1E-like inactivation rates, indicating that the domain I-II linker is a key contributor to calcium channel inactivation.

Calcium channels, like many other voltage-dependent ion channels, undergo a series of conformational changes in response to voltage, resulting in their opening, closing, and inactivation.

Sci. 1998; 19: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism underlying the inactivation process remain unknown, and there have been few systematic attempts to resolve this issue. By creating a series of chimeras between non-inactivating (L-type) α1C and rapidly inactivating (R-type) α1E rat brain calcium channels, we recently demonstrated that multiple structural domains determine the voltage dependence and rates of calcium channel inactivation (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we present novel evidence implicating the domain II and III S6 segments and the domain I-II linker region as key elements in setting the rate of calcium channel inactivation. Using a number of additional chimeras derived from α1C and α1E channels, we demonstrate that insertion of either the domain II S6, III S6, or I-II linker regions of α1E into α1C is sufficient to confer α1E-like inactivation kinetics. Consistent with these data, removal of inactivation from α1E required the concomitant substitution of all three regions with α1C sequence. Based on this evidence, we propose a model in which the I-II linker forms a hinged lid that may dock at the domain II and III S6 regions of the channel. We previously introduced convenient silent restriction enzyme sites (obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and from New England Biolabs) into the cDNAs encoding for wild-type rat brain α1E (rbE-II, GenBankTM accession number L15453) and α1C (rbC-II, GenBankTMaccession number M67515). AvrII was inserted at the beginning of the I-II linker, and SalI was inserted at the beginning of the II-III linker (see Ref. 34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to facilitate the creation of a series of chimeras encompassing various combinations of transmembrane domains of the two parent channels. To permit exchange of the domain II and III S6 segments, an additional pair of restriction sites was introduced into several of these chimeras at exactly complimentary positions; an AgeI restriction site was introduced 20 amino acids 5′ to the beginning of the II S6 segment, and an AatII site was created 5 amino acids 5′ to the beginning of the III S6 segment. The residues prior to the beginning of II S6 and III S6 are identical in both channels, and hence, the resultant chimeras only differ in their S6 regions. To permit exchange of the domain I-II linker region, a silent NarI site was introduced into the ECCC sequence at the beginning of domain II. The EECC and CCEE chimeras (in the pMT2 expression vector) were used as the template for mutagenesis to introduce unique AgeI sites near the beginning of the II S6 segments. Both constructs were first cut with SalI (II-III linker, 3′-polycloning site) and recircularized to reduce their length by about 5 kb1 before proceeding with mutagenesis. Using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), we created silent mutations at bp 2109 of CCEE and bp 1815 of EECC. Restriction digests confirmed successful addition of the sites, and the coding region was sequenced to confirm the absence of errors. To construct the chimeras, CCEE (+AgeI) and EECC (+AgeI) were cut with KpnI and AgeI, and the resulting 2-kb fragments from each construct were exchanged via ligation. Finally, the excised 5-kb SalI fragment was reintroduced into both constructs to yield two full-length clones: α1E (IIS6C)/pmT2 and α1C(IIS6E)/pmT2. The EEEC and CCCE chimeras (in the pMT2 expression vector) were used as the templates for mutagenesis to introduce unique AatII sites near the beginning of the III S6 segments. Using the QuikChange kit, a silent mutation at bp 4002 of EEEC and a non-silent mutation at bp 3384 of CCCE were introduced. However, because the non-silent mutation of CCCE involved a substitution to the corresponding residue in the EEEC sequence (serine to valine), the substitution became inconsequential in the completed chimera. Successful addition of the sites was confirmed by restriction digests, and the coding region was sequenced to confirm the absence of errors. To construct the chimeras, CCCE + AatII and EEEC +AatII were cut with NotI and AatII restriction enzymes, and the resulting 4-kb fragments from each construct were exchanged and religated to yield two full-length clones: α1E (IIIS6C)/pmT2 and α1C(IIIS6E)/pmT2. To create double chimeras, α1E (IIS6C) and α1E (IIIS6C) were cut withSalI (II-III linker, 3′ polylinker, ∼5 kb). Subsequently, the 5-kb SalI fragment derived from α1E(IIIS6C) was ligated into α1E (IIS6C) to produce α1E (II/IIIS6C). An analogous approach was used to create α1C (II/IIIS6E) from α1C (IIS6E) α1C (IIIS6E). In each case, the correct orientation was determined using restriction digest patterns. To create CeCCC, a unique non-silentSplI site was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange) at the very end of the domain I-II linker regions of CECC and CCCC at exactly complimentary positions in a stretch of residues that is completely conserved between both parent channels (VFYW). AKpnI-SplI fragment (∼1.5 kb) was excised from CECC and ligated into likewise digested CCCC to produce CeCCC but still carrying the non-silent SplI site. Finally, another round of site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove the non-silentSplI site, thereby restoring the original amino acid sequence (VFYW). To create CEEE(II+IIIS6C), anAvrII fragment cut from CCCC (900 bp before 5′ polylinker, I-II linker region, ∼2 kb) and ligated into likewise-digested α1E(II/IIIS6C). To create CECC(IIS6C), CEEE(II/IIIS6C) and EECC were cut with SalI, and the fragment from the latter chimera (corresponding to domains III and IV of α1C) was ligated into the former construct. The correct orientation of the constructs was confirmed via restriction digests. To create CcEEE(II/IIIS6C), we first introduced a silent NarI site into the EEEE(II/IIIS6C) sequence ∼20 amino acid residues before the end of the domain I-II linker region. ECCC contained an endogenousNarI site at an exactly complementary position. A 1900-bpNarI fragment (1000 bp before the 5′ polylinker, end of I-II linker) was excised from ECCC substituted in the EEEE(II/IIIS6C +NarI) construct to give rise to EcEEE(II/IIIS6C), with the lowercase letter indicating the origin of the I-II linker. This construct did not express functionally in HEK cells but was used to create the chimera CcEEE(II/IIIS6C) by substituting domain I of EcEEE(II/IIIS6C) with that of CCCC using AvrII. Correct orientations of the inserts were confirmed via restriction enzyme digests. We previously provided a detailed description of the procedures for transient expression of the wild type and chimeric calcium channels in human embryonic kidney tsa-201 cells and their electrophysiological analysis via whole cell patch clamp (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, the external and internal recording solutions contained, respectively, 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide) and 108 mm cesium methanesulfonate (CsMS), 4 mmMgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide), thus minimizing the possibility of contamination from calcium-dependent inactivation processes. Pipette resistances were typically on the order of 3 to 4 MΩ, and series resistance was compensated by 85% to minimize voltage errors. Currents were typically elicited from holding potentials of −100 mV (or −130 mV for α1E and other chimeras which activated more negatively) to various test potentials using Clampex software (Axon Instruments). However, to obtain steady state inactivation curves, a 5-s conditioning pulse preceded a test depolarization to +10 mV. The rate of inactivation was assessed by considering both the percentage of current that had inactivated over a time course of 125 ms and by mono-exponential fits to the time course of inactivation. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Steady state inactivation curves and macroscopic current voltage relations were analyzed using the Boltzmann equation (see Ref. 34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All error bars are standard errors, numbers in parentheses displayed in the figures reflect numbers of experiments, and p values were determined by Student'st tests. We previously reported that wild type α1C and α1E channels exhibited pronounced differences in their inactivation profiles (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since completion of our original study, we switched our internal recording solution (105 mm CsCl, 25 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 11 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) to a solution composed of 108 mm CsMS, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), which we found to yield more stable recordings. Hence, it was necessary to reassess the inactivation properties of the two wild type channels under our present experimental conditions. Fig. 1 compares the inactivation profiles of wild type α1C and α1E channels, coexpressed with α2-δ and β1b subunits. As shown in the figure, the two wild type channels exhibit diametrically different inactivation properties such that the half-inactivation potential of α1E is 60 mV more negative than that of α1C. Furthermore, the rate of inactivation, expressed either as the time constant for current decay, τ, or the percentage of current that has inactivated over a time course of 125 ms, is 2–4-fold greater for α1E than α1C, depending on the test potential. These differences in the inactivation profiles of the two channels are qualitatively consistent with our previous recordings (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, a closer comparison with our previous work reveals three quantitative differences. First, the current densities obtained in the CsMS internal solution were on average twice as large as those observed in CsCl (not shown). Second, the half-inactivation potentials of α1Eand α1C were shifted, respectively, by 10 to 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, whereas the half-activation potential was not significantly affected (p > 0.05). Finally, the inactivation rates in internal CsMS were considerably accelerated. Neither the substitution of negative counter ion nor the presence or absence of internal magnesium was found to account for the effects (not shown). However, internal TEA ions significantly affected the inactivation properties of the channel such that the presence of 25 mm internal TEA resulted in a significant slowing of the inactivation rate (Fig. 1, C and D) and an ∼10-mV rightward shift in the midpoint of the steady state inactivation. Thus, TEA ions, commonly thought to be inert for voltage-dependent calcium channels, exert a pronounced effect on calcium channel gating. Our previous work showed that multiple transmembrane domains were involved in the inactivation process of α1E channels, with domain II and III contributing to the greatest extent (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We theorized that calcium channel inactivation may occur via a mechanism reminiscent of that underlying C-type inactivation common to many types of voltage-dependent potassium channels, a process that is believed to involve pore constriction mediated by the S6 segments of the channel (35Choi K.L. Aldrich R.W. Yellen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5092-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 36Kukuljan M. Lebarca P. Latorre R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C425-C436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess a putative role of the S6 segments in fast calcium channel inactivation, we created chimeras in which the S6 regions of domains II/III of α1C were replaced by the corresponding regions of α1E. As seen in Fig. 2 A, replacement of the II S6 or III S6 segments of α1C with that of α1E dramatically increased the inactivation rate of α1C to levels observed with wild type α1E channels. These data suggest that the individual S6 segments in domains II and III are important determinants of calcium channel inactivation. To test whether the effects of domains II and III were additive, we also examined a double chimera α1C(II/IIIS6E) in which the S6 segments of domains II and III of α1E were inserted into α1C concomitantly (Fig. 2). The double replacement did not result in further speeding of the inactivation kinetics, nor could it enhance the slower, α1C-like rates that persisted at relatively hyperpolarized test potentials in the two single S6 chimeras. Thus, although the presence of a single “inactivating” S6 segment is sufficient to confer many aspects of the more rapid inactivation of the wild type α1E channels, even their combination cannot account for all of the voltage dependence associated with the inactivation rates. If the presence of a single S6 segment in domain II or III of α1E is sufficient to confer rapid inactivation kinetics onto α1C, one might expect that replacement of only one of those two S6 segments in α1Eshould be ineffective in removing inactivation. To test this hypothesis, we examined two additional chimeras, α1E(IIS6C) and α1E (IIIS6C). As seen in Fig.3, A and B, the two chimeras exhibited inactivation rates that did not differ significantly from those of the wild type α1E channel, except at relatively hyperpolarized test potentials. However, even simultaneous substitution of the II S6 and III S6 regions of α1E with those of α1C (i.e. α1E(II/IIIS6C)) did not significantly slow inactivation (Fig.3 C), suggesting the presence of an additional region in the α1E sequence that is independently capable of maintaining inactivation. To identify the putative region sustaining rapid inactivation of α1E, we first inserted the α1C domain I into EEEE(II/IIIS6C), creating the CEEE(II/IIIS6C) chimera, and still, α1E-like inactivation persisted (Fig. 3 D). However, upon substitution of most of the α1C domain I-II linker region into this construct, inactivation was virtually abolished (Fig. 3 E), suggesting that it was the domain I-II linker region of α1E that maintained α1E-like inactivation rates in the α1E (II/IIIS6) construct. To unequivocally show the importance of the domain I-II linker region, we created two additional chimeras (EcEEE and EcEEE (II/IIIS6C)); however, neither construct expressed functionally in tsa-201 cells. Nonetheless, if our hypothesis is correct, then an α1C channel containing the domain I-II linker of α1E should exhibit rapid inactivation kinetics. Data obtained with such a chimera (CeCCC) are shown in Fig. 3 F. As evident from the figure, the CeCCC construct exhibited inactivation kinetics that were significantly faster than those seen with the wild type α1C channels, consistent with our hypothesis. We also examined an additional construct that contained the domain I-II linker plus the first five transmembrane segments of domain II of α1E (thus retaining the “non-inactivating” domain II S6 and III S6 regions of α1C), and similar to that of the CeCCC chimera, the CECC(IIS6C) construct exhibited inactivation kinetics that were significantly more rapid than those of the wild type α1Cchannel (n = 12, not shown). Taken together, this supports the idea that the presence of either one of three regions in α1E, the domain I-II linker or II S6 or III S6 regions, is sufficient to preserve rapid inactivation, whereas the concomitant replacement of these three regions with the corresponding elements of α1C is required to confer slow inactivation kinetics. We have previously shown that domains II and III could account for the majority of differences in half-inactivation potential between the two wild type channels, whereas domains I and IV contributed to a lesser extent (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test whether the effects of domains II and III could be attributed to the S6 regions, we compared the half-inactivation potentials of the wild type and chimeric calcium channels (Fig. 4). Replacement of the II S6 region of α1E did not affect the half-inactivation potential, and the reverse substitution in α1C resulted in only a small ∼10-mV hyperpolarizing shift in steady state inactivation kinetics, which was paralleled by a comparable change in half-activation potential (Fig. 4). Thus, it seems unlikely that the domain II S6 region contributes in a meaningful manner to the determination of steady state inactivation kinetics despite its pronounced effects on inactivation rate. Replacement of the domain III S6 region resulted in more substantial (∼15 mV) hyperpolarizing shifts in half-inactivation potential that were not mirrored by activation potential shifts. In view of the 60-mV spread between the wild type channels, the contributions from the S6 regions were relatively minor, suggesting that other regions in domains II and III may determine the voltage dependence of inactivation. Indeed, both the CeCCC and CECC (IIS6C) constructs inactivated 20 mV more negatively than the wild type α1C channel (Fig. 4) despite sharing a common half-activation potential with α1C, thereby implicating the domain I-II linker. Thus, although insertion of a single inactivating structure of α1E is sufficient to confer the rapid inactivation profile in an essentially all or none fashion, multiple substitutions, including some that do not affect inactivation rates (i.e.domain I in Fig. 4D of Ref. 34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), are required to account for the differences in voltage dependence of inactivation of the wild type channels. We previously presented evidence that the calcium channel domains II and III are critical determinants of both the voltage dependence and the rate of inactivation (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each of those two domains contributed to about half of the observed differences in half-inactivation potential between α1C and α1E, and insertion of either domains II or III of α1E into the α1Csequence conferred all of the rapid inactivation kinetics of α1E (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we have more narrowly identified the regions involved in determining the inactivation rate. As seen from Table I, with one exception (ECEE), any construct containing the α1E sequence in the domain IIS6, III S6, or I-II linker regions exhibited α1E-like inactivation kinetics. In contrast, only constructs carrying α1C sequence in each of those regions inactivated slowly, consistent with the idea that the above regions are the central structural elements involved in the control of inactivation rates.Table IDependence of the inactivation rate on the presence of the domain I-II linker, and domain II S6 and III S6 regionsConstructII S6III S6I-IIE (IIS6 or IIIS6 or I-II)RateCCCCCCCSlowEEEEEEE√FastCEECEEE√FastCCECCEC√FastEECCECE√FastCECCECE√FastCEEEEEE√FastCCEECEC√FastECCCCCCSlowCCCECCCSlowECEE*CEC√Slow*CCCC (II S6E)ECC√FastCCCC (III S6E)CEC√FastCCCC (II/III S6E)EEC√FastEEEE (II S6C)CEE√FastEEEE (III S6C)ECC√FastEEEE (II/III S6C)CCE√FastCEEE (II/III S6C)CCE√FastCcEEE (II/III S6C)CCCSlowCeCCCCCE√FastCECC (II S6C)CCE√FastThe data for the inter-domain chimeras (third through tenth lines) were taken from Spaetgens and Zamponi (34Spaetgens R.L.

The involvement of the I-II linker would be consistent with the observation that two separate point mutations in this region can slow the inactivation of α1A calcium channels (7Bourinet E. Soong T.W.

In addition, overexpression of the I-II linker regions of α1A was found to speed inactivation of the α1A channel (31Cens T. Restituito S. Galas S. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5483-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also consistent with our data, amino acid substitutions in the domain III S6 region have been reported to affect inactivation kinetics (32Hering S. Aczel S. Grabner M. Doring F. Berjukow S.

Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) implicate exclusively the domain I S6 region in the fast inactivation process by utilizing a series of chimeras between rabbit α1A and marine ray α1E calcium channels, which contrasts with our observations that rapid inactivation kinetics do not require the presence of α1E domain I nor is replacement of this region with α1C sequence sufficient to abolish inactivation. Both α1E and α1Ashare identical domain II and III S6 regions and differ in their domain I S6 regions in only one position (methionine in α1A versus valine in α1E (38Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 113-141Google Scholar)). Interestingly, the α1C sequence also contains a valine residue in this position, thus perhaps masking any subtle effects of domain I in our experiments. Alternatively, it is possible that an amino acid substitution in the domain I S6 regions secondarily affects inactivation by altering the conformation of the associated I-II linker region. We previously presented evidence that domains II and III accounted for much of the difference in half inactivation potentials seen with the wild type channels (34Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Within domain III, we can attribute a significant effect to the S6 segment, indicating that the III S6 region is involved in controlling both the rate and some of the voltage dependence of inactivation. A similar argument can be made for the domain I-II linker region. In contrast, the II S6 region had little effect on the voltage dependence of inactivation despite being an important feature for determining the inactivation rate. Conversely, domain I does not affect inactivation rate but does contribute to voltage dependence (compare α1E (II/IIS6C) and CEEE (II/IIIS6C)). Thus, despite some overlap, the structural determinants governing the rates and voltage dependence of inactivation appear to be distinct. Whereas the critical determinants of inactivation rate are fairly localized, the mechanism controlling the voltage dependence of inactivation appears to be more globally distributed across the calcium channel α1 subunit. Our original intent was to gather additional evidence in support of our hypothesis that fast calcium channel inactivation might occur via a mechanism reminiscent of the C-type inactivation process, which is thought to involve a pore collapse mediated by the four S6 segments (i.e. Refs. 35Choi K.L. Aldrich R.W. Yellen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5092-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar and 36Kukuljan M. Lebarca P. Latorre R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C425-C436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data implicating the domain II and III S6 regions fit with such a model. However, the critical involvement of the cytoplasmic domain I-II linker region argues against simple pore collapse. As a result, our data are best described by a model in which the I-II linker region forms a cytoplasmic gating particle (39Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 447-590Crossref Scopus (764) Google Scholar) similar to that proposed for the domain III-IV linker of voltage-dependent sodium channels (23Vassilev P. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8147Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Eaholtz G. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (see Fig.5). If so, then the S6 regions might perhaps serve as the docking site for the inactivation gate. The current belief that that S6 segments line the inner vestibule of the pore would be consistent with such a mechanism (40Doyle D.A. Morais-Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5746) Google Scholar, 41MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T.

Nature. 1994; 367: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but it may well be possible that other regions of the channel could be part of the docking interaction. A putative role of the domain I-II linker as the inactivation gate would fit the previously reported effects of point mutations in the α1A calcium channel I-II linker (7Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 30Herlitze S. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T.

A. 1997; 94: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the ability of overexpressed α1A I-II linker to accelerate the inactivation rate of α1A calcium channels. This model could also account for the effects of the calcium channel β subunits, which are known to physically bind to the I-II linker region, on inactivation rate (10Stea A. Tomlinson W.J.

(Lond.). 1996; 497: 675-686Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The antagonistic effects of the β2a subunit on inactivation (44Olcese R. Neely A. Qin N. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 675-686Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) could perhaps arise from a restricted mobility of the domain I-II linker region as a consequence of anchoring the palmitoylated N terminus of this subunit to the plasma membrane (45Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Costantin J.L. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 14: 4690-4695Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A hinged-lid model could also accommodate our observations that intracellular TEA slows inactivation rates. If a TEA molecule acting as a low affinity blocker were to compete with the I-II linker for its docking site, one would expect to observe a slowing of the macroscopic time course of inactivation. Such a mechanism would not be without precedent, as TEA prevents inactivation gate closure of shaker B potassium channels (35Choi K.L. Aldrich R.W. Yellen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5092-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and open channel block of batrachotoxin-activated cardiac sodium channels by local anesthetics and related compounds prevents fast inactivation (46Zamponi G.W. Sui X. Codding P.W. French R.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2324-2334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 47Zamponi G.W. French R.J. Biophys J. 1993; 65: 2335-2347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). How can a hinged-lid mechanism account for the observation that the presence of either the domain IIS6, III S6, or the domain I-II linker region of α1E was generally sufficient to mediate rapid inactivation? Within the framework of our model, the domain I-II linker of α1C would have the ability to dock to either the domain II S6 or III S6 regions of α1E. Conversely, the domain I-II linker of α1E would have to be capable of interacting with either one of the domain II S6 or III S6 regions of α1C. In contrast, the relative lack of inactivation of L-type channels would require an inability of the α1CI-II linker region to dock effectively to the domain II S6 and III S6 regions when of α1C origin. Biochemical evidence, however, will ultimately be required to prove a putative existence of a physical binding interaction between the domain I-II linker and the S6 segments. In summary, a hinged-lid model of inactivation can nicely account for our data as well as the key observations reported in the literature. The redundancy of the structural elements that are sufficient to maintain rapid inactivation underlines the fundamental importance of this process for the precise control of calcium entry and, thus, prevention of accumulation of toxic levels of intracellular calcium (18Choi D.W.

Glutamine is also an obligatory participant in the intercellular glutamine cycle that occurs in the liver between periportal hepatocytes and perivenous hepatocytes (6Haussinger D. Stoll B. Stehle T. Gerok W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cellular uptake of glutamine is known to be mediated by at least three different Na+-dependent amino acid transport systems, namely system A, system B0, and system N (7Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 8Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The first two transport systems have a broad substrate specificity accepting several neutral amino acids, including glutamine as substrates. In contrast, system N exhibits a much narrower substrate specificity (10Kilberg M.S. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It transports only glutamine and asparagine, and in some instances, histidine. The tissue distribution pattern is significantly different for these three transport systems. System A is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues, whereas system B0 has been described primarily in the intestine and kidney and system N in the liver, skeletal muscle, and brain (7Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 8Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev.

Functional studies have indicated that system N expressed in the liver, skeletal muscle, and brain may not be identical (10Kilberg M.S. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ahmed A. Maxwell D.L. Taylor P.M. Rennie M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E993-E1000PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tamarappoo B.K. Raizada M.K. Kilberg M.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The differences in the characteristics of system N in these three tissues have led to the following subtype classification of this transport system: system N in the liver, system Nm in the skeletal muscle, and system Nb in neurons. All three subtypes transport glutamine and asparagine in a Na+-dependent manner. Differences lie primarily in Li+ tolerance and pH sensitivity. The liver system N functions well even when Na+ is replaced by Li+. Thus, this subtype is Li+-tolerant. In addition, it is highly pH-sensitive and its transport activity is almost undetectable at pH 7 or below (10Kilberg M.S. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, the subtypes Nm and Nb are comparatively Li+-intolerant and pH-insensitive (11Ahmed A. Maxwell D.L. Taylor P.M. Rennie M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E993-E1000PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tamarappoo B.K. Raizada M.K. Kilberg M.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The subtype Nb can, however, be differentiated from the other two subtypes by its ability to interact with glutamate (10Kilberg M.S. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tamarappoo B.K. Raizada M.K. Kilberg M.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent cloning studies have begun to unravel the molecular nature of these transport systems. We have cloned system B0(ATB0 or ASCT2) and characterized its ability to transport glutamine and other neutral amino acids in a Na+-coupled manner (13Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.J. Torres-Zamorano V.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). More recently, Varoqui et al.(17Varaqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) reported on the cloning of a Na+-coupled transporter for glutamine and the system A-specific substrate α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid. Surprisingly, this transporter, designated GlnT,1 is expressed in neurons but not in any other tissue. This suggests that system A may also consist of distinct subtypes. GlnT represents one of the system A subtypes. We have recently cloned and characterized the ubiquitously expressed system A subtype, designated ATA2 for amino acid transporter A2, the brain-specific system A subtype (GlnT) being ATA1 (18Sugawara M. Nakanishi T. Fei Y.J. Huang W. Ganapathy M.E. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16473-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The cloning of another Na+-coupled glutamine transporter from rat brain has been reported recently (19Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This transporter is Li+-tolerant and is expressed primarily in the brain and liver. Based on functional characteristics and tissue distribution pattern, this transporter has been identified as system N and designated SN1 (19Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of rat SN1 has led to the discovery of a unique feature of this transporter. SN1 mediates the influx of Na+ and glutamine into the cells in exchange with intracellular H+. This is indicated by the glutamine-dependent intracellular alkalinization in SN1-expressing cells. Thus, SN1 is a Na+- and H+-coupled glutamine transporter. These findings agree with the pH sensitivity of system N observed in hepatocytes (10Kilberg M.S. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is no information available for system N in the liver on the role of membrane potential in the transport process. However, functional studies with cloned rat SN1 have led to the conclusion that the transport process is electroneutral, suggesting a Na+:glutamine:H+ stoichiometry of 1:1:1. On the basis of primary structure, SN1, ATA1, and ATA2 are related to each other. Interestingly, these three plasma membrane transport proteins bear significant homology to the vesicular γ-aminobutyrate transporter, which is present in synaptic vesicles in the brain (20McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This synaptic vesicle transporter mediates the entry of γ-aminobutyrate into the vesicles in exchange for intravesicular H+ (20McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M.

ATA1 and ATA2 are also highly pH-sensitive, but whether or not H+ is a transportable substrate for these two transporters is not known. In this report we describe the cloning of the human SN1 from the HepG2 liver cell line and the structural organization of the sn1gene. We also demonstrate here the transport function of human SN1 using two different heterologous expression systems with mammalian cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Human SN1 transports glutamine in a Na+-dependent manner. It is also H+-coupled and Li+-tolerant. Most importantly, the present studies show that the transport process mediated by human SN1 is electrogenic with a Na+:glutamine stoichiometry of 2:1, contrary to the conclusions drawn by Chaudhry et al.(19Chaudhry F.A.

To determine whether this difference is due to species-dependent variation in the transport mechanism, we cloned rat SN1 from skeletal muscle and studied its transport function. Our results show that rat SN1 is also electrogenic similar to human SN1. These data suggest that the transport mechanism of SN1 involves the influx of two Na+ ions and one glutamine molecule coupled to the efflux of one H+. [3H]Glutamine (specific radioactivity, 49.9 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Asparagine (specific radioactivity, 650 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Moravek (Brea, CA). Human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells were originally provided by Dr. M. A. Del Monte (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and have been in use in our laboratory for several years for heterologous expression of a variety of cloned transporters (22Wu X. Kekuda R. Huang W.

The human liver cell line HepG2 was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell culture media, TRIzol reagent, oligo(dT)-cellulose, and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Restriction enzymes were either from Promega or from New England BioLabs. Magna nylon transfer membranes used in the library screening were from Micron Separations, Inc. (Westboro, MA). The Ready-to-Go oligolabeling kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The recently cloned rat SN1 is highly homologous to the human cDNA designated g17 in the GenBank data base (accession number U49082). This indicated that g17 most likely represents the human homolog of rat SN1. Therefore, to clone the full-length g17 cDNA for functional studies, we prepared a cDNA fragment by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers based on the nucleotide sequence of g17. The sense primer was 5′-AACATCGGAGCCATGTCCAG-3′, which corresponded to nucleotide positions 581–600 in g17 cDNA sequence, and the antisense primer was 5′-AAGGTGAGGTAGCCGAAGAG-3′, which corresponded to nucleotide positions 1136–1155 in g17 cDNA sequence. Because the Northern blot analysis has shown that rat SN1 mRNA is expressed most abundantly in the liver (19Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we used poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from HepG2 cells, a human liver cell line, as a template for RT-PCR. A single product of expected size (−0.6 kilobase pair (kbp)) was obtained in the RT-PCR reaction. This product was subcloned into pGEM-T vector and sequenced to establish its molecular identity. This cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen cDNA libraries. The SuperScript plasmid system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to establish unidirectional cDNA libraries with poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from HepG2 cells and rat skeletal muscle. Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared by subjecting total RNA twice to oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography prior to use in library construction. The cDNA products with sizes greater than 1 kbp were separated by size-fractionation and used for ligation at aSalI/NotI site in pSPORT1 vector. The −0.6-kbp cDNA fragment of g17 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Ready-to-Go oligolabeling kit. The HepG2 and rat skeletal muscle cDNA libraries were screened with this probe under low stringency conditions. Hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 0.15m NaC1, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 1 mm EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Posthybridization washing was done as described earlier (22Wu X. Kekuda R. Huang W. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

Positive clones were identified, and the colonies were purified by secondary screening. Both sense and antisense strands of the cDNAs were sequenced by primer walking. Sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method was performed by Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing with an automated PE Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer. The sequence was analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis software package GCG, version 7.B (Genetics Computer Group, Inc. Madison, WI). This was done using the vaccinia virus expression system as described before (22Wu X. Kekuda R. Huang W. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

Subconfluent HRPE cells grown on 24-well plates were first infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (VTF7–3) encoding T7 RNA polymerase and then transfected with the plasmid carrying the full-length cDNA. After 10–12 h post-transfection, uptake measurements were made at 37 °C with 50 μm[3H]glutamine. In most experiments, the uptake medium was 25 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 8.5, containing 140 mmLiC1, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 10 mm cysteine, and 5 mm glucose. The time of incubation was 15 min. Endogenous transport was always determined in parallel using cells transfected with empty vector. This transport accounted for 15–25% of the transport measured in cells that were transfected with the vector carrying the cDNA insert. Therefore, the transport values measured in cells transfected with empty vector were always subtracted from the corresponding transport values measured in cells transfected with vector-cDNA to obtain the cDNA-specific uptake. The cDNA-induced [3H]glutamine transport activity was maximal at pH 8.5 in a LiCl-containing uptake medium (instead of NaCl) and in the presence of 10 mm cysteine. The influence of pH on the transport function was studied by measuring the uptake of 50 μm [3H]glutamine in cDNA-transfected cells and in vector-transfected cells at varying pH. Uptake buffers of varying pH (6.0–8.5) were prepared by appropriately mixing two buffers: 25 mm Mes/Tris buffer (pH 6.0), containing 140 mm LiCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm Mg SO4, 10 mm cysteine, and 5 mm glucose; and 25 mm Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 8.5), containing 140 mm LiCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 10 mm cysteine, and 5 mm glucose. Saturation kinetics for glutamine were analyzed by measuring cDNA-specific transport at varying concentrations of glutamine (0.1–15 mm). The kinetic parameters, Michaelis-Menten constant (K t) and maximal velocity (V max), were calculated by fitting the data to a Michaelis-Menten equation describing a single saturable transport system. Analysis was done by nonlinear regression, and the resultant values for the kinetic parameters were confirmed by linear regression. Li+ activation kinetics were analyzed by measuring cDNA-specific transport of glutamine at varying concentrations of Li+ (10–80 mm). The osmolality of the buffer and the concentration of Cl− were kept constant by substituting LiCl with N-methyl-d-glutamine (NMDG) chloride. The data were fit to the Hill equation, and the Hill coefficient was calculated by nonlinear regression as well as by linear regression. cRNA from the cloned cDNA was synthesized using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was linearized using NotI, and the cDNA insert was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of an RNA cap analog. The resultant cRNA was purified by multiple extractions with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Mature oocytes from X. laevis were isolated by treatment with collagenase A (1.6 mg/ml), manually defolliculated, and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's medium supplemented with 10 mg/l gentamycin (25Parent L.S. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the following day, oocytes were injected with 50 ng of cRNA. Oocytes injected with water served as control. The oocytes were used for electrophysiological studies 6 days after cRNA injection. Electrophysiological studies were done by the conventional two-microelecrode voltage clamp method (26Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oocytes were superfused with a NaCl-containing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm Hepes, 3 mm Mes, and 3 mm Tris, pH 8.0) followed by the same buffer containing different amino acid substrates. The membrane potential was held steady at −50 mV. For studies involving the current-voltage (I-V) relationship, step changes in membrane potential were applied, each for a duration of 100 ms in 20-millivolt (mV) increments. Kinetic parameters for the saturable transport of glutamine and asparagine were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and confirmed by linear regression. When the effects of Na+ on the transport (i.e.amino acid-induced currents) were evaluated, the oocyte was perifused with buffer containing different concentrations of Na+ and 10 mm glutamine or asparagine. The data for the Na+-dependent activation of amino acid-induced currents were fitted to the Hill equation, and the Hill coefficient was calculated by nonlinear regression as well as by linear regression. In some experiments, the perifusion buffer contained LiCl instead of NaCl to determine if Na+ was replaceable with Li+ to support the amino acid-induced currents. When the influence of Cl− on the amino acid-induced currents was assessed, a Cl−-free buffer was used that contained gluconate salts instead of chloride salts. In experiments dealing with the influence of pH on the amino acid-induced currents, NaCl- or LiCl-containing buffers of varying pH were prepared by appropriately adjusting the concentrations of Mes, Hepes, and Tris. Uptake of [3H]asparagine in control oocytes and in human SN1-expressing oocytes was measured at pH 8.0 in the presence of NaCl as described previously (29Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8744-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The concentration of [3H]asparagine (unlabeled plus radiolabeled) was 250 μm. To assess the role of membrane potential in the uptake of asparagine, uptake measurements were made in the presence of 50 mm Na+, but with low (2 mm) or high (52 mm) K+. The oocyte membrane was depolarized with the high concentration of K+. This method has been used previously in our laboratory to study the role of membrane potential in the transport function of the organic cation transporter OCT3 (30Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Wu X. Wang H.

Devoe L.D. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To assess whether there is a direct relationship between the amino acid influx and the inward currents observed in oocytes expressing human SN1, we measured simultaneously in the same oocyte the influx of asparagine and the membrane currents associated with the asparagine influx. Oocytes, clamped at −50 mV, were perifused with a NaCl-containing buffer, and current traces were monitored in a chart recorder until they reached a steady baseline. The oocyte was then perifused with 2.5 mm asparagine (unlabeled plus radiolabeled) in the same buffer for 8–10 min while the asparagine-induced currents were recorded. At the end of this period, the oocyte was perifused with the buffer in the absence of asparagine until the currents returned to the baseline levels. The oocyte was removed, rinsed three times with ice-cold buffer, and lysed in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amount of radioactivity in the oocyte lysate was then quantitated for the calculation of asparagine influx. The total inward charge transfer was calculated by integrating the area under the current versus time curve and by using the Faraday constant. The magnitude of the amino acid influx was then compared with the magnitude of the charge transfer to determine the ratio of the amino acid influx to the charge influx. This experiment utilized the Fetchex program within the pCLAMP 6.0 software package. We have used this method previously in our laboratory to determine the substrate/charge transfer ratio for the H+-coupled peptide transporter PEPT2 (32Fei Y.J. Nara E. Liu J.C. Boyd C.A.R.

A full-length human SN1 cDNA was isolated by screening a HepG2 cDNA Library with a cDNA fragment of g17 clone as a probe. The cDNA (GenBank accession no. AF244548) is 2437 bp long with an open reading frame consisting of 1515 bp (including the termination codon). The open reading frame is flanked by a 113-bp-long 5′-untranslated region and a 809-bp-long 3′-untranslated region. The cDNA codes for a protein of 504 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 56 kDa. Hydropathy analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests the presence of 12 putative transmembrane domains in the protein. There is a single putative site for N-linked glycosylation in the extracellular loop between the transmembrane domains 7 and 8 (Asn-323). The protein also contains a single protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation site in the cytoplasmic tail (Thr-497). At the level of amino sequence, the human SN1 exhibits 90% identity and 91% similarity with the recently cloned rat SN1 (19Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J.

Interestingly, ATA1 and ATA2 represent the two currently known subtypes of amino acid transport system A. It appears that the amino acid transporters belonging to system N and system A form a distinct family. In the recent report of the cloning of rat SN1, the investigators used PS120 cells for functional expression of the cloned transporter (19Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D.

https://openalex.org/W2020344403,"We previously identified a constitutively active form of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) 5A by polymerase chain reaction-driven random mutagenesis followed by retrovirus-mediated expression screening, which had two point mutations in the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains, and was designated STAT5A1*6. STAT5A1*6 showed markedly elevated DNA binding and transactivation activities with stable tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation, and conferred autonomous cell growth on interleukin 3-dependent Ba/F3 cells. We now report another constitutively active mutant, STAT5A-N642H which has a single point mutation (N642H) in its SH2 domain, identified using the same strategy as that used to identify STAT5A1*6. STAT5A-N642H showed identical properties to those of STAT5A1*6 both biochemically and biologically. Interestingly the mutation in STAT5A-N642H resulted in restoration of the conserved critical histidine which is involved in the binding of phosphotyrosine in the majority of SH2-containing proteins. Introduction of an additional mutation (Y694F) to STAT5A-N642H, which disrupted critical tyrosine 694 required for dimerization of STAT5, abolished all the activities manifested by the mutant STAT5A-N642H, which indicates that dimerization is required for the activity of STAT5A-N642H as was the case for the wild-type STAT5A. The present findings also show that different mutations rendered STAT5A constitutively active, through a common mechanism, which is similar to that of physiological activation.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). The STAT family consists of seven known members, including closely related STAT5A and STAT5B. Once ligands bind to their cognate receptors, Janus kinases (JAKs) and STATs are phosphorylated successively. The phosphorylated STAT protein forms homo- or heterodimer through intermolecular interaction between the SH2 domain and the phosphotyrosine of the STAT. The dimerized STAT then translocates into the nuclei and binds to promoter regions of target genes to activate transcription. Since phosphorylated STAT is rapidly dephosphorylated, transactivation of gene expression by STAT is generally transient (4Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was reported that human leukemias were frequently associated with the constitutive activation of STATs (5Gouilleux-Gruart V. Gouilleux F. Desaint C. Claisse J.F. Capiod J.C.

Although gene targeting is a powerful strategy in analyzing biological roles of the gene product, redundancy of functional genes occasionally masks the phenotype of the null mutation of the gene. In the case of STAT5A and STAT5B- doubly disrupted mice, fetal anemia and apoptosis of erythroid progenitors occurred. However, no gross abnormalities were found in hematopoietic systems of adult mice (9Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L.

Our group identified a constitutively active STAT5A mutant (STAT5A1*6) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-driven random mutagenesis followed by retrovirus-mediated expression screening (13Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). STAT5A1*6 harbors two point mutations, one in the transactivation domain (S710F) and the other in the DNA-binding domain (H298R). The interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 can proliferate autonomously in the absence of IL-3 after transduction with STAT5A1*6. We recently found that STAT5A1*6 also provoked differentiation and apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells upon IL-3 stimulation with prolonged expression of growth-suppressive genes induced by STAT5 (14Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We have now identified and characterized another constitutively active mutant, STAT5A-N642H, which harbors a point mutation on or very close to the phosphotyrosine-binding site in the SH2 domain and has the identical phenotype to that of STAT5A1*6. In addition, substitution of Tyr694, the phosphorylation of which is required for dimerization and activation of STAT5, abolished the constitutive activity of STAT5A-N642H. These findings indicate that activation of these mutant STAT5s mimicked the physiological activation of STAT5, an event not caused by gain-of-function mutations. Mutations were introduced into the mouse STAT5A sequence by PCR-driven random mutagenesis (13Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell.

The pMX-STAT5A DNA was used as a template, and a 5′ vector primer, pMX5′ (5′-CCCGGGGGTGGACCATCCTCT-3′), and a 3′ vector primer, pMX3′ (5′-CCCTTTTTCTGGAGACT-3′), were used to amplify the full-length sequence of STAT5A. PCR was run for 35 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 58 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C) with recombinantTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), under standard conditions, except that the deoxynucleotide triphosphate concentration was 400 μm. The average frequency of point mutations ranged from 1/600 to 1/1200 under these conditions (data not shown). The constitutively active STAT5As were identified by the ability to induce IL-3-independent growth of IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells in retrovirus-mediated expression screening, as described (13Onishi M.

One such mutant harboring a point mutation (N642H) in the SH2 domain was designated STAT5A-N642H. We introduced an additional mutation to STAT5A-N642H by site-directed mutagenesis with a high fidelity DNA polymerase Pyrobest (Takara), to acquire amino acid substitution from Tyr694 to Phe (STAT5A-N642H/Y694F) (17Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). STAT5B-N642H was constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. DNA sequences of all the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Ba/F3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 ng/ml murine IL-3 (mIL-3) (provided by DNAX Research Institute). A granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent human leukemic cell line, TF-1 (18Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 5 ng/ml human GM-CSF (R & D Systems). An ecotropic retrovirus packaging cell line, BOSC23 (19Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and guanine phosphoribosyltransferase for selection, and transferred into the medium without guanine phosphoribosyltransferase selection reagents 2 days before transfection. A murine fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3, and a monkey kidney epithelial cell line, COS-7 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS. The C terminus of each STAT5A-N642H and STAT5A-N642H/Y694F was fused in-frame with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (CLONTECH) or Flag as an epitope tag (13Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These fusion constructs were digested with both EcoRI andNotI, and were ligated to EcoRI andNotI sites of pMX and pMX-neo (pMX with a simian virus 40 early promoter-driven neomycin resistance gene between the multicloning sites and the 3′ long terminal repeat) retrovirus vectors (15Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). High titer retroviruses harboring STAT5A mutants were produced with BOSC23, and Ba/F3, TF-1, and NIH3T3 cells were infected with these retroviruses, as described (20Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A mouse ecotropic viral receptor (21Baker B.W. Boettger D. Spooncer E. Norton J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was exogenously expressed on TF-1 cells prior to infection. To isolate IL-3-independent Ba/F3 cells expressing high levels of STAT5A-N642H, cells were transferred to the medium without IL-3 24 h after infection because IL-3 induces apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells expressing STAT5A-N642H as in the case of STAT5A1*6 (14Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To isolate GM-CSF-independent TF-1 cells expressing high levels of STAT5A-N642H, cells were transferred to the medium without GM-CSF 24 h after infection. Ba/F3 and TF-1 cells expressing STAT5A wild type or STAT5A-N642H/Y694F were selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) after the infection. NIH3T3 cells were used to express EGFP fusion constructs, and the intracellular localization was examined 48 h after infection. The expression vector for human MPL (16Onishi M. Mui A.L. Morikawa Y. Cho L. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Gorman D.M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Blood. 1996; 88: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed using an SRα promoter (22Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was designated pME-MPL. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pME-MPL and each expression vector for the STAT5A mutants by using the LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ba/F3 cells expressing the wild type STAT5A or the mutant STAT5A (STAT5A-N642H and STAT5A-N642H/Y694F) with a Flag peptide epitope were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.2 mmNa3VO4, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with an anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Chemical Co.) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were then washed twice with the lysis buffer, and eluted with sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After boiling for 3 min, the immunoprecipitates of each sample were separated on a 5–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) by electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then the membrane was incubated in the stripping buffer (100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed with an anti-STAT5A antibody (R & D systems). The immunoprecipitates of COS-7 cells 48 h after transfection were prepared and analyzed in the same way as described above except that the membrane was probed with an anti-phosphorylated tyrosine residue 694 of STAT5A monoclonal antibody, anti-phospho-STAT5A/B(Y694/Y699) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Cells were lysed in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml of aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min on ice, followed by 15 min of incubation with the Klenow-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides harboring the STAT5A optimal binding sequence, 5′-GATCCGAATTCCAGGAATTCA-3′ and 3′-GCTTAAGGTCCTTAAGTCTAG-5′. For supershift experiments, the cell extracts were preincubated with the anti-Flag M2 antibody or a mouse IgG as a control for 30 min on ice. The prepared samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 2.2 × TBE (110 mm Tris borate, 2.2 mm EDTA) and autoradiographed. Ba/F3 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 300 V with 10 μg of a reporter plasmid consisting of a luciferase gene under the control of the β-casein promoter harboring STAT5-binding sites, 3 μg of Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat-driven β-galactosidase plasmid to monitor transfection efficiency, and 10 μg of each effector plasmid (STAT5A wild type, STAT5A-N642H, STAT5A1*6, or STAT5A-N642H/Y694F) at room temperature in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. After leaving the cells for 12 h in the presence of 10% FCS and IL-3, the cells were divided into two groups, one group was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in the absence of IL-3 for 12 h, and the other was stimulated with 4 ng/ml IL-3 without FCS for the last 6 h after 6 h starvation. Cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Transfection efficiency was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was done three times. Total RNA was isolated from Ba/F3 cells before and after IL-3 stimulation using RNeasy kits (Qiagen). Thirty μg of total RNA was denatured in 50% formamide at 60 °C for 15 min, separated on 1% agarose with 6% formaldehyde gel by electrophoresis, and blotted onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was probed with the randomly primed (Stratagene)32P-labeled cDNA fragment at 42 °C in solution containing 50% formamide, 3 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization, the membrane was washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and autoradiographed. The fragments of mouseoncostatin M (OSM), pim-1,c-myc, bcl-x, JAB/SSI-1/SOCS-1, CIS, and humanglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as probes (14Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde. TUNEL assays (Takara) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). We identified several STAT5A mutants that induced IL-3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells, using the method described under “Experimental Procedures” (13Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Among them, STAT5A-N642H has a single point mutation in the SH2 domain, which results in amino acid substitution from Asn642 to His (Fig. 1). To confirm that this mutation alone was sufficient to cause constitutive activation of STAT5A, we introduced this point mutation into STAT5A and cloned in the pMX vector (15Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). High titer retroviruses harboring STAT5A-N642H were produced with a transient retrovirus packaging cell line, BOSC23 (19Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar), and Ba/F3 cells were infected with these retroviruses (20Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The infection efficiencies of Ba/F3 cells in the experiments were 20–30%, as assessed by simultaneous experiments using a control vector pMX-EGFP. Twenty-four hours after the infection, the cells were deprived of IL-3 to determine the potential to induce factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. The cells transduced with pMX STAT5A-N642H survived and proliferated well in the absence of IL-3, while those transduced with pMX STAT5A WT (wild-type) or pMX STAT5A-N642H/Y694F did not (Fig.2 A). In addition, STAT5A-N642H induced factor-independent growth of a GM-CSF-dependent human leukemic cell line TF-1 after retroviral infection (Fig.2 B). Thus a single point mutation in the SH2 domain was sufficient to render Ba/F3 and TF-1 cells factor-independent. The difference in the growth rate between IL-3-driven and STAT5A-N642H-driven Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 2 A) and that between GM-CSF-driven and STAT5A-N642H-driven TF-1 cells (Fig. 2 B) can be explained by the absence of adequate Ras-Raf-MAPK signal in the latter cells (13Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We also introduced the same point mutation to STAT5B (23Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) to acquire the amino acid substitution from Asn640 to His. Ba/F3 cells transduced with this STAT5B mutant also proliferated in the absence of IL-3 (data not shown).Figure 2STAT5A-N642H induced autonomous growth of factor-dependent cell lines. Cell number was counted after transduction of the retroviral vector constructs. Day 0 is the second day after transduction of the virus. Proliferation of parental Ba/F3 (A) and TF-1 cells (B) with essential cytokine (Ba/F3 IL-3 (+) and TF-1 GM (+)) is each shown as a reference. The average and standard deviation of four independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A in factor-independent Ba/F3 cells expressing the Flag epitope-tagged STAT5A-N642H, using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig.3 a). In Ba/F3 cells, STAT5A-N642H-Flag was constitutively phosphorylated on the tyrosine residues in the absence of IL-3, and prolonged hyperphosphorylation of tyrosine residues after IL-3 stimulation was observed as in the case of STAT5A1*6-Flag (13Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A-N642H-Flag in Ba/F3 cells without IL-3 was nearly as strong as that seen in Ba/F3 cells expressing the wild-type STAT5A-Flag after IL-3 stimulation. Next we asked if Tyr694, which is essential for dimerization, was required for the activity of STAT5A-N642H by introducing the Y694F mutation (17Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) in STAT5A-N642H (STAT5A-N642H/Y694F) (Fig. 1). STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag did not give constitutive or prolonged phosphorylation of STAT5A. Tyrosine phosphorylation observed in STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag in response to IL-3 stimulation probably reflects that of endogenous STAT5A or B which was co-immunoprecipitated with transduced STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag, or that of residues other than the Y694F in STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag. To test these possibilities, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A in COS-7 cells using an anti-phospho-STAT5A/B(Y694/Y699) antibody after transfection with STAT5A-Flag constructs and human MPL (the receptor for TPO) expression vector for thrombopoietin (TPO) stimulation (Fig.3 b). As in Ba/F3 cells, STAT5A-N642H-Flag, but not STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag was constitutively phosphorylated on the critical tyrosine residues in the absence of TPO stimulation. Phosphorylation of Tyr694/Tyr699 was observed in the immunoprecipitates of the cells expressing wild-type STAT5A-Flag or STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag only in the presence of TPO stimulation. This result indicated that co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous STAT5A or -B gave rise to tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr694/Tyr699 oberved in the cells expressing STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the other tyrosines of the STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-Flag are also phosphorylated. Because phosphorylation of STATs is required for the binding of STATs to the promoter elements of target genes (17Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), we examined whether STAT5A-N642H bound the target sequence without IL-3 stimulation, using Ba/F3 transfectants expressing wild-type and mutant STAT5As. As shown in Fig.4, the wild-type STAT5A bound the target sequence only in the presence of IL-3, while STAT5A-N642H bound the target sequence even in the absence of IL-3. A supershift experiment confirmed that STAT5A-N642H is involved in the complex formation. We next investigated the intracellular localization of mutants of STAT5A in NIH3T3 cells, using fusion constructs with EGFP. In the absence of IL-3, STAT5A-N642H-EGFP was mainly localized in the nuclei in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5 C), while STAT5A wild-type EGFP (Fig. 5 A) and STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-EGFP (Fig.5 E) showed no predominant nuclear accumulation. To determine whether STAT5A-N642H is transcriptionally active in the absence of IL-3, we examined transactivation of the β-casein promoter in Ba/F3 cells, using luciferase assay (17Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) (Fig.6). The transcriptional activity induced by STAT5A-N642H was 25-fold higher than that induced by STAT5A wild-type or STAT5A-N642H/Y694F in the absence of IL-3, and was as potent as that induced by STAT5A wild-type in the presence of IL-3. STAT5A-N642H/Y694F did not behave as a dominant negative mutant, rather it had activity comparable to that of the wild type in this assay, suggesting that heterodimerization of STAT5A-N642H/Y694F with endogenous STAT5A or STAT5B had occurred. This result is consistent with that of the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 3. Thus STAT5A-N642H activated transcription of the target gene without IL-3 stimulation, and Tyr694 required for dimerization of STAT5A was necessary for transactivation in STAT5A-N642H as was the case with the wild-type.Figure 5Nuclear localizations of the mutant STAT5A-N642H harboring a point mutation in the SH2 domain. The fusion proteins of STAT5A wild-type EGFP (A andB), STAT5A-N642H-EGFP (C and D), and STAT5A-N642H/Y694F-EGFP (E and F) were expressed in NIH3T3 cells via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, and observed under a fluorescence microscope (A, C, and E), and a phase-contrast microscope (B, D, and F).

https://openalex.org/W2066239958,"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy of elderly men in the United States. Since there is no curative treatment for advanced prostate cancer, exploration of novel modalities of treatment is essential. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein, is detected in the vast majority of prostate cancer, but not in normal or benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Thus, telomerase is expected to be a very strong candidate for targeted therapy of prostate cancer. In this study, we synthesized a 19-mer antisense oligonucleotide against the RNA component of human telomerase (hTR) linked to a 2-5A molecule (2-5A-anti-hTR) and examined its cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cells. The 2-5A antisense strategy relies on the recruitment and activation of RNase L at the site of targeted RNA sequence. We here show that treatment with 2-5A-anti-hTR in the presence of a cationic liposome reduced cell viability of tumor cell lines tested to 9–18% within 6 days. In contrast, normal fibroblast cells were resistant to the treatment. Its effect was mainly due to induction of apoptosis by activated caspase family members. Furthermore, treatment of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice with 2-5A-anti-hTR significantly suppressed the tumor growth through induction of apoptosis (P<0.001). The treatment with 2-5A-anti-hTR may be a promising strategy for the treatment modality of prostate cancer with telomerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2325672876,"The Cdc37 gene encodes a 50 kDa protein which targets intrinsically unstable oncoprotein kinases such as Cdk4, Raf-1, and src to the molecular chaperone Hsp90. This activity is thought to play an important role in the establishment of signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation. The budding yeast Cdc37 homolog is required for cell division and mammalian Cdc37 is expressed in proliferative zones during embryonic development and in adult tissues, consistent with a positive role in proliferation. Here we report that human prostatic tumors, neoplasias and certain pre-malignant lesions display increased Cdc37 expression, suggesting an important and early role for Cdc37 in prostatic transformation. To test the consequences of increased Cdc37 levels, transgenic mice expressing Cdc37 in the prostate were generated. These mice displayed a wide range of growth-related abnormalities including prostatic epithelial cell hyperplasia and dysplasia. These data suggest that the expression of Cdc37 may promote inappropriate proliferation and may be an important early step in the development of human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2003832177,"Following activation by ligand, theN-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) undergoes processing events initiated by phosphorylation that lead to receptor desensitization and internalization. Our previous results have shown that FPR internalization can occur in the absence of receptor desensitization, suggesting that FPR desensitization and internalization are controlled by distinct mechanisms. More recently, we have provided evidence that internalization of the FPR occurs via a mechanism that is independent of the actions of arrestin, dynamin, and clathrin. In the present report, we demonstrate that stimulation of the FPR with agonist leads to a significant translocation of arrestin-2 from the cytosol to the membrane. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the translocated arrestin-2 is highly colocalized with the ligand-bound FPR. A D71A mutant FPR, which does not undergo activation or phosphorylation in response to ligand, did not colocalize with arrestin-2. Surprisingly, an R123G mutant FPR, which does not bind G protein but does become phosphorylated and subsequently internalized, also did not bind arrestin. These results indicate that arrestin binding is not required for FPR internalization and demonstrate for the first time that a common motif, the conserved “DRY” domain of G protein-coupled receptors, is essential for phosphorylation-dependent arrestin binding, as well as G protein activation.

Of particular significance is their role in the regulation of the complex signaling pathways of the immune system. Chemokine and chemoattractant receptors are largely responsible for leukocyte trafficking and activation (1Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The pathways responsible for receptor activation are critical to the proper functioning of a given system, and of equal importance are the pathways involved in terminating or attenuating these responses. Termination of receptor signaling has been shown to be dependent on receptor phosphorylation, primarily by the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (2Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, receptor phosphorylation alone is insufficient to preclude G protein binding and activation. For this to occur, another protein, a member of the arrestin family, must first bind the phosphorylated receptor. The binding of arrestins to phosphorylated receptors prevents G protein binding and results in an inactive receptor (3Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). For many G protein-coupled receptors, arrestin also acts as an adapter protein, mediating internalization through clathrin-coated pits (5Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, arrestin-mediated recruitment of Src has been shown to be essential for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by certain G protein-coupled receptors (6Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that the ability of arrestins to dissociate from an internalized or internalizing receptor regulates the rate at which the receptor is resensitized and re-expressed at the cell surface (7Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It is thus clear that arrestins can play multiple roles in receptor desensitization, internalization, signal transduction, and resensitization. Mechanisms for the binding of arrestins to receptors have been described based largely on biochemical, biophysical, structural, and mutational studies of visual arrestin (8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). This protein exhibits great selectivity for binding to light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin, with binding resulting in signal termination (9Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). With the recent x-ray crystallographic determination of visual arrestin, a much more precise understanding of the functional properties of arrestins has come to light (8Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The structure of visual arrestin consists of two domains with a highly polar core comprised mostly of amino-terminal domain residues. The extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein lies over the cavity containing the polar core. Removal of the carboxyl terminus or mutation of the polar core of the homologous arrestin-2 protein results in an arrestin molecule that discriminates poorly between phosphorylated, activated rhodopsin and non-phosphorylated, activated rhodopsin, suggesting the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of rhodopsin binds to and disrupts this polar region (10Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Disruption of the polar core is believed to result in a large conformational change within arrestin, leading to its activation (11Vishnivetskiy S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11451-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A key feature of arrestin, essential to its proper functioning, is its ability not only to recognize the phosphorylation state of a receptor but also its activation state, reflecting whether ligand is bound. This has been shown for visual and non-visual arrestins and is elegantly demonstrated by studies of a mutant form of arrestin, which disrupts the polar core (partially pre-activating the protein), preventing the protein from discriminating the phosphorylation state of the receptor (10Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Despite this deficit, the protein continues to display significantly higher affinity for the light-activated form of rhodopsin compared with the inactive form. These results indicate that arrestins recognize at least two distinct features of G protein-coupled receptors. The N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a chemoattractant receptor found predominantly on leukocytes (1Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that following ligand stimulation, this receptor is rapidly phosphorylated on its carboxyl terminus (12Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation, likely mediated by GRK2, is essential for the subsequent desensitization and internalization of the receptor (13Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, studies of U937 cells expressing receptor mutants partially defective in phosphorylation have revealed that, unlike the paradigm outlined above, receptor internalization can occur in the absence of desensitization (15Maestas D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggested that FPR internalization and desensitization are mediated by distinct mechanisms. Using a dominant negative arrestin mutant (arrestin-2 319–418), which binds to clathrin but not activated receptors, we have subsequently confirmed in HEK cells that internalization of the FPR occurs in an arrestin-independent manner. 2T. L. Gilbert, T. A. Bennett, D. C. Maestas, D. F. Cimino, and E. R. Prossnitz, submitted for publication. Furthermore, co-expression of a dominant negative dynamin mutant or a dominant negative clathrin mutant also had no effect on FPR internalization, substantiating that neither clathrin nor caveolae are involved in this process. Lastly, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the β2-adrenergic receptor, which does internalize via clathrin-coated pits, does not colocalize with the FPR during simultaneous internalization of both receptors. Together, these results provide clear evidence that the FPR need not bind arrestins to be processed for internalization. In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of the FPR does indeed result in a translocation of arrestin-2 from the cytosol to the membrane and furthermore that the translocated arrestin-2 colocalizes with the FPR. Despite not being required for internalization, arrestin-2 can clearly be seen to be associated with endosomes containing internalized FPR. Activation of the FPR is required for this association as demonstrated by the lack of arrestin colocalization with an inactive D71A mutant form of the FPR. However, another mutant form of the FPR, R123G, which does not bind G protein but does become phosphorylated and undergoes internalization, was also shown not to bind arrestin. These results suggest that the binding of arrestin to G protein-coupled receptors may be regulated in part by the same receptor activation signal utilized by G proteins, namely the highly conserved “DRY” sequence, located at the interface between the third transmembrane helix and the cytoplasm. The cDNA encoding the FPR was originally obtained from a human HL-60 granulocyte library (17Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The generation of FPR mutants has been described previously (18Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Anti-arrestin-2 rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generously supplied by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic, Thomas Jefferson University. Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Vector Laboratories. fMLF, GTPγS, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Sigma.N-Formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys fluorescein was from Molecular Probes. U937 cells (108) were collected, washed once in PBS, and resuspended into 10 ml of PBS. One-half of the sample was stimulated with 50 μm fMLF for 8 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 10 ml of cold PBS. Stimulated and unstimulated cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 750 μl of PBS plus protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and sonicated. The membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane fraction was resuspended once and recentrifuged. Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the relative arrestin concentration in each fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman) with a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Owl Scientific). Membranes were blotted with antibody against the indicated arrestin protein followed by an HRP secondary antibody. The blots were developed using ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and imaged using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Membrane fractions were generated by nitrogen cavitation as described previously (19Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E.R. Biotechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and stored until use at −80 °C. Lysed membranes were thawed and washed in binding buffer (30 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Membranes were centrifuged at 135,000 × g and resuspended to 5 × 108 cell equivalents/ml of binding buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Membrane extract (10 μl) was incubated with 10 nm formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys fluorescein (Peninsula Laboratories) in a final volume of 20 μl for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Samples were analyzed by the spectrofluorometric approach described previously (19Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E.R. Biotechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, following preparation at 4 °C, samples were diluted to 200 μl and equilibrated to 22 °C. They were then placed into the spectrofluorimeter (SLM 8000, Spectromic Instruments), and fluorescence was measured using the photon counting mode. Total fluorescence was obtained for 20 s followed by the addition of an anti-fluorescein Ab. The Ab binds formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys fluorescein with high affinity and results in essentially the complete quenching of fluorescence of free ligand but does not recognize ligand bound to receptor. Thus, the remaining fluorescence indicates ligand bound to receptor. At 120 s GTPγS (100 μm) was added. Guanine nucleotide sensitivity was used to assess the coupling between receptors and G proteins based on characteristic ligand dissociation rates. Data were analyzed and graphed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Kinetic binding data was normalized to peak fluorescence with the mean base line subtracted. Ligand dissociation rates were determined by using a non-linear curve fit to either a single or a double exponential decay as described previously (20Gilbert T.L. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Receptor internalization was determined as the uptake of N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys fluorescein. Cells were incubated with 10 nm N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys fluorescein at 37 °C or on ice for 8 min and rapidly chilled. Samples were washed extensively with successive washes of ice-cold 50 mm glycine (pH 3.0), 1× PBS, and 1× PBS containing 10 μm N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys to remove surface-bound fluorescent ligand. Cells were then analyzed for residual fluorescent intensity, representing internalized ligand, on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson) with dead cells excluded by a gate on forward and side scatter. Control cells were incubated with 10 nm N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys fluorescein for 8 min at 0 °C. Receptor internalization was stimulated by incubating cells with 10 nm N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys fluorescein for 8 min at 37 °C. Each of the samples were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.02% saponin. Arrestin-2 was detected by incubating cells with anti-arrestin antibody followed by a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red. After three washes, cells were resuspended in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and placed on a slide. Fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 equipped with a digital camera (Orca, Hammamatsu) to localize both the FPR (green) and arrestin proteins (red). The role of arrestins in the desensitization, and more recently internalization, of numerous G protein-coupled receptors has been thoroughly documented (21Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 22Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). However, our recent work in the characterization of phosphorylation-deficient FPR mutants has suggested that desensitization and internalization of this receptor occur through distinct mechanisms (15Maestas D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have demonstrated that FPR internalization proceeds via a pathway that is not only independent of arrestin but also independent of dynamin and clathrin.2 The mediators of this mode of internalization have yet to be described. Despite this, our results have led to questions regarding the existence of an interaction between arrestins and the FPR and the role, if any, of arrestins in FPR function. To investigate the potential interaction between the FPR and arrestins, we utilized a model promonocytic cell line, U937, stably transfected with the wild type FPR (23Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Analysis of whole cell lysates by Western blot revealed that this cell line predominantly expresses arrestin-2 (data not shown). To determine the cellular location of the arrestin-2, cells were incubated for 10 min either in the presence or absence of agonist, disrupted by sonication, and separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by centrifugation. In the nonstimulated cells, approximately 15% of the total arrestin-2 was associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 1). Following a 10-min treatment with agonist, a significant translocation occurred with approximately 50% of the arrestin-2 now detected in the membrane fraction. Because arrestin is known to reside predominantly in the cytosol in unstimulated cells (24Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), this result is consistent with the activated FPR being able to recruit arrestin to the membrane. Given that activation of the FPR induced arrestin-2 translocation to the plasma membrane, we next examined cells utilizing fluorescence microscopy techniques to investigate whether the translocating arrestin was being directed to sites containing the FPR. Cells were stimulated with a fluorescent agonist to identify and track the FPR as it was processed. The cells were then immediately fixed and permeabilized, and arrestin-2 was detected with an anti-arrestin antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red. As demonstrated in Fig.2, both arrestin-2 and the FPR have a diffuse appearance in a cell treated with the fluorescent ligand but kept at 0 °C. Following an 8-min incubation with the fluorescent agonist at 37 °C, the FPR can be seen to be localized in punctate structures, presumably largely endosomes at this point. Translocation of arrestin into punctate structures is also apparent. The arrestin-2 colocalized with the FPR as seen in endosomes that are close to the cell surface, as well as in structures that have migrated further into the interior of the cell. The arrestin-2 seems to remain associated with the receptor throughout the internalization process. This is in contrast to the β2 adrenergic receptor, which has been reported to dissociate from arrestin at the membrane prior to or concomitant with release from the membrane (25Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, although the FPR does not require arrestin binding for internalization, arrestin does bind to the wild type FPR upon stimulation and appears to co-internalize with the receptor. To characterize this interaction further, we employed two mutant forms of the FPR, R123G and D71A, that we have described previously (26Prossnitz E.R. Schreiber R.E. Bokoch G.M. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10686-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The R123G mutation is at the cytoplasmic boundary of the third transmembrane domain, and the D71A is located in the second transmembrane segment. The Arg-123 site is part of the highly conserved DRY consensus sequence that is conserved in all identified G protein-coupled receptors (27Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Although the Asp and Tyr can permit a small number of substitutions, the Arg is unalterable. The Asp-71 residue is also highly conserved in the great majority of G protein-coupled receptors, with only a small number exhibiting substitutions. In our previous work we have demonstrated that neither the R123G nor the D71A mutant receptor was able to mediate a ligand-induced calcium response as seen with the wild type FPR. This suggested a defect in the ability of these mutant receptors to either bind or activate G protein (26Prossnitz E.R. Schreiber R.E. Bokoch G.M. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10686-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although we initially hypothesized that both mutants were unable to attain the active receptor conformation, differences in receptor phosphorylation and internalization suggested otherwise (15Maestas D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the functional capabilities of the R123G and D71A mutants, we used membrane preparations to investigate receptor activity with respect to G protein coupling. Utilizing spectrofluorometric techniques that detect ligand dissociation from receptors, it can be determined whether a given receptor is capable of interacting with G proteins. Two distinct rates of ligand dissociation can be observed dependent on whether a G protein is bound to the receptor. The receptor-G protein complex has a higher affinity for ligand than receptor alone. This can also be viewed in spectrofluorometric experiments as the ligand dissociation rate being sensitive to guanine nucleotide (GTPγS). An initial slow dissociation rate is present that is followed by a fast dissociation rate after the addition of GTPγS with the wild type receptor (Fig.3 A). Neither the Arg-123 nor the Asp-71 mutants display any nucleotide sensitivity, and there is no initial slow dissociation rate (Fig. 3 A). Ligand dissociates at a single rate rather than two distinct rates as observed with the wild type receptors, indicating that 70% of the wild type FPR is initially coupled to G protein (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, although both mutant receptors exhibit single rate dissociation kinetics, the R123G rate is slower than the D71A, suggesting that the Arg-123 receptor may be able to undergo a conformational change in the presence of ligand, possibly to a higher affinity, activated state. To determine the extent to which the receptors internalize under the conditions used in microscopy experiments, cells expressing either wild type, R123G, or D71A FPR were treated with fluorescent agonist for 8 min and washed extensively to remove fluorescent ligand from the exterior of the cell. Samples were then assayed by flow cytometry where detected fluorescence represents fluorescein that has been internalized with receptors into the cell (Fig. 3 C). Approximately 70% of the total wild type cell surface receptors have been internalized under these conditions, and approximately 50% of the cell surface R123G mutant FPR was internalized. Under the same conditions, there is essentially no internalization of the D71A receptor. This is consistent with the rates and extents of internalization demonstrated previously for other agonists (28Prossnitz E.R. Gilbert T.L. Chiang S. Campbell J.J. Qin S. Newman W. Sklar L.A. Ye R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We next examined the ability of both of the mutant receptors to redistribute arrestins following stimulation. Fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed to determine whether either the R123G or D71A mutant receptor was able to colocalize with arrestin-2. Both receptors, like the wild type receptor, initially appeared diffuse, spread evenly over the cell surface (data not shown). After incubation with fluorescent agonist, the R123G receptor appears punctate, similar to wild type receptor, with a significant fraction of the receptor appearing in endosomes (Fig. 4). The D71A receptor, however, remains diffuse over the cell surface reacting very differently to agonist treatment. Stimulation of the cells has no effect on the appearance of arrestin-2, and there is no apparent colocalization with either mutant receptor. The result for the R123G mutant FPR was particularly surprising, because it has been shown to undergo ligand-dependent phosphorylation (28Prossnitz E.R. Gilbert T.L. Chiang S. Campbell J.J. Qin S. Newman W. Sklar L.A. Ye R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To support these findings, arrestin-2 translocation experiments were performed using the R123G and D71A cells lines. For both cell lines, there is no change in the fraction of arrestin that is membrane-associated upon ligand stimulation, with <10% of the total arrestin being associated with the membrane fraction in either the agonist-treated or unstimulated cells (data not shown). These results indicate that receptor activation is required for receptor processing and arrestin binding as demonstrated by the D71A FPR mutant but that receptor phosphorylation alone, in the presence of ligand, is insufficient for arrestin binding as demonstrated by the R123G FPR mutant, which undergoes phosphorylation and internalization but does not activate G proteins. The results of our experiments are summarized in TableI. After stimulation with agonist, the wild type FPR assumes a fully active conformation, activates G protein, localizes to discrete membrane sites, recruits arrestin, and internalizes. The D71A mutant FPR appears totally inactive, exhibiting none of the features of the wild type receptor with the exception that it is able to bind ligand, be it in the low affinity state. The R123G mutant FPR represents an interesting intermediate. It binds ligand only with low affinity, indicating it does not couple to G protein. This has been confirmed previously in calcium mobilization experiments (26Prossnitz E.R. Schreiber R.E. Bokoch G.M. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10686-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although we had at first believed this mutant was inactive like the D71A mutant, we were surprised to discover that it became phosphorylated and internalized almost as well as the wild type receptor. If receptor internalization required arrestin binding, then this mutant would also have to bind arrestin. However, our recent studies in HEK cells suggested that the FPR could internalize in an arrestin-independent manner.2 In the current study, when we examined the ability of the R123G mutant FPR to colocalize with arrestin in U937 cells, we found that no such interaction occurred, demonstrating that in a native myeloid cell line, FPR internalization occurs in the absence of arrestin binding.Table ISummary of properties of the wild type and mutant forms of the FPRFPRLigand affinityG protein bindingInternalizationArrestin colocalizationWild typehigh/low+++D71Alow−−−R123Glow−+−The ligand binding, G protein interaction, internalization, and arrestin-2 binding properties are summarized for the wild type, D71A, and R123G mutant forms of the FPR expressed in U937 cells.

Open table in a new tab The ligand binding, G protein interaction, internalization, and arrestin-2 binding properties are summarized for the wild type, D71A, and R123G mutant forms of the FPR expressed in U937 cells. Ligand affinity and G protein binding results are derived from Fig.3 A; internalization ability is derived from Fig.3 C. The ability to colocalize with arrestin-2 is summarized from the results shown in Fig. 4. Our data further indicate the importance of the Arg-123 site not only in the interaction with G protein, but with arrestin as well. It is interesting to note that the R123G mutant is recognized by the kinase, as we have demonstrated previously, resulting in substantial ligand-dependent phosphorylation. This suggests that the R123G mutant may be able to form an overall active-like conformation state that can be recognized by the kinase but not by G protein or arrestin. This is supported by Fig. 3 B, in which the ligand dissociation rate from the R123G mutant differs from that of the D71A mutant. If the D71A mutant is incapable of forming an active conformation and wild type can form a fully active conformation, the R123G mutant may represent a new intermediate state of the receptor. An alternative interpretation could propose that in addition to being an important point of contact for G protein, the Arg-123 site governs the phosphorylation pattern produced by the kinase, altering it in such a way that arrestin can no longer bind, even though phosphorylation-dependent internalization can take place. Even in this situation, a crucial role for Arg-123 is indicated in the regulation of receptor processing. The role of the DRY sequence in two other GPCRs, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (29Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P.

Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), has been extensively modelled. Work with both receptors suggests that the arginine in the DRY sequence plays a key structural role in receptor activation. Scheeret al. (16Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) speculate that for the α1b-adrenergic receptor, mutations of the arginine residue can induce different states of the receptor. Ballesteroset al. (29Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10445-10453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggest that a highly conserved aspartate, which is on helix 2 in most GPCRs and on helix 7 in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, forms a salt bridge with the arginine of the DRY sequence in the active state of the GPCR. This conflicts with the view by the Scheer et al. (16Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which argues that the arginine is not engaged in a salt bridge interaction. Molecular modelling by the latter group suggests that the Arg of the DRY sequence is embedded within the receptor in the inactive state, and upon ligand-mediated receptor activation, the ensuing conformational change results in the movement of the arginine side chain to the cytoplasmic surface, where it becomes solvent-exposed. This suggests that the exposure of the arginine side chain is a crucial triggering event in G protein binding and/or activation. This model supports our conclusion that this same site is equally important in triggering the binding of arrestin, consistent with the ability of arrestin to distinguish between active, phosphorylated and inactive, phosphorylated receptors. In conclusion, we describe a novel function of a recognized G protein-coupled receptor domain. The DRY motif of G protein-coupled receptors, known to be involved in G protein activation, is shown here to be critical to arrestin recognition and binding, demonstrating the use of a conserved receptor signal to signify the activation state of the receptor to multiple binding partners. This represents the first report, to our knowledge, of the mapping of a site used by arrestins to assess the activation state of a receptor, independent of the phosphorylation state of the receptor. It remains to be determined whether this paradigm will extend to other G protein-coupled receptors. In addition, we directly demonstrate that internalization of the FPR occurs in the absence of arrestin binding, suggesting the existence of alternative adapter proteins that recognize phosphorylated receptors and mediate their internalization.

Mutations in these genes lead to a reduction of GPI anchoring and cell wall fragility. Gpi7 mutants accumulate a GPI lipid intermediate of the structure Manα1–2[NH2-(CH2)2-PO4→]Manα1–2Manα1–6[NH2-(CH2)2-PO4→]Manα1–4GlcNα1–6[acyl→]inositol-PO4-lipid, which, in comparison with the complete GPI precursor lipid CP2, lacks an HF-sensitive side chain on the α1–6-linked mannose. In contrast, mcd4–174 accumulates only minor amounts of abnormal GPI intermediates. Here we investigate whether YLL031c, an open reading frame predicting a further homologue of GPI7and MCD4, plays any role in GPI anchoring. YLL031c is an essential gene. Its depletion results in a reduction of GPI anchor addition to GPI proteins as well as to cell wall fragility. YLL031c-depleted cells accumulate GPI intermediates with the structures Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–6[NH2-(CH2)2-PO4→]Manα1–4GlcNα1–6[acyl→]inositol-PO4-lipid and Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNα1–6[acyl→]inositol-PO4-lipid. Subcellular localization studies of a tagged version of YLL031c suggest that this protein is mainly in the ER, in contrast to Gpi7p, which is found at the cell surface. The data are compatible with the idea that YLL031c transfers the ethanolaminephosphate to the inner α1–2-linked mannose, i.e. the group that links the GPI lipid anchor to proteins, whereas Mcd4p and Gpi7p transfer ethanolaminephosphate onto the α1–4- and α1–6-linked mannoses of the GPI anchor, respectively.

In particular, human and all other mammalian cells invariably add an EtN-P group onto Man1 (Fig.1), and in a few cases they also add an EtN-P group to Man2 (for a review, see Ref. 2Brewis I.A. Ferguson M.A. Mehlert A. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22946-22956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although no EtN-P side chains had been found in a study of a pool of protein-derived GPI anchors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Fankhauser C. Homans S.W. Thomas Oates J.E. McConville M.J. Desponds C.

Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, the complete GPI anchor precursor lipid CP2 that can be observed in mutants such as pmi40 or in transamidase mutants (5Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Hamburger D. Egerton M. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Benghezal M.

Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A.

This suggests that the side chains on Man1 and Man2 may have been invented before the separation of the lineages leading to present day yeast and mammals. Recent studies have implicated MCD4and GPI7 in the transfer of EtN-P groups onto GPI structures in yeast. MCD4 is essential, and mcd4–174 cells show an almost complete defect in GPI anchor addition to proteins at the restrictive temperature (9Mondesert G. Clark D.J. Reed S.I. Genetics. 1998; 147: 421-434Crossref Google Scholar, 10Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Deletion of PIG-N, a mammalian homologue of MCD4, leads to a reduced surface expression of GPI proteins and loss of an enzyme activity that adds EtN-P to Man1 (11Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GPI7 is not essential, but its deletion slows the GPI anchor addition to newly synthesized proteins, produces cell wall fragility, and blocks biosynthesis of GPI lipids at a premature stage. Of the several abnormal GPI lipids accumulating inΔgpi7 cells, even the most complete one lacks the phosphodiester-linked substituent on Man2, a finding that relatesGPI7 to the addition of a side chain to Man2 (8Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The idea that MCD4, GPI7, and their homologue YLL031c may all be involved in the transfer of EtN-P groups has been fostered by their pronounced homology with bacterial, viral, plant, and mammalian phosphodiesterases, phosphatases, and pyrophosphatases (8Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol.

Here we investigate whether YLL031c plays any role in GPI biosynthesis and, specifically, in the addition of EtN-P- groups to GPI structures. S. cerevisiae strains were FBY413 (MATa ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200), FBY1102 (MATa ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 yll031c::HIS3-pGAL1, 10-YLL031c), FCEN010a (MATa ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 YNR019w::KanMX4), FBY1103 (MATa ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 yll031c::HIS3-pGAL1,10-YLL031c YNR019w::KanMX4), FBY1104 (MATa ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 mcd4::HIS3-pGAL1,10-MCD4 YNR019w::KanMX4), FBY182 (MATα ade2–1 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 gpi7::KanMX4), FBY1106 (MATa yll031c::HIS3-pGAL1, 10-YLL031c gpi7::KanMX4 leu2 ura3 his3), FY1679 (MATa/α ura3–52/ura3–52 leu2-Δ1/+ trp1-Δ63/+ his3-Δ200/+), FBY1105 (MATa/α ura3–52/ura3–52 leu2-Δ1/+ trp1-Δ63/+ his3-Δ200/+ YLL031c::KanMX4/YLL031c), FBY1107 (MATa ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 yll031c::YLL031c-13Myc-KanMX6), FBY122 (MATa ade2–1 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 trp1–1 gpi8–1 gpi7–1), FBY169 (MATα ade2–1 can1–100 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 trp1–1 gpi10–1), and HMSF176 (MATa sec18–1). Maintenance and growth conditions have been described (7Benghezal M. Benachour A. Rusconi S. Aebi M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6575-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CFW-containing plates were made as described (12Lussier M. Genetics. 1997; 147 (▪): 435-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that a 100 mg/ml filter-sterilized CFW stock solution was used. Materials were obtained from the sources described recently (4Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were from Microsynth GmBH (Balgach, Switzerland), Quantazyme ylg from Quantum Biotechnologies Inc. (Montreal, Canada), Calcofluor White (CFW) from Sigma, and antibodies to carboxypeptidase Y from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Rabbit antibodies to Yap3p and Cwp1p were kindly donated by Dr. Y. Bourbonnais (UniversitéLaval, Québec, Canada) and Dr. H. Shimoi (National Institute of Brewing, Higashihiroshima, Japan), respectively. Rabbit antibodies to Och1p and Wbp1p were gifts from Dr. Y. Jigami (National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology, Ibarasaki, Japan) and Dr. M. Aebi (Mikrobiologisches Institut, ETH Zürich, Switzerland), respectively. A mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, clone 9E10, was obtained from Babco (Richmond, CA), and goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate was from Sigma. Conditional expression of YLL031c was achieved by the insertion of theGAL1,10 promoter in front of the chromosomal YLL031c gene as described (13Lafontaine D. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3469-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HIS3 marker flanked by theGAL1,10 promoter was PCR-amplified using pTL26 as template and the following two adapter primers: 031GalFor (5′-AAGATCAAAAAAGGAATAGAAGCATATGTTTTAAGGGCAACGCCGctcttggcctcctctag-3′) with 17 nt of homology to the pTL26 vector (lowercase) and 45 nt of homology to a 5′-flanking sequence of YLL031c (uppercase) and oligonucleotide 031GalRev (5′-AAGAATCGACTTTTTAATTGTCTTTTCATCCATATTACGGGAGCTcgaattccttgaattttcaaa-3′) with 45 nt of homology to the 5′-end of YLL031c ending 12 nt upstream of the start codon (boldface type) and 21 nt of homology to the pTL26 vector (lowercase type). This PCR-generated DNA fragment was used to transform the strains FCEN010a and FBY413, yielding FBY1103 and FBY1102, respectively. Correct targeting of the inserted promoter was verified by whole yeast cell PCR (14Huxley C. Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), using primers A3Gal (5′-gagcagttaagcgtattactg-3′) and 031A4 (5′-catcaatgaaagtcggtaagg-3′) yielding a 0.7-kilobase pair DNA fragment. The genomic MCD4 was placed under the control of theGAL1,10 promoter by the same strategy as described above for YLL031c, using the following two adapter primers for PCR amplification from the pTL26 as the template: 165GalFor (5′-GAACCGTTCTTTACTATATATTCAACAACCCATCTTCGACCAAAGctcttggcctcctctag-3′) with 17 nt of homology to the pTL26 vector (lowercase type) and 45 nt of homology to the MCD4 flanking sequence (uppercase type) and oligonucleotide 165GalRev (5′-GACACCAACAGCCAGAAGCGTCGTTCTGGTTTTGTTCCACATTTTcgaattccttgaattttcaaa-3′) with 45 nt of homology to MCD4 ending 3 nt upstream of the start codon (boldface type) and 21 nt of homology to the pTL26 vector (lowercase type). This PCR-generated DNA fragment was used to transform the strain FCEN010a. Correct targeting of theHIS3-marked GAL1,10 promoter was verified by whole yeast cell PCR using primers A3Gal (5′-gagcagttaagcgtattactg-3′) and 165A4 (5′-agcaatcatagcaacatgacc-3′) yielding a 0.5-kilobase pair DNA fragment. For deletion of YLL031c, a short flanking homology (SFH) replacement cassette was synthesized by PCR amplification of the KanMX4 module of pFA6a-KanMX4 (15Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar) with the following primers: primer 031-S1 (5′-GATGAAAAAATAATATACAAATCGCGAATAAAGAAATTTCAAcgtacgctgcaggtcgac-3′) with 42-nt homology to amino acids 16–29 of YLL031c and 18-nt homology to the KanMX4 module (lowercase type) and primer 031-S2 (5′- TATAGTATATTTGTAAGTAAAGAGTGGAAATGAAGTTCGTCATTatcgatgaattcgagctcg-3′) with 19 nt of homology to the KanMX4 module (lowercase type) and 44 nt of homology to a sequence near the 3′ end of YLL031c (uppercase type) comprising the stop codon (boldface type). Since gene replacement with this SFH cassette proved to be difficult, the SFH cassette was used as a template to construct a long flanking homology cassette. This long flanking homology replacement cassette was synthesized as described (16Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In a first step, the primer pair K1 (5′-CATGGTACAATTGCAAAGT-3′) and L2 (5′-TTGAAATTTCTTTATTCGCGATTTGTATATTAT-3′) as well as the primer pair L3 (5′- AATGACGAACTTCATTTCCACTCTTTACTTACAAATATAC-3′) and A4 (5′-GCTGCAGAAAAGAGATGC-3′) were used to amplify two fragments of genomic DNA corresponding to the promoter region including the first 29 codons of the open reading frame and the terminator region, respectively. The 5′-parts of primers L2 and L3 were designed to anneal, respectively, to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the SFH replacement cassette, which are homologous to YLL031c. In the second step, a PCR was performed using the SFH cassette as template and the two PCR-generated fragments from the first step as primers, yielding a replacement cassette with long flanking regions having homology to the YLL031c gene. The long flanking homology cassette was used to transform the diploid WT strain FY1679, homozygous for YLL031c. The correct targeting of the KanMX4 replacement cassette to the YLL031c locus was verified by whole yeast cell PCR using primer K1, primer 031-A5 (5′-catcaatgaaagtcggtaagg-3′) annealing inside the YLL031c coding sequence, and the K2 primer of the KanMX4 module (5′-gtcgcacctgattgcccg-3′), yielding a 900-bp DNA fragment for the disrupted gene and a 748-bp DNA fragment for the WT YLL031c gene. A Myc tag was inserted at the C terminus of the genomic copy of YLL031c by homologous recombination with an insertion cassette containing the Myc tag and the selectable KanMX6 marker as described (17Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The insertion cassette was obtained by using plasmid pFA6a-13Myc-kanMX6 (17Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) as template and the oligonucleotides F2 and R1 as target gene-specific primers (F2, 5′-AGTGGGAGATTGATTAAGCACATAAATGACATTTTTTGGAAAcggatccccgggttaattaa-3′, with 20-nt homology to the pFA6a-13Myc-kanMX6 sequence (lowercase type) and 42-nt homology to the sequence of YLL031c immediately upstream of the stop codon (uppercase type), including the codon of the last amino acid (boldface type); R1, 5′-ATATATAGTATATTTGTAAGTAAAGAGTGGAAATGAAGTTCGgaattcgagctcgtttaaac-3′ with 42-nt homology to the genomic sequence of YLL031c immediately downstream of the stop codon (uppercase) and 20-nt homology to the pFA6a-13Myc-kanMX6 plasmid sequence). This PCR fragment was used to transform the WT strain FBY413, yielding FBY1107. The correct targeting of the PCR-made module was verified by whole yeast cell PCR using the primer K2 of the kanMX module and oligonucleotide C1-Myc (5′-CTGACACTGTGGTCACAGCC-3′), producing a 1577-nt fragment. The subcellular localization of YLL031c-Myc was determined essentially as described (18Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 optical density units of exponentially growing FBY1107 cells were washed with 10 mm NaN3 and converted to spheroplasts by incubation for 1 h at 30 °C with Quantazyme in 1.4m sorbitol, 10 mm NaN3, 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Spheroplasts were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mmpotassium acetate, 250 mm sorbitol, 1 mmmagnesium acetate, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml antipain, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and homogenized by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The crude lysate was centrifuged twice at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove unlysed spheroplasts. The cleared supernatant was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min to generate pellet P13 and supernatant S13. S13 was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 60 min in a Sorvall AH-650 swing out rotor to generate pellet P100 and supernatant S100. Pellet fractions were dissolved and denatured in high urea buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm EDTA, bromphenol blue, 15 mg/ml dithiothreitol) by sonication and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. The S100 fraction was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated before denaturation in high urea buffer. For probing the surface exposure of YLL031c-Myc, exponentially growing FBY1107 cells were converted to spheroplasts as described above but using zymolyase-20T. Spheroplasts were either mock-treated or treated with proteinase K in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added to a final concentration of 4 mm, and samples were kept on ice for 15 min. Finally, spheroplasts were placed on a cushion of 1.5m sorbitol, 50 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm NaF and were centrifuged. YLL031c protease sensitivity in microsomes was examined by protease K digestion essentially as described (8Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), except that the membrane pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer before protease digestions. All samples were denatured during 5 min at 95 °C in reducing sample buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 6–10% gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by Western blotting. Western blots were revealed using the chemiluminescence ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Previously described procedures were used to label cells with [2-3H]Ins and for lipid extraction (20Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In vitro biosynthesis of GPIs with microsomes was performed as described previously (4Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with the exception that spheroplasts were sometimes prepared using Quantazyme ylg instead of zymolyase-20T. Desalted lipid extracts were analyzed by ascending TLC using solvent 1 (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O, 10:10:3, v/v/v) or solvent 2 (chloroform/methanol/0.25% KCl, v/v/v). Radioactivity was detected and quantitated by two-dimensional radioscanning (LB 2842; Berthold AG, Regensdorf, Switzerland). Thereafter, TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE and exposed to film (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. Soluble head groups were obtained from purified radiolabeled glycolipids through limiting methanolic NH3 deacylation (21Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18766-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by PI-PLC treatment, for which the lipid extracts were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mmEDTA, 20% 1-propanol. Incubations with PI-PLC were for 16 h at 37 °C. Nonhydrolyzed GPIs were removed by butanol extraction. The water-soluble head groups were treated with JBAM (0.5 units) orA. satoi α-mannosidase (5 microunits) as described (22Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22673-22680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HF dephosphorylation was done as described (23Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7215-7224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generated fragments were analyzed by paper chromatography in methylethylketone/pyridine/H2O (20:12:11) as described (23Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7215-7224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before paper chromatography the products wereN-acetylated and desalted over mixed bed ion exchange resin AG-501-X8 (Bio-Rad). Radiolabeled chromatography standards were obtained as described (8Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). YLL031c was disrupted in a diploid strain by the replacement of most of the open reading frame by the KanMX4 kanamycin resistance gene. This deletion strain was constructed because in the YLL031c deletion strain produced in the EUROFAN project, part of YLL030c has been deleted along with YLL031c (24Zhang N. Ismail T. Wu J. Woodwark K.C. Gardner D.C. Walmsley R.M. Oliver S.G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Sporulation and dissection of tetrads yielded in all cases two growing colonies per tetrad. None of these colonies were kanamycin-resistant, indicating that YLL031 is essential. A partial depletion of YLL031 was achieved by the insertion of the glucose-repressible GAL1,10 promoter immediately upstream of the genomic YLL031c. When such cells, growing in liquid culture, were shifted from galactose to glucose, thus allowing for the partial depletion of the YLL031c protein, their doubling time increased, after 24 h, to 3.5 h, and cells thereafter continued to grow at this rate, whereas WT cells grew on glucose with a doubling time of 1.3 h. When the same experiment was done in aΔgpi7 background, the doubling time of YLL031c-depleted cells, after 24 h on glucose, had risen to 7.7 h, while Δgpi7 mutants grew as fast as WT cells. Thus, the deletion of GPI7 synthetically enhances the growth retardation caused by depletion of YLL031c. The reduced growth rate of YLL031c-depleted cells could also be observed on YPD plates, and this effect was significantly enhanced by the presence of CFW at a concentration that did not affect growth of WT cells but totally blocked the growth of Δgpi7 cells (Fig.2). This result indicates that partial depletion of YLL031c leads to cell wall fragility, a phenotype that is commonly observed in mutants affected in the GPI biosynthesis pathway. If Gas1p does not receive a GPI anchor in the ER, it fails to be transported to the Golgi (25Nuoffer C. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because, as shown byin vitro experiments using a vesicle budding assay, nonanchored Gas1p is not packaged into COPII-coated transport vesicles budding off the ER (26Doering T.L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, the characteristic mass increase due to elongation of N- and O-glycans in the Golgi does not take place, and the maturation of the immature 105-kDa ER form into the mature 125-kDa form is delayed. GPI anchoring deficiencies also can lead to the relative depletion of the mature forms of Gas1p and other GPI proteins (27Meyer U. Benghezal M. Imhof I. Conzelmann A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using Western blotting and antibodies to detect well characterized GPI proteins, we could observe a significant depletion of mature GPI proteins upon depletion of YLL031c. As can be seen in Fig. 3, while in WT cells the carbon source affects the amount of Gas1p only moderately, cells partially depleted of YLL031c by growth on glucose contain much less of the mature 125-kDa form of Gas1p than cells grown on galactose. This phenomenon is even more drastic when YLL031c depletion occurs in a Δgpi7 background. Other GPI proteins such as Yap3p and Cwp1p are also affected. Although the details of the biosynthesis of these proteins have not been reported and part of their mature forms gets covalently attached to the cell wall, the mass of their ER forms can be inferred form the peptides accumulating in sec18, a mutant that blocks the protein traffic from ER to Golgi at 37 °C (28Wilson D.W. Wilcox C.A. Flynn G.C. Chen E. Kuang W.J. Henzel W.J. Block M.R. Ullrich A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 29Esmon B. Novick P. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). YAP3 predicts a 60-kDa translation product, but upon shift to 37 °C,sec18 cells rapidly accumulate lower molecular weight forms (Fig. 3). Similar forms also accumulate upon depletion of YLL031c, suggesting a maturation defect of these proteins due to a delay in GPI anchor addition. Cwp1p is a cell wall protein that can be released as soluble 55–60-kDa protein by β-glucanase (30van der Vaart J.M. Caro L.H. Chapman J.W. Klis F.M. Verrips C.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C. Vink E. de la Cruz J. Llobell A. Douwes J.E. Shimoi C. Lipke P.N. Klis F.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). There are also intracellular, detergent-soluble forms of Cwp1p of 48 and 58 kDa, and these forms are drastically increased when the secretory pathway is blocked for 2 h at 37 °C in sec18 (Fig. 3). In YLL031c-depleted cells, these detergent-soluble forms are severely diminished. This also can be taken as evidence for some disturbance of GPI protein maturation, although in this case the protein does not seem to accumulate but may be rapidly degraded. In contrast, YLL031c-depleted cells do not accumulate the typical ER proform p1 of carboxypeptidase Y, a vacuolar hydrolase, nor do they show a thinning of mature carboxypeptidase Y (Fig. 3). This suggests that the maturation defect of YLL031c-depleted cells affects only GPI proteins. When WT cells are metabolically labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol ([3H]Ins), their lipid extracts contain various forms of labeled phosphatidylinositol and inositolphosphorylceramide, but the GPI intermediates remain undetectable. GPI intermediates have, however, been found to accumulate in several gpi mutants. As can be seen in Fig. 4, A andB, YLL031c-depleted cells accumulate the abnormal lipids 031a and 031b, which are present neither in WT nor in previously described gpi mutants. Lipid 031a migrates quite differently from M2*, the most polar lipid accumulating in gpi10–1, which has the structure Manα1–6[NH2-(CH2)2-PO4→]Manα1–4GlcNα1–6[acyl→]Ins-PO4-lipid (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4) (4Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The more polar lipid 031b has a lower R F than M2* but a higher R F than M4, the GPI lipid that accumulates in Δgpi7 cells and has the structure Manα1–2[NH2-(CH2)2-PO4→]Manα1–2Manα1–6[NH2-(CH2)2-PO4→]Manα1–4GlcNα1–6[acyl→]Ins-PO4-lipid (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and4) (8Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A block of GPI biosynthesis can also be observedin vitro with YLL031c-depleted microsomes. WT microsomes make the complete GPI precursor CP2 irrespective of the carbon source on which cells have been grown (Fig. 4 C, lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, YLL031c-depleted microsomes make considerably less CP2 but instead accumulate a less polar lipid that also has a higher R F than the M4 made by Δgpi7 microsomes (Fig. 4 C,lanes 3, 4, 10, and11). This in vitro generated lipid comigrates with in vivo made 031b (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 4). 031a and 031b are less polar than M4, suggesting that they have smaller head groups and are earlier intermediates of GPI biosynthesis than M4. It therefore is not unexpected that the accumulation of 031b is epistatic to the accumulation of M4 both in vitro andin vivo. Indeed, the combination ofΔgpi7 with YLL031c depletion strongly reduces the accumulation of M4 and increases the accumulation of 031b (Fig. 4,A, lane 6, and C,lanes 5 and 6). Since the depletion of YLL031c is only partial, it is understandable that in vitrothere still is residual biosynthesis of CP2 or M4 in single or double mutants, respectively (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4, 6, and 11). The severely affectedmcd4–174 mutant has been reported to accumulate only trace amounts of abnormal [3H]Ins-labeled lipids (10Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2040999006,"The interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor colocalizes with focal adhesion complexes (FACs), actin-enriched structures involved in cell adhesion and signaling in fibroblasts and chondrocytes. The colocalization of FACs and IL-1 receptors has been implicated in the restriction of IL-1 signaling transduction to ERK; however, the mechanism of this restriction and the requirement of IL-1 receptor-associated proteins have not been characterized. We determined if the association kinetics of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) colocalizes with FACs and the requirement for IRAK in IL-1-dependent ERK activation. Human gingival fibroblasts were incubated with collagen-coated beads to induce the assembly of FACs at sites of cell-bead contact. Immunoblot analysis of bead-isolated FACs showed a time-dependent assembly of the focal adhesion proteins beta-actin, vinculin, and talin, which was blocked by the actin monomer sequestering toxin latrunculin B. Although no IRAK was isolated with FACs from unstimulated cells, phosphorylated IRAK was transiently associated with FACs isolated from IL-1beta-stimulated fibroblasts. Fibroblasts plated on tissue culture plastic (which permitted the formation of focal adhesions) showed phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. Cells plated on poly-l-lysine (to prevent the formation of focal adhesions) showed activation only of JNK and p38. ERK activation was partially restored by incubating cells plated on poly-l-lysine with collagen-coated beads before IL-1 stimulation. Cells treated with latrunculin B or swinholide A, which caused a progressive depolymerization of actin filaments, showed a reduction or elimination of IL-1-induced ERK activation, respectively. Fibroblasts electroinjected with a mouse monoclonal anti-IRAK antibody to block the recruitment of IRAK into FACs failed to activate ERK after IL-1 treatment, indicating that FAC-associated IRAK is required for the activation of ERK. These data indicate that the integrity of actin filament arrays and the recruitment of IRAK into focal adhesions are involved in the restriction of IL-1 signaling to ERK."

https://openalex.org/W2320890190,"The mechanism(s) of c-Myc transcription factor-induced apoptosis is still obscure. The activation of c-Myc has been found to lead into the processing/activation of caspases (caspase-3), but the significance of this for the cell demise is debatable. Here we report that several targets of caspases (PKCdelta, MDM2, PARP, replication factor C, 70 kDa U1snRNP, fodrin and lamins) are cleaved during c-Myc-induced apoptosis in Rat-1 MycER cells, indicating an important role for caspases in the apoptotic process. We further found that the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)--protein is a novel key substrate of caspases. In in vitro assays, purified recombinant ATM protein was found to be cleaved by the effector caspases 3 and 7. The functional significance of the ATM cleavage is supported by the finding that ectopic expression of ATM protected in part against apoptosis. We also show that c-Myc-induced apoptosis involves loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and subsequent processing of caspase-9. The cleavage of caspase-9 is, however, minimal and a much later event than the processing/activation of caspase-3, suggesting that it is not the apical caspase. Evidence is provided that there is, nevertheless, an upstream caspase(s) regulating the functions of caspase-3 and mitochondria. Additionally, it was found that p53 becomes upregulated, together with its transcriptional targets MDM2 and p21, upon c-Myc induction, but this occurs also at a later time than the activation of caspase-3."

The cortical actin cytoskeletal network is also lost during apoptosis, yet little is known about the temporal relationship between altered phosphorylation of proteins that are critical in the regulation of this network and their potential cleavage by caspases during apoptosis. Adducins are central in the cortical actin network organization. Cisplatin caused apoptosis of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, which was associated with the cleavage of α-adducin into a 74-kDa fragment; this was blocked by a general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk). Hemagglutinin-tagged human α-adducin was cleaved into a similar 74-kDa fragment by caspase-3 in vitro but not by caspase-6 or -7. Asp-Arg-Val-Asp29-Glu, Asp-Ile-Val-Asp208-Arg, and Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp633-Ala were identified as the principal caspase-3 cleavage sites; Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp633-Ala was key in the formation of the 74-kDa fragment. Cisplatin also caused an increased phosphorylation of α-adducin and γ-adducin in the MARCKS domain that preceded α-adducin cleavage and was associated with loss of adducins from adherens junctions; this was not affected by z-VAD-fmk. In conclusion, the data support a model in which increased phosphorylation of α-adducin due to cisplatin leads to dissociation from the cytoskeleton, a situation rendered irreversible by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of α-adducin at Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp633-Ala.

Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). The caspase family consists of at least 14 different proteases that can be subdivided based on sequence homology into caspase-1- and caspase-3-like caspases and functionally into upstream caspases (caspases-8, -9, and -10) and terminal executioner caspases (caspases-3, -6, and -7) (4Thornberry N.A.

Disruption of the F-actin cytoskeletal network by xenobiotics and loss of both focal adhesion kinase and paxillin from the focal adhesion occurred before caspase activation and was not blocked by caspase inhibitors but was associated with loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins (15van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

The data suggested a model in which loss of focal adhesion integrity results from toxicant-induced changes in signaling. Although caspase cleavage did not initiate the disruption by inducing a gain or loss of function, it did render the process irreversible, ensuring that the cell is committed to apoptosis. Preliminary observations also suggested that cell-cell contact was also disrupted during xenobiotic-induced apoptosis. Cell-cell interactions are mediated through homophilic interactions between E-cadherins at the adherens junctions (29Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is linked through β- and α-catenin to the cortical F-actin network (29Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B.

However, little is known about the involvement of caspases in disruption of the cortical actin cytoskeleton during drug-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the fate of the cortical actin-capping protein adducin in relation to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in renal epithelial cells. Adducins are cytoskeletal proteins composed of highly related α and β or α and γ subunits that bind to the fast-growing ends and the sides of actin filaments (34Gardner K. Bennett V.

Adducins consist of three distinct domains: an N-terminal head, involved in dimerization, a neck, and C-terminal tail domain containing the MARCKS-related domain that recruits spectrin/fodrin to the fast-growing ends of actin filaments (35Joshi R.

Although adducin is a cytoskeletal component important for controlling the cortical cytoskeletal network, to our knowledge there is little or no data available on its involvement in cytoskeleton rearrangements before apoptosis or the fate of adducin during apoptosis. To investigate this we have used nephrotoxicant-induced apoptosis of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells as a model. RPTE cells are a target for many chemicals as well as ischemia/reperfusion injury (46Brady H.R. Brenner B.M. Lieberthal W. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. W. B.

Since we used the RPTE cell model to investigate the role of caspases in loss of focal adhesion integrity during apoptosis, we used RPTE cells to address the relationship between adherens junction organization, adducin phosphorylation, and proteolysis in chemically induced apoptosis. Apoptosis of RPTE cells was preceded by an early increased phosphorylation of primarily α-adducin at Ser726, most likely by a PKC isoform that correlated with a loss of adducin in adherens junctions. This was followed by activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis. α-Adducin (but not γ-adducin) was cleaved by a caspase-3-dependent manner at Asp-Arg-Val-Asp29-Glu and Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp633-Ala to yield a 74-kDa fragment in RPTE cells. The data indicate that phosphorylation of α-adducin and disruption of cellular adherens junctions precede the caspase-3-mediated degradation of α-adducin. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, α-modified minimal essential medium with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin, and trypsin/EDTA were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was from Bodinco (Alkmaar, The Netherlands). Bovine serum albumin fraction V, cholera toxin, insulin, AMC, doxorubicin, staurosporin, and cisplatin were from Sigma. Epidermal growth factor was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk), acyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (Ac-DEVD-CHO), acyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-YVAD-AMC), acyl-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-VEID-AMC), calpain inhibitor I and II were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Acyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). An expression vector for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human α-adducin (amino acids 1–737; pEF-BOS-HA-α-adducin) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Kaibuchi and described elsewhere (33Kimura K. Fukata Y.

For site-directed mutagenesis, the α-adducin-coding region was subcloned into pZErO (Invitrogen) using KpnI. For mutation by polymerase chain reaction of amino acid residue D to A at the various caspase-3 cleavage sites in human α-adducin, the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used with the following primers: Asp29 → Ala, forward primer 5′-GGTACTTCGACCGAGTAGCTGAGAACAACCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGGTTGTTCTCCAGCTACTCGGTCGAAGTACC-3′; Asp208 → Ala, forward primer 5′-GGTACTTCGACCGAGTAGCTGAGAACAACCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGGTTGTTCTCAGCTACTCGGTCGAAGTACC-3′; Asp633 → Ala, forward primer 5′-GGAGATGACAGTGCTGCTGCCACCTTTAAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCTTAAAGGTGGCAGCAGCACTGTCATCTCC-3′. The correct sequences after mutation were confirmed by DNA cycle sequencing. Mutated α-adducin was subcloned back into pEF-BOS. Correct expression of HA-α-adducin and the different Asp → Ala mutants was checked by transient overexpression in COS1 cells followed Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. RPTE cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion and separated by density centrifugation using Nycodenz as described (54Boogaard P.J. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. Toxicol. Appl.

RPTE cells were used after they had reached confluence, 6 to 9 days after plating. For experiments, confluent monolayers of RPTE cells in 24-well dishes containing coated glass coverslips, 6-well or 10-cm dishes (Corning Costar, Acton, MA), were washed with Earle's balanced salt solution once. Thereafter, cells were treated with cisplatin in Hanks' balanced salt solution (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4·7 H2O, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4·2 H2O, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 4 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 1, 2, or 10 ml, respectively, for 8 h. In some experiments the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (100 μm; 100 mm stock in Me2SO) was added simultaneously with cisplatin. Following treatment with cisplatin for 8 h, cells were allowed to recover in complete medium in the presence or absence of z-VAD-fmk. Apoptosis was determined by cell cycle analysis as described (15van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, floating as well as adherent cells that were trypsinized were fixed in 90% ethanol (−20 °C). After washing cells twice with PBS, 1 mm EDTA cells were resuspended in PBS-EDTA containing 7.5 μm propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur, Becton Dickenson), and the percentage of cells present in sub-G0/G1 was calculated using the Cellquest software (Becton Dickenson). Cell death was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase from cells in the culture medium as described (57Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage cell death was calculated from the amount of lactate dehydrogenase release caused by treatment with toxicants relative to the amount to that released by 0.1 w/v Triton X-100, i.e. 100% release. Briefly, attached and detached cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation as above. The cell pellet was taken up in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EGTA) and subjected to 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. Equal amounts of cell proteins were used in a caspase assay using Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-YVAD-AMC, or Ac-VEID-AMC (25 μm; Research Biochemicals) as a substrate. Fluorescence derived from release of the AMC moiety was followed using a fluorescence plate reader (HTS 7000 Bio assay reader; Perkin-Elmer). Caspase activity was calculated as pmol/mg of cell protein·min using AMC as a standard. For transfection, 2 × 105 COS1 cells were plated in 6-well culture clusters. After overnight culturing, COS1 cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pEF-BOS-α-adducin, pEF-BOS-α-adducin-Asp29 → Ala, pEF-BOS-α-adducin-Asp208 → Ala, or pEF-BOS-α-adducin-Asp633 → Ala using LipofectAMINEPlus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's procedures. After 24 h, cells were harvested in TSE buffer plus inhibitors (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) followed by sonication (3 × 5 s). Protein was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). 15 μg of COS1 cell lysate was dissolved in caspase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After the addition of 0.1 μg of recombinant human caspase 3, 6, or 7 (gift from D. Nicholson and N. Thornberry, Merck Frosst, Montreal, Canada), the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, 5 μm z-VAD-fmk, 5 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO, or 5 μm calpain inhibitor I or 5 μm calpain inhibitor II was also added. The cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample preparation buffer followed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged human α-adducin, 25 μg protein of total COS1 cell lysate was dissolved in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1.0% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 7.4, containing the above protease inhibitors) followed by pre-clearing by centrifugation (30 min, 13,000 rpm). The supernatant was incubated with anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After 3 washes with low salt buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors), beads were resuspended in caspase assay buffer. Next, 0.1 μg of human recombinant caspase-3 was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without 5 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO. The cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample preparation buffer followed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. To obtain soluble and cytoskeletal fractions, the Triton X-100 extraction method was used (41Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol. C"

NF-κB activation depends on phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitor protein, IκB, initiated by an IκB kinase (IKK) complex. This IKK complex includes a catalytic heterodimer composed of IκB kinase 1 (IKK1) and IκB kinase 2 (IKK2) as well as a regulatory adaptor subunit, NF-κB essential modulator. To better understand the role of IKKs in NF-κB activation, we have cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the physiological isoform, the rhIKK1/rhIKK2 heterodimer. We compared its kinetic properties with those of the homodimers rhIKK1 and rhIKK2 and a constitutively active rhIKK2 (S177E, S181E) mutant. We demonstrate activation of these recombinantly expressed IKKs by phosphorylation during expression in a baculoviral system. TheK m values for ATP and IκBα peptide for the rhIKK1/rhIKK2 heterodimer are 0.63 and 0.60 μm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the IKK2 homodimer. However, the purified rhIKK1/rhIKK2 heterodimer exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) of 47.50 h−1 μm−1 using an IκBα peptide substrate compared with any of the other IKK isoforms, including rhIKK2 (17.44 h−1μm−1), its mutant rhIKK2 (S177E, S181E, 1.18 h−1 μm−1), or rhIKK1 (0.02 h−1 μm−1). Kinetic analysis also indicates that, although both products of the kinase reaction, ADP and a phosphorylated IκBα peptide, exhibited competitive inhibitory kinetics, only ADP with the low K i of 0.77 μm may play a physiological role in regulation of the enzyme activity.

Through the synergistic interaction with other transcription factors, further specificity can be achieved while maintaining enormous potential to coordinately induce a large number of functionally related genes.

This kinase complex appears to represent a critical, common denominator in the activation of NF-κB in a number of signal transduction pathways stimulated by a variety of agonists, including cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β, microbial products such as LPS, and viral proteins such as TAX, as well as phorbol esters, oxidizing agents, and serine/tyrosine phosphatases (1Ghosh S.

IKK1 (also termed IKKα ( 4–6)) was cloned simultaneously by standard biochemical purification of the IκB kinase activity from TNFα-stimulated HeLa S3 cells and by its interaction with the mitogen-activated protein kinase, NF-κB-inducing kinase, in a yeast two-hybrid screen. IKK1 was identified as the previously cloned serine/threonine kinase, CHUK (14Connelly M. Marcu K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 537-549PubMed Google Scholar). IKK1 (also termed IKKα) is an 85-kDa, 745-amino acid protein that contains an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, a leucine zipper-like amphipathic helix, and a C-terminal helix-loop-helix domain. IKK2 (also termed IKKβ) was also cloned by standard biochemical purification, copurifying with IKK1 from TNFα-stimulated HeLa S3 cells as well as by being identified in the public data base from an expressed sequence tag clone with sequence homology to IKK1 (6Mercurio F.

IKK2 is an 87-kDa, 756-amino acid protein with the same overall topology as IKK1 except for the addition of an 11-amino acid extension at the C terminus. IKK1 and IKK2 are 52% identical overall with 65% identity in the kinase domain and 44% identity in the protein interaction domains in the C terminus. Data obtained using transient mammalian expression analysis, by in vitro translation experiments, and by coexpression in a baculoviral system reveal that IKK1 and IKK2 associate preferentially as a heterodimer through their leucine zipper motifs. Although homodimers have also been described in these systems, the heterodimer is thought to be the physiological form of the kinase in mammalian cells (7Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayadawa M.

Finally, NEMO (also termed IKKγ) contains three α-helical regions, including a leucine zipper, interacts preferentially with IKK2, and is required for activation of the heterodimeric kinase complex perhaps by bringing other proteins into the signalsome complex (10Yamaoka S.

The kinase activities of IKK1 and IKK2 are regulated by phosphorylation and require an intact leucine zipper for dimerization as well as an intact helix-loop-helix domain, which can exert a positive regulatory effect on kinase activity even when it is expressed in transwith the remainder of the IKK protein (4Regnier C.

Both IKK subunits contain a canonical mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) activation loop motif near the N terminus, which is the target for phosphorylation and activation of kinase activity by MAP3Ks such as NF-κB-inducing kinase and MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1, although the physiological regulation by these two upstream kinases awaits further characterization (2Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3Karin M. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Finally, phosphorylation of serines in the C terminus of IKK2 results in a decreased IKK activity and is postulated to be responsible for the transient kinase activity seen after stimulation of cells with an agonist (16Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). IKK2 demonstrates a more potent kinase activity compared with IKK1 using IκBα or IκBβ as a substrate (6Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M.

Mutations of the phospho-acceptor serine residues within the MAPKK activation loop alters IKK2 kinase activity; the serine to alanine substitutions result in decreased kinase activity, whereas the serine to glutamic acid substitutions result in a constitutively active kinase. Similar alanine mutations in IKK1 do not result in a decreased stimulation of total IKK activity in response to TNFα or IL-1β (16Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). IKK2 being the dominant kinase activity within the IKK complex is further supported by the analysis of fibroblasts from mice deficient in IKK1 or IKK2. Fibroblasts lacking IKK1 retain full IKK activity in response to cytokines and could activate NF-κB. In contrast, fibroblasts lacking IKK2 do not exhibit IKK activity when stimulated with cytokines nor do they activate NF-κB. Furthermore, the phenotype of each IKK knock-out is unique, with IKK1 deficiency resulting in skin and skeletal defects and IKK2 knock-out being embryonic lethal due to hepatocyte apoptosis (18Li Q.

Both the isolated IKK complex from mammalian cells and the recombinant IKKs utilize all three isoforms of IκBs, α, β, and γ, as substrates equally well. However, there are differences in the kinetic data reported for the rhIKK homodimers. First, the K m for IκBα have varied in different publications, with the wide range of 1.4–23 μm being reported for rhIKK1 compared with more similar values of 0.5–1.3 μm being reported for rhIKK2. Second, most reports indicate that rhIKK2 phosphorylates truncated IκBs more efficiently than does rhIKK1 with thek cat (h−1) being three to four times greater for rhIKK2 compared with rhIKK1. In addition, the rhIKK2 (S177E, S181E) mutant has a dramatically enhanced kinase activity, being approximately 10-fold higher than rhIKK2 (12Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennet B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 2: 1526-1538Crossref Google Scholar). Third, kinetic analysis using rhIKK2 also indicates that, in the presence of NF-κB, the K m for IκBα is decreased from 2.2 to 1.4 μm and the V max is increased by a factor of four, indicating that rhIKK2 phosphorylates IκBα bound to NF-κB more efficiently than it phosphorylates free IκBα (16Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Although the physiological form described to be most abundant in mammalian cells is the IKK1/IKK2 heterodimer, its thorough kinetic characterization has not been described to date. In this paper we have characterized the heterodimer rhIKK1/rhIKK2 and compared its kinase activity to that of the rhIKK1 homodimer rhIKK2 and the mutant rhIKK2 (S177E, S181E) homodimer. Although all purified recombinant enzymes are capable of phosphorylating IκBα, the rhIKK1/rhIKK2 heterodimer exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency. This kinase activity is dependent on phosphorylation, because phosphatase treatment abolishes the ability of each rhIKK to phosphorylate IκBα. While characterizing the purified rhIKKs, we also found that both of the products of the kinase reaction, ADP and a phosphorylated IκBα peptide, exhibited inhibitory activity; however only ADP has aK i that may support a physiological role in the regulation the IKK activity. While performing these kinetic analysis of rhIKK isoforms, it was noted that, unlike the IKK activity in mammalian cells, which is not present unless stimulated by an agonist, the rhIKKs expressed in a baculovirus system are catalytically active upon their isolation. Because this signaling pathway is remarkably conserved during evolution, with IKK activity being described in Drosophila, oysters, andDictyostelium (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E. Annu. Rev.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3529-3535PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that recombinantly expressed hIKKs can be activated by phosphorylation via a homologous signaling pathway in the baculoviral system. In this paper we also demonstrate that an anti-NEMO antibody can immunoprecipitate rhIKKs from insect cell lysates infected with baculovirus containing only recombinantly expressed IKK proteins, strongly suggesting the presence of a functional NEMO homologue in the insect cells mediating the phosphorylation and activation of rhIKKs during expression.

The other reagents used were of the highest grade commercially available. cDNAs of human IKK1 and IKK2 were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from human placental RNA (CLONTECH). hIKK1 was subcloned into pFastBac HTa (Life Technologies) and expressed as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. The hIKK2 cDNA was amplified using a reverse oligonucleotide primer that incorporated the peptide sequence for a FLAG-epitope tag at the C terminus of the IKK2 coding region (DYKDDDDKD). The hIKK2:FLAG cDNA was subcloned into the baculovirus vector pFastBac. The rhIKK2 (S177S, E177E) mutant was constructed in the same vector used for wild type rhIKK2 using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Viral stocks of each construct were used to infect insect cells grown in suspension culture. The cells were lysed at a time that maximal expression and rhIKK activity were demonstrated. Cell lysates were stored at −80 °C until purification of the recombinant proteins was undertaken as described below. All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Buffers used were: buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmNaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 500 μmsodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1× Complete protease inhibitors), buffer B (same as buffer A, except 150 mmNaCl), and buffer C (same as buffer A, except 500 mmNaCl).

The cells were microfluidized and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was collected, imidazole was added to the final concentration of 10 mm, and the mixture was incubated with 25 ml of Ni-NTA resin for 2 h. The suspension was poured into a 25-ml column and washed with 250 ml of buffer C and then with 125 ml of 50 mm imidazole in buffer C. The rhIKK1 homodimer was eluted using 300 mm imidazole in buffer C. BSA and Nonidet P-40 were added to the enzyme fractions to the final concentration of 0.1%. The enzyme was dialyzed against buffer B, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. A 10-liter culture of baculovirus-expressing IKK2 tagged with FLAG peptide was centrifuged, and the resultant cell pellet (m.o.i. = 0.1; I = 72 h) was resuspended in buffer A. These cells were microfluidized and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min. Supernatant was passed over a G-25 column equilibrated with Buffer A. The protein peak was collected and incubated with anti-FLAG affinity resin on a rotator overnight in buffer B. The resin was washed in batch with 10–15 bed volumes of buffer C. Washed resin was poured into a column, and rhIKK2 homodimer was eluted using 5 bed volumes of buffer B containing FLAG peptide. A mixture, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and BSA, (concentrated to 0.1% in the final amount) was added to the eluted enzyme before concentrating in an Amicon membrane with a molecular mass cut-off of 30 kDa. Enzyme was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. rhIKK2 (S177E, S181E) homodimer mutant tagged with FLAG was isolated following the same method as described above for its wild type. The heterodimer enzyme was produced by coinfection in a baculovirus system (FLAG IKK2/IKK1 His; m.o.i. = 0.1 and I = 72 h). Infected cells were centrifuged, and the resultant cell pellet (10.0 g) was suspended in 50 ml of buffer A. The protein suspension was microfluidized and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mm. The protein was allowed to bind 25 ml of Ni-NTA resin by mixing for 2 h. The protein-resin slurry was poured into a 25-ml column and washed with 250 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole followed by 125 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. Buffer A, containing 300 mm imidazole, was then used to elute the protein. A 75-ml pool was collected, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. The protein solution was then dialyzed against buffer B. The dialyzed heterodimer enzyme was then allowed to bind to 25 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel overnight with constant mixing. The protein-resin slurry was then centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was collected, and the resin was resuspended in 100 ml of buffer C containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The resin was washed with 375 ml of buffer C containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The protein/resin mixture was poured into a 25-ml column, and the enzyme was eluted using buffer B containing FLAG peptide. Enzyme fractions (100 ml) were collected and concentrated to 20 ml using an Amicon membrane with a molecular mass cut-off of 30 kDa. Bovine serum albumin was added to the concentrated enzyme to final concentration of 0.1%. The enzyme was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The wild type (wt) human pre-B cell line, 70Z/3, and its mutant, 1.3E2, were generously provided by Dr. Carol Sibley. The wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7% defined bovine serum (Hyclone) and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, obtained from the ATCC, were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% defined bovine serum, 10 mmHEPES, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol. For experiments, cells were plated in 6-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml in fresh media. Pre-B cells were stimulated by the addition of 10 μg/ml LPS for varying lengths of time ranging from 0 to 4 h. THP-1 cells were stimulated by the addition of 1 μg/ml LPS for 45 min. Cells were pelleted, washed with cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl, and lysed at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF,"

Thus, the process of mRNA export commences long before the RNA actually reaches the nuclear membrane.Pre-mRNAs and snRNAs1 are first modified co-transcriptionally at the 5′-end by a monomethyl cap after reaching a length of 20–30 nucleotides (5Salditt-Georgieff M. Harpold M. Chen-Kiang S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1980; 19: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This modification consists of a guanosine residue methylated at the N-7 position joined to the first encoded nucleotide of the RNA via a triphosphate linkage. The cap structure appears to be important for efficient splicing and export of RNAs (reviewed in Ref. 2Lewis J.D. Izaurralde E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Evidence has suggested that the effects of the cap structure on RNA metabolism are protein-mediated (7Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 109-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A cap binding activity was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and was found to consist of two proteins termed cap-binding protein 80 (Cbp80p) and cap-binding protein 20 (Cbp20p) (8Ohno M. Kataoka N. Shimura Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6989-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Izaurralde E. Stepinski J. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Neither Cbp80p nor Cbp20p has been found to bind capped RNA alone, suggesting that a complex of the two proteins is required for binding of a cap (10Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This complex is referred to as the cap-binding complex (CBC). Homologues of both CBC proteins have been identified in all eukaryotes examined thus far (e.g.see Refs. 10Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 11Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W.

Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Although the 5′ cap structure is not required for successful export, it has been shown to enhance the rate of mRNA export from the nucleus (7Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 109-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Jarmolowski A. Boelens W.C. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Studies of the Balbiani ring pre-mRNP particle in the insectChironomus tentans show that Cbp20p binds the pre-mRNA nascent transcript and remains bound to the pre-mRNA throughout splicing and as the mRNA is translocating through the nuclear pore complex (13Visa N. Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because the 5′-end is in the lead as the mRNA exits the nucleus, these data raised the possibility that the CBC mediates the effect of the cap on mRNA export.In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,CBP80 has been isolated through both genetic and biochemical approaches (15Uemura H. Jigami Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5526-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Gorlich D. Kraft R. Kostka S. Vogel F. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Mattaj I.W. Izaurralde E. Cell. 1996; 87: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CBP80 is not an essential gene (15Uemura H. Jigami Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5526-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, deletion of the gene results in a severe growth defect. YeastCBP20 was originally identified as MUD13, a gene that when mutated causes synthetic lethality in combination with a mutant form of U1 snRNA (12Colot H. Stutz F. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1699-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Like CBP80, CBP20is not an essential gene in yeast. A strain carrying null alleles of both CBP80 and CBP20 is also viable (17Fortes P. Kufel J. Fornerod M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Lafontaine D. Tollervey D. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6543-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).From the time that they leave the transcription complex, pre-mRNAs are also associated with proteins in complexes referred to as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs) (for a review, see Ref. 18Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The hnRNP proteins are among the most abundant proteins found in the nucleus (19Kiledjian M. Burd C.G. Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. Nagai K. Mattaj I.W. RNA-Protein Interactions: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 127-149Google Scholar) and are proposed to function in nearly every maturation step of mRNA including splicing, polyadenylation, and export (for reviews, see Refs. 20Pinol-Roma S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 21Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). One of the most studied hnRNPs in mammalian cells is hnRNPA1, which belongs to the class of hnRNP proteins that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (22Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Along with other hnRNPs in its class, hnRNPA1 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine-rich region at the carboxyl terminus (23Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Because hnRNPA1 is bound to poly(A)+ RNA in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and is able to shuttle, it has been proposed to play a role in mRNA export (for a review, see Ref. 20Pinol-Roma S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Shuttling proteins like hnRNPA1 could be escorting the RNA to the cytoplasm, where other RNA-binding proteins take over.Several hnRNP proteins have been identified in S. cerevisiae, allowing for a genetic approach to the study of their functions. One of the most studied hnRNP proteins is Npl3p (24Bossie M.A. DeHoratius C. Barcelo G. Silver P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Russell I.D. Tollervey D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells bearing mutant npl3 alleles accumulate poly(A)+ RNA in their nuclei at the nonpermissive temperature, consistent with a block in mRNA export (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 25Russell I.D. Tollervey D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Singleton D.R. Chen S. Hitomi M. Kumagai C. Tartakoff A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 265-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Henry M. Borland C.Z. Bossie M. Silver P.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 103-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Npl3p shares structural features found in some mammalian hnRNPs such as hnRNPA1. These include two RRMs and a glycine-rich domain (RGG box) in the form of 15 RGG repeats (23Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Npl3p is methylated at arginine residues in this glycine-rich domain by the major arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p/Rmt1p, in yeast cells (28Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 30Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, Npl3p contains a domain characterized by a series of serine-arginine repeats that overlaps with the RGG box. This domain, referred to as the RS domain, is found in splicing factors known as SR proteins (for a review, see Ref. 31Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). Npl3p has been shown to cross-link to poly(A)+ RNA (32Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Paddy M.R. Swedlow J.R. Swanson M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Krebber H. Taura T. Lee M.S. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although localized in the nucleus at steady state, Npl3p has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 34Flach J. Bossie M. Vogel J. Corbett A. Jinks T. Willins D.A. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8399-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This ability to shuttle depends on the presence of RNA polymerase II activity such that in a strain carrying a mutation in RNA polymerase II, exit of Npl3p out of the nucleus is impaired (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of Npl3p to shuttle appears important for its function, because a strain carrying a mutation in an RRM that abolishes its ability to shuttle is temperature-sensitive (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These data have led to a model where Npl3p plays a role as a carrier of mRNA for export out of the nucleus.We have previously reported genetic interactions betweenNPL3 and HMT1 as well as between HMT1and CBP80 (28Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to explore the possible interaction between NPL3 and CBP80. We now report that CBP80 and CBP20 share a genetic relationship with NPL3. Furthermore, we show that Cbp80p and Cbp20p physically interact with Npl3p in vivo. Our results suggest that these RNA-binding proteins may work together to promote the export of mRNAs.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have demonstrated a genetic and biochemical interaction between one of the major yeast mRNA-binding proteins, Npl3p, and the proteins of the cap-binding complex. Mutations in NPL3 show allele-specific synthetic lethal relationships with both CBP80 and CBP20. Moreover, a complex containing Npl3p, Cbp80p, and Cbp20p can be isolated from yeast and is dependent on the presence of RNA.Deletion of either component of the cap-binding complex,CBP80 or CBP20, is dead when combined with certain temperature-sensitive npl3 mutations. Moreover, CBP80 and CBP20 show the same allele-specific synthetic lethality with the npl3 ts mutants, supporting the idea that Cbp80p and Cbp20p work as a complex with relation to Npl3p. Taken together, these genetic data support the idea that the CBC works with Npl3p to ensure proper RNA metabolism.The genetic interaction between the genes that encode the CBC and NPL3 is further supported by our finding that a complex containing both the CBC and Npl3p can be isolated from yeast. This complex requires Cbp20p because binding of Cbp80p to Npl3p is not detected in a strain lacking CBP20. It is possible that Cbp80p interacts with Npl3p only after Cbp20p binds the capped RNA. However, it appears that neither Cbp80p nor Cbp20p is able to bind capped RNA alone (10Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Perhaps the interaction between the CBC and Npl3p can take place only after the CBC has bound the capped RNA. We could not determine if Cbp80p is necessary for the binding of Cbp20p to Npl3p, because expression of Cbp20p is barely detectable in a strain lacking CBP80 (17Fortes P. Kufel J. Fornerod M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Lafontaine D. Tollervey D. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6543-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).2 We have found that the interaction between the CBC and Npl3p is sensitive to RNase treatment, supporting the idea that capped RNA may also need to be present for the interaction. A direct interaction between the CBC and Npl3p has not yet been found.In addition to binding the cap structure of mRNAs, the cap-binding complex is also known to bind the cap structure of snRNAs. Interestingly, Npl3p has also been associated with snRNAs in that it has been found as a potential component of the yeast U1 snRNP (42Gottschalk A. Tang J. Puig O. Salgado G. Neubauer H.V. Colot M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Luhrmann R. Fabrizio P. RNA. 1998; 4: 374-393PubMed Google Scholar). In the same study, it was shown that the association of Npl3p with the U1 snRNP is weak, salt-sensitive, and only moderately specific. Similarly, Mattaj and colleagues (43Fortes P. Bilbao-Cortes D. Fornerod M. Rigaut G. Raymond W. Seraphin B. Mattaj I.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2425-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have found that Npl3p and Cbp80p can be co-immunoprecipitated with the U1 snRNP protein Luc7. These interactions with Luc7 have also been shown to be weak and easily dissociated. However, the formal possibility still exists that interaction between the CBC and Npl3p exists in the context of snRNAs and not mRNAs.We found that, like Npl3p and other mRNA-binding proteins, Cbp80p shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This is consistent with the observation that Cbp20p is bound to the Balbiani ring RNP as it traverses across the nuclear pore (13Visa N. Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We also report that, like Npl3p, export of Cbp80p depends on ongoing mRNA synthesis. This result suggests that Cbp80p may need to be bound to mRNA in order to be exported. It has been previously shown that Cbp20p binds to nascent transcripts before they are released from the chromosome (13Visa N. Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because of the interdependence shown between CBP20 and CBP80, Cbp80p is also most likely bound at this time. Capping itself has been shown to occur co-transcriptionally (5Salditt-Georgieff M. Harpold M. Chen-Kiang S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1980; 19: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This occurs through direct interactions between the capping machinery and the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (44McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 45Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Perhaps Cbp80p export depends on RNA polymerase II because binding of the CBC to capped RNA is also occurring co-transcriptionally.Taken together, we propose that these data lend further support to a model where mRNAs are packaged co-transcriptionally by proteins such as Npl3p and Cbp80/20p. It is possible that the binding of the CBC to the cap structure of mRNAs as they are being synthesized promotes the binding of other mRNA-binding proteins such as Npl3p (Fig. 6). These and other proteins then leave the nucleus together with the mRNA and are released in the cytoplasm, where they rapidly return to the nucleus for another round of packaging and export. While in the nucleus, mRNA precursors, referred to as pre-mRNAs or heterogeneous nuclear RNAs undergo a series of processing events before entering the cytoplasm. These maturation events include co-transcriptional capping at the 5′-end, splicing, and cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3′-end. The proper execution of these steps affects the export of mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 2Lewis J.D. Izaurralde E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Stutz F.

Thus, the process of mRNA export commences long before the RNA actually reaches the nuclear membrane. Pre-mRNAs and snRNAs1 are first modified co-transcriptionally at the 5′-end by a monomethyl cap after reaching a length of 20–30 nucleotides (5Salditt-Georgieff M. Harpold M. Chen-Kiang S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1980; 19: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the most studied hnRNP proteins is Npl3p (24Bossie M.A. DeHoratius C. Barcelo G. Silver P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Russell I.D. Tollervey D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells bearing mutant npl3 alleles accumulate poly(A)+ RNA in their nuclei at the nonpermissive temperature, consistent with a block in mRNA export (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 25Russell I.D. Tollervey D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Singleton D.R.

Genetics. 1996; 142: 103-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Npl3p shares structural features found in some mammalian hnRNPs such as hnRNPA1. These include two RRMs and a glycine-rich domain (RGG box) in the form of 15 RGG repeats (23Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Npl3p is methylated at arginine residues in this glycine-rich domain by the major arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p/Rmt1p, in yeast cells (28Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, Npl3p contains a domain characterized by a series of serine-arginine repeats that overlaps with the RGG box. This domain, referred to as the RS domain, is found in splicing factors known as SR proteins (for a review, see Ref. 31Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). Npl3p has been shown to cross-link to poly(A)+ RNA (32Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Paddy M.R. Swedlow J.R. Swanson M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Krebber H. Taura T. Lee M.S. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although localized in the nucleus at steady state, Npl3p has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 34Flach J. Bossie M. Vogel J. Corbett A. Jinks T. Willins D.A. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8399-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This ability to shuttle depends on the presence of RNA polymerase II activity such that in a strain carrying a mutation in RNA polymerase II, exit of Npl3p out of the nucleus is impaired (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of Npl3p to shuttle appears important for its function, because a strain carrying a mutation in an RRM that abolishes its ability to shuttle is temperature-sensitive (1Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These data have led to a model where Npl3p plays a role as a carrier of mRNA for export out of the nucleus. We have previously reported genetic interactions betweenNPL3 and HMT1 as well as between HMT1and CBP80 (28Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to explore the possible interaction between NPL3 and CBP80. We now report that CBP80 and CBP20 share a genetic relationship with NPL3. Furthermore, we show that Cbp80p and Cbp20p physically interact with Npl3p in vivo. Our results suggest that these RNA-binding proteins may work together to promote the export of mRNAs. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have demonstrated a genetic and biochemical interaction between one of the major yeast mRNA-binding proteins, Npl3p, and the proteins of the cap-binding complex. Mutations in NPL3 show allele-specific synthetic lethal relationships with both CBP80 and CBP20. Moreover, a complex containing Npl3p, Cbp80p, and Cbp20p can be isolated from yeast and is dependent on the presence of RNA.Deletion of either component of the cap-binding complex,CBP80 or CBP20, is dead when combined with certain temperature-sensitive npl3 mutations. Moreover, CBP80 and CBP20 show the same allele-specific synthetic lethality with the npl3 ts mutants, supporting the idea that Cbp80p and Cbp20p work as a complex with relation to Npl3p. Taken together, these genetic data support the idea that the CBC works with Npl3p to ensure proper RNA metabolism.The genetic interaction between the genes that encode the CBC and NPL3 is further supported by our finding that a complex containing both the CBC and Npl3p can be isolated from yeast. This complex requires Cbp20p because binding of Cbp80p to Npl3p is not detected in a strain lacking CBP20. It is possible that Cbp80p interacts with Npl3p only after Cbp20p binds the capped RNA. However, it appears that neither Cbp80p nor Cbp20p is able to bind capped RNA alone (10Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Perhaps the interaction between the CBC and Npl3p can take place only after the CBC has bound the capped RNA. We could not determine if Cbp80p is necessary for the binding of Cbp20p to Npl3p, because expression of Cbp20p is barely detectable in a strain lacking CBP80 (17Fortes P. Kufel J. Fornerod M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Lafontaine D. Tollervey D. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6543-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).2 We have found that the interaction between the CBC and Npl3p is sensitive to RNase treatment, supporting the idea that capped RNA may also need to be present for the interaction. A direct interaction between the CBC and Npl3p has not yet been found.In addition to binding the cap structure of mRNAs, the cap-binding complex is also known to bind the cap structure of snRNAs. Interestingly, Npl3p has also been associated with snRNAs in that it has been found as a potential component of the yeast U1 snRNP (42Gottschalk A. Tang J. Puig O. Salgado G. Neubauer H.V. Colot M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Luhrmann R. Fabrizio P. RNA. 1998; 4: 374-393PubMed Google Scholar). In the same study, it was shown that the association of Npl3p with the U1 snRNP is weak, salt-sensitive, and only moderately specific. Similarly, Mattaj and colleagues (43Fortes P. Bilbao-Cortes D. Fornerod M. Rigaut G. Raymond W. Seraphin B. Mattaj I.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2425-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have found that Npl3p and Cbp80p can be co-immunoprecipitated with the U1 snRNP protein Luc7. These interactions with Luc7 have also been shown to be weak and easily dissociated. However, the formal possibility still exists that interaction between the CBC and Npl3p exists in the context of snRNAs and not mRNAs.We found that, like Npl3p and other mRNA-binding proteins, Cbp80p shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This is consistent with the observation that Cbp20p is bound to the Balbiani ring RNP as it traverses across the nuclear pore (13Visa N. Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We also report that, like Npl3p, export of Cbp80p depends on ongoing mRNA synthesis. This result suggests that Cbp80p may need to be bound to mRNA in order to be exported. It has been previously shown that Cbp20p binds to nascent transcripts before they are released from the chromosome (13Visa N. Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because of the interdependence shown between CBP20 and CBP80, Cbp80p is also most likely bound at this time. Capping itself has been shown to occur co-transcriptionally (5Salditt-Georgieff M. Harpold M. Chen-Kiang S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1980; 19: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This occurs through direct interactions between the capping machinery and the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (44McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 45Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Perhaps Cbp80p export depends on RNA polymerase II because binding of the CBC to capped RNA is also occurring co-transcriptionally.Taken together, we propose that these data lend further support to a model where mRNAs are packaged co-transcriptionally by proteins such as Npl3p and Cbp80/20p. It is possible that the binding of the CBC to the cap structure of mRNAs as they are being synthesized promotes the binding of other mRNA-binding proteins such as Npl3p (Fig. 6). These and other proteins then leave the nucleus together with the mRNA and are released in the cytoplasm, where they rapidly return to the nucleus for another round of packaging and export. In this report, we have demonstrated a genetic and biochemical interaction between one of the major yeast mRNA-binding proteins, Npl3p, and the proteins of the cap-binding complex.

https://openalex.org/W2332129083,"c-myc protooncogene positively regulates cell proliferation and overexpression of c-myc is found in many solid tumors and leukemias. In the present study we used the K562 human myeloid leukemia cell line as a model to study the functional interaction between c-Myc and p53. Using two different methods, we generated K562 transfectant cell lines with conditional expression of either c-Myc or p53. The cells expressed the p53Vall35 mutant, which adopts a wild-type conformation at 32 degrees C, while c-Myc induction was achieved with a zinc-inducible expression vector. We found that p53 in wild-type conformation induces growth arrest and apoptosis of K562. Expression of c-Myc significantly attenuated apoptosis and impaired the transcriptional activity of p53 on p21WAF1, Bax and cytomegalovirus promoters. The impairment of p21WAF1 transactivation by c-Myc was confirmed by transfection of a c-Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein and by induction of c-myc by zinc in transfected cells. Also, p53-mediated up-regulation of p21WAF1 mRNA protein were significantly reduced by c-Myc, while Bax levels were unaffected. Consistently, c-Myc increased cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity in K562 cells expressing p53 in wild-type conformation. These results suggest that c-Myc overexpression may antagonize the pro-apoptotic function of p53, thus providing a molecular mechanism for the frequently observed deregulation of c-myc in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2077847217,"Rb-deficient embryos (Rb−/−) show abnormal degeneration of neurons and die at mid-gestation, suggesting that RB may protect against apoptosis. Having previously shown that cyclin D1 accumulates during K+-induced apoptosis of granule neurons, we chose to investigate the role of RB under these conditions. We show that RB is cleaved in its C-terminus during the onset of neuronal apoptosis. Caspase 3-like activity increases following K+ deprivation and the time course correlates with RB cleavage and apoptosis. Although the use of a specific caspase 3-like inhibitor (z-DEBD.fmk) delays RB cleavage and reduces DNA fragmentation, data implicate other caspases in these processes. However, K+ deprivation induces a gradual production of the active p20 subunit of caspase 3 (CPP32) that coincides with RB disappearance at the cellular level. Nuclear detection of a transfected HA-tagged caspase cleavage-resistant RB mutant (DEAG/D to DEAA/D) revealed a significant decrease in apoptosis of neurons expressing the RB mutant (less than 5%) relative to the wild type form of RB (40%) during K+ deprivation. Taken together, these data show that caspase-dependent cleavage of RB is an early permissive step of the apoptosis-inducing signaling pathway in neurons. They indicate a major role of RB in neuronal protection."
https://openalex.org/W1650521528,"Temporal and spatial regulation of actin-based cytoskeletal organization and focal adhesion formation play an essential role in cell migration. Here, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of a focal adhesion protein, paxillin, crucially participates in these regulations. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was a prominent event upon integrin activation during epithelial-mesenchymal trans-differentiation and cell migration. Four major tyrosine phosphorylation sites were identified, and two of them were highly inducible upon integrin activation. Paxillin exhibits three distinct subcellular localizations as follows: localization along the cell periphery colocalized with circumferential actin meshworks, macroaggregation at focal adhesions connected to actin stress fibers, and diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin localized at the cell periphery and focal adhesions was shown using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. Mutations in the phosphorylation sites affected the peripheral localization of paxillin and paxillin-containing focal adhesion formation during cell migration and cell-cell collision, accompanied by altered actin organizations. Our analysis indicates that phosphorylation of multiple tyrosines in paxillin alpha is necessary for the proper function of paxillin and is involved in the temporospatial regulation of focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeletal organization in motile cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058303120,"Transient HTLV-1 Tax expression suppresses cellular nucleotide excision repair, and this effect correlates with Tax transactivation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter. The inability to repair DNA damage typically induces apoptotic cell death. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Tax-mediated suppression of DNA repair on apoptosis in stable Tax-expressing cells. Constitutive Tax expression reduced cellular nucleotide excision repair activity compared with parental and control cells. Tax-expressing cells were also more sensitive to apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents than control cells. Even though Tax-expressing cells displayed reduced DNA repair, they showed increased DNA replication following UV damage. These results suggest that Tax suppresses the cell's ability to repair DNA damage and stimulates DNA replication even in the presence of damage. The inability to repair DNA damage is likely to stimulate apoptotic cell death in the majority of Tax-expressing cells while the ability to promote DNA replication may also allow the survival of a small population of cells. We propose that together these effects contribute to the monoclonal nature and low efficiency of HTLV-1 transformation."

However, the structural elements that provide the gelatinases with this unique proteolytic activity among matrix metalloproteinases had not been thoroughly defined. To identify these elements, we examined the substrate specificity of chimeric enzymes containing domains of gelatinase B and fibroblast collagenase. We have found that the addition of the fibronectin-like domain of gelatinase B to fibroblast collagenase is sufficient to endow the enzyme with the ability to cleave type V collagen. In addition, the substitution of the catalytic zinc-binding active site region of fibroblast collagenase with that of gelatinase B increased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme 3- to 4-fold. This observation led to the identification of amino acid residues, Leu397, Ala406, Asp410, and Pro415, in this region of gelatinase B that are important for its efficient catalysis as determined by substituting these amino acids with the corresponding residues from fibroblast collagenase.

The gelatinases, A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9), digest denatured collagen (gelatin) with relatively high efficiency and cleave fibrillar collagens V and XI, among other proteins. Lastly, membrane-type MMPs (MMPs 14–17) are known for their ability to activate gelatinase A at the cell surface, which may be an important step for inducing tumor cell invasion (17Sato H. Takino T.

The morbidity and mortality of cancer is directly related to the ability of tumor cells to metastasize. There is evidence that tumor cell invasion is facilitated by the actions of degradative enzymes, particularly the gelatinases, that are capable of digesting the components of the basement membrane and stromal matrix barriers (reviewed in Ref. 18Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Type V collagen maintains the integrity of the extracellular matrix by acting as a molecular anchor, linking the basement membrane to the stromal matrix (19Modesti A. Kalebic T. Scarpa S. Togo S. Grotendorst G. Liotta L.A. Triche T.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 35: 246-255PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the degradation of this molecule by the gelatinases is an important step in tumor cell invasion. Undoubtedly, studying the mechanism by which these enzymes interact with and degrade type V collagen will increase our understanding of metastasis and perhaps lead to strategies to inhibit this lethal pathological process. It is known that the ability of MMPs to recognize particular substrates depends on the presence of certain domains and particular amino acids within the enzyme structure. Almost every MMP possesses three common domains: an amino-terminal pro-domain that is partially or completely removed during the processing and activation of the enzyme, a catalytic domain that contains the catalytic zinc-binding active site region (AS), and a carboxyl-terminal domain that consists of a proline-rich hinge region followed by four hemopexin-like repeats. The ability of the collagenases to bind and cleave type I collagen, but not casein or gelatin, is dependent on the presence of their carboxyl-terminal domains (20Schnierer S. Kleine T. Gote T.

The gelatinases are the only MMPs that contain three contiguous fibronectin type II homology units, collectively known as the fibronectin-like domain (Fib), that are inserted into their catalytic domains. Several reports have indicated that this domain plays a role in the various proteolytic activities of these enzymes. It has been shown that the presence of this domain greatly increases their gelatinolytic and elastinolytic activities (26Shipley J.M. Doyle G.A.R. Fliszar C.J. Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.J. Shapiro S.D. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4335-4341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,28Murphy G. Nguyen Q. Cockett M.I. Atkinson S.J. Allan J.A. Knight C.G.

Biophys. 1998; 354: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that the presence of the fibronectin-like domain in gelatinase B is critical for its ability to bind and digest collagen types V and XI but not a small peptide substrate (29O'Farrell T.J. Pourmotabbed T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether the addition of this domain to an MMP is sufficient to confer type V collagenolytic activity. In fact, there are MMPs, such as the collagenases and the stromelysins, that can bind collagen via their carboxyl-terminal domains (22Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Connell J.P. Docherty A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but are unable to cleave type V collagen (30Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Bretz U. Baggiolini M. Biochem.

Ogata Y. Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that determinants of type V collagenolytic activity may also be located in other domains of the gelatinases. In this report, we have achieved a definitive understanding of the structural elements that are required for type V collagenolytic activity by studying the substrate specificity of chimeric enzymes containing domains of gelatinase B and fibroblast collagenase (FC). We were able, for the first time, to demonstrate that the insertion of the fibronectin-like domain into the catalytic domain of an MMP (FC) is sufficient to endow the enzyme with the ability to cleave type V collagen. In addition, we were able to identify amino acid residues in the AS of gelatinase B (Gel.B/AS) that dictate and differentiate its type V collagenolytic, gelatinolytic, and peptidolytic activities. The full-length FC cDNA was cloned into the pET12C (Novagen) expression vector via engineered BamHI and NheI sites to produce pET/FC. The pET/FC+Fib expression vector was designed to produce FC with the fibronectin-like domain of gelatinase B (amino acids 216–394) inserted into its catalytic domain (see Fig. 1). This vector was created by amplifying the region of the gelatinase B cDNA encoding the fibronectin-like domain by anchor PCR using pNG 4.1 (34Pourmotabbed T. Solomon T.L. Hasty K.A. Mainardi C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as a template. The 5′ primer, 5′-GGGGATGCTCATTTTGATGAACATGAAAGGTGGACCAACAATTTCACAGAGTACAA CGTCGTGGTTCCAACTCGG-3′, contained nucleotides (shown in bold) complementary to the 5′ end of the region of the gelatinase B cDNA encoding the fibronectin-like domain (amino acids 216–221). The 5′ portion of the primer contained a MslI site and encoded amino acids 193–211 of the catalytic domain of FC. The 3′ primer, 5′-GGAGAGTCCAAGAGAATGGCCGAGCTCATGCGCCGCCACGCGGAA-3′, contained nucleotides (shown in bold) complementary to the 5′ end of the region of the gelatinase B cDNA encoding the AS (amino acids 396–402). Amino acids 215–219 of FC are identical to residues 398–402 in gelatinase B. The underlined nucleic acid represents a substitution to replace Leu397 in gelatinase B with the corresponding Arg214 in FC. The 5′ portion of the primer contained a BstXI site and encoded amino acids 220–227 of the FC AS. The 0.6-kb PCR product was digested with BstXI and MslI and ligated with 5-kbSalI/BstXI and 0.6-kbMslI/SalI fragments from pET/FC to produce the final expression vector. The pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS expression vector was designed to produce the pET/FC+Fib chimera with the additional substitution of the AS of FC (amino acids 212–254) for the Gel.B/AS (amino acids 395–437) (see Fig. 1). This vector was constructed by amplifying the region of the gelatinase B cDNA in pNG 4.1 encoding the fibronectin-like domain and AS (amino acids 216–437) using anchor PCR. The same 5′ primer used for the construction of pET/FC+Fib was used in this reaction. The 3′ primer, 5′-TTGGGAACGTCCATATATGGCTTGGATGCCATTCACGTCGTCCTT-3′, contained nucleotides (shown in bold) complementary to the 3′ end of the region of the gelatinase B cDNA encoding the AS (amino acids 433–437). The 5′ portion of the primer encoded FC amino acids 255–264 of the hinge region and contained a XcmI site. The resulting 0.7-kb PCR product was digested with MslI andXcmI and ligated with 0.6-kb MslI/SalI and 4.9-kb XcmI/SalI fragments from pET/FC to produce the final expression vector. The pET/FC+Gel.B/AS expression vector was designed to produce FC with its AS substituted with the Gel.B/AS (see Fig. 1). This vector was created by using anchor PCR with pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS as the template. The 5′ primer, 5′-CGTCGACGGGATCCCACAGCTTT-3′, bound 5′ to aSalI site in the extreme 5′ end of the cDNA. The 3′ primer, 5′-CGCCGCCACGAGGAACAAGTTGTACTCTGTGAAATTGTTG-3′, contained nucleotides (shown in bold) complementary to the region of the FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS cDNA encoding FC amino acids 205–211 of the catalytic domain, which is immediately 5′ to the region encoding the fibronectin-like domain. The 5′ portion of the primer was complementary to the 5′ end of the region encoding the Gel.B/AS (amino acids 395–400) that contained a BssSI site. This 0.7-kb PCR product was digested with BssSI and SalI and ligated to 0.8-kb BssSI/DraIII and 4.5-kbSalI/DraIII fragments produced from pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS. This effectively deleted the region of the cDNA encoding the fibronectin-like domain from pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS to produce pET/FC+Gel.B/AS. The pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS-COOH expression vector was designed to produce the FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS chimera without the carboxyl-terminal domain of FC (see Fig. 1). This construct was produced from the pET28/Δ3′NG expression vector. pET28/Δ3′NG contains the gelatinase B cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1–444 inserted into pET28C (Novagen). An engineered stop codon immediately following the codon for Gly444 enables this vector to produce a carboxyl-terminal truncated form of gelatinase B. A 5.5-kbXbaI/SacII fragment was produced from pET28/Δ3′NG that contained nucleotides encoding a portion of the fibronectin-like domain and the Gel.B/AS. This fragment was ligated with a 1.2-kb NdeI/SacII fragment from pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS encoding the remaining portion of the fibronectin-like domain from gelatinase B and the catalytic and pro-domains of FC to produce pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS-COOH. All of the PCR-derived DNA for these constructs was found to be free of mutations by dideoxy sequencing. The plasmids encoding the chimeric enzymes were transformed either into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) or BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. With the exception of cells transformed with pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS-COOH, BL21(DE3)-transformed cells were maintained in 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, whereas BL21(DE3)pLysS-transformed cells were maintained in 50 μg/ml carbenicillin plus 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The pET/FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS-COOH vector was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells that were maintained in 30 μg/ml kanamycin. PCR was used to create the L397R, A406S, D410S, and P415I point mutations in the gelatinase B cDNA. The following mutagenic primers were used (substituted nucleotides underlined): L397R, 5′-GGATACAGTTTGTTCCGCGTG-3′; A406S, 5′-TTGTTCCTCGTGGCGGCGCATGAGTTCGGCCACTCGCTGG-3′; D410S, 5′-GTTCGGCCACGCGCTGGGCTTATCTCATTCC-3′; P415I, 5′-CATGAGCGCTTCAATCACTGAGGAATG-3′. The expected mutations were confirmed and all PCR-derived DNA was found to be free of secondary mutations by dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids encoding the mutant enzymes were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells that were maintained in 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Transformed cells were grown to mid-log phase and induced with the addition of 100–120 mg/liter isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were then allowed to grow 4–19 h before being pelleted at 6,370 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellets were stored at −20 °C for further purification. Latent gelatinase B, point mutants, FC+Fib, FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS, and FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS-COOH were purified using a gelatin-agarose affinity column essentially as described previously (34Pourmotabbed T. Solomon T.L. Hasty K.A. Mainardi C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Activated FC and FC+Gel.B/AS were purified by a zinc-chelating column. FC containing bacterial pellets was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5m NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Brij-30, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting suspension was then sonicated three times, 30 s each time, at 30% duty cycle and centrifuged at > 20,000 × g for 30 min. To activate the enzymes, p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 4–5 h at 37 °C. During the incubation period, precipitant formed that was removed by centrifugation at > 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then dialyzed against buffer containing 25 mm Na2B4O7 (Borax), pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (dialysis buffer) and then loaded onto a 5-ml iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been charged with 50 mm ZnCl2 and equilibrated with dialysis buffer. The column was then washed with dialysis buffer until the A 280 of the effluent was approximately zero. The protein was then eluted with a 10–33 mm gradient of imidazole in dialysis buffer. Selected fractions were combined and concentrated. FC+Gel.B/AS was purified in essentially the same manner except that the dialysis buffer contained 0.5 m NaCl and that a 10–40 mm imidazole gradient was used to elute the enzyme. All of the purified enzymes were finally dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 μm ZnCl2 and stored at −80 °C for further use. Gelatinase B and point mutants were activated either by 1 mm APMA for 12–15 h at 37 °C or by 16 units/μl stromelysin-1 for 2 h at 37 °C. One unit of stromelysin-1 degrades 1 nm/s of (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl) acetyl (Mca)-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-(3-(2′, 4′-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl](Dpa)-Ala-Arg-NH2(Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA) at 23 °C. Pro-stromelysin-1 was activated by incubation at 52 °C for 1 h. Stromelysin-1, at concentrations used in the enzyme assays, had no proteolytic activity toward any of the substrates. FC+Fib, FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS, and FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS-COOH were activated by 1 mm APMA for 1 h at 37 °C. Prior to the loading of samples, 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels were electrophoresed for 20 min. The buffer in the upper reservoir contained either 1 mm glutathione or mercaptoacetic acid. When glutathione was used, the upper buffer was removed and replaced with buffer containing no glutathione prior to the loading of samples. Samples were heated for 15 min at 60 °C under reducing conditions before loading onto the gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 80 min at 120 mA in 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 11, and 10% (v/v) methanol. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and sequenced at Midwest Analytical Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Enzymes were mixed with Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH2 in assay buffer that was composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 μmZnCl2. The concentrations of Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH2 used fulfilled the condition ofK m ≫ [S]. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence intensity (λex 328 nm, λem 393 nm) as a function of time using an Aminco Bowman luminescence spectrophotometer (SLM Aminco, Inc., Urbana, IL) at 23 °C. Assays were performed in duplicate, and the results were averaged. Thek cat/K m values were calculated from the following equation:k cat/K m ≅ v0/[E]T[S]. Concentrations of active enzymes, [E]T, were found by active-site titration with the amino-terminal, 14-kDa, inhibitory domain of recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (a kind gift from Dr. Harold Tschesche, Lerstuhl für Biochemie, Universitat Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany) as described previously (29O'Farrell T.J. Pourmotabbed T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This method was used to determine the concentration of enzyme used in every assay in this study. Concentrations of active enzymes found by titration correlated with those determined by the Bradford dye-binding technique (standard Bio-Rad assay) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The gelatinolytic activity of enzymes was determined using 14C-labeled gelatin essentially as described previously (35Harris Jr., E.D. Krane S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The specific activity was calculated by dividing the amount of gelatin degraded per hour (mg or μg) by the nanomoles of enzyme used in the reaction. Each assay was conducted in duplicate, and the results were averaged. Various concentrations of enzymes were added to reaction mixtures containing 0.1 μg/μl pepsin-solubilized human placental type V collagen (a kind gift from Dr. Jerome Seyer, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Norfolk, VA) and 0.8 μg/μl bovine serum albumin in assay buffer that consisted of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 μm ZnCl2. A control reaction was also conducted that contained no enzymes. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 18 h at 30 °C before being quenched by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The specific activities were determined by preparing reaction mixtures as described above and incubating them for 2 h at 30 °C. Reactions were performed in duplicate, and a control reaction was also conducted that contained no enzymes. All reaction mixtures were then boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed on 6% SDS-PAGE gels under nonreducing conditions. The amount of collagen degraded was determined by subtracting the integrated intensities of the remaining intact collagen chains after incubation with enzyme from that of the control reaction. The integrated intensities of the protein bands were determined using an Alpha Imager 2000 documentation and analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Specific activities were calculated by dividing the amount of collagen cleaved (ng) in 2 h by the picomoles of enzyme used in the reaction. The relationship between the concentration of enzyme and the amount of collagen degraded was linear at the enzyme levels used. Amino acid substitutions in the crystal structure of neutrophil collagenase (NC) (36Stams T. Spurlino J.C. Smith D.L. Wahl R.C. Ho T.F. Qoronfleh M.W. Banks T.M. Rubin B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) were made using Insight II software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). Substitutions were made, and the energy of the resulting structure was minimized by the Biopolymer and Discover modules, respectively. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the gelatinases is their ability to cleave type V collagen. Our previous experiments indicated that the type V collagenolytic activity of gelatinase B is determined, at least in part, by its fibronectin-like domain (29O'Farrell T.J. Pourmotabbed T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To assess whether the fibronectin-like domain and the Gel.B/AS are sufficient to provide an MMP with type V collagenolytic activity, the proteolytic properties of an FC molecule containing these motifs were examined. The chimera, FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS, consisted of full-length FC with its AS (amino acids 212–254, Fib) replaced by the Gel.B/AS (amino acids 395–437, Fib) and the fibronectin-like domain of gelatinase B (amino acids 216–394, Fib) inserted into its catalytic domain as it is in the gelatinases (Fig.1). The chimeric enzyme, latent gelatinase B, and latent FC were expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild type FC was activated during the purification procedure by APMA and recovered as a 42-kDa species (Fig.2, lane 1) as expected (37Windsor L.J. Bodden M.K. Birkedal-Hansen B. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26201-26207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS (Fig. 2, lane 5) was recovered as a latent enzyme of 68 kDa, which is consistent with the addition of the fibronectin-like domain to the FC molecule. This enzyme was processed by APMA to an active 62-kDa species (Fig. 2, lane 6). The activity of these enzymes toward type V collagen was then assessed using APMA-activated gelatinase B as a standard. As shown in Fig.3, FC, at concentrations up to 5.4 μm (lanes 2 and 3), was not able to cleave type V collagen as previously observed (30Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at the same concentration, FC+Fib+Gel.B/AS (Fig. 3, lane 9) was able to degrade 66% of the type V collagen. This indicated that the presence of the fibronectin-like domain and Gel.B/AS is sufficient to endow FC with type V collagenolytic activity.Figure 3Analysis of Type V collagenolytic activity of chimeric proteins. Various concentrations of enzymes were mixed with 1 μg/μl pepsin-solubilized human placental type V collagen and 0.8 μg/μl bovine serum albumin in assay buffer that consisted of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 μm ZnCl2. A control reaction containing no enzyme was also included. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 18 h at 30 °C before being quenched by 10 mm EDTA.

We identified by differential display/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 40 genes with altered expression in cultured SMCs upon stimulation with the conditioned medium of activated macrophages. This set of genes comprises 10 known genes and 30 novel genes, which we call “smags” (forsmooth muscle activation-specificgenes). To determine the in vivo significance of these (novel) genes in atherogenesis, we performed in situ hybridization experiments on vascular tissue. Specifically, FLICE (Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme)-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) is expressed in neointimal SMCs as well as in lesion macrophages and endothelial cells, whereas the expression of the novel genes smag-63,smag-64, and smag-84 is restricted to neointimal SMCs.

The principal function of medial SMCs is to provide the artery with elastic properties to maintain vascular tone in response to environmental stimuli. Therefore, SMCs are equipped with a contractile apparatus, involving cytoskeletal proteins, ion channels, and specific signaling molecules. Limited information is available on SMC-specific proteins except for those, which have been proposed to be associated with the cytoskeleton, notably SM α-actin, myosin heavy chain subtypes, desmin, vimentin, calponin, caldesmon, SM22α (reviewed in Ref. 1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 3: 487-517Crossref Scopus (1397) Google Scholar), and smoothelin, a recently described protein (2van der Loop F.T. Schaart G. Timmer E.D. Ramaekers F.C. van Eys G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A typical characteristic of vascular SMCs is that they easily undergo phenotypic changes, involving the transient transformation from resting, contractile, fully differentiated SMCs into proliferative, migratory, dedifferentiated SMCs, which synthesize vast amounts of extracellular matrix components (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 3: 487-517Crossref Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 3Schwartz S.M. deBlois D. O'Brien E.R.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 445-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). This plasticity of SMC phenotype is relevant in adult organisms for maintenance of an intact vascular system upon vascular injury as well as during angiogenesis. In addition, accelerated proliferation and migration of SMCs plays an important role in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions, post-angioplastic restenosis, and vessel-wall extension in response to hypertension. During atherosclerosis, activated endothelial cells allow massive infiltration of monocytes into the subendothelial space, where these cells differentiate into macrophages and are ultimately converted into lipid-laden foam cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Ros R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar). The continuous presence of macrophages in the vessel wall results in constitutive, local secretion of cytokines and growth factors. These, mostly unknown, factors affect the quiescent medial SMCs, which subsequently undergo a transition into migrating, proliferative SMCs. At present, limited information is available on the molecular mechanisms that control the (de)differentiation program of human SMCs and, more specifically, on the genes which are involved in these processes. It should be emphasized that the human genome has been estimated to comprise up to 100,000 genes and that a function has been assigned to only 5–10% of these genes. Therefore, we assume that most of the genes, which are involved in a multifactorial phenomenon like SMC phenotype transition, are unknown. An inventory of those (novel) genes will substantially improve our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms in SMC biology and pathology, and may allow the future identification of new targets for drug discovery. We cultured human SMCs in vitro and treated the cells with a stimulus that mimics the onset of atherogenesis when the initial lipid-laden macrophages have accumulated in the subendothelium. Differential gene expression of SMCs was analyzed by differential display/RT-PCR (DD/RT-PCR) (5Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 6Bauer D. Muller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthoe P. Strauss M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification of 40 (partial) cDNAs corresponding to mRNAs with regulated expression in activated SMCs. Among these genes are four known genes, which have been described to be involved in atherosclerosis, a set of six known genes, which have been described in relation to different cellular processes and 30 novel genes of unknown function, the so-called “smooth muscleactivation-specific genes (smags). The subsequent documentation of differential expression of these genes in vascular specimen of normal vascular tissue and at different stages of the disease and characterization of the corresponding full-length cDNAs allows us to propose a potential function of these (novel) genes in atherogenesis. Arteries were dissected from human umbilical cords and immediately frozen or used for SMC explant cultures. Apparently normal vascular tissue and early stages of atherosclerosis were obtained during organ transplantation, whereas final stages of atherosclerotic vascular tissue was acquired during vascular surgery. In each case, informed consent was obtained of patients and/or relatives according to protocols of the Medical Ethical Committee of the Academic Medical Center of Amsterdam. Tissue samples for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were fixed within 15 min after resection in 3.8% (v/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and were subsequently paraffin-embedded. SMCs were obtained from human artery explant cultures (passage 5 to 7) and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of RPMI and M199 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with 20% (v/v) human serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone. The cultured cells were characterized by immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody directed against SM α-actin (1A4, Dako, Denmark), which was detected with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Westgrove, PA). With this method, the cells show uniform fibrillar staining. Confluent cultures were made quiescent by incubation overnight in serum-free medium, supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), selenite (5 μg/ml), and vitamin C (0.2 mm). LDL (200 μg of protein/ml) (Sigma) was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated for 7 h at 37 °C with copper sulfate (10 μm). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μm EDTA. The oxidized-LDL contained 40–50 nmol of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances per mg of protein (7Steinbrecher U.P. Parthasarathy S. Leake D.S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Human elutriated monocytes (kindly provided by Dr. E. Meul, CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were allowed to attach to 80-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 10 ml of RPMI/M199 with 5% (v/v) human serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and Fungizone per 108 cells. Subsequently, the attached cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence of 25–30 μg/ml oxidized LDL particles. The conditioned medium was harvested, stored at −20 °C, and applied at a 10-fold dilution, which resulted reproducibly in the induction of interleukin-8 (IL-8). Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzolTM method (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Ten μg of total RNA per lane was run on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were (pre)hybridized in formamide-containing buffers according to standard procedures (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes were radiolabeled with the random primer labeling mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.). To detect SM22α mRNA and calponin mRNA, rat cDNA probes were kindly provided by Dr. C. Shanahan (Cambridge, United Kingdom) (9Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and to detect SM α-actin mRNA the oligonucleotide (5′-AGTGCTGTCCTCTTCTTCACACATA-3′) was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized at 50 °C under standard conditions without formamide or dextrane sulfate (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNA blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and hybridized according to the enclosed protocols. As a control for equal RNA loading on the multiple tissue blots we used the 2-kb human β-actin cDNA probe supplied with the filters. For the other Northerns equal loading was confirmed with a GAPDH probe. DD/RT-PCR was performed according to Liang and Pardee (5Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (10Horrevoets A.J.G. Fontijn R.D. van Zonneveld A.J. de Vries C.J.M. ten Cate J.W. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1999; 93: 3418-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 12 random decamers as described by Bauer et al.(6Bauer D. Muller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthoe P. Strauss M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Differential bands were recovered from the gel, subcloned with TA-cloning plasmids pCRII (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). The clones were sequenced using the AutoRead Sequencing-kit and Cy5-labeled T7 or SP6 oligonucleotides and analyzed on the ALF-automatic sequencer (materials and protocol from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the RNase protection assay, [32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobes were obtained by in vitro transcription of cDNA fragments inserted in plasmids, containing T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase transcription initiation sites. A GAPDH riboprobe of 114 nt was used as a control for equal loading, yielding a protected fragment of 84 nucleotides (nt) (bp 517 to 601 of GenBank accession number M17851). The RNase protection assay was performed with 4 μg of total RNA as described before (11Boot R.G. van Achterberg T.A.E. van Aken B.E. Renkema G.H. Jacobs M.J.H.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. de Vries C.J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For quantification of the protected bands we applied the Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) PhosphorImager with Image Quant software. Immunostaining was performed on 5-μm paraffin sections with monoclonal antibody HAM56 (Dako, Denmark) to detect macrophages and monoclonal antibody 1A4 (Dako), directed against SM α-actin to identify SMCs. The secondary goat anti-mouse antibody was a biotin conjugate, which was subsequently detected with StreptABComplex horseradish peroxidase (Dako). Peroxidase activity was visualized with the substrate aminoethylcarbazole and hydrogen peroxide. Riboprobes were synthesized as described for the RNase protection assay, but were radiolabeled with [35S]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) a probe corresponding with bp 124 to 968 of GenBank accession number U97074 was used, for FGF-5 bp 240 to 899 of GenBank accession number M37825, for smag-84 the complete 1228-bp insert of the EST clone with GenBank accession number W46259was transcribed, for smag-64 bp 60 to 515 and for smag-63 the complete differential display fragment of 450 bp. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (10Horrevoets A.J.G. Fontijn R.D. van Zonneveld A.J. de Vries C.J.M. ten Cate J.W. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1999; 93: 3418-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each probe both antisense and sense riboprobes were assayed, the latter ones as a control for specificity of the signal. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from quiescent SMCs (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and mixed with equal amounts of RNA from SMCs that were stimulated for 1 to 24 h with conditioned medium of macrophages (see above). Polyadenylated RNA was isolated with the FastTrack kit (InVitrogen). A cDNA library was constructed essentially according to the method described by Aruffo and Seed (12Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized with 5 μg of mRNA by incubation for 1.5 h at 42 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTP, 5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer, 80 units of RNasin (Promega), and 600 units of SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following an incubation for 10 min at 70 °C, second strand cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 15 °C and 1 h at 21 °C by addition of 50 units of DNA Polymerase I and 4 units of RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the double-stranded cDNA was precipitated with ethanol. Four μg of BstXI adaptors (InVitrogen) were ligated to the cDNA by incubation for 16 h at 15 °C in T4 DNA ligase buffer and 400 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Size fractionation of the cDNA and removal of residual adaptors was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Two fractions, ranging from 500 bp to 2 kb and larger than 2 kb, were excised and purified using Qiaquick spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified cDNA fractions were ligated to BstXI-cut pUC-BstXI, which is a derivative of pUC18 containing an additional polylinker including BstXI sites (a generous gift of Dr. A. Caricasole, Hubrecht Laboratory, Utrecht, the Netherlands), for 16 h at 15 °C using 400 units of T4 DNA ligase. Aliquots of the ligation mixture were used for transformation of ElectroMAX DH10BTN bacteria (Life Technologies, Inc.) by electroporation. After cloning full-length cDNAs into the pSP64 Poly(A) vector (Promega), in vitro transcription and translation was performed using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). Although a substantial cellular part of the human atherosclerotic vessel wall consists of SMCs, the complexity and variability of these lesions, with respect to differences in cellular composition and differentiation status of those vascular cells, is too extensive to allow a direct comparison of gene expression patterns in normal and atherosclerotic tissues. Consequently, we applied in vitrocultured SMCs in our search for novel atherosclerotic, SMC-specific genes. At present, no stable human SMC line is available, which can either display a quiescent or a proliferative phenotype, like primary cells. SMCs were obtained from explant cultures of umbilical cord artery, adult iliac artery, or abdominal aorta and grown to confluency. Subsequently, we compared the relative expression levels of the SMC-specific differentiation markers SM22α, SM α-actin, and calponin in these cultures by Northern blotting (Fig.1). Each of these genes exhibits the highest expression level in normal vascular tissue (lane 1), which is predominantly composed of fully differentiated, medial SMCs. SM22α is expressed in all the SMC cultures, originating from different vascular sources (panel A), with a relatively high expression level in umbilical cord artery SMCs. However, SM α-actin (panel B) as well as calponin (panel C) mRNA expression is restricted to the in vitro cultured SMCs obtained from umbilical cord artery. From these data we conclude that SMCs derived from this human, neonatal vascular tissue most closely resemble medial SMCs and are likely to exhibit the largest differences in gene expression upon activation, which makes them most appropriate for our studies. To mimic the conditions to which vascular SMCs are exposed at the initiation of atherosclerosis, we stimulated cultured, umbilical cord artery SMCs with the conditioned medium of human macrophages, which were activated with oxidized LDL particles. Confluent SMC cultures were kept overnight in serum-free medium and were subsequently stimulated for different periods with medium, containing 5% (v/v) human serum and appropriately diluted conditioned medium of human macrophages. To discriminate between genes, which respond to serum and genes that are regulated by macrophage-secreted components, an additional stimulation was performed for a few selected periods with 5% (v/v) human serum only. To identify immediate early, early as well as late response genes, total RNA was isolated from SMCs after 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h of stimulation. The incubations were performed in duplicate in separate experiments. For each RNA preparation, different cDNA fractions were generated with 12 two-base anchored oligo(dT)11 oligonucleotides (5Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). These cDNA fractions were amplified with 12 different random decamers (6Bauer D. Muller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthoe P. Strauss M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and the reaction products were analyzed on denaturing gels. Differential cDNA fragments that are present at identical periods of activation in both sets of RNA, were isolated from the gel, re-amplified, and subcloned. Subsequently, the sequence of the differential display fragments was determined. Finally, these partial cDNA sequences were analyzed by means of the nonredundant GenBank/EMBL data base to identify known genes with established functions. Homology searches against expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases and the High-Throughput Genome sequence data bases identified known sequences to which no function has been assigned yet and the novel sequences were deposited in GenBank (TableI). Representative examples of DD/RT-PCR reactions run on denaturing gels are shown in Fig.2. The nucleotide sequence of the band indicated with an arrow in Fig. 2 A was identified as part of the 3′-untranslated region of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (13Wong G.G. Witek J.S. Temple P.A. Wilkens K.M. Leary A.C. Luxenberg D.P. Jones S.S. Brown E.L. Kay R.M. Orr E.C. Shoemaker C. Golde D.W. Kaufman R.J. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Clark S.C.

FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) mRNA is induced at 2–4 h and was isolated from a DD-RT/PCR reaction on a single set of mRNAs (Fig. 2 B) (14Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Of the novel genes shown in this figure (Fig. 2, C-E), smag-84 is induced at 2–8 h and this sequence is represented in the EST data base (GenBank accession number W46259). The expression of smag-64 is also enhanced at 2 to 4 h, whereas smag-63 exemplifies a gene, which is induced only after 2 h of activation of the SMCs.Table IGenes identified in activated human SMCs by DD/RT-PCRGenbank accession number1-aGenBank accession number for obtaining full name, sequence, and references to published reports.Homology from-to (bp)1-bThe exact location of the homology of the sequences identified by DD/RT-PCR within the published sequence is given according to the numbering of the GenBank sequence.Cellular interactionsICAM-1X06990ELAM-ligand fucosyltransferase/Fuc-TIVM58596Signaling/gene activationGM-CSFM11220Interleukin-8M28130FGF-5M37825, AF171928This studyNF-κBM58603TR3 orphan receptorL13740Mitogen induced orphan receptorU12767Inhibition of apoptosishIAP-1AF070674FLICE-like inhibitory proteinU97075Unassignedsmag-9AL049305.1493–307smag-16AL13644781399–81272smag-20AW129983468–270smag-30AL049694.925010–24777smag-37AW561138This studysmag-38AW561139This studysmag-40AW561140This studysmag-42AW561141This studysmag-50AW561142This studysmag-53AC007319147397–147133smag-54AL138722112942–113114smag-56N7814253–248smag-58AW561143This studysmag-59AW561144This studysmag-60AC02064981674–81896smag-63AW561145This studysmag-64AF170702This studysmag-66AC00722633823–33434smag-71AW561146This studysmag-75AC01700288325–88627smag-83AC012584118793–118501smag-84W4625942–202smag-85AF002223128959–128809smag-86AC01696660167–59998smag-92AW562329This studysmag-95AW562330This studysmag-96AW562331This studysmag-97AW562332This studysmag-98AW562333This studysmag-99AW562334This study1-a GenBank accession number for obtaining full name, sequence, and references to published reports.1-b The exact location of the homology of the sequences identified by DD/RT-PCR within the published sequence is given according to the numbering of the GenBank sequence.

FLIP, ICAM, smag-53, and smag-99 are induced by 5% (v/v) human serum both in the presence and absence (lane 6c) of the macrophage conditioned medium, suggesting that these genes are at least partially induced by serum. In TableII, top, we summarized the extent of induction of the genes shown in Fig. 3 A as determined by PhosphorImager analysis, as well as the size of the corresponding mRNA, deduced from the relative migration in the gel. Only 12 of the 40 partial cDNAs, isolated from the DD/RT-PCR analysis, reveal a hybridization signal on the total RNA blots, whereas the expression of the other mRNAs corresponding with the available probes is too low to be detected with this technique.Table IISummary of the data obtained by Northern blotting and RNase protection assaysNorthern blotPrimer pair2-aPrimer pair represents the combination of anchored primer (letters) and decamers (numbers) (6) that identified the gene by DD/RT-PCR as described in Fig. 1.Kinetics2-bKinetics of (optimal) expression of the gene (in hours).kb2-cThe Northern blots revealed information on the length of the mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2329678181,"Smad family members are essential intracellular signaling components of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily involved in a range of biological activities. The loss of sensitivity to TGF-beta is frequent in human lung cancers and inactivation of Smad family members are thought to play important roles in disruption of TGF-beta signaling. In the study presented here, we characterized the biological and biochemical functions of six Smad2 and Smad4 mutants, which we previously identified in human lung cancers. All mutant Smad2 and Smad4 were in fact found to be defective in transmitting growth inhibitory signals originating from TGF-beta and incapable of activating Smad/hFAST-1-mediated transcription. Transcriptional activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) was impaired in four of the six mutants due to the defects in homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization with wild-type Smads. In contrast, the remaining two Smad mutants showed a modest reduction in the PAI-1 transcriptional activation and apparently retained the ability to oligomerize with wild-type Smads. Significant loss of growth inhibition and Smad/hFAST-1-mediated transcriptional activation by all of the six mutants suggested that Smad mutants are indeed functionally impaired Smad mutations and may play a role in lung tumorigenesis. Moreover, the present findings suggest that in addition to the impairment in the homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization, there may be an alternative mechanism producing disruption of TGF-beta signaling, involving hFAST-1-or possibly other transcriptional cofactor(s)-mediated transcriptional activation."

Here, we report that hyperthermia sensitizes malignant glioma cells to CD95L- and APO2L-induced apoptosis in the absence, but not in the presence, of inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. Hyperthermia does not alter CD95 expression at the cell surface and does not modulate the morphology of CD95-mediated cell death on electron microscopy. Bcl-2 gene transfer inhibits apoptosis and abrogates the sensitization mediated by hyperthermia. Hyperthermia does not overcome resistance to apoptosis conferred by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A, indicating the absolute requirement for the activation of crm-A-sensitive caspases, probably caspase 8, for apoptosis. CD95L-evoked DEVD-amc-cleaving caspase activity is enhanced by hyperthermia, suggesting that hyperthermia operates upstream of caspase processing to promote apoptosis. There is no uniformly enhanced processing of three caspase 3 substrates, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), protein kinase C (PKC) delta and DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) 45. Yet, hyperthermia promotes CD95L-evoked DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, hyperthermia enhances the CD95L-evoked release of cytochrome c in the absence, but not in the presence, of CHX. In contrast, the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential is enhanced by hyperthermia both in the absence and presence of CHX, and enhanced cytochrome c release is not associated with significantly enhanced caspase 9 processing. The potentiation of cytochrome c release at hyperthermic conditions in the absence of CHX is abrogated by Bcl-2. Thus, either hyperthermia or inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX potentiate cytotoxic cytokine-induced apoptosis. These pathways show no synergy, but rather redundance, indicating that CHX may function to promote apoptosis in response to cytotoxic cytokines by inhibiting the synthesis of specific proteins whose synthesis, function or degradation is temperature-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1991415069,"We have reported that prothrombin (1 μm) is able to replace high molecular weight kininogen (45 nm) as a cofactor for the specific binding of factor XI to the platelet (Baglia, F. A., and Walsh, P. N. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 2271–2281). We have also determined that prothrombin fragment 2 binds to the Apple 1 domain of factor XI at or near the site where high molecular weight kininogen binds. A region of 31 amino acids derived from high molecular weight kininogen (HK31-mer) can also bind to factor XI (Tait, J. F., and Fujikawa, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11651–11656). We therefore investigated the role of prothrombin fragment 2 and HK31-mer as cofactors in the binding of factor XI to activated platelets. Our experiments demonstrated that prothrombin fragment 2 (1 μm) or the HK31-mer (8 μm) are able to replace high molecular weight kininogen (45 nm) or prothrombin (1 μm) as cofactors for the binding of factor XI to the platelet. To localize the platelet binding site on factor XI, we used mutant full-length recombinant factor XI molecules in which the platelet binding site in the Apple 3 domain was altered by alanine scanning mutagenesis. The recombinant factor XI with alanine substitutions at positions Ser248, Arg250, Lys255, Leu257, Phe260, or Gln263 were defective in their ability to bind to activated platelets. Thus, the interaction of factor XI with platelets is mediated by the amino acid residues Ser248, Arg250, Lys255, Leu257, Phe260, and Gln263 within the Apple 3 domain.

FXI can also bind to prothrombin, which can displace HK bound to FXI and which binds to a site (Ala45–Ser86) in the A1 domain that is within the HK-binding site (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the presence of HK or prothrombin, FXI can bind reversibly and specifically to high affinity sites on the surface of stimulated human platelets in the presence of zinc and calcium ions (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). More specifically, this laboratory has demonstrated that the A3 domain of FXI is essential in the binding of FXI to platelets, since a recombinant A3 (rA3) domain of FXI demonstrated specific, saturable binding and effectively competed with radiolabeled FXI in binding to the platelet surface (17Ho D.H. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 34: 316-323Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The consequence of FXI binding to activated platelets is an acceleration of the rate of FXI activation by thrombin, FXIIa, or FXIa (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), one objective of the present study was to examine the mechanism by which HK and prothrombin promote the binding of FXI to the activated platelet,i.e. to determine whether either the FXI·HK complex or the FXI·prothrombin complex initially binds as an encounter complex to platelets via HK or prothrombin, or whether, alternatively either HK or prothrombin binds only to the FXI A1 domain resulting in exposure of the A3 domain platelet binding site. Another goal of the present study was to define the amino acids within the A3 domain of FXI that mediate its binding to platelets. The results of these studies, utilizing site-directed mutational analysis of recombinant FXI (rFXI) confirm and extend previous studies utilizing conformationally constrained synthetic peptides and the rA3 domain of FXI, which identified Arg250, Lys255, Phe260, and Gln263 as important for generating the platelet-binding site (17Ho D.H.

The chromogenic substrate for measurement of FXIa activity (S2366) was obtained from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). Rabbit brain phospholipids (Cephaline) were purchased from Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY). The thrombin receptor agonist peptide, SFLLRN-amide, was synthesized at the Protein Chemistry Facility of the University of Pennsylvania on a model 430A synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purified by reverse-phase high performance liqud chromatography to >99% homogeneity. Normal pooled and FXI-deficient human plasmas were purchased from George King Biochemical (Overland Park, KS). All reagents and materials used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. IODOGEN vials (20 μg of coating) were obtained from Pierce. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, benzamidine, HEPES, sodiumm-periodate, Sepharose 2B-CL, Sephadex G25 (fine), dithiothreitol, sodium phosphate, Tris-HCl, Trizma base, cysteine, bovine serum albumin, iodoacetamide, and metabisulfite were purchased from Sigma. Purified proteins were radiolabeled by a minor modification of the IODOGEN method. Briefly, 2 μl of 125I-NaOH (500–1,000 μCi/μl) was added to 100 μl of protein (0.1–1.0 mg/ml) and incubated in an IODOGEN vial (20-μg coating) for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding metabisulfite (50 μg/ml). The 125I-protein was purified by centrifugation at 200 × g for 20 min through a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in 0.01 m,Tris pH 8.0. The incorporation of 125I into FXI was ∼98%, and the specific radioactivity of the 125I-FXI was 29.4 μCi/μg. This corresponds to 1.24 ± 0.40 atoms of125I/molecule of FXI monomer. The procedures utilized to prepare wild type FXI and the FXI mutants rFXI(S248A), rFXI(T249A), rFXI(R250A), rFXI(I251A), rFXI(K252A), rFXI(K253A), rFXI(S254A), rFXI(K255A), rFXI(L257A), rFXI(F260A), rFXI(Q263A), rFXI(250–255→A), rFXI(249–251→A), rFXI(252–254→A), rFXI (255–257→A), and rFXI·PKA3 were those described by Sun et. al. (7Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the wild type human FXI cDNA in vector pBluescript (SK+ version) using a Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proper introduction of the mutation was confirmed by conventional dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing. cDNAs were subsequently ligated into a mammalian expression vector, pJVCMV, containing the cytomegalovirus promoter. Human fetal kidney fibroblasts (293 cells, 5 × 107 cells) were co-transfected with 40 μg of FXI cDNA/pJVCMV construct and 2 μg of a plasmid RSVneo, which contains a gene conferring resistance to neomycin. Transfection was by electroporation using an Electrocell Manipulator 600 (BTX, San Diego, CA). Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then switched to the same medium supplemented with the neomycin analog, G418, at 500 μg/ml. Medium was exchanged every 48 h. G418-resistant clones were transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates and culture supernatants were tested for protein expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using goat anti-human FXI capture antibody and the same antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for detection, as recommended by the supplier. Clones expressing the highest levels of protein were expanded to confluence in 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks. When the cells had reached confluence, medium was replaced with 75 ml of serum-free Cellgro complete medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. This mixture of protease inhibitors prevents activation or degradation of the recombinant protein in the conditioned medium. Medium was exchanged every 48 h. After collection, conditioned medium was supplemented with benzamidine to a final concentration of 5 mm and stored at −20 °C pending purification. One liter of conditioned medium was passed over a 3-ml column of murine anti-human FXI monoclonal antibody, 1G5.12, linked to Affigel-10 as described previously (7Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After loading, the columns were washed with 10 column volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) supplemented with 5 mm benzamidine, followed by elution with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2m sodium thiocyanate, 5 mm benzamidine. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator, dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, and stored at −70 °C. The concentration of recombinant proteins was determined using a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). All the recombinant proteins utilized in this study have been extensively characterized as previously reported (20Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All proteins were shown to be homogeneous and >95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When zymogen proteins were converted to FXIa by incubation with FXIIa, the activated proteins cleaved the chromogenic substrate S-2366 with similar kinetic parameters compared with wild type and plasma-derived proteins (20Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins had normal clotting activity (within 20% of wild type or plasma-derived FXI) when assayed in FXI-deficient plasma (20Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Forty-five ml of blood was collected in a 50-ml tube containing 5 ml of 2.5% trisodium citrate (w/v), 1.5% citric acid (w/v), and 2.0% dextrose (w/v). The blood was centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min. to obtain platelet-rich plasma. Platelet-rich plasma was removed to a new 50-ml tube and centrifuged again at 800 × g for 5 min to remove contaminating red blood cells. This supernatant was centrifuged at 1,800 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of HEPES-Tyrode buffer, pH 6.5, and gel-filtered on a column of Sepharose 2B equilibrated in HEPES-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4. Platelets were counted using a particle counter from Coulter Electronics (Hialeah, FL). The coagulation assays were performed using the kaolin-activated partial thromboplastin time. The master reaction mixture contained 50 μl of 25 mg of kaolin mixed with phospholipids (0.04% inosithin) in 5 ml of HEPES-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4. To this mixture, 50 μl of FXI-deficient plasma, 1 nmwild type FXI, or appropriate concentrations of recombinant wild type FXI or mutant rFXI-A3 proteins were added to a final volume of 200 μl. This was repeated with activated platelets (108/ml) substituted for phospholipids. The master mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min; 50 μl of 50 mm CaCl2 was then added, and the clotting time was determined. Prothrombin activation material containing PF2 and depleted of thrombin by SP-Sephadex column chromatography was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN) and processed as follows. This preparation contained 0.4 mg/ml protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 1 μm benzamidine, pH 6.5. To 50 ml of this material, Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem, Indianapolis, IN) was added to a concentration of 10 μm. PF2 was isolated using fast protein liquid chromatography at 23 °C using a MonoQ (HR 5/5) column according to the procedure of Stevens and Nesheim (21Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Preparative isolation of the material on this column results in PF1 and PF2 in two separate pools. PF2 migrates at 14 kDa as a doublet on SDS-gel electrophoresis. From 50 ml loaded on the column, approximately 7 mg of PF2 was recovered. An identical preparation of human PF2 was obtained as a generous gift from S. Krishnaswamy (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and gave identical results. Direct binding and competition experiments were carried out as described previously (16Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For direct binding, platelets (108/ml) were activated with the thrombin receptor activation peptide (5 μm, SFLLRN-amide) for 5 min at 37 °C. Then, various concentrations of125I-FXI and the following reagents were added in the combinations specified in the figure legends: 25 μmZnCl2 and/or 2 mm CaCl2 with 50 nm HK, 8 μm HK31-mer, 1 μmprothrombin, or 1 μm PF2. For total binding, unlabeled FXI was not added in the reaction mix; however, for determination of nonspecific binding, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled FXI was added in the reaction mix. At the end of the incubation period (30 min, 37 °C), 100-μl aliquots were removed and centrifuged through a mixture of Dow Corning methyl silicon oil (3 parts of 550 density oil for every 2 parts of 200 density oil) to separate platelet pellets from supernatant. The amount of 125I-FXI bound to platelets was counted for 125I using a Wallac 1470 Wizard γ counter. Specific binding was determined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding. In competition experiments, the concentration of competitor that displaced 50% of bound 125I-FXI (IC50) was determined by plotting the amount of 125I-FXI bound to platelets versus the amount of competitor ligand added. TheK i was calculated using the equation: IC50 = ((1+ [S])/K d)K i; where S was the concentration of125I-FXI used in these experiments (held constant at 22 nm) and K d was the value (10 nm) determined from direct binding experiments. One hundred percent binding of 125I-FXI represented an average of ∼250,000 cpm bound whereas 0% binding represented background binding (∼250 cpm). Binding studies were performed on a Biacore 2000 flow biosensor (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). High molecular weight kininogen was immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) flow cell surface using amine coupling chemistry. Briefly, 1.15 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide was mixed with 7.5 mg of N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and injected at 5 μl/min, for 7 min across the flow cell surface. HK, ∼10 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, was then injected for 1–2 min to a response level of ∼500 response units. Any remaining derivatized carboxymethyl groups were then blocked by a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride-NaOH. Nonspecific binding was determined by protein binding to a derivatized and blocked flow cell with an unrelated antibody bound. Serial dilutions of wild type FXI and FXI mutants in HBS, with or without 20 μm zinc, 0.005% surfactant P20 (Biacore, Inc.) were injected with a 6-min association time and 5-min dissociation time. After subtraction of the nonspecific binding curves, the association and dissociation rate constants were determined using a global fit to a one to one Langmuir association model on Biaevaluation software (Biacore, Inc.). The best fit was determined by a χ2 value of less than 10 or less than 5% of the equilibrium response unit value for the highest concentration. The χ2 value is the square of the differences between the theoretical ideal curve and the actual curve and was calculated according to the following equation. χ2=Σ(rf−rx)2n−pEquation 1 Where rf indicates the fitted value at a given point, rx indicates the experimental value at that point, n indicates the number of data points, andp indicates the number of fitted parameters. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test.p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We reported that prothrombin binds to FXI with aK d ∼250 nm and that complex formation between FXI and prothrombin can promote the binding of FXI to the platelet surface (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, we have determined that the interaction between prothrombin and FXI occurs through PF2 and the A1 domain of FXI (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, the binding of HK to the A1 domain of FXI (12Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4149-4154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is mediated by a 31-amino acid region, 565–595, on domain 6 of HK (14Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11651-11656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HK, which is bound to FXI in circulation, also promotes the specific, high affinity binding of FXI to the surface of stimulated human platelets in the presence of zinc and calcium ions (16Greengard J.S.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). FXI binding to activated platelets was demonstrated to be saturable, and nonspecific binding (measured in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled FXI) was demonstrated to be linear and to represent a small fraction (<10%) of total binding at saturation (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6734-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined whether the sequences of amino acids, in both prothrombin and HK, that bind to FXI can also promote FXI binding to the activated platelet surface. Binding of various concentrations of FXI to stimulated platelets was determined in the presence of 25 μm ZnCl2 and 2 mmCaCl2 with either 1 μm PF2 (Ser156–Arg271) or 8 μm HK31-mer (Ser194–Lys224), compared with intact prothrombin or HK, respectively. Saturable specific, high affinity binding of 125I-FXI to stimulated platelets was observed for both conditions, with low level, linear nonspecific binding representing <10% of total binding of saturation. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from total binding to give values of specific binding, which are plotted in Fig.1. The calculated values ofB max derived from experiments on three separate donors (each done in triplicate) in the presence of prothrombin as cofactor (panel B) varied from 1.4 to 2.0 pmol/platelet, and the calculated values of K dranged from 8.8 to 18.3 nm, demonstrating remarkable consistency from experiment to experiment. When HK was used as cofactor (panel A), the corresponding range ofB max values was 1.1–1.3 pmol/platelet withK d values of 8.8–11.4 nm. Furthermore, when compared with prothrombin and HK as cofactors for FXI binding to activated platelets, the HK31-mer and PF2 peptides were able to induce saturable binding in the same manner as the intact proteins (Fig. 1). The results demonstrate that saturable binding was achieved at FXI concentrations above those present in plasma (30 nm). When saturation binding data were analyzed, theK d (∼10 nm) and total number of sites (1,500–2,000 sites/platelet) were the same for the HK, HK31-mer, prothrombin, and PF2. Thus, the synthetic peptide HK31-mer or PF2 can substitute for HK or prothrombin, respectively, as a cofactor for FXI binding to platelets. We also examined the binding of FXI to activated platelets in the presence or absence of ions. When HK31-mer was used as a cofactor, in the absence of zinc, the saturable binding decreased by 70%, as compared with total binding in the presence of zinc (Fig. 1). However, when we replaced zinc with calcium, we observed suboptimal binding (Fig. 1), suggesting that in addition to the HK31-mer, the binding of FXI to activated platelets also requires zinc ions. When PF2 was used as cofactor, the binding was specific and saturable in the presence of zinc. In the absence of zinc, specific binding was reduced by 75%. When calcium was included in the binding assay, slight enhancement of binding was observed (Fig. 1), suggesting that the requisite ion for PF2-mediated binding of FXI is zinc and not calcium as previously reported for prothrombin (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ability of cofactors to act as co-receptors for FXI binding to activated platelets was examined. The binding of 125I-FXI (50 nm) in the presence of HK (50 nm) or in the presence of prothrombin (1 μm) was titrated against an increasing concentration of HK31-mer or PF2 (Fig.2). It was anticipated that if HK·FXI or prothrombin·FXI complexes were binding to activated platelets via HK- or prothrombin-binding sites on platelets, then high concentrations of HK31-mer or PF2 would prevent FXI binding. The results indicated that the binding of FXI to platelets remained unchanged at high concentration of HK31-mer or PF2. Thus, these cofactors do not function as receptors for FXI on the platelet surface. This study also suggests that, even if the HK31-mer or PF2 are displacing HK or prothrombin from FXI, the platelet binding site on the A3 domain of FXI remains exposed and functional due to continued occupancy of the HK or prothrombin binding site in the FXI A1 domain by the HK31-mer or by PF2. We have reported that a platelet-binding site exists in the A3 domain of FXI. In order to expose this site, FXI must be bound to a cofactor (HK or prothrombin) (10Kaplan A.P. Silverberg M. Dunn J.T.

Ectopic expression of the ets related transcription factor Fli-1 in these cells resulted in the establishment of the Epo-dependent cell line HB60-ED that proliferates in the presence of Epo. In this study, we utilized these two cell lines to examine the signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to Epo and SCF stimulation. We demonstrate that Epo, but not SCF, phosphorylates STAT-5 in both HB60-5 and HB60-ED cells. Interestingly, SCF activates the Shc/ras pathway in HB60-5 cells while Epo does not. However, both Epo and SCF are capable of activating the Shc/ras pathway in HB60-ED cells. Furthermore, enforced expression of gp55 in HB60-5 cells by means of infection with the Spleen Focus Forming virus-P (SFFV-P), confers Epo independent growth, which is associated with the up-regulation of Fli-1. Activation of the Shc/ras pathway is readily detected in gp55 expressing cells in response to both Epo and SCF, and is associated with a block in STAT-5B tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that STAT-5 activation, in the absence of Shc/ras activation, plays a role in erythroid differentiation. Moreover, Fli-1 is capable of switching Epo-induced differentiation to Epo-induced proliferation, suggesting that this ets factor regulated genes whose products modulate the Epo-Epo-R signal transduction pathway."

With the exception of Txk, Tec and the Tec-related PTKs possess a relatively long NH2-terminal region that consists of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (11Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and a Tec homology (TH) domain (12Vihinen M. Nilsson L. Smith C.I.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PH domain is thought to mediate protein binding to various phospholipids or phospholipid-derived molecules; for example, the Tec PH domain binds to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphate (13Shirai T. Tanaka K. Terada Y. Sawada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Nagata S. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Li S. Hattori S. Mano H. Fukui Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the Btk PH domain binds to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (14Fukuda M. Kojima T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

These PH domain-phospholipid interactions are thought to mediate the conditional tethering of Tec family kinases to the cell membrane, suggesting that these enzymes might act downstream of PI 3-kinase. The TH domain of Tec PTKs contains proline-rich sequences that interact with the Src homology (SH) 3 domain of these same proteins (16Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and, probably, also with the SH3 domains of other proteins. The intramolecular interaction between the TH and SH3 domains results in the bending of Tec proteins, which likely serve to mask their catalytic centers and to inhibit kinase activity.Several Tec proteins are abundant in hematopoietic tissues and are therefore thought to play important roles in the development or maintenance of the hematopoietic system. Indeed, Tec PTKs are activated in blood cells by stimulation of cytokine receptors, lymphocyte surface antigens, G protein-coupled receptors, receptor type PTKs, or integrins (17Mano H. Int. J. Hematol. 1999; 69: 6-12PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a functional Btk is indispensable for the maturation of B lymphocytes and the subsequent production of immunoglobulins. However, the downstream effectors of Tec family kinases remain largely unknown. Tec, Btk, and Itk each phosphorylate and activate phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 (18Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I.

Candidate substrates for Btk also include BAP-135 (or TFII-I) (19Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and WASP (20Baba Y.

Ozawa, and H. Mano, manuscript in preparation.Stimulation of cell surface receptors often induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of two unidentified Tec-binding proteins in addition to that of Tec. One of these Tec-binding phosphoproteins, p62, gives rise to a broad blurred band of ∼62–66 kDa on immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, suggesting that the protein is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues. The other Tec-binding phosphoprotein migrates at a position corresponding to a molecular size of ∼56 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p62 is induced by cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in B lymphocytes (23Kitanaka A. Mano H. Conley M.E. Campana D. Blood. 1998; 91: 940-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by activation of c-Kit in myeloid cells (24Tang B. Mano H. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8432-8437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicates that p62 is not identical to Sam68 or SHC. 3K. Yoshida, unpublished data.3K. Yoshida, unpublished data.The protein p62Dok-1 was isolated as a major substrate for activated Abl tyrosine kinases (25Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 26Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Dok-1 contains a PH domain at its NH2 terminus as well as multiple tyrosine residues that are potential binding sites for SH2 domains. Dok-1 is identical to the protein previously known as the GTPase-activating protein of Ras (RasGAP)-associated p62, which was shown to be an effective substrate for various PTKs (27Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and to undergo rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with insulin (28Hosomi Y. Shii K. Ogawa W. Matsuba H. Yoshida M. Okada Y. Yokono K. Kasuga M. Baba S. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11498-11502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (29Sanchez-Margalet V. Zoratti R. Sung C.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that it functions as a docking protein in signaling by a wide variety of mitogens. However, the biological role of Dok-1 has remained unclear. Although its ability to bind to RasGAP suggests that Dok-1 might function to inhibit Ras activity in vivo, such a role has not been proved yet.Dok-1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to BCR engagement in B cells or to c-Kit activation in myeloid cells (25Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Given the similarity in phosphorylation profile and molecular size between Dok-1 and the Tec-binding protein p62, we investigated whether these two proteins are identical. We have now shown that Tec associates through its SH2 domain with Dok-1 as well as phosphorylates tyrosine residues of Dok-1 at a high stoichiometry. Furthermore, BCR-induced phosphorylation of Dok-1 was inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Tec, suggesting that Tec is a key mediator of Dok-1 phosphorylation in the BCR signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that Dok-1 is a direct substrate of the PTK Tec and that, at least in BCR signaling, Tec is an important mediator of Dok-1 phosphorylation in vivo. Given that Dok-1 is hyperphosphorylated in cells expressing the Bcr-Abl fusion protein or v-Abl (25Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 26Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), it is likely that Dok-1 also serves as a substrate for these activated Abl proteins. In addition, c-Abl also efficiently phosphorylates Dok-1. Our data showing that a wide spectrum of nonreceptor PTKs phosphorylates Dok-1 suggest that this protein receives input from various such enzymes under different conditions. Integrin activation has recently been shown to regulate Dok-1 phosphorylation (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and evidence suggests that Dok-1 is also a substrate for receptor type PTKs. The function of Dok-1 in vivo has, however, remained unclear, although a recent study implicated this protein in insulin-induced cell migration (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Although Dok-1 was previously identified as a binding protein of RasGAP, it has been unclear whether Dok-1 activates or inhibits the activity of Ras. Our data support the latter of these two possibilities, consistent with the ability of Dok-1 to recruit RasGAP to the cell membrane in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, despite such Dok-1-mediated recruitment of RasGAP, Noguchi et al. (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) failed to detect inhibition of p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases in response to insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells that express human insulin receptors (IR) (Chinese hamster ovary-IR cells). These observations are not necessarily incompatible with our data. With the use of transfected 293 cells, we showed that Dok-1 appears to transmit a negative signal to Ras through RasGAP. In the Chinese hamster ovary-IR cells, however, activated insulin receptors also likely send a positive signal to mitogen-activated protein kinases (or Ras) independent of their signaling to Dok-1. IRS proteins undergo marked tyrosine phosphorylation in response to stimulation of insulin receptors and thereby provide docking sites for PI 3-kinase and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, the latter of which up-regulates Ras activity (43Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin receptors phosphorylate the adapter molecule SHC (44Paez-Espinosa V. Carvalho C.R. Alvarez-Rojas F. Janeri L. Velloso L.A. Boschero A.C. Saad M.J. Endocrine. 1998; 8: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is a potent activator of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These insulin receptor-evoked positive signals to Ras may therefore have masked Dok-1 regulation of Ras activity in the study of Noguchi et al. (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Dok-1 on multiple tyrosine residues, one of which may become a binding site for Nck (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), further suggests that Dok-1 may be functionally connected to a variety of signaling molecules in addition to RasGAP. Identification of cellular proteins that are recruited to these multiple phosphorylation sites of Dok-1 should clarify the in vivo roles of this protein (Fig.5).We showed that the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 in BA/F3 cells expressing an active form of Tec was >50-fold that apparent in the parental BA/F3 cells. Tec also associated with, and phosphorylated multiple tyrosine residues of, Dok-1 in 293 cells. Furthermore, BCR-induced phosphorylation of Dok-1 in Ramos cells was markedly inhibited by expression of dominant negative mutants of Tec. Together, these data support the occurrence of a physical and functional interaction between Tec and Dok-1. At least in Ramos cells, Tec appears to be the predominant PTK responsible for the activation of Dok-1 (Fig.5). However, the observation that a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 remained apparent in Ramos cells expressing dominant negative mutants of Tec suggests that other PTKs also contribute to phosphorylation of Dok-1 in these cells.Our data indicate that the SH2 domain of Tec binds to tyrosine residues of Dok-1 that are phosphorylated by Tec itself. Thus, the SH2 domain and the kinase domain of Tec appear to target the same tyrosine residues. This conclusion is consistent with the “processive phosphorylation” model proposed to account for the hyperphosphorylation of docking proteins by nonreceptor PTKs (36Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). According to this scenario, Tec first phosphorylates a tyrosine residue of Dok-1 that is then recognized and bound with high affinity by the SH2 domain of Tec. The interaction of this phosphotyrosine residue with the SH2 domain of Tec then allows the kinase domain of Tec to phosphorylate the next target tyrosine of Dok-1. Repetition of this cycle would result in the hyperphosphorylation of Dok-1 by Tec.The Tec family member Btk was not able to phosphorylate Dok-1 in 293 cells. Btk is abundant in Ramos cells and is activated in response to BCR stimulation (data not shown). However, in contrast to the situation with Tec, we were not able to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 in anti-Btk immunoprecipitates prepared from BCR-stimulated Ramos cells (data not shown). A similar discrepancy between the abilities of Tec and Itk to phosphorylate Dok-1 was recently described (45Yang W.C. Ghiotto M. Barbarat B. Olive D. J. Biol.

Members of the Tec family of PTKs therefore appear to possess distinct, but probably overlapping, target specificities, with Dok-1 being one example of such a member-specific substrate. The protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)1 Tec was initially isolated from mouse liver (1Mano H. Ishikawa F. Nishida J. Hirai H. Takaku F.

With the exception of Txk, Tec and the Tec-related PTKs possess a relatively long NH2-terminal region that consists of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (11Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and a Tec homology (TH) domain (12Vihinen M. Nilsson L. Smith C.I.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PH domain is thought to mediate protein binding to various phospholipids or phospholipid-derived molecules; for example, the Tec PH domain binds to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphate (13Shirai T. Tanaka K. Terada Y. Sawada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Nagata S. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Li S. Hattori S. Mano H. Fukui Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the Btk PH domain binds to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (14Fukuda M. Kojima T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30303-30306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate (15Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R.

These PH domain-phospholipid interactions are thought to mediate the conditional tethering of Tec family kinases to the cell membrane, suggesting that these enzymes might act downstream of PI 3-kinase. The TH domain of Tec PTKs contains proline-rich sequences that interact with the Src homology (SH) 3 domain of these same proteins (16Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and, probably, also with the SH3 domains of other proteins. The intramolecular interaction between the TH and SH3 domains results in the bending of Tec proteins, which likely serve to mask their catalytic centers and to inhibit kinase activity. Several Tec proteins are abundant in hematopoietic tissues and are therefore thought to play important roles in the development or maintenance of the hematopoietic system. Indeed, Tec PTKs are activated in blood cells by stimulation of cytokine receptors, lymphocyte surface antigens, G protein-coupled receptors, receptor type PTKs, or integrins (17Mano H. Int. J. Hematol. 1999; 69: 6-12PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a functional Btk is indispensable for the maturation of B lymphocytes and the subsequent production of immunoglobulins. However, the downstream effectors of Tec family kinases remain largely unknown. Tec, Btk, and Itk each phosphorylate and activate phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 (18Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I.

Candidate substrates for Btk also include BAP-135 (or TFII-I) (19Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and WASP (20Baba Y.

Ozawa, and H. Mano, manuscript in preparation. Stimulation of cell surface receptors often induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of two unidentified Tec-binding proteins in addition to that of Tec. One of these Tec-binding phosphoproteins, p62, gives rise to a broad blurred band of ∼62–66 kDa on immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, suggesting that the protein is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues. The other Tec-binding phosphoprotein migrates at a position corresponding to a molecular size of ∼56 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p62 is induced by cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in B lymphocytes (23Kitanaka A. Mano H. Conley M.E. Campana D. Blood. 1998; 91: 940-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by activation of c-Kit in myeloid cells (24Tang B. Mano H. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8432-8437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicates that p62 is not identical to Sam68 or SHC. 3K. Yoshida, unpublished data.3K. Yoshida, unpublished data. The protein p62Dok-1 was isolated as a major substrate for activated Abl tyrosine kinases (25Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 26Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Dok-1 contains a PH domain at its NH2 terminus as well as multiple tyrosine residues that are potential binding sites for SH2 domains. Dok-1 is identical to the protein previously known as the GTPase-activating protein of Ras (RasGAP)-associated p62, which was shown to be an effective substrate for various PTKs (27Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and to undergo rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with insulin (28Hosomi Y. Shii K. Ogawa W. Matsuba H. Yoshida M. Okada Y. Yokono K. Kasuga M. Baba S. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11498-11502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (29Sanchez-Margalet V. Zoratti R. Sung C.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that it functions as a docking protein in signaling by a wide variety of mitogens. However, the biological role of Dok-1 has remained unclear. Although its ability to bind to RasGAP suggests that Dok-1 might function to inhibit Ras activity in vivo, such a role has not been proved yet. Dok-1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to BCR engagement in B cells or to c-Kit activation in myeloid cells (25Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Given the similarity in phosphorylation profile and molecular size between Dok-1 and the Tec-binding protein p62, we investigated whether these two proteins are identical. We have now shown that Tec associates through its SH2 domain with Dok-1 as well as phosphorylates tyrosine residues of Dok-1 at a high stoichiometry. Furthermore, BCR-induced phosphorylation of Dok-1 was inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Tec, suggesting that Tec is a key mediator of Dok-1 phosphorylation in the BCR signaling pathway. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that Dok-1 is a direct substrate of the PTK Tec and that, at least in BCR signaling, Tec is an important mediator of Dok-1 phosphorylation in vivo. Given that Dok-1 is hyperphosphorylated in cells expressing the Bcr-Abl fusion protein or v-Abl (25Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 26Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), it is likely that Dok-1 also serves as a substrate for these activated Abl proteins. In addition, c-Abl also efficiently phosphorylates Dok-1. Our data showing that a wide spectrum of nonreceptor PTKs phosphorylates Dok-1 suggest that this protein receives input from various such enzymes under different conditions. Integrin activation has recently been shown to regulate Dok-1 phosphorylation (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and evidence suggests that Dok-1 is also a substrate for receptor type PTKs. The function of Dok-1 in vivo has, however, remained unclear, although a recent study implicated this protein in insulin-induced cell migration (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Although Dok-1 was previously identified as a binding protein of RasGAP, it has been unclear whether Dok-1 activates or inhibits the activity of Ras. Our data support the latter of these two possibilities, consistent with the ability of Dok-1 to recruit RasGAP to the cell membrane in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, despite such Dok-1-mediated recruitment of RasGAP, Noguchi et al. (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) failed to detect inhibition of p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases in response to insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells that express human insulin receptors (IR) (Chinese hamster ovary-IR cells). These observations are not necessarily incompatible with our data. With the use of transfected 293 cells, we showed that Dok-1 appears to transmit a negative signal to Ras through RasGAP. In the Chinese hamster ovary-IR cells, however, activated insulin receptors also likely send a positive signal to mitogen-activated protein kinases (or Ras) independent of their signaling to Dok-1. IRS proteins undergo marked tyrosine phosphorylation in response to stimulation of insulin receptors and thereby provide docking sites for PI 3-kinase and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, the latter of which up-regulates Ras activity (43Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin receptors phosphorylate the adapter molecule SHC (44Paez-Espinosa V. Carvalho C.R. Alvarez-Rojas F. Janeri L. Velloso L.A. Boschero A.C. Saad M.J. Endocrine. 1998; 8: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is a potent activator of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These insulin receptor-evoked positive signals to Ras may therefore have masked Dok-1 regulation of Ras activity in the study of Noguchi et al. (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Dok-1 on multiple tyrosine residues, one of which may become a binding site for Nck (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), further suggests that Dok-1 may be functionally connected to a variety of signaling molecules in addition to RasGAP. Identification of cellular proteins that are recruited to these multiple phosphorylation sites of Dok-1 should clarify the in vivo roles of this protein (Fig.5).We showed that the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 in BA/F3 cells expressing an active form of Tec was >50-fold that apparent in the parental BA/F3 cells. Tec also associated with, and phosphorylated multiple tyrosine residues of, Dok-1 in 293 cells. Furthermore, BCR-induced phosphorylation of Dok-1 in Ramos cells was markedly inhibited by expression of dominant negative mutants of Tec. Together, these data support the occurrence of a physical and functional interaction between Tec and Dok-1. At least in Ramos cells, Tec appears to be the predominant PTK responsible for the activation of Dok-1 (Fig.5). However, the observation that a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 remained apparent in Ramos cells expressing dominant negative mutants of Tec suggests that other PTKs also contribute to phosphorylation of Dok-1 in these cells.Our data indicate that the SH2 domain of Tec binds to tyrosine residues of Dok-1 that are phosphorylated by Tec itself. Thus, the SH2 domain and the kinase domain of Tec appear to target the same tyrosine residues. This conclusion is consistent with the “processive phosphorylation” model proposed to account for the hyperphosphorylation of docking proteins by nonreceptor PTKs (36Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). According to this scenario, Tec first phosphorylates a tyrosine residue of Dok-1 that is then recognized and bound with high affinity by the SH2 domain of Tec. The interaction of this phosphotyrosine residue with the SH2 domain of Tec then allows the kinase domain of Tec to phosphorylate the next target tyrosine of Dok-1. Repetition of this cycle would result in the hyperphosphorylation of Dok-1 by Tec.The Tec family member Btk was not able to phosphorylate Dok-1 in 293 cells. Btk is abundant in Ramos cells and is activated in response to BCR stimulation (data not shown). However, in contrast to the situation with Tec, we were not able to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 in anti-Btk immunoprecipitates prepared from BCR-stimulated Ramos cells (data not shown). A similar discrepancy between the abilities of Tec and Itk to phosphorylate Dok-1 was recently described (45Yang W.C. Ghiotto M. Barbarat B. Olive D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1980063720,"Inactivation of DNA-mismatch repair underlies the genesis of microsatellite unstable (MSI) colon cancers. hPMS2 is one of several genes encoding components of the DNA-mismatch repair complex, and germline hPMS2 mutations have been found in a few kindreds with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC), in whom hereditary MSI colon cancers develop. However, mice bearing null hPMS2 genes do not develop colon cancers and hPMS2 mutations in sporadic human colon cancers have not been described. Here we report that in Vaco481 colon cancer the hPMS2 gene is inactivated by somatic mutations of both hPMS2 alleles. The cell line derived from this tumor is functionally deficient in DNA mismatch repair. This deficiency can be biochemically complemented by addition of a purified hMLH1-hPMS2 (hMutLalpha) complex. The hPMS2 deficient Vaco481 cancer cell line demonstrates microsatellite instability, an elevated HPRT gene mutation rate, and resistance to the cytotoxicity of the alkylator MNNG. We conclude that somatic inactivation of hPMS2 can play a role in development of sporadic MSI colon cancer expressing the full range of cancer phenotypes associated with inactivation of the mismatch repair system."
https://openalex.org/W2312827787,"BCL-2 family proteins play a central role in apoptosis regulation in mammals and in C. elegans. Mammalian cellular and viral anti-apoptosis proteins such as BCL-2 and E1B-19K interact with several cellular proteins. Some of these interacting proteins promote apoptosis and belong to the BCL-2 family. Certain BCL-2 family proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK share extensive sequence homology with BCL-2. In contrast, certain pro-apoptotic proteins such as BIK and BID share a single death effector domain, BH3, with other BCL-2 family proteins. By mutational analysis, we show that one of the cellular proteins, BNIP1 (previously Nip-1), that interacts with BCL-2 family anti-apoptosis proteins is a 'BH3 alone' pro-apoptotic protein. Transient transfection of BNIP1 induces a moderate level of apoptosis. Deletions of the N-terminal 32 amino acid region and the C-terminal trans-membrane domain did not significantly affect pro-apoptotic activity. In contrast, deletions encompassing a region containing a motif similar to the BH3-domain abrogated the apoptotic activity. Substitution of BNIP1 BH3 domain for the corresponding sequence in BAX efficiently restored the apoptotic activity of BAX, establishing the functional identity of the BH3 domain of BNIP1. The N-terminal deletions of BNIP1 (that retain the BH3 domain) enhanced the level of interaction with BCL-XL. Mutants containing the BH3 deletions were still able to heterodimerize with BCL-XL while mutants lacking both the N-terminal region and the BH3 domain were unable to heterodimerize, suggesting that BNIP1 may bind to BCL-XL via two different binding motifs."

Sempe P. Peterson P.A. Immunol. Res. 1996; 15: 208-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Viral-infected cells are identified through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 class I molecules that sample the viral antigens synthesized within cells (1Yang Y. Sempe P. Peterson P.A.

The degradation products, 8–10 amino acid peptides, are then translocated by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where they bind to MHC class I molecules stabilizing the assembly of a transmembrane class I heavy chain with a soluble β2-microglobulin. Only after the assembly of the trimolecular complex can these complexes be transported to the cell surface, via the exocytic pathway, for inspection by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The TAP transporter is a heterodimer composing of TAP1 and TAP2 (1Yang Y. Sempe P. Peterson P.A. Immunol. Res. 1996; 15: 208-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Elliott T. Adv.

The interaction between TAP transporters and MHC class I heterodimers requires the assistance of a MHC-encoded chaperone, tapasin (9Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The formation of TAP-class I complexes provides an efficient and effective means to load antigenic peptides from TAP transporters onto MHC class I molecules (1Yang Y. Sempe P. Peterson P.A. Immunol. Res. 1996; 15: 208-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Van Endert P.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the molecular and biochemical nature of the assembly of TAP-containing complexes as well as the biological importance of the functional regulation of TAP complexes in MHC class I antigen processing and presentation remains to be addressed. It has previously been observed that cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (OK), display a reduction of surface expression of MHC class I molecules (12Tector M. Zhang Q. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25816-25822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying a role for phosphorylation in the regulation of MHC class I antigen processing and presentation. Because TAP transporters and proteasomes are known to play essential roles in supplying antigenic peptides to MHC class I molecules (1Yang Y. Sempe P. Peterson P.A. Immunol. Res. 1996; 15: 208-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Fourie A.M. Yang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 232: 49-74PubMed Google Scholar), they are mostly likely to be targeted by cellular phosphorylation machinery to regulate MHC class I antigen presentation. Although several proteasome subunits have been shown to be phosphorylated (1Yang Y. Sempe P. Peterson P.A. Immunol. Res. 1996; 15: 208-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,14Wehren A.

Rep. 1999; 26: 11-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation does not seem to affect proteasomal generation of class I peptides. On the other hand, it has been well documented that phosphorylation affects the function of members of ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily (16Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 17Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Cytotechnology. 1998; 27: 31-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol.

Interestingly, the cytoplasmic domains of TAP transporters contain several conserved tyrosine, threonine, and serine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites (6Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ohta Y. Powis S.J. Coadwell W.J. Haliniewski D.E. Liu Y. Li H. Flajnik M.F. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that MHC class I antigen presentation is modulated by the phosphorylation of TAP complexes, we performed a systematic analysis to determine the effect of cellular phosphorylation on the formation and function of TAP complexes as well as on the expression of MHC class I molecules. We provide convincing evidence demonstrating that TAP function is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation and suggest that by interfering with antigenic peptide transport, TAP phosphorylation appears to play an important role in developing autoimmune diseases.

To increase the expression levels of TAP, cells were cultured for 2–3 days in the presence of 2000 or 500 units/ml of human or mouse interferon γ, respectively. Human and murine interferon γ were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Metabolic labeling of cells was carried out as described (26Yang Y. Früh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When necessary, cells were induced with interferon γ, labeled, and subsequently chased in the presence of culture medium for the times indicated in the individual experiments. Cells were solubilized either in 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline or 1% digitonin in a buffer (150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8) containing a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF) and proteinase inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml α1-antitrypsin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography were performed as described (27Yang Y. Waters J. Fruh K. Peterson P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4928-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine- or [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells were lysed in 1% digitonin lysis buffer. 200 μl of the resulting cell lysates was fractionated by using a gel filtration column (Superose 6, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.25 ml/min/fraction was collected (22Ahn K. Erlander M. Leturcq D. Peterson P. Früh K. Yang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each fraction was divided equally into two aliquots, immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Low and high molecular weight gel filtration calibration kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to calibrate the column (22Ahn K. Erlander M. Leturcq D. Peterson P. Früh K. Yang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 2000 units/ml interferon γ and subjected to infection with the Towne strain of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at a multiplicity of infection of 20 for 1 h in serum-free medium (28Ahn K.

After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were cultured either for an additional 96 h and used for microsome preparation, or for 1 additional hour and subjected to starvation for 1 h followed by a 4-h labeling in phosphate-free medium containing 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate, and an additional 0.5-h incubation with or without 1 μm OK thereafter. The cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitations were performed, and the resulting immunoprecipitated materials were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After a 48-h induction by interferon γ, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of OK for an additional 2 h, and lysed in a buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml α1-antitrypsin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% digitonin. Anti-TAP1 immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with the lysis buffer and subsequently washed twice with a kinase buffer (10 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF). The resulting immunoprecipitates were then incubated for 25 min at 30 °C in 5 μl of kinase buffer and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. For microsome preparation, cells were treated with or without OK at 0.1, 1, or 10 nm for 8 h and live cells were collected using Histopak 1080 (Sigma). Crude microsomes that were pretreated with 25 units/ml of a protein phosphatase for 15 min at 20 °C were purified and used as a control. The microsomes were purified, adjusted to A 280 = 60/ml for protein content, and used with a fluoresceinated reporter peptide (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled RYNATRGL) in a peptide transport assay (29Blevitt J.M. Fruh K. Glass C. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Huang S. J. Biomol. Screening. 1999; 4: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To examine whether TAP1 or TAP2 is phosphorylated, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis of TAP complexes using [32P]orthophosphate-labeled murine RMA or human HeLa cells. As shown in Fig.1 a, both murine and human TAP1 and TAP2 were phosphorylated, suggesting that TAP phosphorylation takes place physiologically. The extent of TAP phosphorylation increased ∼5-fold when the cells were treated with OK, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor. However, the changes in TAP phosphorylation were not detected with the use of several kinase inhibitors. 2Y. Li and Y. Yang, unpublished observations. The finding that the levels of TAP phosphorylation can be preserved and increased in the presence of OK suggests that the de-phosphorylation of TAP by cellular phosphatases takes place rapidly and physiologically. Because the state of cellular protein phosphorylation is known to be affected by viral infection (30Lee C.H. Yoon J.H. Kang K.H. Mol. Cells. 1994; 4: 481-485Google Scholar, 31Zhu H. Cong J.-P. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), we investigated whether virus-mediated changes in cellular phosphorylation affect the levels of TAP phosphorylation. Compared with mock-infected cells, the phosphorylation level of TAP in HCMV-infected cells increased ∼4-fold (Fig. 1 b). When HCMV-infected cells were treated with OK, the extent of TAP phosphorylation increased by an additional 4-fold. These results suggest that viral infection leads to an increase in TAP phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis of anti-TAP immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine, -serine, or -threonine antibodies demonstrated that both TAP1 and TAP2 were phosphorylated at the serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, in order of decreasing intensity,2 indicating that several types of kinases are responsible for TAP phosphorylation. It is conceivable that TAP phosphorylation might influence TAP dimerization, association with class I heterodimers, ATP binding, peptide binding, or peptide transport, resulting in changes in the surface expression levels of MHC class I molecules and affecting the recognition of antigen-presenting cells by CD8+ T lymphocytes. TAP supplies peptides to MHC class I molecules and promotes MHC class I surface expression (1Yang Y. Sempe P. Peterson P.A. Immunol. Res. 1996; 15: 208-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Fourie A.M. Yang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 232: 49-74PubMed Google Scholar, 32van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tish R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). If TAP phosphorylation interferes with TAP functions, changes in the surface expression levels of MHC class I molecules are most likely to take place. To investigate whether increased cellular phosphorylation, which leads to an increase in TAP phosphorylation, results in a reduction of MHC class I surface expression, we determined the surface expression levels of class I molecules in cells treated with or without kinase inhibitors or phosphatase inhibitors by flow cytometry. Treatment of cells with several kinase inhibitors did not alter the surface expression levels of MHC class I molecules.2 When cells were treated with phosphatase inhibitors, either OK or calyculin A,2 surface expression levels of MHC class I molecules, Db or Kb, decreased by ∼10- or ∼20-fold, respectively, compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 2). The surface expression of MHC class I molecules in OK-treated cells was restored upon removal of OK.2 These results suggest that increased cellular phosphorylation abrogates MHC class I surface expression and that OK-induced cellular phosphorylation does not permanently impair biosynthesis and intracellular transport of MHC class I molecules. To firmly rule out the possibility that the observed reduction in MHC class I surface expression is due to an inhibitory effect of OK on the MHC class I biosynthesis, we performed metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments under conditions that cells were treated with or without OK. As shown in Fig. 3, the amount of newly synthesized class I molecules in OK-treated cells was equivalent to those in untreated cells, suggesting that under the conditions used the biogenesis of class I molecules is not affected by OK or by increased cellular phosphorylation. However, these MHC class I molecules were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of the OK-treated cells as revealed by their faster electrophoretic mobilities as well as their sensitivity to endoglycosidase H digestion (upper panel of Fig. 3). Furthermore, by using a class I thermostability assay (33Ljunggren H.-G. Stam N.J. Ohlen C. Neefjes J.J. Hoglund P. Heemels M.-T. Bastin J. Schumacher T.N.M. Townsend A. Nature. 1990; 346: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 34Jackson M.R. Song E.S. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12117-12121Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) we determined that these endoplasmic reticulum-retained MHC class I molecules were “empty,”2 indicating they were void of class I-binding peptides. To examine whether the endoplasmic reticulum-retained MHC class I molecules can be transported intracellularly upon removal of OK, we analyzed the transport kinetics of MHC class I molecules in OK-treated cells by removing the phosphatase inhibitor during the course of intracellular transport. After removal of OK, the endoplasmic reticulum-retained MHC class I molecules regained the ability to be transported to the cell surface and became resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion (lower panel of Fig. 3). Because these MHC class I molecules become transport-competent once the cellular de-phosphorylation event is allowed to take place, the accumulation of empty class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum is most likely due to a limited supply of class I-binding peptides imposed by TAP phosphorylation (13Fourie A.M. Yang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 232: 49-74PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the observed increase in TAP phosphorylation interferes with TAP dimerization and/or association with class I heterodimers, we analyzed the assembly of TAP-containing complexes by gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation using [35S]methionine (Fig.4 a) or [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 4 b) labeled cells that were cultured in the presence or absence of OK. Regardless of whether the cells were treated with OK or not, the contents of TAP complexes, which contain TAP1, TAP2, tapasin, and empty class I heterodimers, were almost identical in [35S]methionine-labeled cells (Fig. 4 a). Densitometric analysis of the amounts of TAP complexes present in the fractions (Fig. 4 c) revealed that, while the fraction of TAP complexes in untreated cells peaked at fraction 49 (upper panel of Fig. 4 a), the peak fraction was reproducibly shifted to fraction 45 in OK-treated cells (middle panel of Fig. 4 a), indicating that formation of high molecular weight TAP complexes is induced when the level of cellular phosphorylation increases. Interestingly, a 43-kDa polypeptide, which was barely detected at fraction 45 in untreated samples, seemed to be preserved in TAP-containing complexes of the OK-treated cells (arrows, Fig. 4 a). When an aliquot of the same OK-treated cell lysates was treated with a protein phosphatase and then subjected to a gel filtration analysis, we found that the peak fraction of TAP-containing complexes was shifted back to fraction 49 (lower panel of Fig. 4 a). These results demonstrate that dynamic assembly and disassembly of high molecular weight TAP complexes is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation. In [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells, the peak for32P-labeled TAP complexes in untreated cell lysates remained at fraction 49, whereas the peak for TAP complexes in OK-treated cell lysates was reproducibly shifted to fraction 45 (Fig.4 b). The 43-kDa protein was clearly evident in32P-labeled TAP complexes of OK-treated cells (arrow, Fig. 4 b), but not in untreated cells, indicating that under physiological conditions, the association of this 43-kDa phosphoprotein with TAP complexes is either transient or unstable. These results strongly suggest that phosphorylation induces the formation of high molecular weight TAP complexes that contain phosphorylated TAP1, TAP2, tapasin, the 43-kDa protein, and non-phosphorylated class I molecules. Because TAP complexes are phosphorylated in vivo, we examined whether a kinase activity is present in TAP-containing complexes. As shown in Fig. 5, anti-TAP1 immunoprecipitate contained TAP1, TAP2, tapasin, class I heterodimers, and the 43-kDa protein. When an aliquot of the same anti-TAP1 immunoprecipitate was subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction with [γ-32P]ATP, we found that TAP and tapasin, but not class I heterodimers, were phosphorylated. These results suggest that TAP-containing complexes contain kinase(s) and that TAP complex-associated kinases selectively phosphorylate tapasin and TAP. To address the question of whether the ability of TAP to bind peptides and/or ATP is affected by phosphorylation, we compared TAP-expressing microsomes that were prepared from untreated or OK-treated cells, with those that were pretreated with protein phosphatase. We made use of a fluoresceinated reporter peptide (29Blevitt J.M. Fruh K. Glass C. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Huang S. J. Biomol. Screening. 1999; 4: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled RYNATRGL) and photoaffinity-labeled 8-[azido-γ-32P]ATP to assay for peptide (32van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tish R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and ATP binding (35Wang K. Früh K. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. FEBS Let. 1994; 350: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively. We found that the ability of TAP to bind peptides or ATP was not measurably affected, suggesting that TAP phosphorylation does not interfere with either peptide or ATP binding to TAP. We next examined whether phosphorylation affects TAP function in peptide transport (Fig.6 a). While TAP-expressing microsomes from untreated cells exhibited high peptide transport activity, the relative peptide transport activity in TAP-expressing microsomes decreased by ∼50% when 0.1 nm OK was used. When cells were treated with 1 nm OK, peptide transport activity was almost completely abrogated. These results suggest that the degree of TAP inhibition in the peptide transport inversely correlates with the extent of TAP phosphorylation. When the TAP-expressing microsomes from OK-treated cells were pretreated with a protein phosphatase prior to the assay, the TAP activity was substantially restored, suggesting that TAP-mediated peptide transport is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation. The effect of virus-induced TAP phosphorylation on TAP function was investigated. We prepared microsomes from HCMV-infected cells under the experimental infection conditions that the expression of US6, the only known TAP inhibitor in the HCMV genome (2Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 25Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J.H.J. Ploegh H.L. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Fruh K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), was not detected. We found that the peptide transport activity of TAP-expressing microsomes from HCMV-infected cells was reduced by 25%, compared with microsomes from mock-infected cells (Fig. 6 b). When the microsomes from HCMV-infected cells were pretreated with a protein phosphatase prior to the assays, the peptide transport activity was almost completely restored, suggesting that TAP inhibition imposed by HCMV infection can be reversed by the removal of protein phosphorylation. Because US6 is not expressed in HCMV-infected cells and because HCMV infection enhances TAP phosphorylation, it can be concluded that the difference in the extent of TAP inhibition between HCMV-infected and mock-infected cells is most likely attributed to the virus-induced TAP phosphorylation. These results strongly suggest that virus has exploited this regulatory TAP phosphorylation mechanism to evade host immune surveillance. Phosphorylation is known to modulate functions of members of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (7Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar, 16Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 17Germann U.A.

Castro A.F. Pourcher T. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: 370-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A typical example is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (18Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), which has been demonstrated to interact with Na+ and Cl−channels in airway epithelium as well as to modulate the function of renal K+ channels by altering the phosphorylation state of either renal K+ channels, associated proteins, or itself (36McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). TAP as an ATP-binding cassette transporter is no exception. TAP appears to be phosphorylated at several evolutionarily conserved residues present in its cytoplasmic domains (6Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ohta Y. Powis S.J. Coadwell W.J. Haliniewski D.E. Liu Y. Li H. Flajnik M.F. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a consequence of phosphorylation-induced formation of high molecular weight TAP-containing complexes, peptide transport activity of TAP is altered. The recent finding that TAP activity inversely correlates with its lateral mobility on the membrane (37Reits A.J. Vos J.C. Gromme M. Neefjes J. Nature. 2000; 404: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) leads us to suggest that TAP's mobility on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane might be the result of a dynamic assembly and disassembly of TAP complexes, which appear to be regulated by phosphorylation. We have carefully calibrated the gel filtration column used in the study and determined that the estimated molecular masses for soluble proteins at fractions 45 and 49 are ∼2200 and ∼750 kDa, respectively. However, molecules present in TAP-containing complexes are not soluble but transmembrane proteins, making the estimated molecular weight values for fractions 45 and 49 meaningless. In addition, the presence of additional TAP complex-associated factors, which may not be preserved with our immunoprecipitation protocol, may lead us to draw incorrect conclusions. Nevertheless, we have estimated that, with respect to TAP1, the phosphorylation intensity ratio of TAP1, TAP2, and tapasin is 1:1:1 at fraction 49, whereas at fraction 45 the ratio was changed to 1:0.1:15 (see Fig. 4 b). Because the phosphorylation level of tapasin seems to markedly increase in the TAP-containing complexes, it is possible that hyperphosphorylated tapasin plays a critical role in mediating the assembly of high molecular weight TAP complexes. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-TAP1, -TAP2, or -tapasin antibodies demonstrated that the 43-kDa protein is physically associated with the TAP complexes2 (Figs. 4 and 5). The finding that the main difference between the protein compositions of anti-TAP1 immunoprecipitates prepared from OK-treated and untreated cells was the amount of the 43-kDa protein (Fig. 4), in conjunction with the observation that the immunoprecipitates from cells without OK treatment had lower kinase activity (Fig. 5), suggests that the 43-kDa phosphoprotein is a TAP complex-associated kinase. Because TAP phosphorylation requires tyrosine, serine, and threonine kinases, the 43-kDa phosphoprotein appears to be one of several TAP complex-specific kinases. The observation that the amount of the 43-kDa protein in anti-TAP1 immunoprecipitates was greater than those in anti-TAP2 or -tapasin immunoprecipitates suggests that the 43-kDa phosphoprotein might directly interact with TAP1. Thus, in vivo the increased level of TAP1 phosphorylation could be due to this preferred association of the 43-kDa phosphoprotein with TAP1 (Fig. 4). Because the peptide transport activity of TAP in the 43-kDa protein-containing TAP complexes is severely altered, the 43-kDa protein-containing TAP complexes might represent a subset of non-functional TAP complexes, whose formation is promoted and/or preserved by phosphorylation. The finding that dephosphorylation of TAP complexes restores TAP peptide transport activity suggests that via phosphorylation TAP function is reversibly regulated by the dynamic assembly and disassembly of TAP complexes. It is conceivable that TAP phosphorylation is a regulatory mechanism that has evolved to control MHC class I antigen presentation in a tissue and/or cell-type specific manner. Because dephosphorylation of TAP occurs rapidly under physiological conditions, a role for TAP-specific phosphatases in regulating MHC class I antigen presentation can be envisaged. Under interferon induction TAP dephosphorylation takes place at a rate faster than its kinase-dependent phosphorylation, indicating that TAP-specific phosphatase activity is not a rate-limiting step in the MHC antigen presentation pathway. It is possible that, in antigen-presenting or viral-infected cells, expression of TAP-specific phosphatases is up-regulated by interferon. As a result of an increase in the activity of TAP-specific phosphatase, a net increase in TAP activity and an increase in the surface level of MHC class I expression can be achieved during cytotoxic immune response. At least two types of viruses, HCMV and herpes simplex virus, have evolved to have gene products, US6 (25Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J.H.J. Ploegh H.L. Peterson P.A. Yang Y.

Yang Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), respectively, which physically bind to, and inhibit TAP function, making TAP a proven target that has been exploited by virus to escape host immune detection. The present study demonstrates that virus-induced changes in the phosphorylation of cellular proteins (30Lee C.H. Yoon J.H. Kang K.H. Mol. Cells. 1994; 4: 481-485Google Scholar, 31Zhu H. Cong J.-P. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) increase the phosphorylation level of TAP complexes, thus affecting MHC class I antigen presentation. Because the kinase activity present in anti-TAP immunoprecipitates of HCMV-infected cells was greater than that in non-infected cells,2 TAP phosphorylation could be directly and/or indirectly enhanced by virus-encoded kinases (38Gilbert M.J. Riddel S.R. Plachter B. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 720-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 39Gallina A. Simoncini L. Garbelli S. Percivalle E. Pedrali-Noy G. Lee K.S. Erikson R.L.

Virol. 1998; 143: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One likely viral kinase candidate is the HCMV-encoded serine/threonine kinase pp65 (39Gallina A. Simoncini L. Garbelli S. Percivalle E. Pedrali-Noy G. Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Plachter B. Gerna G. Milanesi G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to selectively block antigen processing and presentation of its immediate-early gene product (38Gilbert M.J. Riddel S.R. Plachter B. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 720-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Alternatively, viruses might recruit host cellular kinases (31Zhu H. Cong J.-P. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) to catalyze TAP phosphorylation. Enhancing TAP phosphorylation represents a newly discovered mechanism that has been exploited by viruses to evade immune surveillance, further confirming that TAP is a target for virus-driven evolution to evade the immune system. Functional polymorphisms in rat and Syrian hamster TAP are known to change the peptide pool available for binding and presentation by MHC class I alleles (41Deverson E.V. Leong L. Seelig A.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, human TAP polymorphism has been shown to influence in vivo antigenic peptide presentation (44Quadri S.A. Singal D.P. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 61: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because several TAP polymorphic residues, such as those at codon positions 374 (Ser-Ala), 565 (Ala-Thr), and 665 (Ala-Thr) of TAP2 (6Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are potential sites of phosphorylation (20Ohta Y. Powis S.J. Coadwell W.J. Haliniewski D.E. Liu Y. Li H. Flajnik M.F. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), TAP phosphorylation at those sites could interfere with TAP-dependent transport of certain antigenic peptides. Indeed, a single amino acid substitution at position 374 in human TAP2 has been demonstrated to change the preference of transported peptides (45Armandola E.A. Momburg F. Nijenhuis M. Bulbuc N. Frueh K. Haemmerling G.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that abnormal TAP phosphorylation might lead to dangerous cytotoxic immune responses, perhaps developing into certain human autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease, diffuse panbronchiolitis, and Reiter's syndrome, all of which are known to have strong associations with TAP polymorphism (6Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ofosu M.H. Brown C. Cheatham W. Henry L. Austin C. Immunol.

Tissue Antigens. 1999; 53: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In light of the finding that viral infection changes the hosts cellular protein content and phosphorylation state, which in turn affects the TAP phosphorylation state, the issue of whether virus-mediated TAP phosphorylation contributes to the development of autoimmune diseases should be re-addressed.

https://openalex.org/W1974903652,"Abstract The slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) plays an important role during repolarization in the human heart. Life-threatening arrhythmias can be triggered by sympathetic stimulation, presumably acting on IKs. The ion channel responsible for the IKs current is made of two proteins, the KvLQT1 protein and the MinK protein. In this study, we investigated the effects of adrenergic stimulation on the KvLQT1/MinK channel by coexpressing KvLQT1/MinK channels with the human β3-adrenoreceptor subunit heterologously inXenopus oocytes. Western blot experiments revealed that β3-adrenoreceptor proteins appear in the cell membrane ofXenopus oocytes, when the corresponding cRNA was injected. In electrophysiological measurements we found that stimulation with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased the current amplitude of the β3/KvLQT1/MinK complex up to 237% with an ED50 of 8 nm, a value similar to that found on IKs in guinea pig cardiomyocytes. When oocytes with β3/KvLQT1/MinK were preincubated with cholera toxin (2 μg/ml), an activator of GS proteins, the basal current amplitude of the β3/KvLQT1/MinK complex was increased 3.1-fold, and the current amplitude increase by isoproterenol was drastically reduced, indicating that the signal transduction cascade was mediated via Gs proteins. The knowledge about functional coupling of the human β3-adrenoreceptor to KvLQT1/MinK channels reveals interesting aspects about the genesis and therapy of arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2324657720,"The activity of transcription factors is often modulated by signal responsive protein kinases. Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors are regulated by IkappaB inhibitors, the phosphorylation of which causes ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and activation of target genes. Here we report pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments showing that a mammalian 66 kDa protein kinase binds murine c-Rel, both in vitro and in vivo. This kinase appears to have at least two binding sites on c-Rel, a proline-directed serine/ threonine substrate specificity similar to MAP kinases and to specifically phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of murine c-Rel at an ERK consensus site."
https://openalex.org/W1589619954,"Designing synthetic vaccines from class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding antigenic peptides requires not only knowledge of the binding affinity of the designed peptide but also predicting the stability of the formed MHC-peptide complex. In order to better investigate structure-stability relationships, we have determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy the thermal stability of a class I MHC protein, HLA-B*2705, in complex with a set of 39 singly substituted peptide analogues. The influence of two anchoring side chains (P3 and P9) was studied by peptide mutation and appropriate site-directed mutagenesis of the HLA-B*2705 binding groove. The side chain at P9 is clearly the one that contributes the most to the thermal stability of the MHC-peptide complexes, as destabilization up to 25 °C are obtained after P9 mutation. Interestingly, structure-stability relationships do not fully mirror structure-binding relationships. As important as the C-terminal side chain are the terminal ammonium and carboxylate groups. Removal of a single H-bond between HLA-B27 and the terminal peptide moieties results in thermal destabilization up to 10 °C. Depending on the bound peptide and the location of the deleted H-bond, the decrease in the thermal stability of the corresponding complex is quantitatively different. The present study suggests that any peptidic amino acid at positions 3 and 9 promotes refolding of the B27-peptide complex. Once the complex is formed, the C-terminal side chain seems to play an important role for maintaining a stable complex."
