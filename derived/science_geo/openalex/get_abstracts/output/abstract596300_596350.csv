https://openalex.org/W2759487791,"Monitoring population trends of threatened species requires standardized techniques that can be applied over broad areas and repeated through time. Sun bears Helarctos malayanus are a forest dependent tropical bear found throughout most of Southeast Asia. Previous estimates of global population trends have relied on expert opinion and cannot be systematically replicated. We combined data from 1,463 camera traps within 31 field sites across sun bear range to model the relationship between photo catch rates of sun bears and tree cover. Sun bears were detected in all levels of tree cover above 20%, and the probability of presence was positively associated with the amount of tree cover within a 6-km2 buffer of the camera traps. We used the relationship between catch rates and tree cover across space to infer temporal trends in sun bear abundance in response to tree cover loss at country and global-scales. Our model-based projections based on this ""space for time"" substitution suggested that sun bear population declines associated with tree cover loss between 2000-2014 in mainland southeast Asia were ~9%, with declines highest in Cambodia and lowest in Myanmar. During the same period, sun bear populations in insular southeast Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei) were projected to have declined at a much higher rate (22%). Cast forward over 30-years, from the year 2000, by assuming a constant rate of change in tree cover, we projected population declines in the insular region that surpassed 50%, meeting the IUCN criteria for endangered if sun bears were listed on the population level. Although this approach requires several assumptions, most notably that trends in abundance across space can be used to infer temporal trends, population projections using remotely sensed tree cover data may serve as a useful alternative (or supplement) to expert opinion. The advantages of this approach is that it is objective, data-driven, repeatable, and it requires that all assumptions be clearly stated."
https://openalex.org/W2757522837,"Since the importance of DNA-binding proteins in multiple biomolecular functions has been recognized, an increasing number of researchers are attempting to identify DNA-binding proteins. In recent years, the machine learning methods have become more and more compelling in the case of protein sequence data soaring, because of their favorable speed and accuracy. In this paper, we extract three features from the protein sequence, namely NMBAC (Normalized Moreau-Broto Autocorrelation), PSSM-DWT (Position-specific scoring matrix—Discrete Wavelet Transform), and PSSM-DCT (Position-specific scoring matrix—Discrete Cosine Transform). We also employ feature selection algorithm on these feature vectors. Then, these features are fed into the training SVM (support vector machine) model as classifier to predict DNA-binding proteins. Our method applys three datasets, namely PDB1075, PDB594 and PDB186, to evaluate the performance of our approach. The PDB1075 and PDB594 datasets are employed for Jackknife test and the PDB186 dataset is used for the independent test. Our method achieves the best accuracy in the Jacknife test, from 79.20% to 86.23% and 80.5% to 86.20% on PDB1075 and PDB594 datasets, respectively. In the independent test, the accuracy of our method comes to 76.3%. The performance of independent test also shows that our method has a certain ability to be effectively used for DNA-binding protein prediction.

https://openalex.org/W2757371372,"Extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is an important mechanism involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Genetic variations of MMPs have shown association with multiple cancers. The present study is focused to elucidate the association of MMP-1, 3 and 9 genetic variants with respect to epidemiological and clinicopathological variables by haplotype, LD, MDR, survival in silico analyses among South Indian women.MMP3-1171 5A/6A and MMP9-1562 C/T SNPs were genotyped by Allele specific polymerase chain reaction and MMP1-1607 1G/2G polymorphism by restriction fragment length polymorphism assays respectively, in 300 BC patients and age-matched 300 healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed using the SNPStats and SPSS software. Linkage disequilibrium and gene-gene interactions were performed using Haploview and MDR software respectively. Further, transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of SNPs under study were carried out using AliBaba2.1 software.We have observed an increased frequency of 2G-allele of MMP1, 6A-allele of MMP3 and T-allele of MMP9 (p<0.05) respectively in BC subjects. The 2G-6A haplotype (minor alleles of MMP-1 and MMP-3 respectively) has shown an increased susceptibility to BC. Further, MMP polymorphisms were associated with the clinical characteristics of BC patients such as steroid hormone receptor status, lymph node involvement and metastasis. SNP combinations were in perfect LD in controls. MDR analysis revealed a positive interaction between the SNPs. 5-years survival rate and cox-regression analysis showed a significant association with clinicopathological variables.Our results suggest that MMP1-1607 1G/2G, MMP3-1171 5A/6A and MMP9-1562 C/T gene polymorphisms have synergistic effect on breast cancer. The interactions of MMPs clinical risk factors such as lymph node involvement has shown a strong correlation and might influence the 5-years survival rate, suggesting their potential role in the breast carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2756522357,"Our previous study has found that circulating microRNA (miRNA, or miR) -122, -140-3p, -720, -2861, and -3149 are significantly elevated during early stage of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study was conducted to determine the origin of these elevated plasma miRNAs in ACS.qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression profiles of these 5 miRNAs in liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, skeletal muscles, and heart. To determine their origins, these miRNAs were detected in myocardium of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and as well in platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, including monocytes, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and lymphocytes) of the AMI pigs and ACS patients.MiR-122 was specifically expressed in liver, and miR-140-3p, -720, -2861, and -3149 were highly expressed in heart. Compared with the sham pigs, miR-122 was highly expressed in the border zone of the ischemic myocardium in the AMI pigs without ventricular fibrillation (P < 0.01), miR-122 and -720 were decreased in platelets of the AMI pigs, and miR-122, -140-3p, -720, -2861, and -3149 were increased in PBMCs of the AMI pigs (all P < 0.05). Compared with the non-ACS patients, platelets miR-720 was decreased and PBMCs miR-122, -140-3p, -720, -2861, and -3149 were increased in the ACS patients (all P < 0.01). Furthermore, PBMCs miR-122, -720, and -3149 were increased in the AMI patients compared with the unstable angina (UA) patients (all P < 0.05). Further origin identification revealed that the expression levels of miR-122 in CECs and lymphocytes, miR-140-3p and -2861 in monocytes and CECs, miR-720 in monocytes, and miR-3149 in CECs were greatly up-regulated in the ACS patients compared with the non-ACS patients, and were higher as well in the AMI patients than that in the UA patients except for the miR-122 in CECs (all P < 0.05).The elevated plasma miR-122, -140-3p, -720, -2861, and -3149 in the ACS patients were mainly originated from CECs and monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2757694213,"Background Oxidative stress and inflammatory factors are deeply involved in progression of atherosclerosis. Mitochondrion-targeted peptide SS-31, selectively targeting to mitochondrial inner membrane reacting with cardiolipin, has been reported to inhibit ROS generation and mitigate inflammation. The present study was designed to investigate whether SS-31 could suppress the development of atherosclerosis in vivo. Methods Male ApoE-/- mice (8 weeks old) fed with Western diet were treated with normal saline or SS-31 (1 mg/kg/d or 3 mg/kg/d) through subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks. Oil Red O staining was performed to evaluate area and sizes of the plaques. DHE staining and immunohistochemical staining of 8-OHDG was performed to assess the oxidative stress. The aorta ATP contents were assessed by the ATP bioluminescence assay kit. Immunohistochemical staining of CD68 and α-SMA and Masson’s trichrome staining were performed to evaluate the composition of atherosclerotic plaque. Biochemical assays were performed to determine the protein level and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The levels of CD36, LOX-1 and ABCA1 were immunohistochemically and biochemically determined to evaluate the cholesterol transport in aorta and peritoneal macrophages. Inflammatory factors, including ICAM-1, MCP-1, IL-6 and CRP in serum, were detected through ELISA. Results SS-31 administration reduced the area and sizes of western diet-induced atherosclerotic plaques and changed the composition of the plaques in ApoE-/- mice. Oxidative stress was suppressed, as evidenced by the reduced DHE stain, down-regulated 8-OHDG expression, and increased SOD activity after chronic SS-31 administration. Moreover, systemic inflammation was ameliorated as seen by decreasing serum ICAM-1, MCP-1, and IL-6 levels. Most importantly, SS-31 administration inhibited cholesterol influx by down-regulating expression of CD36 and LOX-1 to prevent lipid accumulation to further suppress the foam cell formation and atherosclerotic progression. Conclusion Administration of SS-31 prevents against atherosclerotic formation in ApoE-/- mice suggesting that SS-31 might be considered to be a potential drug to prevent atherosclerotic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2756643793,"An important role of genetic factors in the development of breast cancer (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC) in Taiwanese (ethnic Chinese) patients has been suggested. However, other than germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which are related to hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC), cancer-predisposition genes have not been well studied in this population. The aim of the present study was to more accurately summarize the prevalence of genetic mutations in HBOC patients using various gene panels ranging in size from BRCA1/2 alone to multi-gene panels. Among 272 HBOC patients analyzed, the prevalence of BRCA1, BRCA2 and non-BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations was 7.7% (21/272), 6.8% (16/236) and 8.2% (13/159), respectively. The total mutation rate was 18.4% (50/272). Although no founder mutations were identified in this study, two recurrent mutations, BRCA1 (c.3607C>T) and BRCA2 (c.5164_5165 delAG), were found. The main pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes included ATM, BRIP1, FANCI, MSH2, MUYTH, RAD50, RAD51C and TP53. The prevalence rate of gene mutations in HBOC patients did not differ with respect to whether BC or OC was the first diagnosis or they presented a family history of the disease or their age at diagnosis. HBOC patients with both BC and OC exhibited a higher prevalence rate of mutations (50.0%) than patients with OC (25.0%) or BC (8.6%) alone. In conclusion, evaluation of hereditary cancer risk in Taiwan HBOC patients, particularly individuals with double cancer, is strongly encouraged. Panel testing can yield additional genomic information, and widespread and well-designed panel testing will help in assessing more accurate mutational prevalence of risk genes."
https://openalex.org/W2758076042,"Global metabolomic profiling offers novel opportunities for the discovery of biomarkers and for the elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms that might lead to the development of novel therapies. GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) is an inborn error of metabolism due to reduced function of glucose transporter type 1. Clinical presentation of GLUT1-DS is heterogeneous and the disorder mirrors patients with epilepsy, movement disorders, or any paroxysmal events or unexplained neurological manifestation triggered by exercise or fasting. The diagnostic biochemical hallmark of the disease is a reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/blood glucose ratio and the only available treatment is ketogenic diet. This study aimed at advancing our understanding of the biochemical perturbations in GLUT1-DS pathogenesis through biochemical phenotyping and the treatment of GLUT1-DS with a ketogenic diet. Metabolomic analysis of three CSF samples from GLUT1-DS patients not on ketogenic diet was feasible inasmuch as CSF sampling was used for diagnosis before to start with ketogenic diet. The analysis of plasma and urine samples obtained from GLUT1-DS patients treated with a ketogenic diet showed alterations in lipid and amino acid profiles. While subtle, these were consistent findings across the patients with GLUT1-DS on ketogenic diet, suggesting impacts on mitochondrial physiology. Moreover, low levels of free carnitine were present suggesting its consumption in GLUT1-DS on ketogenic diet. 3-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, 3-methyladipate, and N-acetylglycine were identified as potential biomarkers of GLUT1-DS on ketogenic diet. This is the first study to identify CSF, plasma, and urine metabolites associated with GLUT1-DS, as well as biochemical changes impacted by a ketogenic diet. Potential biomarkers and metabolic insights deserve further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2758616877,"Complementary medicine (CM) is utilized in a growing number of academic centers despite the debate concerning its value, risks and benefits. Healthcare professionals often feel uncomfortable discussing CM with patients, and little is known about their sources of knowledge in the field of CM.To assess healthcare professionals' sources of knowledge and attitude toward CM in an academic hospital.The cross-sectional web-based survey took place from October to December 2013. A total of 4,925 healthcare professionals working at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, were invited to answer the questionnaire.Factors influencing healthcare professionals' opinion toward CM, knowledge and communication about CM.The questionnaire was answered by 1,247 healthcare professionals. The three key factors influencing professionals' opinion toward CM were personal experience, clinical experience and evidence demonstrating the physiological mechanism of CM. Personal experience was more associated with nurses' and midwives' opinion compared to physicians' (80.8% vs 57.1%, OR = 3.08, [95% CI: 2.35-4.05], P<0.001 and 85.3% vs 57.1%, OR = 3.83, [95% CI: 1.95-7.53], P<0.001, respectively) as well as with professionals trained in CM compared to non-trained professionals (86.0% vs 73.2%, OR = 2.60, [95% CI: 1.92-3.53], P<0.001). Physicians relied more on randomized controlled clinical trials compared to nurses (81.3% vs 62.9%, OR = 0.43, [95% CI: 0.33-0.57], P<0.001). A majority of the respondents (82.5%) agreed that they lacked knowledge about CM and 65.0% noted that it was the patient who initially started the discussion about CM.Different professionals used different strategies to forge opinions regarding CM: physicians relied more on scientific evidence, while nurses and midwives were more influenced by personal experience. Regardless of preferred information source, most respondents did not feel prepared to address patient questions regarding CM. Enhancing interprofessional education opportunities is an important strategy to help providers become empowered to discuss CM with patients. This in turn will help patients making informed decisions in their healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W2760425022,"Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium are important food-borne bacterial pathogens, which are responsible for diarrhea and gastroenteritis in humans and animals. In this study, S. typhimurium bacterial ghost (STG) was generated based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Experimental studies performed using in vitro and in vivo experimental model systems to characterize effects of STG as a vaccine candidate. When compared with murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) exposed to PBS buffer (98.1%), the macrophages exposed to formalin-killed inactivated cells (FKC), live wild-type bacterial cells and NaOH-induced STG at 1 × 108 CFU/mL showed 85.6%, 66.5% and 84.6% cell viability, respectively. It suggests that STG significantly reduces the cytotoxic effect of wild-type bacterial cells. Furthermore, STG is an excellent inducer for mRNAs of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β) and factor (iNOS), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and dual activities (IL-6) in the stimulated macrophage cells. In vivo, STG vaccine induced humoral and cellular immune responses and protection against homologous and heterologous challenges in rats. Furthermore, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of STG vaccine were compared with those of FKC and non-vaccinated PBS control groups. The vaccinated rats from STG group exhibited higher levels of serum IgG antibody responses, serum bactericidal antibodies, and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations than those of the FKC and PBS control groups. Most importantly, after challenge with homologous and heterologous strains, the bacterial loads in the STG group were markedly lower than the FKC and PBS control groups. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the STG vaccine induces protective immunity against homologous and heterologous challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2760622413,"Several ethical aspects in the management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) are still controversial, including family planning and testing for disease presence in at-risk individuals. We performed an online survey aiming to assess the opinion and current clinical practice of European pediatric and adult nephrologists, as well as geneticists. A total of 410 clinicians (53% male, mean (SD) age of 48 (10) years) responded, including 216 pediatric nephrologists, 151 adult nephrologists, and 43 clinical geneticists. While the 3 groups agreed to encourage clinical testing in asymptomatic ADPKD minors and adults, only geneticists would recommend genetic testing in asymptomatic at-risk adults (P<0.001). Statistically significant disagreement between disciplines was observed regarding the ethical justification of prenatal genetic diagnosis, termination of pregnancy and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for ADPKD. Particularly, PGD is ethically justified according to geneticists (4.48 (1.63)), whereas pediatric (3.08 (1.78); P<0.001) and adult nephrologists (3.66 (1.88); P<0.05) appeared to be less convinced. Our survey suggests that most clinicians support clinical testing of at-risk minors and adults in ADPKD families. However, there is no agreement for genetic testing in asymptomatic offspring and for family planning, including PGD. The present data highlight the need for a consensus among clinicians, to avoid that ADPKD families are being given conflicting information."
https://openalex.org/W2757020002,"Since wind power is integrated into the thermal power operation system, dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED) has become a new challenge due to its uncertain characteristics. This paper proposes an adaptive grid based multi-objective Cauchy differential evolution (AGB-MOCDE) for solving stochastic DEED with wind power uncertainty. To properly deal with wind power uncertainty, some scenarios are generated to simulate those possible situations by dividing the uncertainty domain into different intervals, the probability of each interval can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function, and a stochastic DEED model can be formulated under different scenarios. For enhancing the optimization efficiency, Cauchy mutation operation is utilized to improve differential evolution by adjusting the population diversity during the population evolution process, and an adaptive grid is constructed for retaining diversity distribution of Pareto front. With consideration of large number of generated scenarios, the reduction mechanism is carried out to decrease the scenarios number with covariance relationships, which can greatly decrease the computational complexity. Moreover, the constraint-handling technique is also utilized to deal with the system load balance while considering transmission loss among thermal units and wind farms, all the constraint limits can be satisfied under the permitted accuracy. After the proposed method is simulated on three test systems, the obtained results reveal that in comparison with other alternatives, the proposed AGB-MOCDE can optimize the DEED problem while handling all constraint limits, and the optimal scheme of stochastic DEED can decrease the conservation of interval optimization, which can provide a more valuable optimal scheme for real-world applications."
https://openalex.org/W2757222109,"Washington DC has a high burden of HIV with a 2.0% HIV prevalence. The city is a national and international hub potentially containing a broad diversity of HIV variants; yet few sequences from DC are available on GenBank to assess the evolutionary history of HIV in the US capital. Towards this general goal, here we analyze extensive sequence data and investigate HIV diversity, phylodynamics, and drug resistant mutations (DRM) in DC.Molecular HIV-1 sequences were collected from participants infected through 2015 as part of the DC Cohort, a longitudinal observational study of HIV+ patients receiving care at 13 DC clinics. Sequences were paired with Cohort demographic, risk, and clinical data and analyzed using maximum likelihood, Bayesian and coalescent approaches of phylogenetic, network and population genetic inference. We analyzed 601 sequences from 223 participants for int (~864 bp) and 2,810 sequences from 1,659 participants for PR/RT (~1497 bp).Ninety-nine and 94% of the int and PR/RT sequences, respectively, were identified as subtype B, with 14 non-B subtypes also detected. Phylodynamic analyses of US born infected individuals showed that HIV population size varied little over time with no significant decline in diversity. Phylogenetic analyses grouped 13.5% of the int sequences into 14 clusters of 2 or 3 sequences, and 39.0% of the PR/RT sequences into 203 clusters of 2-32 sequences. Network analyses grouped 3.6% of the int sequences into 4 clusters of 2 sequences, and 10.6% of the PR/RT sequences into 76 clusters of 2-7 sequences. All network clusters were detected in our phylogenetic analyses. Higher proportions of clustered sequences were found in zip codes where HIV prevalence is highest (r = 0.607; P<0.00001). We detected a high prevalence of DRM for both int (17.1%) and PR/RT (39.1%), but only 8 int and 12 PR/RT amino acids were identified as under adaptive selection. We observed a significant (P<0.0001) association between main risk factors (men who have sex with men and heterosexuals) and genotypes in the five well-supported clusters with sufficient sample size for testing.Pairing molecular data with clinical and demographic data provided novel insights into HIV population dynamics in Washington, DC. Identification of populations and geographic locations where clustering occurs can inform and complement active surveillance efforts to interrupt HIV transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2758539689,"Chromatin remodeling complexes facilitate the access of condensed genomic DNA during transcription, replication, and repair, by altering the histone-DNA contacts in the nucleosome structures. SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) family of ATP dependent chromatin remodeling complexes have been documented for their tumour suppressor function. Recent studies have reported the high frequency of cancer causing mutations in this protein family. There exist multiple subunits for this complex and can form context-dependent sub-complexes. The cataloguing of individual subunits of this complex is essential for understanding their specific functions and their mechanism of action during chromatin remodeling. This would also facilitate further studies to characterize cancer causing mutations in SWI/SNF subunits. In the current study, a database containing information on the subunits of SWI/SNF-α (BRG1/BRM-Associated Factors (BAF)) and SWI/SNF-β (Polybromo-Associated BAF (PBAF)) sub classes of SWI/SNF family has been curated and catalogued. The database hosts information on 27 distinct SWI/SNF subunits from 20 organisms spanning a wide evolutionary range of eukaryotes. A non-redundant set of 522 genes coding for SWI/SNF subunits have been documented in the database. A detailed annotation on each subunit, including basic protein/gene information, protein sequence, functional domains, homologs and missense mutations of human proteins have been provided with a user-friendly graphical interface. The SWI/SNF Infobase presented here, would be a first of its kind exclusive information portal on SWI/SNF complex subunits and would be a valuable resource for the research community working on chromatin remodeling. The database is available at http://scbt.sastra.edu/swisnfdb/index.php."
https://openalex.org/W2757147410,"Vaginally applied microbicide products offer a female-controlled strategy for preventing sexual transmission of HIV. Microbicide transport processes are central to their functioning, and there is a clear need for a better understanding of them. To contribute to that end, we developed an assay to analyze mass transport rates of microbicide molecules within the epithelial and stromal layers of polarized vaginal mucosal tissue during contact with a gel vehicle. The assay utilizes a new diffusion chamber mounted in a custom instrument that combines confocal Raman spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography. This measures depth-resolved microbicide concentration distributions within epithelium and stroma. Data for a tenofovir gel were fitted with a compartmental diffusion model to obtain fundamental transport properties: the molecular diffusion and partition coefficients in different compartments. Diffusion coefficients in epithelium and stroma were computed to be 6.10 ± 2.12 x 10−8 and 4.52 ± 1.86 x 10−7 cm2/sec, respectively. The partition coefficients between epithelium and gel and between stroma and epithelium were found to be 0.53 ± 0.15 and 1.17 ± 0.16, respectively. These drug transport parameters are salient in governing the drug delivery performance of different drug and gel vehicle systems. They can be used to contrast drugs and vehicles during product design, development and screening. They are critical inputs to deterministic transport models that predict the gels’ pharmacokinetic performance, which can guide improved design of products and optimization of their dosing regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2758509781,"SORBS2 is a scaffolding protein associated with Abl/Arg non-receptor tyrosine kinase pathways and is known to interact with actin and several other cytoskeletal proteins in various cell types. Previous BioID proximity labeling of tight and adherens junction proteins suggested that SORBS2 is a component of the apical junction complex of epithelial cells. We asked whether SORBS2 plays a previously unappreciated role in controlling perijunctional actin and tight junction barrier function. Using super resolution imaging we confirmed that SORBS2 is localized at the apical junction complex but farther from the membrane than ZO-1 and located partially overlapping both the tight- and adherens junctions with a periodic concentration that alternates with myosin IIB in polarized epithelial cells. Overexpression of GFP-SORBS2 recruited alpha-actinin, vinculin and N-WASP, and possibly CIP4 to cellular junctions. However, CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out of SORBS2 did not alter the localization- or immunofluorescent staining intensity of these or several other junctional- and cytoskeletal proteins. SORBS2 knock-out also did not affect the barrier function as measured by TER and dextran flux; nor did it change actin-dependent junction re-assembly as measured by Ca2+-switch and Latrunculin-B wash-out assays. The kinetics of HGF-induced cell scattering and wound healing, and dextran flux increase induced by PDGF also were unaffected by SORBS2 knock-out. SORBS2 concentrates with apical junctional actin that accumulates in response to knock-down of ZO-1 and ZO-2. In spite of our finding that SORBS2 is clearly a component of the apical junction complex, it does not appear to be required for either normal tight- or adherens junction assembly, structure or function or for growth factor-mediated changes in tight junction dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2759330500,"This paper investigates a well-known complex combinatorial problem known as the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). Unlike the standard vehicle routing problem, each customer in the VRPTW is served within a given time constraint. This paper solves the VRPTW using an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm. The performance of this algorithm is improved by a local optimization based on a crossover operation and a scanning strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the IABC is evaluated on some well-known benchmarks. The results demonstrate the power of IABC algorithm in solving the VRPTW."
https://openalex.org/W2759447655,"Introduction End-of-life decisions after stroke should be guided by accurate estimates of the patient’s prognosis. We assessed the accuracy of physicians’ estimates regarding mortality, functional outcome, and quality of life in patients with severe stroke. Methods Treating physicians predicted mortality, functional outcome (modified Rankin scale (mRS)), and quality of life (visual analogue scale (VAS)) at six months in patients with major disabling stroke who had a Barthel Index ≤6 (of 20) at day four. Unfavorable functional outcome was defined as mRS >3, non-satisfactory quality of life as VAS <60. Patients were followed-up at six months after stroke. We compared physicians’ estimates with actual outcomes. Results Sixty patients were included, with a mean age of 72 years. Of fifteen patients who were predicted to die, one actually survived at six months (positive predictive value (PPV), 0.93; 95% CI, 0.66–0.99). Of thirty patients who survived, one was predicted to die (false positive rate (FPR), 0.03; 95%CI 0.00–0.20). Of forty-six patients who were predicted to have an unfavorable outcome, four had a favorable outcome (PPV, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98; FPR, 0.30; 95% CI; 0.08–0.65). Prediction of non-satisfactory quality of life was less accurate (PPV, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.26–0.90; FPR, 0.18; 95% CI 0.05–0.44). Conclusions In patients with severe stroke, treating physicians’ estimation of the risk of mortality or unfavorable functional outcome at six months is relatively inaccurate. Prediction of quality of life is even more imprecise."
https://openalex.org/W2759613812,"The invasive green alga Caulerpa cylindracea has become an important component of the diet of the Mediterranean white seabream Diplodus sargus. As a consequence of this ""exotic diet"", the algal bisindolic alkaloid caulerpin accumulates in the fish tissues. Although the compound shows structural similarity to endogenous indolamines that modulate animal behaviour, the potential impact of caulerpin on fish behaviour still remains unexplored. In this report, behavioural experiments both on groups and on single fish responding towards a mirror were performed under different doses of dietary caulerpin. Differences between treated and control groups for each behaviour and for the overall aggressive pattern during the different experimental phases showed that the aggressiveness of D. sargus decreased with the administration of caulerpin. These results call the attention to a still unexplored potential ability of bioactive metabolites from marine invasive species, to alter the behaviour on native species, with putative negative effects on patterns of fish growth and population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2758877208,"In the plant cell wall, boron links two pectic domain rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) chains together to form a dimer and thus contributes to the reinforcement of cell adhesion. We studied the mur1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana which has lost the ability to form GDP-fucose in the shoots and show that the extent of RG-II cross-linking is reduced in the lignified stem of this mutant. Surprisingly, MUR1 mutation induced an enrichment of resistant interunit bonds in lignin and triggered the overexpression of many genes involved in lignified tissue formation and in jasmonic acid signaling. The defect in GDP-fucose synthesis induced a loss of cell adhesion at the interface between stele and cortex, as well as between interfascicular fibers. This led to the formation of regenerative xylem, where tissue detachment occurred, and underlined a loss of resistance to mechanical forces. Similar observations were also made on bor1-3 mutant stems which are altered in boron xylem loading, leading us to suggest that diminished RG-II dimerization is responsible for regenerative xylem formation."
https://openalex.org/W2756697896,"Psbetaeudomonas (P.) aeruginosa infection of the cornea in BALB/c mice does not result in perforation and the mice have been classified as resistant. However, regulation of this response via inflammasome activation remained untested. Therefore, BALB/c mice were infected with P. aeruginosa ATCC strain 19660 and NLRP3 and NLRC4 protein tested by ELISA. Since NLRC4 vs NLRP3 protein levels were significantly higher in the corneas of BALB/c at 1 and 5 days postinfection we used silencing to knockdown NLRC4. Silencing NLRC4 vs scrambled siRNA treatment exacerbated disease in BALB/c mice, reduced myeloperoxidase levels and elevated bacterial plate counts at 5 days postinfection. It also increased pro IL-1beta, but reduced total protein for IL-1beta and IL-18 at 5 days postinfection. Flow cytometry to identify cells affected by silencing, showed reduced caspase-1 levels in a CD11blowLy6Glow population of cells, (but not PMN or macrophages) from the infected cornea of siNLRC4 treated mice that produced less mature IL-1beta. These data provide evidence that the NLRC4 inflammasome contributes to resistance through regulation of caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 in a CD11blowLy6Glow population of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2759340633,"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is one of the most lethal inherited cardiac arrhythmias mostly linked to cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) mutations with high disease penetrance. Interestingly, a novel RyR2 mutation G357S discovered in a large family of more than 1400 individuals has reduced penetrance. The molecular basis for the incomplete disease penetrance in this family is unknown. To gain insights into the variable disease expression in this family, we determined the impact of the G357S mutation on RyR2 function and expression. We assessed spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 wildtype and the G357S mutant during store Ca2+ overload, also known as store overload induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). We found that the G357S mutation reduced the percentage of RyR2-expressing cells that showed SOICR. However, in cells that displayed SOICR, G357S reduced the thresholds for the activation and termination of SOICR. Furthermore, G357S decreased the thermal stability of the N-terminal domain of RyR2, and markedly reduced the protein expression of the full-length RyR2. On the other hand, the G357S mutation did not alter the Ca2+ activation of [3H]ryanodine binding or the Ca2+ induced release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores in HEK293 cells. These data indicate that the CPVT-associated G357S mutation enhances the arrhythmogenic SOICR and reduces RyR2 protein expression, which may be attributable to the incomplete penetrance of CPVT in this family."
https://openalex.org/W2759469234,"The pupil response under constant illumination can be used as a marker of cognitive processes. In the past, pupillary responses have been studied in the context of arousal and decision-making. However, recent work involving Parkinson's patients suggested that pupillary responses are additionally affected by reward sensitivity. Here, we build on these findings by examining how pupil responses are modulated by reward and loss while participants (N = 30) performed a Pavlovian reversal learning task. In fast (transient) pupil responses, we observed arousal-based influences on pupil size both during the expectation of upcoming value and the evaluation of unexpected monetary outcomes. Importantly, after incorporating eye blink rate (EBR), a behavioral correlate of striatal dopamine levels, we observed that participants with lower EBR showed stronger pupil dilation during the expectation of upcoming reward. Subsequently, when reward expectations were violated, participants with lower EBR showed stronger pupil responses after experiencing unexpected loss. Across trials, the detection of a reward contingency reversal was reflected in a slow (tonic) dilatory pupil response observed already several trials prior to the behavioral report. Interestingly, EBR correlated positively with this tonic detection response, suggesting that variability in the arousal-based detection response may reflect individual differences in striatal dopaminergic tone. Our results provide evidence that a behavioral marker of baseline striatal dopamine level (EBR) can potentially be used to describe the differential effects of value-based learning in the arousal-based pupil response."
https://openalex.org/W2757165527,"Most vectors of arthropod-borne diseases produce large eggs with hard and opaque eggshells. In several species, it is still not possible to induce molecular perturbations to the embryo by delivery of molecules using microinjections or eggshell permeabilization without losing embryo viability, which impairs basic studies regarding development and population control. Here we tested the properties and permeability of the eggshell of R. prolixus, a Chagas disease vector, with the aim to deliver pharmacological inhibitors to the egg cytoplasm and allow controlled molecular changes to the embryo. Using field emission scanning and transmission electron microscopy we found that R. prolixus egg is coated by three main layers: exochorion, vitelline layer and the plasma membrane, and that the pores that allow gas exchange (aeropiles) have an average diameter of 10 μm and are found in the rim of the operculum at the anterior pole of the egg. We tested if different solvents could permeate through the aeropiles and reach the egg cytoplasm/embryo and found that immersions of the eggs in ethanol lead to its prompt penetration through the aeropiles. A single five minute-immersion of the eggs/embryos in pharmacological inhibitors, such as azide, cyanide and cycloheximide, solubilized in ethanol resulted in impairment of embryogenesis in a dose dependent manner and DAPI-ethanol solutions were also able to label the embryo cells, showing that ethanol penetration was able to deliver those molecules to the embryo cells. Multiple immersions of the embryo in the same solutions increased the effect and tests using bafilomycin A1 and Pepstatin A, known inhibitors of the yolk proteolysis, were also able to impair embryogenesis and the yolk protein degradation. Additionally, we found that ethanol pre-treatments of the egg make the aeropiles more permeable to aqueous solutions, so drugs diluted in water can be carried after the eggs are pre-treated with ethanol. Thus, we found that delivery of pharmacological inhibitors to the embryo of R. prolixus can be performed simply by submersing the fertilized eggs in ethanol with no need for additional methods such as microinjections or electroporation. We discuss the potential importance of this methodology to the study of this vector developmental biology and population control."
https://openalex.org/W2759505716,"Background Ischemic mitral regurgitation (iMR) predisposes to right ventricular (RV) pressure and volume overload, providing a nidus for RV dysfunction (RVDYS) and non-ischemic fibrosis (NIF). Echocardiography (echo) is widely used to assess iMR, but performance of different indices as markers of RVDYS and NIF is unknown. Methods iMR patients prospectively underwent echo and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) within 72 hours. Echo quantified iMR, assessed conventional RV indices (TAPSE, RV-S’, fractional area change [FAC]), and strain via speckle tracking in apical 4-chamber (global longitudinal strain [RV-GLS]) and parasternal long axis orientation (transverse strain). CMR volumetrically quantified RVEF, and assessed ischemic pattern myocardial infarction (MI) and septal NIF. Results 73 iMR patients were studied; 36% had RVDYS (EF<50%) on CMR among whom LVEF was lower, PA systolic pressure higher, and MI size larger (all p<0.05). CMR RVEF was paralleled by echo results; correlations were highest for RV-GLS (r = 0.73) and lowest for RV-S’ (r = 0.43; all p<0.001). RVDYS patients more often had CMR-evidenced NIF (54% vs. 7%; p<0.001). Whereas all RV indices were lower among NIF-affected patients (all p≤0.006), percent change was largest for transverse strain (48.3%). CMR RVEF was independently associated with RV-GLS (partial r = 0.57, p<0.001) and transverse strain (r = 0.38, p = 0.002) (R = 0.78, p<0.001). Overall diagnostic performance of RV-GLS and transverse strain were similar (AUC = 0.93[0.87–0.99]|0.91[0.84–0.99], both p<0.001), and yielded near equivalent sensitivity and specificity (85%|83% and 80%|79% respectively). Conclusion Compared to conventional echo indices, RV strain parameters yield stronger correlation with CMR-defined RVEF and potentially constitute better markers of CMR-evidenced NIF in iMR."
https://openalex.org/W2758811376,"Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) maintains mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) self-renewal. Our previous study showed that trans-acting transcription factor 5 (Sp5), an LIF/STAT3 downstream target, supports mESC self-renewal. However, the mechanism by which Sp5 exerts these effects remains elusive. Here, we found that Nanog is a direct target of Sp5 and mediates the self-renewal-promoting effect of Sp5 in mESCs. Overexpression of Sp5 induced Nanog expression, while knockdown or knockout of Sp5 decreased the Nanog level. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Sp5 directly bound to the Nanog promoter. Functional studies revealed that knockdown of Nanog eliminated the mESC self-renewal-promoting ability of Sp5. Finally, we demonstrated that the self-renewal-promoting function of Sp5 was largely dependent on its zinc finger domains. Taken together, our study provides unrecognized functions of Sp5 in mESCs and will expand our current understanding of the regulation of mESC pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2951691054,"Dispersal heterogeneity is an important process that can compensate for downstream advection, enabling aquatic organisms to persist or spread upstream. Our main focus was the effect of year-to-year variation in larval dispersal on invasion spread rate. We used the green crab, Carcinus maenas, as a case study. This species was first introduced over 200 years ago to the east coast of North America, and once established has maintained a relatively consistent spread rate against the dominant current. We used a stage-structured, integro-difference equation model that couples a demographic matrix for population growth and dispersal kernels for spread of individuals within a season. The kernel describing larval dispersal, the main dispersive stage, was mechanistically modeled to include both drift and settlement rate components. It was parameterized using a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the Gulf of St Lawrence, which enabled us to incorporate larval behavior, namely vertical swimming. Dispersal heterogeneity was modeled at two temporal scales: within the larval period (months) and over the adult lifespan (years). The kernel models variation within the larval period. To model the variation among years, we allowed the kernel parameters to vary by year. Results indicated that when dispersal parameters vary with time, knowledge of the time-averaged dispersal process is insufficient for determining the upstream spread rate of the population. Rather upstream spread is possible over a number of years when incorporating the yearly variation, even when there are only a few “good years” featured by some upstream dispersal among many “bad years” featured by only downstream dispersal. Accounting for annual variations in dispersal in population models is important to enhance understanding of spatial dynamics and population spread rates. Our developed model also provides a good platform to link the modeling of larval behavior and demography to large-scale hydrodynamic models."

Pocket-sized ultrasound devices have the benefits of accessibility and ease of use. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the educational value of these devices in terms of improving medical student interest and understanding of US and sonographic anatomy. Methods We added a US training program comprised of a self-study learning module and a hands-on training session to a two-week block curriculum of medical imaging for first year medical students (n = 40). Multiple pocket-sized US devices were used on a small-group basis during a single afternoon. Students were asked to complete a questionnaire before and after the US training session; these two questionnaires contained 6 and 10 questions, respectively, which were rated by students using a five-point Likert scale. In addition, understanding of sonographic anatomy was tested before and after the training program. Results Forty students completed the two questionnaires and the anatomy-related tests. Students found the program educationally valuable (4.37 ± 0.54 of 5) and reported that US practice was useful for improving their understanding of the principles of US examinations (4.23 ± 0.66 of 5) and sonographic anatomy (4.40 ± 0.55 of 5). Overall confidence at performing US examinations and understanding of sonographic anatomy were significantly increased after US training (increased overall confidence score, 1.87 ± 0.91 and improvement in sonographic anatomy score, 6.55 ± 1.55, p values < 0.001). Conclusion US training using pocket-sized ultrasound devices was found to be educationally valuable for medical students in terms of improving understanding of US principles and familiarizing students with sonographic anatomy."

The data available from commercial growers, however, is of variable duration, due to commercial considerations. We employ a recently proposed regression technique termed Variable-Domain Functional Regression in order to be able to accommodate these irregular-length datasets. In this way, we are able to quantify the contribution of covariates such as temperature, humidity and water spraying volumes across the growing process, and for different lengths of growing processes. Our results indicate that optimal oxygen and temperature levels vary across the growing cycle and we propose environmental schedules for these covariates to optimise overall yields."
https://openalex.org/W2759488068,"P53 protein is more frequently mutated in human tumours compared with the other proteins. While the majority of the p53 mutations, especially within its DNA-binding domain, lead to the loss of the wild-type function, there are accumulating data demonstrating that the p53 mutants gain tumour promoting activities; the latter triggers a revitalised interest in functional analysis of the p53 mutants. A systematic screening for p53 mutations in surgical materials from patients with glioma revealed a 378C>G mutation that creates a stop codon at the position of amino acid residue 126. The mutation eliminates the recognition site for the restriction endonuclease Sca I that allowed us to carry out RFLP analysis of DNA extracted from the clinical samples and suggests that this mutation is more frequent than is documented in the p53 databases. Both the ECV-304 and EJ cell lines, that probably originate from the bladder carcinoma T24 cell line, were confirmed to contain the homozygous 378C>G mutation but were shown to produce the p53 protein of expected full-length size detected by Western blotting. We provide evidence that the 378C>G mutation generates an alternative 3’ splice site (ss) which is more often used instead of the authentic upstream 3’ ss, driving the production of mRNA encoding the protein with the single amino acid deletion (p53ΔY126). Using endogenous expression, we demonstrated that the p53ΔY126 protein is nearly as active as the wild type protein in inducing the p21/Waf1 expression and apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2756489439,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to glucose availability in the environment, inducing the expression of the low-affinity transporters and high-affinity transporters in a concentration dependent manner. This cellular decision making is controlled through finely tuned communication between multiple glucose sensing pathways including the Snf1-Mig1, Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 (SRR) and cAMP-PKA pathways.We demonstrate the first evidence that RNA Polymerase III (RNAP III) activity affects the expression of the glucose transporter HXT2 (RNA Polymerase II dependent-RNAP II) at the level of transcription. Down-regulation of RNAP III activity in an rpc128-1007 mutant results in a significant increase in HXT2 mRNA, which is considered to respond only to low extracellular glucose concentrations. HXT2 expression is induced in the mutant regardless of the growth conditions either at high glucose concentration or in the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found an increased association of Rgt1 and Tup1 transcription factors with the highly activated HXT2 promoter in the rpc128-1007 strain. Furthermore, by measuring cellular abundance of Mth1 corepressor, we found that in rpc128-1007, HXT2 gene expression was independent from Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 (SRR) signaling. The Snf1 protein kinase complex, which needs to be active for the release from glucose repression, also did not appear perturbed in the mutated strain.These findings suggest that the general activity of RNAP III can indirectly affect the RNAP II transcriptional machinery on the HXT2 promoter when cellular perception transduced via the major signaling pathways, broadly recognized as on/off switch essential to either positive or negative HXT gene regulation, remain entirely intact. Further, Rgt1/Ssn6-Tup1 complex, which has a dual function in gene transcription as a repressor-activator complex, contributes to HXT2 transcriptional activation."

https://openalex.org/W2758030566,"Mallada basalis (Walker) has the potential to be a valuable biological control agent because of its predatory abilities, strong reproductive capacity, and broad prey range. This study aimed to improve on a previously used artificial diet for M. basalis, to achieve a longer oviposition period and greater survival rate and fecundity. We analyzed the development, survival, longevity, and reproduction of M. basalis (F1 and F2 generations) fed two artificial diets (AD1 and AD2). Both diets contained chicken egg yolk, beer yeast powder, honey, trehalose, seawater spirulina, and potassium sorbate. AD1 also contained sucrose and vitamin C. The duration of F1 1st larvae, F1 2nd larvae, F1 pupae, F2 egg, and F2 2nd larvae reared on AD1 were significantly shorter than those reared on AD2. F1 adult longevity and F2 oviposition period for AD1 (45.40 d and 31.00 d) were significantly longer than for AD2 (30.74 d and 20.80 d). All the following were significantly greater for AD1 compared with AD2: F1 female proportion, F1 daily oviposition, F1 female oviposition, F2 daily oviposition, F2 female oviposition, F1 emergence rate, F2 pupation rate, and F3 egg hatching rate. Moreover, for M. basalis fed AD2, the duration of F2 2nd and 3rd larvae (9.00 d and 8.64 d) were significantly longer than for F1 (4.70 d and 4.92 d). The F1 oviposition period (31.57 d) was significantly longer than F2 (20.80 d). The F2 female oviposition (189.20 egg/female) was significantly less than F1 (307.14 egg/female). We found that the oviposition period and female longevity of F1 reared on AD1 was longer than that reared on the artificial diet in a previous study. The daily oviposition and female oviposition of F1 from AD1 was larger, while the F2 egg hatching rate was greater compared with that from the previous diet. However, the offspring of M. basalis fed AD2 were less thrifty. We found diet AD1 supported development and reproduction better than AD2 and the diets in our previous study.

https://openalex.org/W2757254950,"Genetic and epigenetic programs regulate dramatic structural changes during cardiac morphogenesis. Concurrent biomechanical forces within the heart created by blood flow and pressure in turn drive downstream cellular, molecular and genetic responses. Thus, a genetic-morphogenetic-biomechanical feedback loop is continually operating to regulate heart development. During the evolution of a congenital heart defect, concomitant abnormalities in blood flow, hemodynamics, and patterns of mechanical loading would be predicted to change the output of this feedback loop, impacting not only the ultimate morphology of the defect, but potentially altering tissue-level biomechanical properties of structures that appear structurally normal.The goal of this study was to determine if abnormal hemodynamics present during outflow tract formation and remodeling in a genetically engineered mouse model of persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) causes tissue-level biomechanical abnormalities.The passive stiffness of surface locations on the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and outflow tract (OFT) was measured with a pipette aspiration technique in Fgf8;Isl1Cre conditional mutant embryonic mouse hearts and controls. Control and mutant experimental results were compared by a strain energy metric based on the measured relationship between pressure and aspirated height, and also used as target behavior for finite element models of the ventricles. Model geometry was determined from 3D reconstructions of whole-mount, confocal-imaged hearts. The stress-strain relationship of the model was adjusted to achieve an optimal match between model and experimental behavior.Although the OFT is the most severely affected structure in Fgf8;Isl1Cre hearts, its passive stiffness was the same as in control hearts. In contrast, both the LV and RV showed markedly increased passive stiffness, doubling in LVs and quadrupling in RVs of mutant hearts. These differences are not attributable to differences in ventricular volume, wall thickness, or trabecular density. Excellent agreement was obtained between the model and experimental results. Overall our findings show that hearts developing PTA have early changes in ventricular tissue biomechanics relevant to cardiac function and ongoing development."

Methods Prospective experimental laboratory study with eight pigs. Induction of acute lung injury with sequential pulmonary lavages and injurious ventilation was initially performed. Then, animals were ventilated on a conventional mechanical ventilator with a respiratory rate (RR) = 60 breaths/minute and PEEP titrated according to ARDS Network table. The first two steps consisted of a randomized order of inspiratory pauses of 10 and 30% of inspiratory time. In final step, we removed the inspiratory pause and titrated PEEP, after lung recruitment, with the aid of electrical impedance tomography. At each step, PaCO2 was allowed to stabilize between 57–63 mmHg for 30 minutes. Results The step with RR of 60 after lung recruitment had the highest PEEP when compared with all other steps (17 [16,19] vs 14 [10, 17]cmH2O), but had lower driving pressures (13 [13,11] vs 16 [14, 17]cmH2O), higher P/F ratios (212 [191,243] vs 141 [105, 184] mmHg), lower shunt (23 [20, 23] vs 32 [27, 49]%), lower dead space ventilation (10 [0, 15] vs 30 [20, 37]%), and a more homogeneous alveolar ventilation distribution. There were no detrimental effects in terms of lung mechanics, hemodynamics, or gas exchange. Neither the addition of inspiratory pauses or the alveolar recruitment maneuver followed by decremental PEEP titration resulted in further reductions in VT. Conclusions During MHFPPV set with RR of 60 bpm delivered by a conventional ventilator in severe ARDS swine model, neither the inspiratory pauses or PEEP titration after recruitment maneuver allowed reduction of VT significantly, however the last strategy decreased driving pressures and improved both shunt and dead space."

https://openalex.org/W2759285900,"We utilize L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data in this study to retrieve a ground velocity map for the near field of the Ganos section of the north Anatolian fault (NAF) zone. The segmentation and creep distribution of this section, which last ruptured in 1912 to generate a moment magnitude (Mw)7.3 earthquake, remains incompletely understood. Because InSAR processing removes the mean orbital plane, we do not investigate large scale displacements due to regional tectonics in this study as these can be determined using global positioning system (GPS) data, instead concentrating on the close-to-the-fault displacement field. Our aim is to determine whether, or not, it is possible to retrieve robust near field velocity maps from stacking L-band interferograms, combining both single and dual polarization SAR data. In addition, we discuss whether a crustal velocity map can be used to complement GPS observations in an attempt to discriminate the present-day surface displacement of the Ganos fault (GF) across multiple segments. Finally, we characterize the spatial distribution of creep on shallow patches along multiple along-strike segments at shallow depths. Our results suggest the presence of fault segmentation along strike as well as creep on the shallow part of the fault (i.e. the existence of a shallow creeping patch) or the presence of a smoother section on the fault plane. Data imply a heterogeneous fault plane with more complex mechanics than previously thought.
