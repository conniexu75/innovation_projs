https://openalex.org/W2018878068,"The membrane lipids in living Mycoplasma laidlawii exhibit a phase transition characteristic of that from crystal to liquid crystal within the bilayer conformation. The transition occurs at the same temperature in viable organisms, membranes isolated from the organisms, and isolated membrane lipids. The enthalpy of the transition in the membrane is compared with that of an aqueous suspension of isolated membrane lipids. The result is consistent with presence of an extended lipid bilayer in the native membrane."

In a sequence of stimulus presentations, these cells characteristically discharge to a particular numbered stimulus in the series. This effect is independent of stimulus modality, intensity, and interstimulus interval; thus, the cells seem to be responding to the number of stimulus presentations."
https://openalex.org/W1507523846,"Abstract A simple method has been devised for the isolation of α-galactosidase in crystalline form from the mycelia of Mortierella vinacea. The crystalline α-galactosidase is free from protease and other glycosidases. It gives a single protein band when examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The crystalline preparation contains 10.8% neutral sugars and 2.7% d-glucosamine, indicating that the enzyme is glycoprotein in nature. The enzyme is stable at neutral and alkaline pH; however, it becomes unstable below pH 6.0. It hydrolyzes O- and P-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactopyranoside, methyl - α - d - galactopyranoside, galactinol, melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, 4-O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-d-galactose, 6-O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-1-glycerol as well as methyl-β-l-arabinoside, though at a much slower rate. It does not liberate d-galactose from the galactomannan of guar gum, glycopeptide obtained from blood group B substance, or earthworm cuticle collagen. The effects of pH, substrate concentration, inhibitors, and temperature on the catalytic activity of the crystalline enzyme are described."

https://openalex.org/W1494566536,"Abstract Kinetics of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-RNA-mediated amino acid incorporation into peptide in a wheat embryo system showed a 5- to 8-min lag. In comparative experiments with polyribosomes (in which the messenger and ribosomes are already attached) and polyuridylic acid (in which the ribosome-messenger attachment is nonspecific), amino acid incorporation was linear from zero time. When peptide synthesis was followed by aminoacyl transfer from aminoacyl-tRNA, the kinetic lag in the TMV-RNA system was retained, indicating that the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA is not the rate-limiting reaction. If, however, TMV-RNA and ribosomes were previously incubated in the presence of ATP and two supernatant components, the lag was removed. These observations suggest that the rate-limiting reaction in the TMV-RNA system is the formation of a ribosome-messenger initiation complex and that ATP and two soluble factors are involved in its formation. The ATP requirement in the TMV-RNA system was completely retained when peptide synthesis was studied by aminoacyl transfer from aminoacyl-tRNA. In contrast, in similar aminoacyl transfer experiments with polyribosomes and polyuridylic acid, only GTP was required and ATP was without effect. These results indicate that ATP is functioning in the TMV-RNA system in some capacity other than to provide aminoacyl-tRNA. When previously incubated mixtures of the TMV-RNA system were passed through Sephadex G-25, the excluded fraction catalyzed aminoacyl transfer in the absence of ATP, suggesting that the product formed during preliminary incubation was a macromolecular complex. Analysis of the requirements for formation of this active complex supports the contention that it is a ribosome-messenger complex. Similar experiments, in which puromycin or cycloheximide were included in the preliminary incubation and then removed by Sephadex G-25 filtration, suggest that aminoacyl transfer is not obligatory to the formation of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W2019447395,"MYCOPLASMAS are a group of microorganisms which can grow on cell-free medium and which are characterized by pleomorphism, for they are bound by a triple layered unit membrane instead of a rigid cell wall. The smallest reproductive forms are about 100 to 150 nm in size. They are the smallest known free-living organisms comparable in size with the myxoviruses, to which they show some morphological resemblance. The largest mycoplasma cell can exceed 1,000 nm in size."
https://openalex.org/W1530956732,"As judged by several physical-chemical criteria, egg white avidin has been purified as a homogeneous glycoprotein from a commercial preparation. The avidin subunit contains 129 amino acid residues, 4 residues of mannose, and 3 residues of glucosamine as determined by amino acid and carbohydrate analyses. Of four cyanogen bromide peptides purified by gel filtration, one was an 18-residue peptide from the NH2 terminus, one was a 78-residue peptide from the middle of the peptide chain, one was a 32-residue peptide from the COOH terminus, and one was a 96-residue peptide containing all of the residues present in the first two peptides. This last peptide was evidently the result of the conversion of methionine in the sequence Met-Thr to homoserine without cleavage of the peptide bond. Inasmuch as these cyanogen bromide peptides account for 128 residues as compared to 129 found by analysis of the protein, it is evident that the subunits of avidin are identical. The sequences of the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide peptides have been determined. The carbohydrate is attached to Residue 17 of the protein in the sequence Asn(carbohydrate)-Met-Thr. This is another example of the general sequences Asn(carbohydrate)-X-Thr or Asn(carbohydrate)-X-Ser found for most glycoproteins in which the carbohydrate is attached to the protein through the side chain of an asparaginyl residue."

https://openalex.org/W1528312245,"Abstract Incubation of radioactive tobacco mosaic virus RNA (TMV-RNA) with a wheat embryo ribosome-supernatant system depleted of transfer RNA results in the formation of a new radioactive component which sediments in a sucrose density gradient somewhat faster than 80 S ribosomes. The reaction requires the presence of ATP, two supernatant factors, and ribosomes. The gradient position of the new radioactive component and the participation of ribosomes in its formation indicate that it is a ribosome-TMV-RNA complex. The conditions and requirements for formation of the complex are identical with those necessary for removing the kinetic lag in aminoacyl-tRNA incorporation. The complex may therefore be described as a ribosome-messenger initiation complex. Formation of the ribosome-TMV-RNA complex is unaffected by addition of cycloheximide or puromycin, nor is radioactive tRNA incorporated into it. Thus, neither free nor aminoacylated-tRNA appears to be a component of the complex. When tRNA is added to the incubation, thereby making aminoacyl transfer possible, radioactivity from the primary complex is chased into polyribosome components sedimenting more rapidly in the gradient. This latter reaction is inhibited by puromycin or cycloheximide. These observations suggest that the TMV-RNA-ribosome complex is a direct precursor of the polyribosome and that the conversion of this complex into polyribosomes requires aminoacyl transfer."

https://openalex.org/W1524663859,"Abstract An investigation of the H2-folate reductases from pyrimethamine-sensitive (Pb/WLTM) and -resistant (Pb/WLTM/50–63) strains of Plasmodium berghei has revealed that the specific activity of the enzyme from the resistant strain is 10-fold higher than that of the sensitive strain. Since turnover numbers (based on amethopterin binding) are equivalent, the increase in specific activity must be due to an increased number of catalytic sites. Marked differences were found between the two enzymes in several of the properties studied. The Km value for H2-folate is 12.4-fold higher for the enzyme from the resistant strain. The Pb/WLTM/50–63 H2-folate reductase is only slightly stimulated by KCl, in contrast to the 3-fold stimulation observed with the enzyme from the sensitive strain. The Ki values for pyrimethamine and two other antifolates are higher for the enzyme from the resistant strain. In addition, the inhibition is competitive with H2-folate for the enzyme from Pb/WLTM and noncompetitive for the enzyme from Pb/WLTM/50–63. It is proposed that Pb/WLTM/50–63 is resistant in vivo to the action of pyrimethamine because of the combined effects of the increase in enzyme content and the decrease in inhibitor binding. It is suggested that these alterations in enzymatic properties and enzyme levels reflect mutations in the gene or genes responsible for the coding of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1645423248,"Abstract Effects of nutritional and hormonal treatments on the activities of rat liver histidine-catabolizing enzymes histidine pyruvate transaminase, histidase, and urocanase, have been examined and estimates have been made of the rates of induction and degradation of each enzyme. Histidase and urocanase activities were slightly elevated in animals fasted for 48 hours, but the transaminase was not affected. In animals fed for 14 days on diets containing various amounts of casein, the activity of histidase increased 20-fold, urocanase 6-fold, but the transaminase only 2-fold as the casein content of the diet was increased from 6 to 80%. When rats were fed a diet containing 4% of histidine for 14 days, histidase and urocanase activities per g of liver were only slightly above control values, but since liver weights increased greatly, the total activities of these two enzymes increased per unit of body weight. The transaminase, in contrast, was diluted as the liver increased in size. A high histidine intake did not stabilize the high histidase and urocanase activities induced by feeding rats an 80% casein diet when they were subsequently fed a low protein diet. Transaminase activity increased 6-fold in adrenalectomized rats fed an 18% casein diet and treated with daily injections of hydrocortisone acetate (2.5 mg per 150 g, body wt) for 14 days; histidase and urocanase activities responded much less (3-fold and 2-fold, respectively). Adrenalectomy depressed the activities of histidine-catabolizing enzymes, the greatest depression occurring in those rats fed a low protein diet. Although glucocorticoids were not necessary for protein-induced increases in transaminase and urocanase activities, hydrocortisone (5.0 mg per 150 g, body wt) and high protein together acted synergistically. In rats fed either a high protein diet or administered hydrocortisone, several days of treatment were required before substantial increases occurred in the activities of these enzymes. In rats fed a diet containing 80% casein for 14 days and then switched to a diet containing no casein, the transaminase, histidase, and urocanase decreased with apparent half-lives of 2.8, 2.5, and 3.5 days, respectively, indicating slow turnover rates in comparison with some other amino acid-degrading enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2019510099,"Two methods are described for preparing cytoplasmic extracts from sea urchin embryos. One method, involving homogenization, yields DNA structures that cosediment with polyribosomes and subribosomal ribonucleoproteins. In addition this method also yields extraneous structures containing RNA that cosediment with polyribosomes. The DNA is not associated with polyribosomes, as shown by buoyant density analysis. Furthermore, this DNA appears to be spurious, because its release into a cytoplasmic extract does not occur when a different method of cell disruption, involving passage of embryos through a hypodermic needle, is used. With this second method, polyribosomes are obtained without extraneous cosedimenting RNA structures and subribosomal ribonucleo-proteins are obtained in the virtual absence of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1532302931,"An enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to α-hydroxyisobutyronitrile (acetone cyanohydrin) has been isolated from flax seedlings (Linum usitatissimum L). The product of this reaction was shown to be identical with linamarin, one of the two cyanogenic glucosides produced by the flax plant. The partially purified UDP-glucose-ketone cyanohydrin β-glucosyltransferase exhibited a high degree of specificity for the two aliphatic side chains of acetone and butanone cyanohydrins as well as for UDP-glucose as the glucose donor. This suggests that its natural function is to catalyze the last step in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin from the precursor cyanohydrins. In a series of steps resulting in a purification of 120-fold, the glucosyltransferase was separated from the β-glucosidase linamarase which is present in the flax plant. No requirements for metal ions or sulfhydryl reagents could be shown for the glucosyl transferase."

https://openalex.org/W1617138575,"Abstract The oxidation of proline by blowfly (Phormia regina) flight muscle mitochondria is stimulated by ADP in the presence of oligomycin. The stimulation is enhanced by high levels of Pi, is still evident with intact mitochondria in the presence of rotenone, arsenate, or arsenite, and is seen with sonically treated particles. The findings indicate that the site of action of the nucleotide is l-proline:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (proline dehydrogenase). It is suggested that ADP is an allosteric effector of the dehydrogenase and lowers the apparent Km for proline. The Km in the presence of ADP approximates the concentration of proline found in the flight muscle at rest. Pyruvate also increases the affinity of the proline dehydrogenase for its substrate. The rate of proline oxidation is dependent on the relative proportions of the adenine nucleotides as well as on the absolute level of ADP. Sensitivity to ADP in the presence of an uncoupling agent or atractyloside suggests that there is an external site for ADP. The physiological significance of the activation of proline oxidation is considered."

https://openalex.org/W1497363573,"Abstract Phosvitin can undergo a change from unordered conformation to β structure upon freezing and thawing. The transconformation may be identical in terms of its product and of key aspects of its mechanism with the conformational change which can take place, without freezing, if the phosphoprotein has been stripped of most of its anionic character, at pH 2 or less, but the freezing effect can occur with solutions that are more weakly acidic by nearly four orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, the effect is enhanced as the acidity of the solution is increased. It is suppressed by increases in salt or protein concentration. The transconformation appears to be linked with the freezing process. Frozen storage is without appreciable effect. Aggregation is an essential corollary of the transconformation: the monomeric protein species gives no evidence of β structure and the extent of transconformation correlates reasonably well with the extent of disappearance of the monomer. The ordered structure is heat-labile and the effect can also be readily reversed by lowering the acidity, but only if the aggregation process has not been allowed to proceed too far. Otherwise, slow continued aggregation leads to the complete precipitation of fibrous phosvitin even at neutral pH. The essential aspects of this freezing phenomenon are consistent with the hypothesis that, as acid is excluded from the growing ice, the acid tide just ahead of the liquid-ice interface causes the transconformation, followed by the trapping of the ordered protein in the rigid ice meshwork."

https://openalex.org/W1485390666,"Abstract γ-Cyano-α-l-aminobutyric acid is identified for the first time as a biological substance. This amino acid nitrile accumulates when inorganic cyanide is administered to young cultures of Chromobacterium violaceum strain D 341. Cyanide supplies the cyano group, and aspartic acid supplies carbon atoms 1 to 4. Biosynthesis of β-cyanoalanine also takes place and appears to be controlled by aspartic acid. No evidence has been obtained for appreciable metabolism of γ-cyano-α-aminobutyric acid. Identification has been based on a close comparison of the physical and chemical properties of the isolated crystalline substance with known synthetic γ-cyano-α-l-aminobutyric acid. The latter has been prepared by an improved procedure involving hydrogenolysis of the benzyloxycarbonyl derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1546295140,"An analogue of vitamin B12 coenzyme in which the ribosyl oxygen has been replaced by —CH2— has been synthesized. This compound has spectral properties very similar to vitamin B12 coenzyme. The chemical properties of the analogue differ from those of vitamin B12 coenzyme in that reaction with CN- and BH4- does not result in cleavage of the carboncobalt bond. The analogue functions as coenzyme in the reaction catalyzed by dioldehydrase. The reaction in the presence of analogue is one-third as fast as with the coenzyme. Other properties of the enzymic reaction in the presence of the analogue are similar to those observed with the coenzyme: spectral changes in the presence of substrate and glycolaldehyde, hydrogen exchange between substrate and coenzyme, and over-all deuterium isotope effect. It was concluded that the ribosyl oxygen of the coenzyme cannot play an essential role in the catalytic process."

https://openalex.org/W1577512300,"Abstract Aqueous solutions of HCl, inorganic salts, and neutral and ionic organic compounds were frozen, and the solute distribution in the frozen systems was assessed in terms of its dependence on composition and initial solute concentration. The distribution may be uniform or uneven, depending on compositional aspects of the solutions. The degree of non-uniformity of the distribution of a given solute is a function not only of its own initial concentration but also of the concentration of any additional solute. With a variety of two-component solutions, maximally uneven solute distribution was found to be associated with approximately the same initial concentration (about 10-4 m, under the conditions of these experiments). As the concentration was raised above this level, the distribution of solute became increasingly more uniform; this was similar for all solutes. Upon lowering the concentration below this level, the tendency toward uniformity of distribution varied with the solute. With multicomponent systems, reciprocal effects of the concentration of one solute on the distribution of another were noted. In producing these effects, the absence or presence and sign of electric charge borne by the solutes seems to play no major role at concentrations higher than the optimal concentration for maximal nonuniformity of distribution. Electric charge and the specific nature of the solute may be important determinants of solute redistribution at very low concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1485790638,"Abstract It has been shown that the pH dependence of the association constant for α-chymotrypsin-methyl hippurate complex formation is different from those of amide substrates and simple hydrocarbon inhibitors in that the values become constant at pH 9 and above. In addition, the association constant for naphthalene goes through a maximum at a pH of 7.5 to 7.8. No binding of the simple aromatic hydrocarbon inhibitors could be shown above pH 9. Evidence is presented which indicates that the alkaline form of the enzyme binds methyl hippurate primarily through the alcoholic moiety of the ester molecule, and that the hydrophobic binding site which is involved in binding the aromatic moiety of the substrate is no longer operative at high pH. Evidence is also presented that, in the case of methyl and isopropyl hippurate, acylation is the rate-governing step over the entire pH range studied. It is shown that either a carbonyl group or an aromatic nucleus is required for Ki for a competitive inhibitor to be pH dependent. Finally it is shown that ionic strength exerts a profound effect upon the pH dependence of both the association constant and kcat for methyl hippurate. At low ionic strength, the dependence of the association constant on pH is greatly decreased. It is suggested that one way of looking at pH dependence is in terms of the effect of pH on ionic strength effects."

The second observation serves to strengthen the suggestion of Huxley et al. that the fertility of schizophrenics seems too low for the disorder to be maintained at its present rate by mutation alone. In explanation they noted the resistance of schizophrenics to surgical and wound shock, to visceral perforation, to high doses of histamine, insulin and thyroxine, and to pain. They noted also the possibility that schizophrenics may be resistant to diseases such as smallpox and bubonic plague which have occurred in widespread epidemics."
